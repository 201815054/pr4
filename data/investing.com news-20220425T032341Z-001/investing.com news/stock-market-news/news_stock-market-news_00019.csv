Investing.com – Frontier Group, owner of Frontier Airlines, and Softbank-backed Compass real estate company started trading after underwhelming the market with initial public offerings that sold fewer shares at lower prices.
Frontier Airlines’ parent company said it raised $570 million, selling 30 million shares at $19 apiece, the low end of the target range, which gave it a valuation of about $4 billion. Shares are trading slightly lower.
Compass raised $450 million, also pricing at the bottom of a reduced range, selling 25 million shares for $18 each. On Wednesday, the company slashed the number of shares to be sold and lowered its target range to $18 to $19, after marketing 36 million shares for $23 to $26. The stock is up almost 2%. It is valued at $9 billion.
Frontier reported a net loss last year of $225 million on revenue of $1.25 billion amid the pandemic that kept everyone at home and off of airplanes.
Compass's revenue rose more than 50% to $3.7 billion last year from $2.4 billion in 2019 as we went on first -and second-home buying sprees. Net loss narrowed to $270.2 million from $388 million in 2019."

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Banco do Brasil SA (OTC:BDORY)'s board members argued in a public statement on Thursday that President Jair Bolsonaro's nominee to take over the state-controlled bank was not ready for the job and that the board should have the power to appoint its leader. 
Currently, Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro is entitled to nominate the chief executive, leaving its board of directors little say, in a deviation of corporate governance best practices. 
Bolsonaro has named Fausto Ribeiro, currently the CEO of the small business unit of Banco do Brasil, to replace Andre Brandao on March 18. Ribeiro's appointment, which would also make him a board member, was opposed by several existing board members.
In a statement, board members Helio Magalhaes, Jose Guimaraes Monforte, Luiz Spinola and Paulo Roberto Evangelista de Lima said Ribeiro meets the legal requirements to become Banco do Brasil's CEO. Still, they consider he lacks management experience to run the bank.
These board members account for half of Banco do Brasil''s directors, not including Brandao, who did not participate in the meeting. 

Brandao resigned two months after Bolsonaro disagreed with cost-cutting measures taken by the former, such as the closure of some branches and an employee buyout program.

Investing.com – Shares of big tech companies were trading higher by as much as 2.5% Thursday amid broader optimism on the back of the Biden administration’s $2 trillion spending plan and easing of yields.
President Joe Biden Wednesday unveiled his 8-year spending plan to boost the country’s manufacturing capacity, transport, water systems, broadband, electricity grid, housing, schools and more.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rose around 2% each. Tech stocks were the biggest gainers last year, a momentum that waned a wee bit recently. Their rise was accentuated by the pandemic as people stayed locked at home and gorged on their various offerings that supported everything from Microsoft’s cloud business to Netflix’s streaming services.
The Bill Gates-founded company on Wednesday said it won a deal to sell augmented reality headsets based on its HoloLens product and backed by Azure cloud computing services to the U.S. Army. The contract could be worth up to $21.88 billion over 10 years, a Microsoft spokesman told Reuters.
Facebook, which rose 2.5%, gave up some gains on a Reuters report that Britain has referred the social media giant's acquisition of GIF website Giphy after it told the country's competition watchdog it would not offer any concessions to address antitrust concerns.
An ‘overweight’ rating by Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) analyst Thomas Champion boosted the positive sentiments for Netflix. Sandler sees the stock hitting $605, 14% higher from its current levels. Shares were up 2%
Similarly, Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul’s ‘buy’ helped Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares gain 1%. Drbul’s $4,000 target is 28% higher from the stock’s current prices, and helped increase shares by 1.1%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares were up 1%, shaking off Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst Rod Hall’s ‘sell’ call on them. He sees significant downside risks to the iPhone maker’s services growth. His $83 target is almost half of the stock’s current prices.
Just a day earlier, UBS upgraded Apple to ‘buy' because of the company’s entry into cars being potentially worth 'at least' $14/share."

""American history is the story of expanding the right to vote to all citizens, and Black people, in particular, have had to march, struggle and even give their lives for more than a century to defend that right,"" Cook said in a statement.
The Republican-backed Georgia law strengthened identification requirements for absentee ballots, shortened early voting periods for runoffs and made it a misdemeanor for members of the public to offer food and water to voters waiting in line.
""Apple believes that, thanks in part to the power of technology, it ought to be easier than ever for every eligible citizen to exercise their right to vote,"" Cook said.
The measure, which has also been slammed by Democratic President Joe Biden, faces legal challenges from civil rights groups that contend it is aimed at suppressing voting among Blacks and other racial minorities.

On Wednesday, major U.S. companies led a charge to challenge the law, with several executives making statements against voting restrictions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Coca-Cola Co and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) on Wednesday joined a bid by U.S. companies to challenge the state of Georgia's new voting restrictions, with both Atlanta-based companies calling the law unacceptable.
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), , which in February announced a major new investment in Atlanta, Georgia's capital, added its voice, with President Brad Smith saying provisions of the law signed last week ""unfairly restrict the rights of people to vote legally, securely, and safely.""
Citi Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said in a LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) post he was ""appalled by the recent voter suppression"" passed in Georgia.
The Republican-backed Georgia law strengthened identification requirements for absentee ballots, shortened early voting periods for runoffs and made it a misdemeanor for members of the public to offer food and water to voters waiting in line.
Georgia Republican Governor Brian Kemp says the law is ""another step to making our elections fair and secure.""
But the measure has been slammed by Democratic President Joe Biden and faces legal challenges from civil rights groups that contend it is aimed at suppressing voting among Blacks and other racial minorities.
Black voters in Georgia were instrumental in state elections that helped Biden win the White House and Democrats gain narrow control of the U.S. Senate.
Republican lawmakers in other states are also pursuing voting restrictions, which they say are aimed at curbing fraud. Research has shown that voter fraud is exceedingly rare in the United States.
Dozens of Black executives, including Merck & Co Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier, had earlier in the day called on their peers in U.S. companies to push back against wider restrictions on voting rights.
They issued their appeal after Delta and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) had faced the threat of boycotts from activists who said they needed to do more to oppose the law.
Delta's criticism was a course reversal for the airline, which had praised the law in a statement on Friday even as it acknowledged having concerns. 
Critics questioned why Delta and other companies did not speak out before Kemp signed the restrictions into law. None of the companies disclosed any concrete steps they might take in response to the law.
'COMPANIES NEED TO TAKE A STAND'
The campaign against the new Georgia law, led by Merck's Frazier and former  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) CEO Kenneth Chenault, urged companies to look past the appearance of partisanship and publicly stand against it and voting restrictions being pursued in other states.
""We're calling on corporate America to publicly oppose any discriminatory legislation and all measures designed to limit Americans' ability to vote,"" Chenault told Reuters.
""American companies need to take a stand.""
A letter supporting the campaign by Frazier and Chenault was signed by 72 Black executives including former Xerox (N:XRX) CEO Ursula Burns, former  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) Chairman Richard Parsons (NYSE:PSN) and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc Chief Legal Officer Tony West.
'A STEP BACKWARDS'
On Wednesday, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey called the law ""unacceptable - it is a step backwards."" He told CNBC the law was ""wrong and it needs to be remedied.""
Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a company memo on Wednesday: ""The entire rationale for this bill was based on a lie: that there was widespread voter fraud in Georgia in the 2020 elections.""
Bastian wrote: ""The bill includes provisions that will make it harder for many underrepresented voters, particularly Black voters, to exercise their constitutional right to elect their representatives.""
""The final bill is unacceptable and does not match Delta's values,"" the memo said.
His memo, on the final day of the state legislative session, drew condemnation from Kemp.
The governor said the memo ""stands in stark contrast to our conversations with the company, ignores the content of the new law, and unfortunately continues to spread the same false attacks being repeated by partisan activists.""
Frazier, who is stepping down as head of Merck in June, has been outspoken on social and political issues before. 
He was the first CEO to leave Republican former President Donald Trump's American Manufacturing Council, saying he was taking a stand against intolerance and extremism, and called out racial inequities across U.S. society after the death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer.

Late on Wednesday, Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement that ""equitable access to voting rights for all people - including our colleagues and dealers in all 50 states - is sacred.""
While not addressing the Georgia law, Farley said the U.S. automaker wanted lawmakers ""to assure everyone who's entitled to vote is able to exercise that freedom.""

6,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 09:46AM ET</span>","Wall Street Opens Higher, Shrugging Off Jobless Setback; S&P Tops 4,000","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The S&P 500 topped 4,000 points for the first time as Wall Street started the second quarter on a bright note, shrugging off any disappointment about a surprise increase in initial jobless claims last week.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the S&P 500 was up 0.7% at 4,001.28 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 70 points, or 0.2% at 33,051 points. However, the Nasdaq Composite was outshining both with a gain of 1.5%, with chipmakers making notable gains on the back of strong outlooks from Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
Earlier, the Labor Department had said that the number of initial claims for jobless benefits rose last week, surprisingly, to 714,000. However, the broader number of those claiming under all unemployment related benefit programs fell by over 1.5 million to 18.2 million, resuming its downward trend. Any disappointment was offset by a sharp upward revision to the Institute of Supply Management's purchasing managers index for March, which rose to within a whisker of its record high. 
Overnight, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) had said it will throw $100 billion over three years at expanding manufacturing capacity, the most dramatic response yet to the global shortage of chips that has been created by a surge in demand for electronics due to the pandemic and new technologies accelerated by the advent of 5G. TSM stock rose 4.6% on the news, despite giving few details as to how it will pay for the investment.
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stock rose 6.3% after it reported solid earnings and upbeat guidance. The stock was also supported by a report linking it with a bid for Japanese memory chip maker Kioxia. Other chipmakers rose in sympathy, with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock rising 2.0% and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock rising 2.2%
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock extended recent gains, rising 2.8% on a Reuters report saying that a Chinese joint venture of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) will buy emissions credits from it for the current year. The report was a reality check for those who have touted VW’s progress in making the transition to e-mobility, and reflected the reality that it is still producing far more conventionally powered vehicles than electric ones. It also underlined that Tesla's first-mover advantage in making zero-emission cars is still contributing directly to its bottom line. The news also supported other pure EV makers, including Xpeng and Nio (NYSE:NIO).
Quantumscape  (NYSE:QS) stock, meanwhile, rose over 12%, after the developer of solid-state lithium batteries said it had met the contractual conditions for unlocking a further $100 million investment from Volkswagen. 
Oil and gas stocks were supported broadly by signs coming out of this month's 'OPEC+' meeting that the world's biggest exporters will keep production at its current level for another month in response to the dip in demand from a rising wave of Covid-19 cases in India, Europe and South America. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stock was up 1.7%, while Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock was up 3.2%.

7,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 09:45AM ET</span>",Five market trends investors are focused on for the second quarter,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) -The first quarter of 2021 kept investors on their toes as it served up surging yields, an accelerated rotation into cyclical stocks and wild rides in the shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) that brought the retail investors of WallStreetBets into the public eye.
Here are some trends investors are positioning for in the second quarter, and how they could impact broader markets.
HIGHER YIELDS
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury rose by about 80 basis points in the second quarter - its third-largest quarterly increase over the past decade - as investors sold bonds in anticipation of a U.S. economic recovery and higher inflation. 
Many investors believe the move will continue - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) sees the yield at 1.9% by the end of 2021, while TD Securities expects yields to rise to 2%.
The move ""is happening, we believe, for the right reasons,"" said Gargi Pal Chaudhuri, head of iShares investment strategy, Americas at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).
Chaudhuri believes further upside in yields is unlikely to derail a rally that took the S&P 500 to a fresh record on Wednesday, as yields are rising from “very, very low levels.”
Others are less certain. Forty-three percent of investors in the most recent BofA Global Research fund manager survey said 2% on the 10-year could trigger a selloff in stocks.
RESURGENT DOLLAR
Rising yields have helped lift the dollar to its highest level in nearly 17 months, and some investors have positioned for more dollar strength ahead: net bets on a weaker dollar in futures markets stood at $10.3 billion, about a third of their mid-January value, the latest data from the CFTC showed. 
A strengthening dollar could weigh on the profits of U.S. multinational companies and spell bad news for the recent commodities rally that has pushed up prices for everything from oil to copper and iron ore.
MORE VALUE
Expectations of a U.S. economic revival have boosted the so-called reopening trade in recent months, fueling rallies in the shares of banks, energy companies and other areas that have for years lagged behind growth and technology stocks.
The Russell 1000 value index rose 11% in the first quarter against its growth counterpart's gain of 1%, continuing a trend that started at the end of 2020.
“If a new paradigm emerges, consisting of sustainably higher nominal growth and higher yields, the value trade could run for years,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a recent note.
Hiccups in the U.S. reopening effort, however, could reinvigorate the appeal of tech, sending investors back to the stocks that have led markets higher for years. 
LOWER VOLATILITY
The quarter also marked a much-awaited drop in investors' expectations for stock market gyrations. The Cboe Volatility Index - known as Wall Street's fear gauge - recently traded just below 20, down from a near-record of 85.47 a year ago.
The decline reflects investors' expectations that the recent gains in stocks are likely to stick, said Brian Overby, senior options analyst at Ally Invest.
The index remains above its long-term median of 17.5, likely a result of some investors hedging their stock positions using S&P index options, Overby said.
INFLATION
Although inflation has consistently averaged below the Federal Reserve’s 2% target in the last decade, trillions of dollars in government spending have revived discussions of its return.

One measure of inflation, which tracks the expected average rate over the five-year period starting five years from now, is at 2.16%, the highest since December 2018. 
The latest survey by BofA Global Research, meanwhile, showed fund managers see a rise in inflation - which could weigh on the dollar and erode demand for longer-dated bonds - as the market’s biggest “tail risk.”

ZURICH (Reuters) -Credit Suisse plans to return more cash this month and recover more assets for investors in supply chain finance funds linked to insolvent finance firm Greensill, the Swiss bank said, aiming to limit damage from risk-management failures.
Switzerland's second-largest bank last month closed around $10 billion of supply-chain finance funds that bought notes from Greensill. Of this, $3.1 billion has been repaid and $1.5 billion in cash was in the funds as of March 29, leaving more than $5 billion outstanding.
""Over time, we expect the majority part of the funds' investments to be recovered in the liquidation process, and we have recourse to other measures should they be necessary, including possible legal action,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said. 
""We continue to explore other options for expediting the return of cash to investors,"" it added in a notice to investors https://www.credit-suisse.com/uk/en/asset-management/funds/notice-to-investors.html dated March 31 and posted on its website.
The bank is facing sharp scrutiny of its ability to manage risk after ructions caused by the Greensill fiasco and its exposure to stricken hedge fund Archegos, which sources say could cost Credit Suisse up to $5 billion. 
The bank has not specified potential losses but said they could have a material impact on profits.
Its shares, which had fallen by almost a quarter in the last month as it deals with the fallout, rose around 2%.
Credit Suisse had told investors the debt in a $7.3 billion finance fund linked to Greensill was low risk because it was insured but the bank failed to ensure the policies would pay out, two sources told Reuters.

The bank had suspended four other Credit Suisse Asset Management (CSAM) funds that invested in the supply chain finance funds.
To reopen these funds, the illiquid part of their assets will be separated into ""side pockets"" that will be subsequently liquidated. Subscriptions and redemptions of the original share classes reflecting the liquid part of assets resume on April 7.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) last week gave Facebook and Giphy five working days to offer proposals to address its concerns over their merger deal. 
However, the CMA said on Thursday that Facebook had informed it last Thursday that it would not be offering any remedies to address its competition concerns.]
""We will continue to fully cooperate with the CMA's investigation,"" a Facebook spokesman said in an emailed statement. 
""This merger is good for competition and in the interests of everyone in the UK who uses GIPHY and our services - from developers to service providers to content creators,"" he added.
Giphy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Facebook, the world's largest social media company bought Giphy, a website for making and sharing animated images, or GIFs, in May last year to integrate it with its photo-sharing app, Instagram. However, a source told Reuters in June that Facebook was pausing the integration.
The CMA began an initial investigation in January at a time when the social media network was under global regulatory scrutiny over antitrust concerns.

After the initial investigation, the CMA said that if the two companies remain merged, Giphy could have less incentive to expand its digital advertising, raising concerns about Facebook's existing market power in display advertising. 
Facebook had said that Giphy's integrations with other social platforms like Twitter Snapchat and ByteDance's TikTok would not change.

Investing.com – Shares of Emergent Biosolutions (NYSE:EBS) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) fell Thursday, after a report that regulators had delayed authorization to a plant making Covid-19 vaccines after a mix-up was found.
The plant, located in Baltimore, belongs to Emergent, a subcontractor of J&J, according to the report in The New York Times. Emergent shares fell 10% on concerns over issues related to quality control at the plant. J&J shares fell 1%.
The mix-up has delayed future shipments of J&J doses in the U.S. while the Food and Drug Administration investigates.
Further shipments of the J&J vaccine — expected to total 24 million doses in the next month — were supposed to come from the plant, the NYT said. J&J’s single dose shot has been credited for the speedy rollout of vaccination the U.S. and the falling cases.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), the others making Covid shots in the U.S., have two-dose vaccines.
The plant makes Covid-19 vaccines for AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), too. The British-Swedish company’s vaccine is yet to be authorized for use in the U.S.
The federal government last year enlisted the plant to produce vaccines from J&J and AstraZeneca. The two vaccines use the same technology employing a harmless version of a virus — known as a vector. But J&J’s and AstraZeneca’s vectors are not interchangeable.
In late February, one or more workers somehow confused the two during the production process, raising questions about training and supervision, NYT said."
11,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 09:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: EU seeks 10 million AstraZeneca vaccines from India to meet shortfall - Indian source,"By Neha Arora
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The European Union has asked India to allow it to buy 10 million doses of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine from Serum Institute of India, a government official told Reuters, the latest sign of growing pressure on Delhi to export more of its production to other countries.
The EU wants the doses from Serum, the world's largest vaccine maker, to offset supply shortfalls from AstraZeneca's European plants and speed up the bloc's vaccine roll-out. 
Any quick approval of the EU request is unlikely, however, with India scrambling to expand its own domestic vaccination drive, said the Indian government official, who asked not to be named as the discussions are private.
Britain is also pressuring India to export the second half of 10 million doses it had ordered from Serum, the source said.
Serum was originally supposed to produce the AstraZeneca vaccine only for low and medium-income countries.
""The EU ambassador wrote a letter, saying, please give us (export) approvals,"" said the source, adding the letter was sent around two weeks ago.
Serum, AstraZeneca and India's foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the EU Commission said the Commission had no immediate comment. 
India, however, has said that it is now focused on expanding its own immunisation drive as COVID-19 cases have surged since March.
Its decision to focus on its domestic needs, which came after the government was criticised at home for shipping tens of millions of doses overseas, will also affect the WHO-backed global network for vaccine distribution, known as COVAX. The network aims to secure COVID-19 vaccines primarily for dozens of poorer nations.
Production glitches have slowed vaccinations for the 450 million people in the 27-nation EU. The bloc's per capita immunisation lags that of countries such as Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States, according to the website Our World in Data https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations.
India has so far exported 64 million vaccine doses to 83 countries, and administered the same number of doses at home. Its inoculation drive expanded from Thursday to include everyone above the age of 45, which is expected to raise vaccine demand substantially.

India has reported 12.22 million cases of the coronavirus, the third highest number globally after the United States and Brazil. It has recorded nearly 163,000 deaths from COVID-19.

By Patturaja Murugaboopathy 
(Reuters) - While the pace of the global equity rally has waned in recent weeks, world shares have a better chance of climbing again if history repeats itself.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe has delivered an average gain of 2.6% in the month of April in the last 19 years, the highest compared with other months of the year.
It was followed by November's 1.7% gain and July's 1.1%, according to the data.
Graphic: MSCI World index's April gains https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmyvmreeypr/MSCI%20World%20April.png
""April tends to be a strong month for risk assets, with monthly returns statistically significant across major markets, said Andrew Sheets, a strategist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), adding that higher dividend payments could be a reason behind this rise in shares in the month.
""The April month could be an important tactical window for investors to take on beta, before heading into a possibly quieter summer period,"" he said. 
The MSCI World index rose just 4.1% in the Jan-Mar quarter, the lowest in a year, as global shares were pressured by growing concerns about hiccups in vaccine rollouts and a fresh wave of coronavirus infections, particularly in Europe.
Some analysts said higher corporate profits could boost stock prices this month, with factories across Europe and Asia ramping up production in March.
Paul Sandhu, head of multi-asset quant solutions at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management, said investors should take this pause in the rally as an opportunity to rebalance their portfolios and buy on dips this month.
Refinitiv data showed global companies' profits in the March quarter are expected to rise 70%, compared with a year ago, led by a recovery in energy, consumer and mining firms.

The MSCI World index was up 0.24% on Thursday, which was the first trading day of the month.

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares were up 2.5% in Thursday’s premarket, driven by a report that a Chinese joint venture of rival Volkswagen (OTC:VWAPY) could buy green car credits from it to help it meet local environmental norms.
To help meet increasingly tough targets, Volkswagen's joint venture with state-owned Chinese automaker FAW has agreed to buy credits from Tesla, according to Reuters. 
Like other major auto markets, China requires carmakers to ensure that the average emissions of the cars they sell falls below a certain threshold. Those who can't meet that standard by their own efforts are allowed to buy credits from others such as Tesla.  
Tesla's revenue from selling regulatory credits totaled $1.58 billion in 2020, as per a regulatory filing. It has relied on such income to offset operating losses throughout its startup phase. Those operating losses are now narrowing, but its competition's needs for credits is also falling as other carmakers also pivot to models with lower emissions.FAW-Volkswagen's offer was around 3,000 yuan per credit, Reuters said quoting sources.
The report comes against a backdrop of a narrowing of the massive valuation gap between Tesla and VW, the world's second-largest automotive group by sales. VW shares have risen sharply in recent weeks in response to its progress in rolling out EVs. It is on course to sell more EVs than Tesla this year, according to the two companies' respective output forecasts.

Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) shares were the biggest gainers in the session so far on reports that the company was weighing a bid to buy Kioxia. They rose 4.5% after WSJ said Micron could value the Japanese rival at $30 billion.
TSM shares rose by over 2%, boosted by the company’s plans to spend $100 billion over the next three years to expand its chip fabrication capacity. TSM is the world’s leading manufacturer of advanced semiconductors purchased by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Shares of  NXP Semiconductors  (NASDAQ:NXPI) gained almost 2% as demand for its chips continues to surge amidst a boom for electric and autonomous cars.
Intel  (NASDAQ:INTC) was higher by 1%. The company recently unveiled plans to invest $20 billion to build two new chip plants in Arizona. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) shares also rose 1.5%.
The advent of 5G services and the general advance of automation has led to record high demand for devices using semiconductors. The pandemic has also spurred a short-term surge in demand for some electronic devices, while the cold snap in the southern U.S. in February has crimped supply by taking major production centers offline.
The disruption will impact the global chip contract manufacturing industry, research provider TrendForce has said.
Chips come in various sizes and shapes including 5G radio frequency chips, display and image sensor chips, power management integrated circuits and chips that control electrical parts."

16,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 07:18AM ET</span>","Cathie Wood Storms Back as ARKK, Space Fund Lure $1 Billion","(Bloomberg) -- A pair of Cathie Wood exchange-traded funds added around $1 billion in a single day this week in an emphatic display of investor loyalty toward the famed Ark Investment Management founder.
The flagship Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) took in a record $717 million on Tuesday, while the Ark Space Exploration and Innovation fund (NYSE:ARKX) absorbed $281 million on its debut, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Alongside bumper trading volumes on the day, it all adds up to one of the best-ever ETF launches for the fund, which tracks U.S. and global companies engaged in space exploration and innovation.
The launch was seen as a key test of Wood’s appeal after a volatile few months of flows and performance. After one of the strongest performances of 2020, ARKK has dropped 3.7% this year amid a rough patch for tech shares. Before a flood of cash this week, Ark’s main fund had posted five consecutive days of outflows, its longest streak on record.
“This is investors taking advantage to jump in after the drop from the top,” said Athanasios Psarofagis, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “You can see some investors were shaken out because there were some days of outflows during this period but for the most part people held strong so the demand is still there.”
ARKK was up 2% in pre-market trading as of 11:40 a.m. in New York, while the space fund rose 1.8%.
Ark’s investing strategy and success in luring new cash has spurred big bets on small companies, raising concern the firm exerts an outsize influence over the shares its holds. Wood handed fresh ammunition to her critics last week in a filing that removed prospectus clauses limiting exposure and concentration risks in its ETFs.
That hasn’t taken any shine off the space fund, with Wood’s first new ETF in two years seeing $294 million worth of shares change hands on its first day.
The product’s top two holdings are Trimble Inc. (NASDAQ:TRMB) and another Ark vehicle, the 3D Printing ETF (NYSE:PRNT). Other large stakes include  Kratos Defense &  Security Solutions Inc. (NASDAQ:KTOS), L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), an online retailer in China.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Thursday, starting a new quarter on a positive note as investors digest the Biden administration’s tax and spending plans.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 3 points, largely flat, S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.3%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 115 points, or 0.9%.
President Joe Biden outlined his $2 trillion infrastructure plan on Wednesday, including proposals to modernize 20,000 miles of roadway, fix 10,000 bridges and install 500,000 electric-vehicle charging stations.
While it’s not clear this plan will clear Congress in its present form, given likely opposition from Republicans to the increases in corporate taxes to pay for it, this fresh round of stimulus should give certain sectors another push higher, with the energy, materials and transportation sectors in particular focus. 
It also marks the second major spending push of Biden’s presidency after he approved a $1.9 trillion Covid relief package in early March.
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 6% in March, the broad-based S&P 500 index over 4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperformed, gaining just 0.4%, pressured by rising interest rates. 
It’s a busy day for economic data. Weekly initial jobless claims are due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), and are expected to have edged down to 680,000 last week, from the previous week’s post-pandemic low of 684,000, continuing the recovery in the labor market
The Institute of Supply Management business survey for March is also due later, and follows strong manufacturing numbers from both the euro zone and the U.K.
In the corporate sector, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is likely to be in focus, as well as semiconductors as a whole, after the company reported strong earnings and guidance after the bell on Wednesday. 
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) confirmed that a batch of a key vaccine ingredient didn't meet quality control standards, potentially resulting in the scrapping of up to 15 million vaccine doses. 
Oil prices pushed higher Thursday on expectations that a group of top producers will agree to largely maintain output curbs into May at a meeting later in the session given the surge of Covid-19 cases in many regions.
Reuters reported that the meeting is set to discuss two options: one would be to freeze output at current levels, and another to raise it by 500,000 barrels a day - still a small increase given the top producers are currently reining in output by around 8 million barrels a day.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% higher at $59.89 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1% to $63.36. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,711.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1734.

18,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 07:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Volkswagen to buy credits from Tesla in China to comply with environmental rules - sources,"By Yilei Sun and Tony Munroe
BEIJING (Reuters) - A Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) joint venture in China has agreed to buy green car credits from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to help meet local environmental rules, three people briefed on the matter told Reuters. 
The deal, the first of its kind to be reported between the two companies in China, highlights the scale of the task Volkswagen faces in transforming its huge petrol carmaking business into a leader in electric vehicles to rival Tesla. 
Shares in Volkswagen, the world's second-biggest automaker, have soared this year as investors warm to its plans to go electric. But in China, and elsewhere, the German company is still heavily reliant on traditional combustion-engine vehicles.
China, the world's biggest auto market where over 25 million vehicles were sold last year, runs a credit system that encourages automakers to work towards a cleaner future by, for example, improving fuel efficiency or making more electric cars. 
Manufacturers are awarded green credits that can be offset against negative credits for producing more polluting vehicles. They can also buy green credits to ensure compliance with overall targets, though trade is usually between affiliated companies that share a major stakeholder.
To help meet increasingly tough targets, Volkswagen's joint venture with state-owned Chinese automaker FAW, or FAW-Volkswagen, has agreed to buy credits from Tesla, the sources said, declining to be named as the talks were private. 
Volkswagen declined to comment on the deal. It said in a statement it was ""strategically targeting to be self-compliant"" with rules in China, but that if required it would buy credits.
Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.
FAW-Volkswagen sold 2.16 million cars last year. The business and another Volkswagen venture in China - with SAIC Motor - were among the most negative credit-generating automakers in the country in 2019, according to data from China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
The ventures' gasoline sedans and SUVs have so far proved far more popular in China than their electric vehicles. 
It is unclear how many green credits FAW-Volkswagen will buy from Tesla, but FAW-Volkswagen's offer was around 3,000 yuan per credit, higher than prices in previous years, the sources said.
The deal effectively sees Volkswagen, the biggest foreign carmaker in China, subsidising a rival while the German group ramps up production of electric vehicles. Its ventures in China plan to roll out five electric ID series models this year. 
In the United States, where regulators also set environmental requirements, Tesla has sold regulatory credits to rivals such as Fiat Chrysler, now part of Stellantis, but it has not so far reported any deals in China, where it started making cars in late 2019.

Tesla's revenue from selling regulatory credits totalled $1.58 billion in 2020, according to a regulatory filing.

LONDON (Reuters) - The City of London has almost closed the share trading gap with Amsterdam since dealings in Swiss shares resumed in the UK capital following Brexit, figures from Cboe exchange showed on Thursday.
Amsterdam took the European top spot in share trading from London in January after roughly 8 billion euros ($9.39 billion) a day left for the Dutch capital.
It was the first tangible sign of how Britain's full departure from the European Union on Dec. 31 will impact the City as the follow-up EU-UK trade deal does not cover finance.
In January, the average daily value of shares traded in Amsterdam was 9.22 billion euros, with 8.62 billion euros in London and 6.06 billion euros in Paris, Cboe said.
In March, Amsterdam traded 10.68 billion euros, just ahead of 10.62 billion euros in London, and 6.74 billion in Frankfurt, which has pushed Paris, at 6.44 billion, into fourth place, Cboe said.
The European Commission had stopped EU investors from trading on Swiss exchanges in June 2019 after a treaty dispute. Switzerland then banned EU exchanges from trading Swiss shares.
Brexit meant that Britain no longer had to comply with such EU decisions and Swiss share trading resumed in London in early February. Before the ban, London handled around 1.2 billion euros daily in Swiss shares.
The shift in euro share trading was expected. Chunks of euro derivatives trading have also left for Amsterdam, and a billion euros in daily EU emission allowance contracts will follow on June 7.
Former EU financial services commissioner Jonathan Hill has said the move in share trading had ""crystallised"" minds that direct City access to the EU was unlikely. He said it was better to focus on making the UK globally competitive in finance. [L8N2LN73A]
""The worst possible thing you can do is just sit there and hope the Europeans will come to our rescue,"" Hill said last week.
After agreeing a regulatory cooperation pact with London last week, Brussels has said it was in ""no rush"" to grant the City direct access to the 27-nation bloc.

21,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 06:25AM ET</span>",Ford and Mahindra to end collaboration on all projects in India,"By Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Mahindra & Mahindra will not collaborate on any project they had agreed to as part of their abandoned joint venture in India, the companies said.
Ford and Mahindra had proposed a joint venture to develop at least three sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) for India and emerging markets, as well as share suppliers, powertrains and technology. The deal, which would have ended most of Ford's independent operations in India, was called off on Dec. 31.
The companies were expected to make a decision by the end of March on whether to continue with all or some of the projects under a new relationship or end all talks.
""As part of winding down our relationship, several cooperative product programmes will no longer proceed. We are currently re-scoping those product programmes,"" a Ford India spokesman said in a statement on Thursday.
Ford has previously said that its independent India operations will continue.
Rajesh Jejurikar, executive director at Mahindra, told Reuters late on Wednesday that ""at this point there are no plans to continue on any of the projects"".
Michigan-based Ford entered India 25 years ago, but it has only a 2% share of a market dominated by Suzuki Motor Corp and Hyundai Motor's extensive line-up of mainly low-cost cars.
The tie-up with Mahindra would have enabled Ford to launch new vehicles faster and at reduced costs with lower investment, company officials and analysts previously said.
The two automakers had planned several projects together, including a mid-sized SUV to be built in 2022 by Mahindra on its vehicle platform and using its powertrain. 
For two other SUVs that Ford was working on for launch in 2023 and 2024, the plan had been to use Mahindra's engines. Ford will now need to find another supplier or invest in upgrading its own engines, sources have said.

Ford executives have said on several occasions that the company is exploring all options in relation to its India business.

22,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 05:45AM ET</span>","Global chip supply chain increasingly vulnerable to massive disruption, study finds","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - A new study from a U.S. industry group found that the global semiconductor supply chain has become increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters and geopolitical disruptions because suppliers have become more concentrated in distinct regions.
The report comes amid a global chip shortage that started with overbooked factories in Taiwan late last year, but has since been exacerbated by a fire at a plant in Japan, a freeze that knocked out electricity in the U.S. state of Texas and a worsening drought in Taiwan this year. The shortage has idled some production lines at automobile factories in the United States, Europe and Asia. 
Modern chipmaking involves more than a thousand steps and requires complex intellectual property, tools and chemicals from around the world. But the Semiconductor Industry Association, representing most U.S. chipmakers, on Thursday said it found more than 50 places in the supply chain where a single region has more than 65% market share.
Intellectual property and software to design cutting-edge chips, for example, is dominated by the United States, while special gases key to fabricating chips come from Europe. And the manufacturing of the most advanced chips is completely located in Asia - 92% of it in Taiwan. 
If Taiwan were unable to make chips for a year, it would cost the global electronics industry almost half a trillion dollars in revenue, the report found: ""The global electronics supply chain would come to a halt.""
Still, the study warned, a go-it-alone approach in which governments try to replicate the supply chain domestically is infeasible because it would cost $1.2 trillion globally - with up to $450 billion of that cost in United States alone - causing the price of chips to skyrocket. 
In some cases, though, it called for incentives to create ""minimum viable capacity"" in regions that lack any part of the supply chain.
In the case of the United States and Europe, that would mean new advanced chip factories to balance concentration in Taiwan and South Korea.

""We don't have enough semiconductor manufacturing in the United States ... And it's got to be fixed with the assistance of the U.S. government,"" John Neuffer, chief executive officer of the association, told Reuters.

23,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 05:30AM ET</span>",Greensill insurance mystery turns up the heat on Credit Suisse,"By Tom Bergin
LONDON (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) told investors the debt in its $7.3 billion finance fund was low risk because it was insured but the bank failed to ensure the policies would pay out, two sources told Reuters.
When Japan's Tokio Marine, the company insuring the debt, declined to renew its coverage with Greensill Capital last month, Credit Suisse was forced to liquidate the fund and said this may have a material impact on its results and reputation.
The bank's shares have fallen by almost a quarter in the past month as it deals with the fallout from Greensill and the impact of losses at its prime brokerage division caused by the stricken U.S. fund Archegos.
The debt Credit Suisse bought was issued by Greensill and backed by loans the supply chain finance firm made to companies. To manage its risk, Greensill took out credit insurance with a subsidiary of Insurance Australia Group (IAG (LON:ICAG)). Tokio Marine took on the policies in 2019 when it bought the unit.
Supply chain finance is a form of financing in which suppliers can receive early payment of their invoices.
Credit Suisse assured clients in marketing documents that the debt in the supply chain fund was ""low risk"". In one factsheet, it also said: ""The underlying credit risk of the notes is fully insured by highly rated insurance companies."" 
The sources told Reuters, however, that the bank did not communicate directly with Tokio Marine to confirm the insurer had no concerns about the validity of the policy or that the debt it bought from Greensill was the type the policies covered.
Instead, the Swiss bank relied on emailed updates about the policies from Marsh & McLennan, the broker that arranged them for Greensill, and did not hold regular discussions with Marsh to check whether the insurer was still intending to honour the contracts, the sources said.
Reuters could not determine what gave Credit Suisse comfort that its clients were covered by Greensill's insurance and why the bank may not have engaged in due diligence beyond its limited checks with Marsh.
Two Credit Suisse sources told Reuters in May 2020 and again in January 2021, just two months before Greensill and the fund collapsed, that Credit Suisse had confirmed with Marsh that insurance cover was in place.
Credit Suisse declined to answer questions about what information it had sought about the insurance from Tokio Marine, Marsh, Greensill or others.
Greensill, Marsh and Tokio Marine all declined to answer questions about the coverage.
DUE DILIGENCE
Tokio Marine told Greensill in August 2020 that it was investigating whether some policies had been issued validly as an employee had exceeded his underwriting authority and it would not accept that the policies were binding pending the outcome of its inquiry, according to court filings in Australia.
According to emails between Marsh and Tokio Marine submitted in evidence in the Australian case, the employee, Greg Brereton, breached a number of internal procedures. Brereton did not respond to requests for comment.
The two people familiar with the matter said Credit Suisse was not informed about these concerns at the time.
Tokio Marine, Greensill and Credit Suisse declined to comment.
Three insurance experts interviewed by Reuters said Tokio Marine and Marsh were not under any obligation to tell Credit Suisse because even though the fund was beneficiary of the insurance, it was not a policy holder. 
Neither Marsh nor Tokio Marine could have told Credit Suisse whether the debt it had bought from Greensill met the policy conditions because the bank did not provide a list of the specific bonds and ask for checks, three sources said.
The three insurance experts said Credit Suisse had dropped the ball if it did not make its own regular checks with Tokio Marine, given the crucial nature of the insurance to the value of the Greensill bonds it bought for its clients.
""Clearly they didn't do their due diligence,"" said Scott Levy, chief executive of Bedford Row Capital, which arranges bond issues. ""If Credit Suisse was doing its job properly there is no way that they could not have identified these problems.""
INVOICED TRANSACTIONS
The head of Credit Suisse's European asset management division and two other employees who worked on the finance funds have temporarily stepped aside, according to an internal bank memo, which did not state the reason for the changes.
Reuters has been unable to reach the managers for comment.
Credit Suisse has warned investors there was ""considerable uncertainty"" about how much money they would get back and said in its annual report that some clients had threatened to sue over the collapse of the fund.
Four sources told Reuters that Credit Suisse was considering compensating investors in the fund as there was concern the debacle could lead to wealthy customers turning their back on the bank.
When it ceased its cover in March, Tokio Marine said in a statement that Greensill was only covered for money it lent to companies backed by receivables - invoices they had received for goods and services delivered. Policies seen by Reuters say the debts should be backed by receivables.
However, Credit Suisse had also been buying Greensill bonds that lacked such collateral, according to corporate and legal filings. The bank declined to comment.
Reuters analysed the assets in Credit Suisse's supply chain finance fund in 2019 and found it included some Greensill bonds not backed by receivables.
Reuters told the bank's public relations department in July 2019 and in May 2020 this was the case. Credit Suisse declined to comment on the Reuters analysis on both occasions and again when contacted for this story. 
Two Credit Suisse sources told Reuters in May 2020 and in January 2021, just two months before Greensill and the fund collapsed, that Credit Suisse had independently confirmed insurance cover was in place.
Credit Suisse's fund managers did have occasional communication with Greensill's broker Marsh, beyond its regular emails to the bank detailing the names of borrowers and exposure limits in the policy, the two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The bank said in a June 2020 investor update that it had made insurance claims following the collapse of a healthcare provider whose debts the fund had bought via Greensill.

One of the sources said Marsh was involved in conversations with Credit Suisse about the claims. Reuters could not determine which insurer was involved or if the policy paid out.

Glovo, based in Barcelona, has seen demand soar during the COVID-19 pandemic, as locked-down customers turned to its quick delivery service that provides everything from food to toiletries. It currently has some 10 million users.
Glovo said it would use the funds to expand further in the 20 markets where it operates. It will also focus on its Q-commerce division as part of a goal of growing ultra-fast deliveries across the 850 cities where the app operates.
So-called quick commerce has boomed in the past year as the pandemic put a new premium on ultra-rapid deliveries of food and goods from relatively local stockrooms.
Investors have rushed to get in on the action of delivery apps, but the much-anticipated IPO of Deliveroo on the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday saw shares in the British delivery company plunge by as much as 30%, cutting more than 2 billion pounds off the company's valuation.
""This investment will allow us to grow in our core markets, accelerate our leadership position in places where we are already very strong, continue to expand our Q-commerce division and bring more innovation to our multi-category offering,"" Glovo CEO Oscar Pierre said in a statement.
Glovo raised the latest investment in a new round of Series F financing led by New York-based Lugard Road Capital and Luxor Capital Group. Delivery Hero, Drake Enterprises and GP Bullhound also participated in the round. All are previous investors in Glovo. 
The company did not give a valuation for the business but Spanish financial newspaper Expansion cited a figure of 2 billion euros.

Atos shares were down 18% in early trading on the Paris bourse, then recovered some ground and were trading down 13.8 % at 0805 GMT. Citi downgraded its outlook on the stock to neutral, citing the accounting issues.
The entities affected were Atos IT Solutions and Services Inc., and Atos IT Outsourcing Services LLC, which between them represent about 11% of Atos's consolidated turnover, Atos said in a statement.
Atos said that as part of a regular audit of its accounts, its accountants had identified problems with financial reporting ""leading to several accounting errors"".
It said it hired external firms to investigate whether those errors had let to a material misstatement of financial performance, but said there was not enough time to complete this work before the regular audit was published. 
""As of today, the Group has not identified misstatements on the two U.S. entities that are material for the consolidated financial statements,"" the company statement said.
""Atos is committed to the highest standards and the Group is strongly enhancing its preventive controls and processes through a comprehensive action plan.""
The French firm said in January it had made an approach to buy U.S. rival DXC Technology in what it called a ""friendly transaction"". In February, they decided to end the talks.
Atos shares have fallen since the deal talks were announced, with investors questioning the rationale for the acquisition, and have since languished near the bottom of France's blue-chip CAC 40 share index.

JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts wrote in a research note on Wednesday that Atos ""dinged investors’ view of its ambitions when it announced that it was looking at a friendly takeover of DXC. Now accounting issues could set the company back a bit further.""

Moscow is trying to strengthen control of the internet and reduce its dependence on foreign companies and countries. A number of additional proposals are in the works, ranging from compelling foreign firms to open offices on Russian territory, to tax breaks for Russian IT companies. 
One potential stumbling block for the law's introduction was the reaction of U.S. tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which dragged its feet before agreeing last month to offer a way for users to install Russian software during iPhone setups. 
The legislation has become known colloquially in Russia as 'the law against Apple.'
Apple said it would offer a selection of apps from Russian developers as part of activation screens for new devices. It said it intended to comply with the new Russian law, but noted that all apps are reviewed to ensure they comply with Apple's standards for privacy, security and content.  
Russia's digital ministry has said the law applies to smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, laptops and PCs produced after April 1. 
""Russian apps from the pre-installation list should be placed next to other programmes of the same class: both from the same category next to each other on the same screen of the device.""
The apps on the list include internet browsers, search engines, maps and navigations providers, and apps for using the payment system Mir, Russia's answer to Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), according to a government decree published in November. 
Russia's IT industry has the opportunity and potential to become a ""locomotive in the process of modernising the country,"" Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko said at a meeting with representatives of the IT industry last month. 
A second package of more than 60 support measures for the industry is being discussed in government, he added.

Profit before tax of 342 million pounds ($471 million) for the year to end January was in line with company guidance but down from 729 million.
With most of Next's stores closed for a significant portion of the year, group sales fell by 17% to 3.6 billion pounds.
Yet Next has shown resilience during the crisis, benefiting from its long-established online operation.
Rivals with weaker or no online business, notably Primark, have seen far larger falls in sales. Others, such as Topshop-owner Arcadia, and Debenhams have collapsed.
In the first eight weeks of the current financial year, Next said online sales had been stronger than expected and up more than 60% on two years ago.
The group raised its central guidance for profit before tax for 2021-22 to 700 million pounds from 670 million.
It maintained its forecast for flat full price sales versus 2019-20 - a two-year comparison.
Shares in Next, up 11% in 2021, closed Wednesday at 7,866 pence, valuing the business at 10.4 billion pounds.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher to record levels Thursday, boosted by additional stimulus in the form of the new U.S. infrastructure plan which overshadowed Covid worries.
At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% higher at an all-time high, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2%, the U.K.’s FTES 100 gained 0.5%, while the blue chip Euro Stoxx 50 gained 0.4%, also at an all-time high. 
Offering support was the news that President Joe Biden is set to inject another $2 trillion into the U.S. economy, the world’s driver, with spending on roads, railways, broadband, clean energy and semiconductor manufacture, funded in part by a sharp rise in corporate taxes.
The plan is likely to face opposition from Republicans in Congress, but it comes fresh on the heels of a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package.
The news in Europe is less encouraging, with President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday ordering France into its third national lockdown as he sought to push back a third wave of Covid-19 infections.
New infection numbers hit their highest since November this week in Europe's second-largest economy, while the number of those in intensive care is now approaching the peak of the first wave last year.. 
Pressure is also rising in Germany for the reintroduction of tougher lockdown measures, while Sweden’s government will postpone a planned easing of some restrictions until the start of May.
German retail sales disappointed in February, falling 9.0% on the year and only climbing 1.2% on the month. The final manufacturing PMI data for the European Union are due later in the session. 
In corporate news, ASML (AS:ASML) stock rose 1.6%, to a record high, with the semiconductor sector in demand during the Covid-19 pandemic as consumers buy more electronics for their homes.  Vinci stock rose 3.0% after the French infrastructure company said it will buy the energy business of Spain's ACS (MC:ACS) for 4.9 billion euros ($1.75 billion), a move that beefs up its exposure to renewable energy significantly.
In the U.K.,  Next  (LON:NXT) shares rose 3.2% to an all-time high after publishing strong earnings and an upbeat look ahead to the reopening of its physical stores. Deliveroo  (LON:ROO) stock fell 1%, as Europe's biggest IPO of the year to day failed to generated even a modest bounce after slumping by nearly one-third on its debut. 
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, announced plans earlier Thursday to invest $100 billion over the next three year to increase capacity at its plants.
Oil prices pushed higher Thursday on expectations that a group of top producers will agree to largely maintain output curbs into May at a meeting later in the session given the surge of Covid-19 cases in many regions.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, is currently reining in output by just over 7 million barrels a day to support prices and reduce oversupply. Saudi Arabia has added to those cuts with a further 1 million barrels a day.

33,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 03:05AM ET</span>","In squeezed euro debt sales, governments curb inflated hedge fund demand","By Yoruk Bahceli
(Reuters) - The ECB's massive bond-buying programme has fuelled a bonanza in euro zone sovereign debt, with some investors vastly overstating their orders at debt sales in a bid to secure the coveted paper. But now some governments are starting to say, enough is enough.
Borrowers including the European Union, France and Spain are moving to rein in orders from hedge funds in their syndicated bond sales, a government official and four banking sources involved in the deals told Reuters. 
The aim is to stem a deluge of inflated orders from these funds, which vastly overstate their demand in an attempt to guarantee they secure their desired amount of bonds, according to the sources. 
""The concern is that if you don't have the correct picture, you might make mistakes in the future about what the actual demand for the bonds is,"" said Stelios Leonidou, who manages Cyprus's debt issuance. He told Reuters he had raised the issue with banks, though did not say Cyprus planned to curb orders.
The investor rush to snap up sovereign debt is being partly driven by the European Central Bank's immense presence in the secondary market, where it's 1.85 trillion-euro ($2.2 trillion) pandemic war chest to shore up the euro zone economy is making it harder for investors to find bonds to buy.
The likes of hedge funds and some other investors are looking to make a quick profit by buying bonds in government sales and flipping them to the ECB for more.
Order inflation has become so extreme of late that government debt management offices are pushing back. Two bankers said they had at times seen hedge funds putting in orders that exceeded the totality of the assets they managed. 
The European Union has been capping orders, mainly from hedge funds, since the beginning of the year and France did so in a March deal, according to the bankers, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter and did not specify what the level of the caps were. Spain also limited such orders in February, the sources said.
The strategy involves having managers at banks explain to the buyers during the sale process that the borrower would be capping their orders, meaning bids exceeding that cap would not be taken into consideration, the people added. 
""The message was: you're not going to get any benefit from putting orders above a certain size,"" said one of the bankers.
A spokesperson for the European Commission said it uses an allocation policy in line with EU securities law. 
France's debt management office told Reuters there was no specific cap on the order size but that banks were instructed to make investors understand it would be amenable to orders ""more in line"" with what they could reasonably expect to receive.
Spain's treasury said its order cap has been in place for several years and that it applies ""uniformly across categories of investors"". 
The ECB declined to comment.
STIMULUS SIDE-EFFECTS
    Sovereign bonds are a necessary asset for many investors, which need them in portfolios to manage risk and returns. Some hedge funds and other investors also trade in the bonds, making it easier for the debt to be bought and sold in the marketplace. 
However the ECB's bond-buying since 2015, which it has stepped up during the pandemic, has created an investor rush that has led to supply shortages.
Eight euros of demand chased every euro of syndicated government debt in January this year, Reuters analysis of Refinitiv IFR data shows, versus two euros in January 2015.
    Order books routinely exceed the funds raised by over 10 times; last October's European Union 17-billion-euro issue set a record, drawing 233 billion euros in bids. Even junk-rated Greece saw a 26-billion-euro order book at a recent 2.5-billion-euro sale of 30-year bonds. 
    For hedge funds - who are allocated a relatively small chunk of bonds by issuers - the supply-demand imbalance means they often get far fewer than they ask for, so they order more than they need, according to the interviews with bankers and government officials. 
This makes it difficult for governments to gauge the true demand and can make it appear that they have underpriced the debt and are not delivering value, even though much of the demand is illusory. 
Britain's Treasury Committee wrote to its debt management office in November, for example, demanding to know how it ensured pricing was ""keen enough in favour of the taxpayer"". 
    Buyers are ""almost incentivized to inflate their orders to get a reasonable allocation"", said Gareth Hill, a fund manager at Royal London Asset Management. 
    One hedge fund manager, who requested anonymity, said that after inflating his order in the recent Greek issue, he received only 3% of his order. ""We didn't get enough,"" he added.
Anthony Requin and Maric Post, heads of the French and Belgian debt management offices, said they may raise the issue of inflated orders at the European Union's sovereign debt sub-committee, which meets at least once a quarter. 
'COMPLETELY PREPOSTEROUS'
Before the ECB's bond buying, hedge funds would only bid in issues if they had a specific interest in the deal, one banker said. ""Now, it's all these players getting involved systematically in every transaction"". 
In January, for example, a 50-year French bond sale saw 75 billion euros in bids. Requin, the debt management office head, estimates over 80% were from hedge funds and other so-called relative-value accounts - investors who sell the bonds on quickly, also known as ""fast-money"" accounts. 
The numbers were ""completely preposterous"", he said. ""They don't reflect anything,"" he added.
    The same month, after receiving a 130-billion-euro order book, Spain's debt management office cut the yield it offered on its bond more sharply than usual. Bond prices go up when yields fall.
     Over half the orders then vanished, an experience which bankers said spooked debt management offices. Spain's treasury director general Pablo de Ramon-Laca blames it on hedge fund-type bidders who might have found it harder to profitably flip the paper after the price hike. 
     Most ""real-money"" investors - those such as asset managers and pension funds who hold onto bonds for a longer period - accepted the tighter price ""but a good many fast-money accounts found that this reduced their profit unbearably"", de Ramon-Laca said.
At France and Spain's most recent deals in February and March, headline orders did shrink considerably. 
Still, the Spanish and French bonds were oversubscribed 13 and five times respectively. Last week's 13 billion-euro EU deal drew nearly 100 billion euros of orders.

""Actually we have a huge amount of interest from new financiers who are willing to back us, who are willing to refinance Greensill,"" Gupta told the BBC. ""Given the situation, this sort of thing takes time and hence we need to find short-term solutions.""
He said it was natural that lenders wanted to protect their position and said there were positive discussions with Grant Thornton, the administrator for Greensill.
""It makes no sense for them or any of the creditors to destroy jobs, but more importantly to destroy value because that is the value which will give them the recovery.""
He said his business owed ""many billions"" of pounds to Greensill but he expected other financiers to back him.
""It is many billions, but also remember that we are one of the largest steel companies in the world, a very substantial aluminium business, and a substantial renewable energy business so it should be reflected in that light,"" Gupta said.
He said no steel plants would close on his watch. 
""None of our steel plants under my watch will be shut down.""

36,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 02:20AM ET</span>",China leads global green-bond sales boom but faces headwinds,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China overtook the United States to lead a boom in global green- bond issuance in the first quarter, but analysts said it needs to do more to draw investors to help fund President Xi Jinping's estimated $21 trillion carbon neutrality pledge.
Pending tasks include raising investor awareness of the environment, harmonising fragmented rules and tackling 'greenwashing', or issuers' efforts to inflate their green credentials, they said. At stake is Beijing's goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2060.
Chinese issuers including banks, property developers, power generators and railway operators sold $15.7 billion of bonds during January-March period to fund 'green' projects such as clean and renewable energy, according to Refinitiv data. 
The volume of such bonds, mostly yuan-denominated, almost quadrupled from a year earlier, the data showed.
For a graphic on global green bond issuance, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmyvmrlkgpr/global%20issuance%20in%20Q1.jpg
That exceeds the roughly $15 billion of such bonds sold by U.S. issuers in the first quarter, and helped drive a tripling of green bond issuance globally.
Green bonds blossomed ""largely thanks to China's recovery from the coronavirus,"" said Nathan Chow, strategist at DBS. ""In addition, the Chinese government is going all out to develop this market this year.""
China, the world's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, needs 140 trillion yuan ($21.33 trillion) of debt financing over the next 40 years to meet its net-zero emissions target, investment bank China International Capital Corp (CICC) estimates.
With roughly 800 billion yuan of green bonds outstanding, China is already the world's second-biggest green bond market after the United States. However, green bonds account for less than 1% of China's $18 trillion bond market.
At this stage, ""companies have no cost advantages issuing green bonds... and there's not enough market support for many green projects which take a long time to complete and are seen as risky,"" said CICC economist Zhou Zipeng. 
Highlighting such headwinds, China's first batch of ""carbon neutral"" bonds, launched in February, met tepid demand.
Several fund managers said green bonds are not yet on their investment radar.
""The only thing Chinese investors currently look at is yield. So obviously if green bonds cannot offer the extra returns, they ask the government, 'what can you do to help me?',"" said Ricco Zhang, Asia-Pacific director of the International Capital Market Association (ICMA).
A brokerage source said state-owned companies were motivated to issue green bonds to align with government priorities, but investors lacked incentives to buy them. 
Authorities are aware of the problems. Earlier this month, Chinese central bank governor Yi Gang called for incentives to boost private participation in meeting Beijing's carbon goals.
Moving closer to international standards by excluding coal from the green market would widen the potential foreign investor base, Chow of DBS said.
ICMA's Zhang said regulators also need to harmonise different domestic standards. Currently, China's central bank, securities regulator and the state planner have separate rules for green bonds issued under their supervision. 
""Sometimes it's hard for international investors to have a granular understanding of different (Chinese) green bonds. This brings challenges for green investors to identify the right target for investment,"" he said.

37,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 02:16AM ET</span>",Dunkirk smelter deal provides a window into GFG's complex web of financing,"By Pratima Desai
LONDON (Reuters) - Sanjeev Gupta's $500 million purchase of Europe’s largest aluminium smelter from Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) in 2018 was the steel tycoon’s first big industrial deal financed through traditional bank debt.
Gupta's GFG Alliance, a sprawling network of hundreds of privately-held companies with interests spanning steel, aluminium, mining, financial services and real estate, publicly announced the five-year term loan with a syndicate of banks.
Behind the scenes, however, GFG had tapped British finance firm Greensill and U.S. asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) for additional funding via a complex chain of holding companies, according to two sources with direct knowledge and documents seen by Reuters. 
The extra borrowing enabled Gupta to minimise the amount of cash that he had tied up in the purchase of the Dunkirk aluminium smelter in France, the two sources said. They said the original syndicate of banks and commodity trader Trafigura were unaware of the additional funding, which Gupta used to cash in some of the equity he had pledged for the purchase of the smelter. 
A spokesman for GFG Alliance declined to comment on its financial arrangements. Trafigura and Greensill's administrators declined to comment.
GFG Alliance's complex corporate structures and financing arrangements are proving problematic as Gupta seeks new sources of funding in the wake of Greensill's insolvency last month.
Gupta is talking to the government in Britain, where he employs around 3,000 people, about receiving financial support from the state for his businesses there but some officials say they are wary.
""We are custodians of taxpayers' money and there were concerns about the very opaque structure of the GFG group,” Britain's Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said on Tuesday.
""We can’t be giving taxpayers’ money, essentially putting it into a black box where we don’t know what the money will be used for.""
The GFG Alliance spokesman declined to comment on Kwarteng's remarks or on the discussions with government.
GFG has said previously that it is trying to negotiate a standstill agreement with Greensill's administrators, which would mean it could pause its debt payments to Greensill, and refinance its businesses. 
The supply chain finance firm was a major source of funding for Gupta as he bought up troubled metals manufacturing facilities, creating a conglomerate with more than 35,000 employees across 30 countries. Greensill repackaged loans it made to GFG Alliance into bonds that could be sold to investors.
The funding that GFG Alliance got from Greensill for the French smelter was in the form of a $77.5 million promissory note while BlackRock lent $115 million, according to the two sources and GFG presentations seen by Reuters.
One presentation of the smelter's funding structure lists 9 corporate entities across multiple jurisdictions including Luxembourg, France and the Netherlands, with a straight line up to Sanjeev Gupta.
In January 2019, when the BlackRock loan was made available, Gupta used the fresh funding to replace some of the equity he had pledged for the Dunkirk smelter, enabling him to access at least $50 million in cash, two sources with direct knowledge said.
That equity was part of the original bank syndicate loan agreement. GFG Alliance was to pay a third of the purchase price for the smelter and the banks, along with Trafigura, lent $350 million, according to a presentation seen by Reuters and the two sources.
The lenders which included Natixis and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) were not informed about the additional loans from Greensill and BlackRock, the sources said.
Reuters could not determine if the syndicated loan agreement required GFG Alliance to request permission from the banks and Trafigura before raising additional funding for the smelter.
Natixis and BNP Paribas declined to comment about their loan agreement with GFG Alliance.
BlackRock’s $115 million loan was not repaid when it matured in January of this year and has been extended by two years according to a third source.

The loan plus interest amount to $131 million, according to a March 2021 document showing GFG's debts and the valuation of its businesses.

38,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 02:12AM ET</span>",Global garment makers unite to demand better terms from retailers,"By Victoria Waldersee and Ruma Paul
DHAKA/LISBON(Reuters) - Garment makers in nine countries spanning Asia, the Middle East and North Africa have banded together to demand better contract terms from global clothing retailers, according to a draft document seen by Reuters.
The suppliers hope their united front will prevent retailers from playing them off against each other in search of more lenient terms after suffering from widespread cancellations and payment delays at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.
Global retailers including Arcadia, Gap, Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), and Primark cancelled or paused orders with garment-making factories in Bangladesh worth almost $3.7 billion in March and April last year, the results of a local survey of factories seen by Reuters showed.
While some, including Primark, H&M,  Inditex  (MC:ITX) and Gap, later committed to paying the cancelled orders in full, campaigning coalition PayUp estimates $18 billion out of $40 billion worth of payments are still outstanding globally.
Arcadia and Kohl's did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
Thirteen associations representing garment suppliers in China, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, Pakistan, Turkey, Morocco and Indonesia have drafted minimum terms they hope to present to clients, including a maximum 90-day payment term and an end to discounts after orders are placed.
The draft document, due to be finalised and released in late April, is a joint initiative of the Star Network, funded by Germany's international development agency GIZ, and the International Apparel Federation. 
""It has become very clear to manufacturers that their vulnerability has increased and that they must play a stronger role in setting standards for purchasing practices,"" a statement announcing the initiative published on Thursday said.
Though the document will not be legally enforceable, the aim is to foster purchasing practices which ""do not cross the boundary of misuse of buying power to the obvious and avoidable detriment of the manufacturer,"" according to the release.
A later phase of the initiative would also aim to build ways of enforcing the terms, including an international arbitration mechanism for manufacturers to raise grievances with buyers.
""We tended to blindly trust our customers,"" said Miran Ali, spokesman for the Star Network. ""If they said they want to buy 100,000 yards of fabric from us and they'll send the purchase order in three weeks, we'd just go ahead and do it. That faith has been lost.""
Global retailers lost $1.2 trillion in sales in 2020, a 3.9% drop, according to research firm Forrester, as global lockdowns decimated demand and shut stores for months on end. Though some sales were recuperated online, many clothing retailers were forced to impose steep discounts in an attempt to get rid of unsold stock.
The Penn State Center for Global Workers' Rights said in a report that U.S. and European Union trade data showed a $16.2 billion drop in apparel imports in April through June 2020.
While clothing sales are beginning to recover from last year's record losses, orders are still far smaller than before the pandemic, with shorter lead times and longer payment windows, factory owners, sourcing agents and retailers themselves say. 
'NOT A HAPPY MESSAGE'
The draft document says retailers must pay suppliers within 90 days, with deferred payments attracting an additional fee to cover interest and loss of profit, while discounts could not be requested after a purchase order is issued. 
A letter from Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) to its suppliers on April 7, 2020 stated orders shipped after March 24 would be paid up to 120 days from invoice receipt date, up from 75 days previously and nearly three times the pre-pandemic industry average of 43 days. These terms remain in place, a Marks & Spencer spokesperson said, declining to comment further. 
In anticipation of lower sales, other retailers imposed discounts on orders already in production. 
A letter sent by Hong Kong-based sourcing agent Li & Fung to some suppliers of  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO) in April last year and seen by Reuters said that a 20% discount would be applied to orders affected by the coronavirus.
""We know it is not a happy message...but...it is the crucial fact we're facing now because we all know chicken dies, no eggs,"" the letter said. ""A PIECE OF CAKE IS NOT ABLE TO FEED ALL."" 
Li & Fung did not respond to a request for comment. American Eagle Outfitters referred Reuters to its statement made last July when it said it had to make ""immediate and difficult business decisions"" and had ""negotiated a one-time discount on a small amount of unshipped orders last April"". 
'FORCE MAJEURE'
The draft also includes limitations on the use of the 'force majeure' clause which exempts retailers from costs and liability for events outside their control. 
A cancellation clause in a purchasing order used by Kohl's gives it the right to cancel an order in the event of natural disasters, disease outbreaks and government restrictions, among other events beyond its control, without being subject to ""any liability, cost or charge whatsoever"".
A letter Arcadia sent to its suppliers informing them of its cancellation of orders due to the impact of COVID-19 stated: ""we are able to cancel any order at any stage. This includes orders in production and orders in transit... we are not responsible for the cost of the Goods"".
Extracts of the purchasing order used by Kohl's and the Arcadia letter were published in a September 2020 report by the European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights. The companies did not respond to a request for comment on their communication with suppliers. Arcadia fell into administration late last year.  
The European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights and the Workers Rights Consortium questioned retailers' use of force majeure during the pandemic in the report, saying parties invoking the clause should prove they made all possible attempts to mitigate the effects of the unforeseen event.
According to U.S. and UK law, they must demonstrate that taking delivery of orders would be ""commercially impracticable"" - which may not be clear-cut for brands with sufficient cash flow and solid e-commerce sales, the report said.
Garment suppliers hope to tip the balance of power in their favour, more fairly distributing risk in the event of another unforeseen disruption to sales. 
""Buyers are asking for drastic cuts and delays in payments...but if I refuse, they will go to another supplier,"" a garment factory owner in Dhaka who preferred to remain anonymous for fear of losing business, said. 

""We need a fair policy, badly,"" he said. ""Or the garment industry will not survive.""

39,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 02:06AM ET</span>","European Stock Futures Flat; Investors Digest Covid, Infrastructure Bill and Data","By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening largely unchanged Thursday, as investors digest fresh Covid lockdowns, a new U.S. infrastructure plan and a raft of economic data releases.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France were flat as was the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. 
President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday ordered France into its third national lockdown and said schools would close for three weeks as he sought to push back a third wave of Covid-19 infections.
New infection numbers hit their highest since November this week in Europe's second-largest economy, while the number of those in intensive care is now approaching the peak of the first wave last year.. 
In Germany, the premiers of two southern states badly hit by the pandemic urged the rest of the country to reintroduce tougher lockdown measures, while Sweden’s government will postpone a planned easing of some restrictions until the start of May.
Offering support was the news Wednesday that President Joe Biden is set to inject another $2 trillion into the U.S. economy, the world’s driver, with spending on roads, railways, broadband, clean energy and semiconductor manufacture, funded in part by a sharp rise in corporate taxes.
The plan is likely to face opposition from Republicans in Congress, but it comes fresh on the heels of a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package.
European investors also have a large number of economic releases to wade through Thursday. Germany’s retail sales disappointed in February, falling 9.0% on the year and only climbing 1.2% on the month, ahead of the disclosure of final manufacturing PMI data for the region.
Earlier China’s Caixin manufacturing PMI for March also disappointed, dropping to 50.6 from February’s 50.9 reading, while Japan’s Tankan Large Manufacturers Index came in at 5 for the first quarter of 2021, above the –10 reading in the fourth quarter of 2020.
In the corporate sector, Sodexo (PA:EXHO) said it expects its second-half revenue to expand after the French catering and food services group reported a large beat on its first-half profit margin.
Oil prices pushed higher Thursday on expectations that a group of top producers will agree to largely maintain output curbs into May at a meeting later in the session given the surge of Covid-19 cases in many regions.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, is currently reining in output by just over 7 million barrels a day to support prices and reduce oversupply. Saudi Arabia has added to those cuts with a further 1 million barrels a day.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $59.67 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.8% to $63.23. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,713.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1717.

But, Sodexo said it will remain cautious in view of a resurgence in coronavirus infections and flagged the continuous volatility in the short-term, particularly in Europe, and expected little improvement in quarter-on-quarter trends throughout its fiscal year.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Celonis, a fast-growing German process mining software startup, has struck a strategic partnership with  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) to help companies make the most of the digital transformation that many are undergoing at speed.
IBM's Global Business Services consulting arm will weave the Celonis Execution Management System into its offering, adding the ability to analyse data thrown off by processes like supply-chain management, finance or procurement to identify weaknesses and recommend fixes.
Celonis will also shift its software stack to IBM's Red Hat OpenShift platform, which enables companies to operate in an open 'hybrid' setting that can include public or private cloud data centres, on-premise servers and mainframe computers.
That represents a big step for the Munich startup, which last raised funds https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-celonis-idUSKBN1XV1LP from investors at a valuation of $2.5 billion in 2019 and counts Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Siemens, Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) as clients.
“This is the most comprehensive and committal partnership that I’ve been part of,"" said Miguel Milano, chief revenue officer and co-owner of Celonis, who joined from Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) a year ago.
""We took the risk because we saw the opportunity and the value to re-engineer our full stack to run on Red Hat OpenShift. That is massive,"" Milano, a 28-year software industry veteran, told Reuters in an interview.
A typical large company runs more than 1,000 processes with the use of technology, often in different computing environments, creating complexity that makes it hard to bring about change.
Weaving Celonis into IBM's consulting offering can help clients to identify where the value can be found across a range of applications, making it possible to benchmark performance, deploy artificial intelligence or trigger automation.
“Every workflow in every organization is now fair game,"" said Mark Foster, senior vice president at IBM Services.
Celonis has doubled bookings and revenues over the past year, and Milano said the partnership offered an opportunity to accelerate its growth further.

“Our breakthrough from a strategic perspective was to realise that Celonis alone cannot take our platform to every company, every industry, every process,"" he said, explaining the attraction of the partnership.

43,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2021 11:50PM ET</span>",Bankers say all aboard for great Asia SPAC merger lift-off,"By Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asia's bankers say they expect the hottest trend in global deal-making, IPOs for special-purpose acquisition vehicles (SPAC), to rocket in the region this year from small beginnings, fuelled by well-resourced investors including private equity firms.
Globally, SPACs raised $92 billion from IPOs in first-quarter 2021, according to Refinitiv data, already surpassing al of 2020. SPAC mergers - when the blank check firm uses IPO funds to merge with a target - amounted to $210 billion.
But Asia's representation in the global pie has been small so far - about 11 out of 2021's 304 SPAC IPOs, and just $4.7 billion in SPAC mergers. Given the region's large pool of new-economy companies, bankers are now plugging it as a hot spot for merger targets.
Raghav Maliah, co-head of M&A for Asia ex-Japan at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), said the significant increase of Asia-focused SPAC involvement has been the most notable feature in the region's M&A this year. First-quarter Asia M&A hit a three-year high of $279.5 billion, up 37% year-on-year, Refinitiv data showed, with private equity-backed deals scoring a record $40.6 billion.
""These blank check companies (SPACs) have become a new dynamic force and potential merger partner for some of Asia's most innovative companies,"" Maliah said.
For example, India's largest renewable energy firm ReNew Power, in which Goldman invested, in February agreed to go public through a merger with a SPAC.
Meanwhile Chinese ride hailing giant Didi Chuxing and its Indonesian counterpart Grab have held discussions about the SPAC merger option to go public, Reuters has reported.
Samson Lo, head of Asia M&A at UBS, said SPAC-related activities will last for the large part of the year. Still, he cautioned, a mismatch could yet develop in the supply of SPAC merger candidates and demand from the abundance of SPACs that just ""keep coming"".
Banks not only generate fees from the SPAC merger transactions, but also from potential 'PIPE' (private investment in public entity) deals - when a SPAC raises additional capital to complete a targeted merger.
On the funding side, private equity deployable capital focusing on Asia stood at $376.4 billion in March - the highest ever, according to data provider Preqin.
""There are lots of buyers, including SPAC, private equity and strategic (investors), which makes it an attractive time to sell assets,"" said Mayooran Elalingam,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s head of investment banking coverage & advisory in Asia Pacific. 
""We are seeing positive momentum in the market.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up Thursday morning, beginning April on a high note as investors assessed economic data from China and Japan, as well as a new U.S. infrastructure plan.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.20% by 11:26 PM ET (3:26 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component rose 0.84%. Thursday's Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for March disappointed, reading 50.6 against the 51.3 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and February’s 50.9 reading.
The figure comes on the back of the positive manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs released on Wednesday. The Caixin services PMI will be released the following week.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.73%, with the Tankan Large Manufacturers Index at 5 for the first quarter of 2021, above the –15 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the –10 reading in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Tankan Large Non-Manufacturers Index was at –1, against the –5 reading in both Investing.com forecasts and the fourth quarter of 2020.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 1.01%, even as trading in more than 50 Hong Kong-listed companies was suspended after several firms reportedly failed to report earnings ahead of the Mar. 31 deadline.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.52% In Australia, theASX 200was up 0.22% as the third-biggest city of Brisbane lifted a three-day snap lockdown earlier in the day.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields steadied at 1.74%, after its worst quarterly performance since 1980 according to Bloomberg data.
Investor sentiment was also boosted by a $2.25 trillion infrastructure plan laid out by U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday. However, the plan will be funded with higher corporate taxes, which is likely to draw resistance when the plan is debated in Congress.
Central banks globally continued their support to keep borrowing costs low, contributing to a push for more investment into economic recovery. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Wednesday warned, however, that policymakers will use all their powers should investors try to push bond yields higher.
Despite encouraging economic data over the past week, the number of global COVID-19 cases continues to grow. Clusters in regions led to fresh restrictive measures, with France entering its third lockdown and Canada’s Ontario province entering a 28-day lockdown, serving as a grim reminder that the fight against the virus is not over yet.
Some investors remained cautiously optimistic, however.
“There is still some room for recovery in stocks that will benefit from the economic recovery and the reopening trade... there’s still a lot of growth that has to come and that’s not necessarily reflected in earnings yet,” Cambiar Investors LLC investment principal Ania Aldrich told Bloomberg."

SINGAPORE/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Stocks crept higher on Thursday following their weakest quarter in a year, while higher Treasury yields supported the dollar, as investors parsed the details of a $2 trillion U.S. government spending plan and hoped for strong jobs data later in the week.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6% after a modest drop on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei rose 1.3% as a survey showed big manufacturers' mood bouncing back to pre-pandemic levels.
Ten-year U.S. Treasuries, which had suffered their biggest selloff in a dozen years last quarter, remained under pressure and yields crept as high as 1.753%, while the dollar stood just shy of a one-year peak on the yen at 110.685.
On the heels of a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, President Joe Biden on Wednesday outlined a broad plan to re-make the world's biggest economy including spending on roads, railways, broadband, clean energy and semiconductor manufacture.
""We'll probably see more spending power from the stimulus than drag from the (accompanying) taxes,"" said Jun Bei Liu, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners in Sydney.
""And if anything the higher taxes probably limit future inflationary pressure, and in a strange way might even help bond yields to stabilise where they are.""
It is not clear if the plan could clear Congress, since it has had an icy reception from Republicans, however, the breadth of the proposed spending did help draw investors back to technology shares overnight, and the Nasdaq rose 1.5%. (NDX)
Biden's plan includes a $174 billion investment in electric vehicles, and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) led gains with a 5% jump, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 1.9% and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) lifted 1.7%.
""We're just seeing a bit of momentum in people picking up some of the left-behind sectors, which is growth, and that will flow through into Asia.""
SHIFTING SENTIMENT
U.S. markets had closed out the quarter with gains - the S&P 500 rose 5.8% and the Dow Jones 7.8% over the three months - however the 4.1% quarterly rise in world stocks was the slowest since the recovery from last March's meltdown had begun.
This has come with growing concern about hiccups in the vaccine rollout and a fresh wave of coronavirus infections, particularly in Europe where on Wednesday France ordered a third national lockdown.
The euro has been punished as the pandemic turns resurgent on the continent, and was clinging on at $1.1729 in Asia while investors awaited Friday's U.S. labour market data to assess the growing gap in recoveries astride the Atlantic Ocean.
There are also other signs of fragility in sentiment and rising risk. The flop listing of food delivery company Deliveroo, which fell by nearly a third on debut in London, is a far cry from the frenzy that sent U.S. new-economy names Airbnb and DoorDash soaring on debut last year.
Investors are jittery about the fallout from the fire sale of holdings by stricken asset manager Archegos Capital, which has walloped the stocks involved and shares in some of Archegos' brokers,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Nomura.
Australia's fastest home-price gains in more than three decades last month also point to some of the side effects of ultra-easy monetary policy, possibly putting pressure on central banks to curtail support sooner than they had planned.

Risk-sensitive currencies and commodities reflected the caution, and the Australian and New Zealand dollars each weakened about 0.2% on Thursday. Crude oil prices nursed overnight losses with Brent futures rebounding about 0.5% to $63.03 a barrel and U.S. crude up 0.6% at $59.52. [O/R]
Gold, which pays no income, was mostly flat after an overnight bounce above $1,700. Even so, it suffered its worst quarter since late 2016 owing to the rise in U.S. yields.

In a consultation paper released late Wednesday, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. proposed broadening secondary listings to all companies from now limiting them to high growth and innovative firms as long as they have one vote per share. It wants to lower the minimum market capitalization to HK$3 billion ($386 million), given a listing track record of five years. That’s down from HK$40 billion, or HK$10 billion with revenue of HK$1 billion.
The move is intended to add further momentum to a boom in listings by Chinese firms in the city amid rising tension with the U.S. New York-listed Chinese tech heavyweights such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). and Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) Inc. have raised $36 billion through secondary listings in Hong Kong since late 2019.
“Our latest proposals to streamline requirements and enhance our listing regime will attract more international and mainland companies looking to benefit from Hong Kong’s liquid financial markets,” Bonnie Chan, HKEX’s head of listing, said in a statement. The plan will maintain “the quality of the market” and “the high standards of shareholder protection that Hong Kong is known for,” she said.
The proposal came as China is said to mull creating a new stock exchange to attract overseas-listed firms to come back home, Reuters reported on Wednesday.
The new rule could allow the likes of retailer Miniso Group Holding Ltd., developer Nam Tai Property Inc. and pet products maker Boqii Holding Ltd. to add listings closer to home.
Market participants have until May 31 to respond to the consultation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Wednesday it had approved the design for the Boeing 737-8200, part of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX series, a necessary step before the U.S. planemaker can begin delivering the airplanes to Ryanair.
The FAA said the 737-8200 incorporates all of the design improvements that were part the 20-month review of the 737 MAX that led to the ungrounding of the MAX in November, more than a year after two fatal crashes killed 346 people.
Ryanair first ordered the 737-8200 plane, which seats 197 passengers, in 2014. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency still must approve the aircraft, a move that could come soon after the FAA approval.
Boeing said Wednesday it would ""continue to work with global regulators to safely return the 737-8 and -9 to service. Our teams are also focused on ensuring future members of the 737 family meet all regulatory requirements.""
In December, Ryanair - Europe's largest airline - said it was is placing a firm order for 75 additional 737 MAX 8200 planes, a higher-passenger capacity version of the 737-8 MAX.
Ryanair Group Chief Executive Michael O’Leary said last week the airline expected to receive eight of the MAX aircraft in April, another eight in May and none in June.

Ryanair is the launch customer for the 737-8 variant after the carrier placed its first order for 100 airplanes and 100 options in late 2014, followed by firm orders of 10 airplanes in 2017 and 25 in 2018. Ryanair did not immediately comment late Wednesday.

Even so, the oil giant probably returned to profit after four straight losses. Rebounding oil and natural gas prices increased earnings by as much as $2.7 billion while improved refining and chemical margins added up to $1.1 billion, the Irving, Texas-based company said Wednesday in a filing.
The Arctic blast in Texas wreaked havoc on gas and power markets, minting winners and losers among energy suppliers. Electricity retailers including  Just Energy Group  (NYSE:JE) Inc. and Griddy Energy LLC declared bankruptcy, while oil producer California Resources (NYSE:CRC) Corp. said its gas trading business generated a profit as a result of the storm.
Exxon was forced to shut or reduce runs at its large refining and petrochemical plants along the Gulf Coast but the filing on Wednesday showed that its oil and gas production facilities also suffered substantial reductions in earnings.
The company suffered its first annual loss in four decades last year and Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods is aiming to repair relations with investors by holding capital spending and production near 20-year lows to maximize cash flow and protect its $15 billion-a-year dividend.
Exxon is due to report first-quarter earnings in four to five weeks and will face a shareholder vote on an activist investor’s proposal to reconstitute its board and change strategy toward the end of May. The company this year appointed three new directors to better equip the board through the energy transition.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou’s arrest was valid, but her ongoing detainment is illegal, defense lawyers told a Canadian court on Wednesday, in a slight deviation from China’s official stance on the case.
Meng, 49, was arrested in December 2018 at Vancouver International Airport on a warrant from the United States, where she faces charges of bank fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s business dealings in Iran.
She maintains her innocence and is fighting extradition while under house arrest in Vancouver.
Huawei lawyers have argued that Meng's actions were so far removed from the United States that the country has no legitimate jurisdiction over them.
Prosecutors representing the Canadian government have argued in court that Canada had no choice but to arrest Meng under treaty obligations to the United States, given that there was an outstanding warrant for her arrest.
Defense lawyer Gib van Ert said on Wednesday that he agreed Canada had to arrest Meng, ""having received what was, on its face, a bona fide extradition request.""
But he said her continued detainment was illegal.
“There’s nothing about it that is an arbitrary detention, but ... it is now revealed to be an unlawful detention,” van Ert said, pointing to the defense allegation that the United States broke international law by requesting her arrest.
China has said that it considers Meng's arrest and possible extradition illegal. In the aftermath of her being detained, China arrested two Canadians on charges of espionage, which Canada has said it sees as retaliation.

Meng's case is set to conclude in May.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose on Wednesday, boosted by gains in technology shares, and the three major Wall Street indexes registered their fourth straight quarterly rise as investors positioned themselves for President Joe Biden's massive infrastructure plan. 
Bets on a strong economic rebound supported Wall Street during the quarter even as jitters cropped up over GameStop (NYSE:GME) and a retail trading frenzy, a spike in Treasury yields and a U.S. hedge fund going bust. 
On Wednesday, the benchmark S&P 500 reached an intra-day record high but stopped short of hitting 4,000 and pared gains late in the day. The S&P 500 technology index led sector gains, while the energy sector fell and was the weakest sector on the day.
""The trend we're seeing today is investors rotating back into growth-oriented names that have gotten a little bit beaten up over the past few weeks or so due to underlying rotation toward the economic reopening stocks,"" said Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at RDM Financial Group at Hightower in Westport, Connecticut.
Some cyclical sectors could also be taking a breather from their rise because of recent strength in the dollar, he said.
For the quarter, the Nasdaq underperformed the other two major indexes as investors swapped growth-oriented stocks with underpriced shares deemed to benefit most from a full economic reopening. High-flying tech names have been hit by a surge in U.S. 10-year bond yields.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 85.41 points, or 0.26%, to 32,981.55, the S&P 500 gained 14.34 points, or 0.36%, to 3,972.89 and the Nasdaq Composite added 201.48 points, or 1.54%, to 13,246.87.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. markets watchdog official on Wednesday warned dealmakers in the frothy blank-check market to follow the regulatory demands associated with special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, amid concerns over problems with the capital-raising scheme. 
The acting chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Paul Munter, urged market participants to be wise in how they select and disclose details of their dealings with SPACs.
""We encourage stakeholders to consider the risks, complexities, and challenges related to SPAC mergers, including careful consideration of whether the target company has a clear, comprehensive plan to be prepared to be a public company,"" he said in a statement.
SPACs are listed shell companies that raise funds to acquire a private company with the purpose of taking it public, allowing such targets to sidestep a traditional initial public offering.
SPACs have surged globally to a record $170 billion this year, outstripping last year's total of $157 billion, Refinitiv data showed.
The boom has been fueled in part by easy monetary conditions as central banks have pumped cash into pandemic-hit economies, while the SPAC structure provides startups with an easier path to go public with less regulatory scrutiny than the traditional IPO route. 
But the frenzy has stirred up some investor skepticism and has also caught the eye of regulators.
Wednesday's SEC statement comes after the agency sent letters to Wall Street banks seeking information on their SPAC dealings, Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-sec-spacs/exclusive-u-s-regulator-opens-inquiry-into-wall-streets-blank-check-ipo-frenzy-sources-idUSL1N2LM3CH last week.
Investors have sued eight companies that combined with SPACs in the first quarter of 2021, according to data compiled by Stanford University. Some of the lawsuits allege the SPACs and their sponsors, who reap huge paydays once a SPAC combines with its target, hid weaknesses ahead of the transactions.

The SEC may be worried about how much due diligence is performed by SPACs before acquiring assets, and about disclosures to investors, analysts said.

While the number of deals was up only 6% from a year ago, the total value of pending and completed deals rose 93% to $1.3 trillion, the second-biggest quarter on record, according to data provider Refinitiv. 
Dealmakers said a boom in the stock market and low borrowing costs - driven by the Federal Reserve's loose monetary policies - emboldened companies, private equity funds and blank-check acquisition firms to pursue their dream deals. This is despite the global economy's failure to have fully recovered as yet from the virus' financial fallout. 
""This is as robust and broad-based an M&A market as I have witnessed in the last 20 years,"" said Colin Ryan, co-head of Americas M&A at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). ""We are in an environment where assets are scarcer than the available capital right now."" 
Dealmaking surged in most sectors of the economy, especially the technology industry, which is positioning for big changes in cloud computing and collaboration spurred on by the shift to remote working. 
Real estate was the only sector to record a major slump in M&A activity, as offices and other types of commercial property became less appealing to buyers.
""We are still in an uncertain world. The first half will look pretty strong in M&A but in the kind of world today, it takes a brave soul to forecast a $4 trillion-plus market for the year,"" said Mark Shafir, global co-head of M&A at Citi. 
Around half the deal activity came from United States where volumes were up 160% year on year at $654.1 billion. 
The Asia Pacific region, excluding central Asia, was up 44.9% at $206.5 billion.
In contrast, M&A activity in Europe was up 24.5% year on year at $277.3 billion, as mega-deals became more difficult to negotiate with the French government blocking a proposed 16.2 billion euro takeover of European retailer Carrefour SA (OTC:CRRFY) by Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard in January.
""This year we have seen a continuation of cross-border activity. This is set to continue amidst a more positive business environment with vaccines becoming available, Brexit coming together and sustained low interest rates,"" said Celia Murray, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s head of M&A for the UK which is Europe's biggest M&A market.
Major deals in the quarter included Ireland's AerCap Holdings NV agreeing to buy  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co's aircraft leasing business for more than $30 billion,  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway Ltd clinching a $25 billion deal for U.S. railway Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU), and  National Grid  (LON:NG)'s purchase of WPD, England's largest electricity distribution business, for 7.8 billion pounds ($10.76 billion). 
Overall, volumes of deals worth more than $5 billion totaled $476 billion, up 133% year on year. 
""What you're seeing right now and will see to an even greater extent throughout the year is strategics coming out of hibernation and trying to do the things they've been thinking about for months,"" said Alan Klein, co-head of M&A at Simpson Thacher.
A key factor in getting deals done was sell-side price expectations coming down, making it easier for investors to price assets.
""The valuation gap has narrowed during the pandemic. Both realism and uncertainty have played a part in that,"" said Bob Bishop, global co-chair of DLA Piper's corporate group.
A further catalyst for activity could come from activist investors, which are shareholders in a company agitating for change. In the first quarter, the likes of department store Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS), French food and beverage company Danone SA (OTC:DANOY) and oil giant  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) were subjects of activist campaigns.
""During the pandemic most activists primarily engaged privately behind closed doors and as a result public campaigns were significantly down compared to 2019,"" said Philipp Beck, EMEA M&A head at UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG).
""However, as markets normalize and corporates refocus on strategic portfolio decisions we anticipate more public engagement by activists.""
SPAC ATTACK
With plentiful access to cheap debt, private equity firms jumped on the deal frenzy. Their deals rose 115.8% to $250.6 billion.
""Private equity funds are standing front and centre in the dealmaking arena and driving a strong pipeline of public-to-private transactions,"" said Dwayne Lysaght, JPMorgan's co-head of EMEA M&A.
Supporting M&A in the United States has been a surge in deal activity among special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), which have captured the interest of Wall Street and amateur traders seeking quick profit.
U.S. SPAC M&A volume was $172.3 billion in the first quarter, up 3,000% year on year and almost 75% of the total SPAC deal activity worldwide. 
In many cases, SPACs have emerged as serious competition to private equity bidders.
""It's a different kind of competition since SPACs only want minority stakes and it's certainly a different proposition. But it makes us think that there is a wall of capital out there that is ready to be invested in either minority or majority deals,"" said Patrick Frowein, co-head of EMEA investment banking coverage and advisory at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). 
Dealmakers said the strength of the global economy and state of the markets would dictate whether 2021 will be a record year for dealmaking.
""Current momentum could be derailed by a resurgence of inflation, a resulting increase in interest rates, or declining confidence - but I don't expect this in the near or intermediate term,"" said Peter Weinberg, founding partner and chief executive of Perella Weinberg Partners.

By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed just shy of a record high Wednesday, as technology stocks were back in vogue among traders as a volatile quarter drew to a close.  
The S&P 500 rose 0.36%, to close at 3,972.89, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.26%, or 85 points, the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.5%.
Tech closed the quarter up 2%, recovering from a nearly 9% decline from its February highs, helped by gains on the final day of the quarter as investor appetite for high-flying tech returned ahead of the next round of quarterly reports.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), with latter getting an extra boost following an upgrade from UBS.
Microsoft racked up gains into the close after winning a 10-year contract from the U.S. Army worth a about $22 billion to deliver 120,000 devices based on its HoloLens augmented-reality headset, CNBC reported.
But it wasn't only megacap tech that attracted a wave of buying. Chip stocks climbed nearly 3% led by a jump in Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) as Bernstein talked up the growth prospects for the sector.
Bernstein initiated coverage on Applied Materials at outperform, betting that ""growth trends in the underlying semi market [are] likely to remain positive over the long term.""
Tech did, however, give up some gains late into the close as the U.S. 10-year yield closed at 1.74%, the highest since Jan. 22. 
Consumer discretionary stocks also played a role in pushing the broader market to record intraday highs, powered by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and apparel company Phillips-Van Heusen Corp.
PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH) jumped 6% despite the company reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue late-Tuesday that fell short of Wall Street estimates.
The economic backdrop, meanwhile, continues to spur investor optimism as the economy created 515,000 private jobs last month, just shy of the 550,000 expected, but the gain serves as a good omen for nonfarm payrolls report due Friday.
The economy could potentially be in line to receive another stimulus-led boost as President Joe Biden is set to unveil a $2 trillion two-part stimulus plan later on Wednesday. The first part will focus on infrastructure and clean energy, and a second will be focused on domestic and social issues.
But there are already grumbles from lawmakers on the opposite side of the political aisle, who are wary of further spending -- following $5.7 trillion of Covid-19 relief measures rolled out over the past year -- and are unlikely to back the tax hikes needed to fund the bill. The tax hikes could force corporate America to tighten its built, with some suggesting that stock buybacks and dividends would likely be curtained to absorb the potential tax hit.  
Energy, down nearly 1%, lagged the broader market's advance as oil prices fell below $60 a barrel on fears over global demand after France widen lockdowns nationwide following a spike in Covid-19 hospitalizations. The swing lower in oil comes ahead of OPEC's decision on output quotas for May. Many are expecting no change to output.
Oil prices were also swayed by data showing U.S. weekly inventories slipped by 876,000 barrels last week, confounding economists' forecast for a build of 107,000 barrels."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday dismissed long-running litigation accusing 10 large banks of conspiring to suppress competition in the now $21.2 trillion market for U.S. Treasury securities.
U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan ruled against 21 pension, retirement and benefit funds, as well as unions, banks, individuals, and companies that traded in Treasuries, in the proposed antitrust class action.
The defendants included Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Barclays  (LON:BARC), BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), NatWest Group and UBS, as well as trading platform operator Tradeweb Markets (NASDAQ:TW).
Traders said the 10 banks, which from 2010 to 2014 handled an estimated 75% of Treasury trades through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, used chat rooms to swap confidential customer orders and coordinate strategies, to profit at clients' expense.
They said seven of the banks also conspired to boycott electronic trading platforms that offered ""anonymous"" trading and better prices for clients.
Manipulation allegedly occurred in the ""when-issued"" market, or the period between when auction dates are announced and securities are delivered.
But in a 53-page decision, Gardephe found no plausible direct evidence of an antitrust conspiracy, and said the plaintiffs' statistical analyses were ""no substitute"" for evidence of individual or collective wrongdoing.
""Plaintiffs' statistical analyses are at most a 'plus factor,'"" he wrote. ""But plus factors alone are not sufficient; a plaintiff must also adequately allege parallel conduct. That Plaintiffs have not done.""
The claims date as far back as 2007. Gardephe gave the plaintiffs until April 30 to amend their complaint.
One of the plaintiffs' lawyers, Dan Brockett from Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, said they ""will consider all options to protect the interests of the class.""
The litigation began in July 2015, shortly after news reports that the U.S. Department of Justice was probing possible Treasury manipulation by banks.
Earlier probes into manipulation of the Libor interest rate benchmark and foreign currencies resulted in billions of dollars in criminal and civil penalties for banks worldwide.

The case is In re: Treasuries Securities Auction Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-md-02673.

DETROIT (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday, while announcing the latest North America production cuts at seven assembly plants due to the global chip shortage, that it would provide an update on April 28 to the expected hit to its 2021 profit. 
The U.S. automaker previously said its operating profit this year would be reduced by $1 billion to $2.5 billion. The update to that forecast will be provided when Ford reports first-quarter results on April 28. A spokeswoman declined further comment.
U.S. rival General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) previously said its 2021 profit could be shaved by up to $2 billion due to the chip shortage. 
Earlier on Wednesday, GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson, speaking at a Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) conference, said he still felt comfortable with the company's 2021 profit forecast despite the chip shortage. GM said in February that, including the chip hit, it expected to earn $4.50 to $5.25 a share this year. 

The chip shortage came as North American auto plants were shut for two months during the COVID-19 pandemic last year and chip orders were canceled, and as demand surged from the consumer electronics industry as people worked from home and played video games. That has now left carmakers competing for chips.
Semiconductors are used extensively in cars, including to monitor engine performance, manage steering or automatic windows, and in sensors used in parking and entertainment systems.

Investing.com -- Tech stocks were back in play on Wednesday, shrugging off concerns about rising interest rates as the government prepares to flood the market with a fresh round of spending, this time on infrastructure.
The S&P 500 is close to piercing the historic 4,000 mark, and Nasdaq surged. 
Economic data supports the reopening trade and fuels investor optimism, which is showing up across the market. The economy created 515,000 private jobs last month, which was shy of the 550,000 expected but a positive sign as the government prepares to release its nonfarm jobs report on Friday.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced a $22 billion contract with the U.S. Army.  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) said its vaccine with BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) was effective in children aged 12 to 15, clearing the way for it to ask the government to allow Covid shots for that age cohort before the beginning of school in the fall. 
The U.S. stock market is closed on Friday, leaving Thursday the last day of trading in a shortened holiday week. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Biden’s infrastructure plan puts the focus on energy and materials 
President Biden outlined his $2 trillion infrastructure plan, and it will likely ripple through sectors such as energy, materials and transportation.  Enphase Energy Inc  (NASDAQ:ENPH) rose almost 8% on Wednesday, and Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ:AMAT) jumped nearly 6% to a new 52-week high.
The plan is to spend on modernizing 20,000 miles of roadway, fixing 10,000 bridges, and installing 500,000 electric-vehicle charging stations, among other initiatives.
2. Jobless claims for the week
On Wednesday, ADP said private companies added 515,000 jobs last month. On Thursday, last week’s initial jobless claims are expected to come in around 680,000, about the same as the week before. Continuing claims are expected to be 3.77 million. The data comes out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
3. All eyes on the oil market
On Thursday, the oil cartel will release its decision on May production levels. When OPEC+ met earlier this month on April levels, the Saudis again announced a 1 million-barrel cut and Saudi Oil Minister Abdulaziz sounded genuinely concerned about demand. 
Traders are betting the Saudis will try to clamp down output again by citing Europe’s renewed wave of Covid-19 lockdowns. (France announced additional restrictions late Wednesday). Inventory fell more than expected, according to the government data released Wednesday, but oil has traded cautiously ahead of OPEC’s announcement.

Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told an online business forum he believed a major aircraft subsidy dispute with Europe could be resolved after 16 years of wrangling at the World Trade Organization, but contrasted this with the outlook on China.
""I think politically (China) is more difficult for this administration and it was for the last administration. But we still have to trade with our largest partner in the world: China,"" he told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Aviation Summit.
Noting multiple disputes, he added: ""I am hoping we can sort of separate intellectual property, human rights and other things from trade and continue to encourage a free trade environment between these two economic juggernauts....We cannot afford to be locked out of that market. Our competitor will jump right in.""
Boeing and Airbus each sell about a quarter of their jetliners to China, which has edged past the United States as the world's largest domestic travel market.
Boeing began to face questions over its share of the Chinese market as the United States and China waged an 18-month trade war under former U.S. President Donald Trump.
Beijing increasingly also faces tensions with the West over its treatment of ethnic and religious minorities in Xinjiang, and has warned foreign companies not to step into politics.
China rejects U.S. charges it has committed genocide against Uighur and other Muslims in the remote western region, where activists say more than 1 million are held in internment camps.

By Danilo Masoni and Abhinav Ramnarayan
MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - A dismal London stock market debut for Deliveroo  (LON:ROO), coming on the heels of other lukewarm listings, may be a sign that investors are becoming more discerning when it comes to buying shares in companies that have yet to turn a profit.
Deliveroo, the biggest UK listing in a decade, plunged as much as 31% after trading started on Wednesday, dealing a blow to London's hopes that more technology companies would be lining up to follow suit.
The fate of the food delivery start-up was not an isolated case as investors have become more wary of record high stock market valuations and rising bond yields are fuelling concerns almost everywhere about so-called 'growth' stocks -- companies promising fast growth but often with no profits to speak for.
A quarter of the top 20 equity listings of 2021, ranked by proceeds, are trading at or below their offer price.
Recent market entrants in Europe include Polish e-commerce logistics firm InPost which debuted strongly in Amsterdam but is now trading 10% below its listing price and online reviews platform Trustpilot which listed in London and fell below its offer price on its second trading day. Cloud platform DigitalOcean sank 12% on its Wall Street debut last week.
Earlier on Wednesday, shares of Chinese tech company Bairong slumped 16% on their Hong Kong debut, following tepid secondary listings in the U.S. from Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and video site Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI).
""The wind has turned on all growth stocks,"" Angelo Meda head of equities at Banor SIM in Milan, said, seeing Deliveroo as a classic example of a stock left vulnerable as investors switch to cheaper 'value' stocks geared to benefit from an economic recovery.
Meda said he stayed out of Deliveroo because of valuation and regulatory concerns and blames mis-pricing for the lukewarm performance of some European IPO stocks.
""Pricing has often been opportunistic and in most of the cases funds, managers and companies were selling existing shares, meaning that proceeds did not go to fund any expansion plans,"" he added.
As the vaccination rollout against the global pandemic progresses, investors have turned away from stocks benefiting from social restrictions to hunt out those which might benefit most from the recovery and whose price has been beaten down.
A global index of value stocks -- a category comprising banks, travel and energy among others -- has risen 10% this year relative to growth stocks and scored its best quarter in more than a decade.
Some market entrants from traditional businesses, such as used-car platform AUTO1 in Germany and footwear brand Dr Martens in London, have performed well, trading 28% and 21% respectively above their debut prices.
COOLING APPETITE?
Last year saw high-profile U.S. tech names AirBnB and DoorDash almost double on their first day of trading. As recently as February, UK online retailer Moonpig leapt 25% on its debut.
""The pipeline is very heavy, which is a sign of dynamism. But because it's very crowded, investors are likely to be more selective,"" said Eric Arnould, head of equity capital markets (ECM) for Natixis.
Ankit Gheedia, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY)' head of equity and derivative strategy for Europe reckons the Deliveroo setback won't derail Europe's IPO market because investors are sitting on so much cash and authorities are keen to market their local stock exchanges.
""Overall appetite is there for European regulators to encourage companies to list in Europe,"" Gheedia said.
UK IPO candidates include money transfer start-up Wise and cyber security firm Darktrace, while Dutch tech firm WeTransfer and Swedish payments firm Klarna are poised to issue shares in continental Europe.
The ECM head at another European bank said the Deliveroo fiasco won't stop the market dead in its tracks but could slow the pipeline of future listings and inject some caution after a record IPO year in 2020 when deal value touched $1.1 trillion.
""Quite a few companies were due to push the button for an IPO post-Easter. Now they will have to wait a while at the very least to see how the overall market behaves,"" he said.

(Reuters) - New York's legalization of recreational marijuana could generate $5 billion in sales for the first year and raises pressure on other states to follow the 16 that have now approved the plant for everyday use, the head of one of the country's biggest producers said on Wednesday.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday signed a bill paving the way for recreational sales of marijuana to begin in the state next year, pushing an ETF tracking U.S. pot producers' stocks up more than 6% and on track for its best day since the U.S. presidential election.
Ben Kovler, chief executive officer of Green Thumb Industries (OTC:GTBIF) Inc, the second largest U.S. pot producer by market value, said his company will allocate ""significant dollars"" to the New York market - set to be the second largest legal market after California.
New York could be worth more than $5 billion in just its first year of sales, without including ""cannabis tourism"" from other states, Kovler said in an interview.
""New York is New York, (there) couldn't be a bigger deal,"" Kovler said.
GRAPHIC: Marijuana Legalization by State - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-CANNABIS/jznvnnwwqvl/chart.png
Global X Research analyst Pedro Palandrani estimated that based on Cuomo's forecast of $350 million in cannabis tax revenue, the state's first year sales should top $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion.
In comparison, Colorado crossed $2 billion in total cannabis sales last year after more than five years as a recreational market, according to the state's revenue department's figures.
While the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting lockdowns cut into tax dollars that states earned from sectors like hotels and airlines, the idea of legal cannabis sales offered some hope to plug up battered fiscal budgets across the country.
""What cannabis brings and is now proven is tax revenue of a material nature,"" Kovler said, citing the example of Illinois, which in February collected more tax revenue from cannabis than alcohol.
Five states had legalized recreational marijuana by ballot initiatives during the November presidential election, and New York's move now puts pressure on others like Connecticut, Palandrani said.
Joseph Bayern, CEO of Curaleaf Holdings (OTC:CURLF) Inc, the largest U.S. cannabis company by market value, called New York's legalization a ""significant milestone for the cannabis industry"" and said he now expects Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Maryland would likely follow suit.
""(New York is) a quintessential emerging market, which is huge ... It will have an impact on the way the federal government thinks about legalization,"" said Nicholas Vita, the CEO of New York-based Columbia Care (OTC:CCHWF) Inc.

The effects of New York's legalization will not just be limited to other governors and states, as the financial capital of the world, it also sets ""a really good precedent from a federal point of view too,"" said Charles Bachtell, CEO of Cresco Labs (OTC:CRLBF) Inc.

Consumer discretionary stocks also played a role in pushing the broader market to record intraday highs, powered by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and apparel company Phillips-Van Heusen Corp.
PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH) jumped 6% despite the company reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue late-Tuesday that fell short of Wall Street estimates.
The economic backdrop, meanwhile, continues to spur investor optimism as the economy created 515,000 private jobs last month, just shy of the 550,000 expected, but the gain serves as a good omen for nonfarm payrolls report due Friday.
The economy could potentially be in line to receive another stimulus-led boost as President Joe Biden is set to unveil a $2 trillion two-part stimulus plan later on Wednesday. The first part will focus on infrastructure and clean energy, and a second will be focused on domestic and social issues.
But there are already grumbles from lawmakers on the opposite side of the political aisle, who are wary of further spending -- following $5.7 trillion of Covid-19 relief measures rolled out over the past year -- and are unlikely to back the tax hikes needed to fund the bill.
Energy, down nearly 1%, lagged the broader market's advance as oil prices fell below $60 a barrel on fears over global demand after France widen lockdowns nationwide following a spike in Covid-19 hospitalizations. The swing lower in oil comes ahead of OPEC's decision on output quotas for May. Many are expecting no change to output.
Oil prices were also swayed by data showing U.S. weekly inventories slipped by 876,000 barrels last week, confounding economists' forecast for a build of 107,000 barrels."

Starting next week, users will see new features marking milestone moments, including first-time money deposits, first investments or for sign-ups for Robinhood Gold, its premium membership offering, the online brokerage said in a blog post on Wednesday. 
The move comes weeks after Robinhood's digital confetti animation was criticized on the grounds that the company was ""gamifying"" investing. 
The Silicon Valley unicorn startup, which was at the heart of the historic retail trading frenzy earlier this year, is currently being probed by U.S. regulators for imposing temporary trading curbs on so-called ""meme stocks"".
During a congressional hearing in February, Robinhood's co-founder, Vlad Tenev, pushed back against criticism of the ""meme"" stock frenzy from investor Warren Buffett's longtime partner, Charlie Munger, who compared it to betting on horse races.
During the Feb. 18 hearing, lawmakers slammed what they called the firm's ""gamification"" of stock trading on mobile phones through things such as virtual confetti celebration following a big trade.
""We don't believe in gamification,"" Tenev had said at the time.
Robinhood's platform allows users to make unlimited commission-free trades in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options and cryptocurrencies. 

Earlier this month, the company confidentially filed paperwork with regulators for an initial public offering in the United States.

Investing.com – Coursera  (NYSE:COUR) shares jumped 18% in their debut on the NYSE Wednesday, as investors predict the online education disruptor has a bright future in a post-pandemic world.
The initial public offering priced 15.73 million shares at $33 each. The surge gives the edtech company a market capitalization of $5.3 billion.
 Coursera  was launched in 2012 by Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, both Stanford computer science professors. It is now one of the largest online learning platforms in the world, with 77 million registered learners. Coursera works with over 200 leading university and industry partners to offer a broad catalog of content and credentials.
While the California-based company has been a big disruptor in a space where trust and pedigree play an important role, Covid-19 accelerated the adoption of digital learning. Coursera is expected to play a big role in higher-level premium education as students turn away from expensive options and embrace more flexible and affordable learning.

Firms including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp and  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) have recently announced they are betting on bitcoin, as the wider adoption of the cryptocurrency for settling transactions and investments gathers pace. 
The move by Goldman, reported by CNBC earlier on Wednesday, comes days after a report that rival  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) had started offering clients investments to the emerging asset class. 
CNBC reported that Goldman would ultimately offer investments in bitcoin and digital assets that would include the physical bitcoin, derivatives or traditional investment vehicles. (https://cnb.cx/3u6VXEA)
A spokesperson for the bank confirmed the details of the report, which cited an interview with Mary Rich, the global head of digital assets for Goldman's private wealth management division. 
Reuters reported earlier this month that Goldman had restarted its cryptocurrency trading desk and that it was also exploring possibilities for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.
The rising interest in the cryptocurrency comes after Tesla revealed in February that it had bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin, helping drive the cryptocurrency to record highs and breach $1 trillion in market capitalization for the first time. 

The digital currency, however, remains highly volatile.

Investing.com -- The owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger rose 5% with a largely rosy outlook for 2021.
PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH). said it expects international businesses to exceed 2019 pre-pandemic revenue levels in the first half of the year as it cuts its global workforce and real estate footprint, which should result in an improvement for gross margins.The company missed sales and profit estimates for the fourth quarter as lockdowns were extended and the need to look smart and sharp fell out the window. Revenue of $2.09 billion was 20% lower than a year earlier, and below the analyst consensus of $2.12 billion. A loss per share of 38 cents was worse than the expected loss of 32 cents.
But with vaccinations increasing and post-pandemic plans being made, the company sees a much brighter future. It's also planning to be more aggressive in reducing promotional selling to help support margins. The company will close more stores and offices in addition to a previously announced 12% reduction in its North America office workforce.
“We remain focused on connecting our core strengths to where the consumer is going – with our biggest brands Calvin Klein and TOMMY HILFIGER, in how we are super charging e-commerce, through our casual assortments, and how we are taking market share in our international businesses,"" said Chief Executive Officer Stefan Larsson in a statement. ""As we look forward, we will increasingly continue to shift our business globally towards these channels and categories. In addition, we executed disciplined expense management, significantly improved our inventory position, and ended the year with over $3 billion in liquidity.""
Current European lockdowns and a slow return to international tourism will keep sales lower until the end of the year, but revenue should increase as much as 24% compared to 2020. 
PVH projects that 2021 earnings per share will be approximately $6 compared to a loss per share of $1.97 in 2020. For the first quarter, revenue should increase up to 44% compared to the prior year period and profit should range from 80 cents to 83 cents compared to a loss of $3.03 per share a year earlier.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in Deliveroo plunged by as much as 30% in their trading debut on Wednesday, slicing more than 2 billion pounds off the company's valuation in a blow to Britain's ambitions to attract fast-growing tech companies to the London market.
The highly-anticipated listing, the biggest on the London market in a decade, had been hailed by finance minister Rishi Sunak as a ""true British tech success story"" that could clear the way for more initial public offerings (IPO) by technology companies.
But the debut had already been overshadowed as some of Britain's biggest investment companies shunned the listing, citing concerns about gig-economy working conditions and the share structure.
Deliveroo founder Will Shu is retaining his 6.3% stake, but will have 57.5% of the voting rights of the company for three years; a structure that meant the company could not obtain a premium listing that gives companies access to the main FTSE indices. 
The 390 pence price tag gave an overall valuation of 7.6 billion pounds ($10.46 billion) at the bottom of a target range. 
Within minutes of the market opening on Wednesday, it lost 2.28 billion pounds of its value, which equity capital markets bankers said could undermine the market for some IPOs in Britain and Europe.
Fabian de Smet, head of investment banking at Berenberg, called it a ""sector problem"". 
""Investors are turning away from the work-at-home play and putting their money into the economic recovery play. Deliveroo got caught in the middle of a huge rotation. It was the last IPO of the old COVID world,"" he said. 
Having hit a low of 271 pence, the stock recovered slightly to close the day at 287.45 pence. It was still down 26.3%, making it the worst first-day performance for a sizeable London IPO - above 1 billion pounds - on record, markets platform Dealogic said. 
Shares often rebound during their market debuts as the managing banks make use of the over-allotment, or greenshoe - a percentage of the offer reserved to stabilise the price. 
Deliveroo customers, who were allocated 50 million pounds of shares, are only able to trade on April 7, when unconditional trading begins. 
Finance minister Sunak said he was not embarrassed by the plunge in the shares, saying: ""Gosh, no... share prices go up, share prices go down.""
AMSTERDAM HIGH
The stock's fall follows a poor run for many growth stocks. Its main peers Just Eat Takeaway.com and Delivery Hero have fallen around 12% each in the past month. 
U.S. peer Doordash - which doubled in value on its stock market debut last year - has fallen as much as 40% over the last month. 
But those stocks have steadied in the last two sessions, and the Amsterdam stock exchange hit a record high on Wednesday, led by tech stocks. 
Graphic: Deliveroo shares plunge in market debut https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmoparaanva/DeliverooTHIS%20ONE.png
PANDEMIC BOOM
Deliveroo's self-employed drivers have seen a boom in demand during the pandemic, bringing food from otherwise-shuttered restaurants to house-bound customers. 
But the Amazon-backed company has been running at a hefty loss; it said it narrowed an underlying loss to 223.7 million pounds ($308.93 million), from 317.3 million pounds in 2019. 
Irrespective of profitability, there has been a clamour for growth companies over the last year as the COVID-19 crisis has pushed interest rates and government bond yields to all-time lows. 
But with U.S. Treasury yields rising, this trade has lost allure and many tech stocks on both sides of the Atlantic have fallen in recent weeks, leading to questions over inflated valuations. 
""That comes back to the issue that how could a company that was valued at 3 billion (pounds) in November, 5 billion in January, be magically worth 8-9 billion in March - particularly when, according to its own statements, it was potentially in need of emergency funding last year,"" Russ Mould, Investment Director at AJ Bell, said. 
The listing of the London-based company, founded in 2013, is London's biggest IPO since Glencore (OTC:GLNCY)'s in May 2011 and also the biggest tech float yet on the London Stock Exchange.
The heavyweight investors that stayed away included Aberdeen  Standard Life  (LON:SLA),  Aviva  (LON:AV), Legal & General Investment Management and M&G.
""The number of institutions lining up to say no on ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) grounds always looked like it was going to make it a tricky debut,"" said James Athey, investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JP Morgan are leading the deal, while Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citi, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) and Numis are also part of the syndicate of banks managing the transaction.

Baird analyst Craig Kennison bumped the stock to a buy-equivalent from neutral, and raised its price target to $45 from $38, according to StreetInsider and Briefing.com. 
""We like the strategic direction led by a proven leader and expect investors to get behind the change narrative embedded in The Hardwire (2021-2025 plan),"" Kennison wrote in a note. ""We see the potential for retail to turn positive in 2021 for the first time since 2014 – and note that lean dealer inventory should fuel a healthy replenishment cycle.""
It's been a bumpy road for the motorcycle maker, with shares hitting their lowest in over a decade at the outset of the pandemic. The company named a new chief executive officer in May and said mid-2020 that it would cut 700 positions globally as part of a major organizational overhaul to bring the brand back to relevance.  
That seemed to be taking effect as the company reported a blowout quarter for the period ended in September, only to disappoint the market for the subsequent quarter, reporting an unexpected loss and underwhelming sales. 
Kennison is one of four analysts who say buy the stock, while five say hold. HOG has no sell ratings.

Instead the stock-market debut of  Deliveroo Holdings  PLC (LON:ROO), an eight-year-old business backed by none other than Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., flopped Wednesday in a sharp blow to the City’s latest ambitions.
A more than 30% slump following the initial public offering was caused by concerns over labor practices, as well as a recent drop in investor appetite for the technology sector. The company’s decision to have a dual-class structure, which gives outsized voting rights for its founder Will Shu, didn’t help, and was criticized by Legal & General Investment Management, the U.K.’s biggest asset manager.
The washout has dented London’s efforts to cast itself as a high-growth listings hub, casting a shadow over a record first quarter for IPOs and proposed changes to make the U.K. more attractive for tech offerings. So far, the City has been losing unicorns to New York’s deeper pool of investors.
If the U.K. doesn’t change how it perceives businesses that are not yet profitable, it “will keep losing valuable businesses to the U.S. – and along with it the investment, the intellectual capital and wider growth of the ecosystem,” said Manish Madhvani, managing partner of GP Bullhound LLP, a tech investment firm.
Deliveroo’s IPO Debacle Is a Bad Look for London: Alex Webb
Tech founders generally prefer listing in the U.S. due to rules that give them greater control over their companies even after they’ve gone public. To level the playing field, the U.K. is looking at allowing dual-class structures on the premium listing segment of the London Stock Exchange, where they are currently prohibited.
But dual-class shares remain a contentious issue in London. Large money managers have pushed back against the structure, saying it runs afoul of corporate governance norms.
The U.K. is also losing startups to deep-pocketed U.S. special purpose acquisition vehicles. Arrival Ltd., a London-based maker of electric vans and buses that counts BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). among its biggest investors, started trading in New York last week after combining with a blank-check firm. Cazoo Ltd. said earlier this week it will list in the U.S. after selling itself to hedge-fund founder Dan Och’s SPAC in a deal valued at $7 billion, turning its back on a potential IPO in London.
All is not lost. Some large deals are waiting in the wings. DNA sequencing firm Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd, another homegrown U.K. unicorn, on Tuesday said it plans to list in the City in the second half of the year.

(Reuters) -Delta Air Lines said on Wednesday it will stop blocking middle seats as of May 1, a move that will allow it to start selling more tickets on each flight at a time when travel demand is picking up as more Americans receive COVID-19 vaccines.
Atlanta-based Delta is now the only U.S. airline still limiting seat capacity on all the cabins of its planes to give passengers more space during the pandemic, though studies have shown that the risk of COVID-19 transmission in flight is low if everyone wears a mask.
The move comes as Delta has faced calls for a boycott over its stance on new voting restrictions passed last week in the state of Georgia, where it is one of the largest employers.
Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian had praised aspects of the Republican-backed law but on Wednesday took a tougher stand against it.
""I need to make it crystal clear that the final bill is unacceptable and does not match Delta’s values,"" Bastian said in a memo to employees.
Delta's decision to lift the middle seat block came alongside a series of other announcements, including the resumption of onboard snack and beverage service starting April 14.

The airline is also extending the validity of tickets expiring in 2021, and those bought this year, through the end of 2022, it said.
Shares of Delta were down 1.4% in morning trade, broadly in line with losses on the Dow Jones U.S. Airlines Index (DJUSAR).

A move into electric vehicles could result in at least $14 a share for Apple, since, despite the rumors, it's not priced in now, Vogt wrote in a note. The base case for the Apple car is for it to capture 8% of the global market in 10 years with operating margins around 15%.
Additionally, UBS found that Apple stock jumps in the six months ahead of a September new iPhone launch, up 15% versus 5% for the S&P 500 index. In the six months after the launch, the share price return is closer to 7%. 
“We believe aggregate iPhone demand in FY21 and FY22 should be relatively stable in-line with historic demand trends,"" Vogt said. ""We modestly raise our FY21 iPhone estimate by 5M (~2.3%) to 220M reflecting better 5G demand in China."" 
Apple is down about 15% since late January, when it hit an all-time high. The $2 trillion company had its best quarter ever for the period ended in December, raking in more than $111 billion and reporting profit of $1.68. Demand for Apple products remains positive, the analyst said, notably in China with 5G. 
Vogt raised revenue and profit expectations for the next two years on steady demand, and bumped the price target to $142 from $114.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is facing pressure from Democrats to revive tougher scrutiny of hedge funds and other large pools of capital as she heads her first meeting of the premier grouping of U.S. financial regulators on Wednesday.
The meltdown of leveraged hedge fund Archegos Capital Management this week, which inflicted losses on  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Nomura and other intermediaries, gives the Financial Stability Oversight Council fresh evidence to review.
The council, led by Treasury and including heads of the Fed, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other major financial regulators, is scheduled to meet at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT) to privately discuss hedge fund activity and the performance of open-end mutual funds during the coronavirus pandemic.
It also will hold a rare public session to discuss financial system risks from climate change for the first time. 
Archegos' failure to meet margin calls is the third significant market episode in the space of a year involving faltering hedge funds or open-end mutual funds.
Thus far, the damage from the Archegos incident has been limited to a handful of stocks, including ViaComCBS Inc and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc, but concerns are rising that trillions of dollars in government coronavirus aid will fuel more market risk-taking.
""Archegos is a potential canary in the coal mine because this came out of nowhere,"" said Gregg Gelzinis, associate director of economic policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress in Washington. 
""Is there another fund that's larger, that's more leveraged with the same characteristics that could prove to be a more systemic event? That's the major concern right now.""
FSOC BACKTRACKED UNDER MNUCHIN 
Former Treasury Secretary Jack Lew used the FSOC from 2014 to 2016 to focus on risks posed by hedge funds and asset managers, forming a working group https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl0431.aspx to study their use of leverage. Yellen, an FSOC member as Fed chair, backed these initiatives.
The fund leverage working group was abandoned by President Donald Trump's Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. The FSOC also weakened rules on the designation of nonbank financial institutions as systemically important.
Gelzinis said that a good FSOC start for Yellen would be to revive the Treasury working group on hedge fund leverage.
The Treasury declined to comment further on the agenda for Wednesday's meeting, which was issued last week, before news of the Archegos downfall broke.
Yellen said at her confirmation hearing in January that she still thought that studying leverage was worth pursuing, citing the market problem experienced last March.
""This is an activities-based approach that FSOC is pursuing and I thought that was the right approach and I would want to look again at some of those approaches,"" Yellen said.
Last week, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat and long-time critic of Wall Street, pressed Yellen on whether she would designate BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and other big asset managers as systemically important financial institutions. 
Yellen said it was ""important to look very carefully"" at the risks posed by these firms, but again backed scrutiny of market activities over company-based designations. 
Mark Sobel, a former Treasury and International Monetary Fund official, said that Yellen, as FSOC chair, needs to make clear to regulators what ""activities-based"" supervision they should apply to hedge funds and asset managers. 

Yellen ""needs to use the bully pulpit of the FSOC to drill down on these issues and compel the relevant regulatory authorities to act,"" Sobel added.

The company saw its products roll off supermarket shelves as shoppers stockpiled essential staples ahead of curfews and lockdowns to stem the spread of COVID-19. 
The company makes several pulp-based products including Cottonelle toilet paper, Kleenex facial tissue and Kotex feminine hygiene products.
 Kimberly Clark  said the price increases, in the mid-to-high single digits, will start from late June and impact the company's baby and child care, adult care and Scott bathroom tissue businesses.
Last year, sales rose to nearly $20 billion, but higher manufacturing costs also led to a surge in input costs. 
Most consumer product companies have been pressured by recent increases in cost of raw materials such as pulp, recycled fiber and resins, even as hygiene and cleaning products remain in demand despite easing of coronavirus-related restrictions.

Pulpmakers have also raised prices for hardwood pulp and forecast rising global demand for tissues and toilet papers.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in Nomura and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) fell further on Wednesday, with a collective $9 billion wiped off their market value so far this week as the banks braced for big losses from the blow-up of U.S.-based hedge fund Archegos Capital.
Credit Suisse and Nomura were slower than rivals to cut their exposure to Archegos, a family office run by former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang. Global lenders that acted as brokers for Archegos may have to write down more $6 billion after the fund defaulted on payments, Reuters has reported.
Credit Suisse shares fell 4% on Wednesday, bringing this week's decline to nearly 20%. Already under pressure from its exposure to failed supply chain finance firm Greensill, Credit Suisse's plans to buy back shares and pay dividends this year could now be at risk, analysts said.
The bank's market capitalisation has shrunk by five billion Swiss francs since Friday to 25.57 billion Swiss francs ($27.12 billion). Sources estimate Credit Suisse's losses may total $5 billion but the bank declined to comment.
UBS analysts said ""a lot of unanswered questions"" remained, referring to Credit Suisse's involvement first in Greensill and now the U.S.-based hedge fund. 
""Outflows? P&L impact? Insurance coverage? Quality of underlying assets? Litigation? Developments around involved partners? Reputational impact? Impact on strategy?"" they wrote.
Meanwhile Nomura which has warned of a $2 billion hit from Archegos, fell a further 2.9% following a 0.8% fall on Japanese stock markets on Wednesday. Its market capitalisation has dropped from 2.3 trillion yen ($20.81 billion) to 1.88 trillion yen since Friday, Refinitiv data shows. 
Ratings agencies added to the pressure as Moody's (NYSE:MCO) slashed its outlook on Nomura to ""negative"", citing potential deficiencies in its risk management process.
Fitch placed Nomura's viability ratings on ""negative watch"" citing the potential for material losses arising from transactions with a U.S. client in one of its U.S. subsidiaries as well as questions over the adequacy of Nomura's controls.
Meanwhile, in derivatives markets the cost of insuring exposure to Credit Suisse and Nomura rose. 
Credit Suisse five-year credit defaults swaps (CDS) were trading at 73 basis points, the highest in a year and up 17 bps from Friday's close, IHS Markit data showed.
That implies a cost of 73,000 Swiss francs a year to insure exposure to 10 million francs worth of Credit Suisse debt for a five-year period. 
Nomura CDS were at 52 bps, versus 41 bps on Friday.

Investing.com – BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) shares fell a sharp 9% Wednesday after the company’s February quarter revenue came in below expectations.
BlackBerry matched estimates with adjusted quarterly earnings of 3 cents per share. But revenue of $210 million for the quarter was down 25% from a year ago. The net loss of $315 million was more than seven times from a year ago.
The company blamed its ongoing negotiations for a potential sale of a part of its portfolio for the dip in revenue.
The sale involves part of the patent portfolio relating primarily to mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking, the company said.
The takeaways from the earnings announcement impressed Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley, who upgraded BlackBerry to hold from sell, revising its target for the stock to $9. 
Should the sale of its licensing business happen, it could help unlock value and provide a capital infusion to drive accelerated software and services growth, Walkley said in a note. He expects software and services fundamentals to improve.

Investing.com -- .U.S. stocks opened higher on Wednesday after payrolls processor ADP registered a jump in private-sector hiring March, reassuring participants that the U.S. economy is starting to put its Covid-19 nightmare behind it. 
ADP said 517,000 private-sector jobs were created in the month through mid-March, less than the 550,000 expected but still almost three times February's number and a clear sign of life in a service sector that accounts for most of the current 10 million-job shortfall in the economy, measured against pre-pandemic levels. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 87 points, or 0.3%, at 33,154 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.0%.
The market was generally quiet ahead of a major policy speech by President Joe Biden, who is expected to unveil a $2 trillion infrastructure spending plan later. Of especial interest will be the scope of plans to broaden and accelerate the clean energy transition, with all that that implies for the energy and transport sectors. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock rose 3.3% in anticipation and Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) stock rose 6.6%.
Broadband access and water systems are two other focus areas of the speech, according to various reports.
Long-term interest rates, in the form of bond yields, have risen markedly since Biden secured control of both houses of Congress in January, in anticipation of a wave of deficit spending to support the economy. The 10-Year Treasury yield was stable at around 1.72% on Wednesday, having hit a 2021 high of 1.77% on Tuesday. 
Rising interest rates were once again reflected in a fourth straight fall in mortgage applications last week, which were down 2.2% from a week earlier. Not only have refinancing rates gone up, but prices are also rising at their fastest pace in a decade, according to data released on Tuesday. Pending home sales, meanwhile, fell by over 10% in February, the biggest drop since May.
Among individual movers, Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) stock regained its mojo with the biggest gain in months - some 10% - after posting solid guidance and better-than-expected earnings, driven by wider operating margins.   Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) went the other way after publishing disappointingly vague guidance, the yogawear maker's stock slipping 5.1%.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) will set strict business criteria for ventures it backs under a new private partnership initiative to help diversify the kingdom's oil-reliant economy and was not being pushed into projects by the state, the CEO said.
His comments in an interview on Wednesday came a day after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced the new Shareek (Partner) initiative, in which the state-controlled oil giant and petrochemical firm SABIC would lead private sector investments worth 5 trillion riyals ($1.3 trillion) by 2030.
The new programme is part of efforts to mobilise private investment in the world's biggest oil exporter, helping the kingdom diversify away from crude sales that still generate more than half the state's income.
""You can look at Shareek as a catalyst in making Saudi Arabia even more compelling as an investment destination for both local and foreign investors,"" Aramco Chief Executive Amin Nasser told Reuters.
The government has not spelled out how the programme will work in detail, but Nasser said private companies would seek incentives from the government - whether infrastructure, fiscal or regulatory support - and Aramco would determine whether to back a project as a partner.
""This is a voluntary programme. It's on the private sector to bring these projects, to ask for incentives,"" he said.
He promised Aramco's shareholders, who include a small minority of private investors since the company began trading on the stock exchange in December 2019, that the firm would set prudent capital allocation and cost criteria.
But Nasser said it was too early to say how the new programme would affect Aramco's dividend and investment plans.
The crown prince said the government had asked the biggest firm's participating in the programme to lower their dividends to raise capital spending, although he said dividends for those owning shares in Aramco would remain stable.
The new programme has raised some investor concerns that Aramco might start building stadiums or launch other infrastructure projects unrelated to its energy business, mirroring its activities in earlier years of Saudi Arabia's oil boom.
But Nasser said the government, which still owns 98% of the company since its initial public offering, was not pushing Aramco to take part in specific projects.
""There is nothing about the government asking for this or that,"" he said when asked if Aramco was shifting towards becoming more of a conglomerate than an energy-focused business.
He said the programme would allow Aramco to improve its supply chains and the profitability of some of its energy projects, which in turn would make it more attractive for Aramco's international partners to invest in the kingdom.

""We will bring each project as a unique case, and I'm sure like other companies we will have specific details that will be discussed with the committee in charge of granting these incentives,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said Wednesday that it will build a battery-based renewable energy storage facility in Central California near a solar energy installation that already provides energy for all of its facilities in the state.
Apple said the project will store 240 megawatt-hours of energy, or enough to power more than 7,000 homes for one day. It is located next to the California Flats solar installation in southeastern Monterey County, about 100 miles southeast of Apple's Cupertino, California headquarters.
The site sends 130-megawatts of electricity directly to Apple's California facilities during daylight hours but does not provide power during dark hours. Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, told Reuters in an interview the company intends to develop what it believes will be one of the largest battery-based storage systems in the United States.
""The challenge with clean energy - solar and wind - is that it's by definition intermittent,"" Jackson told Reuters. ""If we can do it, and we can show that it works for us, it takes away the concerns about intermittency and it helps the grid in terms of stabilization. It's something that can be imitated or built upon by other companies.""
Jackson said that Apple plans to share its findings from building the project with other companies, but said it was too early to say precisely how it would do so. Apple has other projects where it has shared environmental technology developments, including an aluminum smelting joint venture in Canada and an Apple recycling technology lab in Texas.

Apple on Wednesday also said that 110 of its suppliers are now moving to using clean energy for the work they do for Apple, with about 8 gigawatts of clean energy production planned as a result, or what Apple said was the equivalent of removing 3.4 million cars from the road. The figure is an increase from last year when Apple said 70 of its suppliers had made the transition to clean energy for Apple work when it set a goal to eliminate carbon emissions from its supply chain by 2030.

(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) rolled out its new Crispy Chicken Sandwich in February. Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) Co is selling Crispy Chicken Nuggets. And chains like  Shake Shack Inc  (NYSE:SHAK) are known for having some of the fast-food industry's crispiest french fries. 
With delivery and to-go orders soaring during the pandemic, marketing ""crisp"" is risky if the food arrives at consumers' homes limp and listless. In a quest to keep the crunch as long as possible, many chains are tweaking their recipes, trying different additives, formulations, cooking techniques and temperatures.
Delivery orders at U.S. restaurants were 154% higher in January 2021 than they were a year earlier, according to data analytics firm The NPD Group/CREST. 
Delivery comprised 12% of all restaurant orders in January 2021, versus just 5% a year prior. A chicken-fingers-and-fries combo was the top food item ordered for delivery in 2020 by third-party delivery service DoorDash Inc.
But crispier food can cost more. A 30-pound box of the cheapest french-fries can run about $12 to $15 wholesale to restaurants, according to Barry Friends, a partner at food industry consultant Pentallect. Top tier fries made with drier, higher-quality potatoes and sealants can run up to $45 a box. 
White Castle, with roughly 375 locations, is ""testing a different fry to see if we can get something that does hold up longer, stays crispier,"" Chief Operations Officer Jeff Carper told Reuters. Starting late last year, the chain tested a new fry which costs more than its current fries, at about 60 locations through New York and New Jersey, he said. 
One McDonald's franchisee told Reuters its fries stay fresh about seven minutes after coming out of the fryer. ""We have a lot of work to do here"" to make food that travels better, the franchisee said. ""Delivery business is growing leaps and bounds."" 
In a March video review of new fried chicken sandwiches from major chains, Restaurant Business magazine editor-in-chief Jonathan Maze said McDonald's Crispy Chicken sandwich is ""not as crisp as the name would have you believe,"" though he thought it was ""a very nicely done piece of chicken."" 
Two suppliers to McDonald's - both of which also supply other chains - told Reuters in early February that McDonald's was trying new formulations for breading, hoping to devise a coating that can help its chicken patties stay crunchy longer.
The world's largest restaurant chain denied that any such ""official tests"" for were underway for its chicken or fries, but noted that it did introduce foil pouches to keep its new chicken sandwiches fresher for longer.
Potato processor Lamb Weston Holdings (NYSE:LW) Inc, which sells fries to McDonald's and KFC-owner Yum Brands Inc, markets ""Crispy on Delivery"" fries developed in 2018, that it claims have a ""revolutionary coating."" The company told Reuters it has seen restaurants' demand for them quadruple in the three months to Jan. 31 from a year earlier.
Lamb Weston also provides chains with store-to-door training on keeping fries crispy until they reach customers' homes. 
""With so much riding on takeout and delivery, it's important your fries perform perfectly every time,"" Lamb Weston said in an advertisement in March targeting restaurants. 
Ingredion (NYSE:INGR) Inc, which makes sweeteners and starches for sale to restaurants, told Reuters it developed a crispy outer coating for french fries that keeps oil from penetrating the potato upon frying and helps the potato retain moisture without getting slimy after delivery.
Such tactics helped Ingredion extend fry ""freshness"" to between 10 and 25 minutes, up from five minutes previously, ""with a marginal but livable, reduction in crispiness,"" Greg Aloi, vice president of Ingredion's Customer Co-Creation & Innovation, claimed to Reuters. 
Similarly, rival ingredient maker Kerry Group, said it was working on how to control gels on french fries, a byproduct of frying. 
""We had to understand the dynamics of the change in temperature over a longer time and...looking at how that gel needs to set up on the structure and how it will act over time from store to customer,"" said Albert McQuaid, chief innovation officer at the Ireland-based group.
As for chicken patties, major chains increasingly use flours made from plants such as fava beans and chickpeas to increase the crunchy texture, the two restaurant suppliers told Reuters. 
Chains also add more starch and hydrocolloid-based gums such as xanthan and guar gum to retain the structure of the coating for longer, the suppliers said. 

Friends, of Pentallect, said the smartest restaurants are now focused on this issue ""because traveling food has now become a much, much more important part of the entire food service equation.""

The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average and the broad-based S&P 500 index have both had good months, gaining almost 7% and 5% respectively, on expectations of a broad economic recovery helped by substantial fiscal and monetary stimuli and a strong Covid-19 vaccine rollout. 
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has had less success, gaining just over 2% while being pressured by rising interest rates. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield notched a 14-month high of 1.77% on Tuesday, although this has slipped by to 1.73%.
Investors are awaiting details on President Joe Biden’s plan to revitalize U.S. infrastructure later Wednesday, including the size of the total package and what measures will be taken to fund it.
Ahead of this the ADP Research Institute releases its report on private payrolls for March at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT).  The number will likely show a significant pickup in hiring as lockdowns ease and weather improves, with expectations for a gain of 550,000, a significant jump from February’s 171,000 increase. This will act as a curtain raiser for Friday's official employment report for March.
In corporate news, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) reports results for the first time under new CEO Rosalind Brewer, while the likes of  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) and Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) will also be in focus after they reported earnings after the bell on Tuesday.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) will also be in the spotlight after the U.S. drugmaker announced that its coronavirus vaccine was 100% effective in preventing Covid-19 in kids aged 12 to 15 after a late stage clinical trial.
Oil prices slipped Wednesday ahead of Thursday’s meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, which is set to decide production levels into May.
Market consensus is now looking for no change in output levels, despite many of the producers champing at the bit to raise additional revenue on the back of the rally in prices this year.
Data from the American Petroleum Institute industry group on Tuesday showed U.S. crude oil stocks rose by 3.9 million barrels in the week to March 26, well above expectations. The Energy Information Administration will release its equivalent figures later Wednesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $60.50 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.1% to $64.10. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,687.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.12% higher at 1.1736.

96,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2021 06:45AM ET</span>",Daimler to hit the gas on electric shift after strong start to 2021,"By Nick Carey
LONDON (Reuters) -Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) said on Wednesday it will accelerate its shift to electric cars as it builds on a strong start to 2021 despite a global semiconductor chip shortage, but gave no details of how fast its car line-up will go electric. 
The German company said it expected 2021 to be a significantly better year for revenue, and pretax profits than a pandemic-hit 2020.
In common with German rivals BMW and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Daimler benefited from Chinese demand for high-margin luxury vehicles in the second half of 2020, which helped sales to recover from production shutdowns in the first part of the year.
But a shortage of chips the auto industry uses in a range of functions, such as managing fuel economy and emergency braking, has meant much of the auto industry has struggled to maintain output.
Daimler said it planned to speed up the electrification of its product range, but did not provide any specific detail.
In 2019, Daimler said it expected plug-in hybrids or all-electric vehicles to make up more than 50% of its car sales by 2030
""We want to accelerate the electrification of our product portfolio,"" Chief Executive Ola Källenius said. ""It's our goal to reach this target sooner."" 
When asked during a video conference call with investors why Daimler had not provided updated targets for accelerating electrification, the carmaker's CEO said this would depend on many factors, including the availability of charging infrastructure for electric cars. 
Källenius said Daimler will retool two of its oldest German plants, Untertürkheim and Berlin-Marienfelde, and retrain workers to make electric car components as well as parts for fossil-fuel models.
Daimler will next month unveil the EQS, an all-new electric Mercedes-Benz sedan using a dedicated electric vehicle platform. The company said on Wednesday the EQS should have a battery range of up to 770 kilometers (478 miles).
CEO Källenius said the EQS can also be charged up to a range of 300 km in 15 minutes. Carmakers are developing faster charging batteries for consumers used to filling combustion engine fuel tanks in just minutes. 
Across the industry, carmakers are racing to adapt as CO2 emissions targets tighten in Europe and China.
This month, BMW said it expected at least 50% of its sales to be zero-emission vehicles by 2030.
Sweden's Volvo said this month its line-up would be fully electric by 2030, and Ford said in February its European models would be too.

While it focuses on electric cars, is preparing to list its truck making unit, Daimler Truck, which it said should happen by the end of 2021. 
The company announced plans to spin off the unit, the world’s largest truck and bus maker, in February, seeking to increase its investor appeal as a focused electric, luxury car business.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s landmark union election was set to resume Wednesday morning with a second session of reviewing ballots from employees in Alabama, who are deciding whether to organize one of the company's U.S. warehouses for the first time.
Starting at 8:30 a.m. CT (1330 GMT), the U.S. National Labor Relations Board will continue sifting through ballots in a closed hearing, a process that could last days and result in legal challenges.
The public tally of the ballots sent to more than 5,800 workers at the Bessemer, Alabama, facility is not expected to begin until later this week or next. Amazon and union representatives are currently weighing in on the eligibility of votes cast, and the parties may attempt to clear some challenges to ballots before the public hearing begins, a person familiar with the process said.
Votes are then expected to be counted in groups of 100, the person said. Later procedures and objections may further delay the election outcome.
Amazon has fought against the unionization attempt by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), in an election that may influence the future of labor organizing at America's second largest private employer after Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. Amazon has more than 800,000 employees nationwide. 
Amazon has said in a statement: ""Our employees know the truth—starting wages of $15 or more, health care from day one, and a safe and inclusive workplace. We encouraged all of our employees to vote and hope they did so."" 

RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum has said: ""This campaign has already been a victory in many ways. Even though we don't know how the vote will turn out, we believe we have opened the door to more organizing around the country.""

99,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2021 05:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China considering new bourse to attract overseas-listed firms - sources,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - China is considering establishing a stock exchange to attract overseas-listed firms and bolster the global status of its onshore share markets, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The country's State Council has asked the top securities regulator to lead studies on how to design the exchange that would target Chinese firms listed in offshore markets such as Hong Kong and the United States, said the people.
The government hopes the initiative would also lure marquee global firms such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, which would have the option of carving out local businesses and listing them on the new bourse, one of the people said.
The plan comes as Beijing and Washington remain locked in a rivalry that has featured moves by the U.S. securities regulator toward expelling Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges if they do not comply with U.S. auditing standards.
About 13 U.S.-listed Chinese firms including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd, Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc have conducted secondary listings worth a combined $36 billion in Hong Kong over the past 16 months, Refinitiv data showed.
With Sino-U.S. relations showing little sign of easing, bankers and investors expect more such ""homecoming"" offerings.
Talks for the new exchange are in early stages and a time frame and location are yet to be decided, said the people, who declined to be identified as the discussions are confidential.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission did not respond to a Reuters' request for comment. 
China has two main onshore exchanges, in Shanghai and Shenzhen, with combined listed market capitalisation of 78.7 trillion yuan ($12 trillion).
In the first quarter, Nasdaq and New York Exchange topped the global bourses league table in terms of IPO proceeds, while Shenzhen's tech-focussed ChiNext board and Shanghai's main board were ranked 8th and 10th, respectively, according to Refinitiv data.
The same rules govern initial public offerings as well as non-initial listings, in contrast to some other leading bourses, such as Hong Kong's, which offer waivers for secondary listings.
One option under discussion is upgrading an existing listing platform such as a smaller bourse in Beijing, said the people.
Beijing's municipal government has been lobbying for years to upgrade its equity exchange for small and mid-sized firms, known as the ""New Third Board"", to be home to U.S.-listed Chinese firms, said one of the people and three other sources. 
The securities regulator and a few government bodies have for about six month been studying the feasibility of such an upgrade, for which there is a ""50-50"" chance of adoption, said one of the three sources.
In a meeting with regulators and institutions in February, Cai Qi, head of Beijing city's Communist Party, called for the capital to lead financial reform and develop a modern financial industry, the official Beijing Daily reported.
The Beijing government's media office did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
It is rare for foreign companies to raise funds through China's equity markets partly due to the country's strict control of foreign exchange.
Moreover, government attempts to open up its stock markets to foreign firms and investors via stock connect projects including the London-Shanghai Stock Connect have struggled to take off against a backdrop of geopolitical challenges.
China launched a trial program in 2018 to lure overseas-listed technology companies back home with Chinese depositary receipts, or CDRs. That effort has also struggled for success with most such firms opting for secondary listings in Hong Kong.
""The biggest question is whether the new exchange can be attractive enough,"" said one of the people. ""Otherwise, it might just turn out to be another madcap scheme.""

(Reuters) - European stocks were flat on Wednesday as a 30% slump for delivery company Deliveroo in its London debut took the shine off the fourth straight quarterly rise for the benchmark STOXX 600.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index inched down 0.1% to 430.4 - trading below its pre-pandemic peak of 433.9. The benchmark was on course to end March with a 6.4% rise and the first quarter with an 8% gain.
The German DAX slipped 0.1% after breaching the 15,000-mark for the first time on Tuesday, while the UK's FTSE 100 fell 0.4%.
Shares in Deliveroo (LON:ROO) opened well below the initial public offering price, falling as low as 271 pence. The company had priced its IPO at 390 pence per share, giving it a valuation of 7.6 billion pounds ($10.5 billion), less than initially expected.
Continental peers Just Eat Takeaway and Delivery Hero fell 2.0% and 0.3%, respectively.
""The biggest concern is regulation around worker rights. The flexible employee model of Deliveroo's riders is a huge pillar of the group's plans for success,"" Sophie Lund-Yates, an equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), said in a note.
H&M fell 2.8% after the Swedish retailer reported a quarterly loss and said it would not propose a dividend at its annual general meeting.
Economically sensitive sectors such as autos, banks and travel and leisure have been the top performers in Europe this quarter as investors hoped that the reopening of economies would spur growth in these cheap sectors.
""A lot of the winners of 2020 have become losers of 2021 on the recovery aspect,"" said Roger Jones, head of equities at London & Capital. ""European stocks still have the cyclical element to them that will continue to be favoured by investors.""
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) extended declines for a third day, down 2.5%, on worries about its losses linked to the downfall of Archegos Capital, which defaulted on margin calls earlier this week.

102,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2021 05:30AM ET</span>",Singapore bourse proposes allowing SPAC listings but with restrictions,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY) Ltd is proposing introducing regulations this year to allow the listing of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) or blank check firms that have taken U.S. markets by storm. SPACs or shell companies, raise funds via IPOs to merge with operating firms and then take them public after offering them shorter listing timeframes and strong valuations. ""The feedback we have been receiving is that an Asian SPAC would be interesting because Asia is such a fertile ground not just for target companies but also for sponsors,"" Tan Boon Gin, CEO of Singapore Exchange Regulation, told a news conference. SGX, the first major Asian bourse to consider SPAC listings, is calling for feedback from the market from Wednesday until April 28. Based on the feedback, it plans to introduce a regulatory framework by mid-year, followed by the first SPAC listing, Tan said.
SGX said it would impose various safeguards to rein in risks such as excessive dilution by sponsors and shareholders of SPACs and a rush by shell firms to merge with targets.
Asian exchanges are stepping up efforts for SPAC listings although the response has been tepid in Europe. Some executives say Asia may not attract the kind of frenzy seen in the United States where SPACs have already raised $97 billion this year after a bumper 2020. ""Our observations showed that the SPACs that were most successful were the ones which managed two main risks well: first, free-riding by investors and excessive dilution of long-term investors, and second: the rush to do a business combination also known as a de-SPAC,"" Tan said.
SPACs usually offer shares with warrants attached, which entitle them to buy shares at a certain price, becoming valuable if the underlying stock price goes up.
Unlike the United States, SGX proposes that warrants cannot be detached from underlying shares, and that the right to redeem shares can only be exercised by investors who vote against a business combination. This would help prevent what is known as free-riding, Tan said.
In the United States, the shares and warrants may be traded separately, meaning investors can sell their shares but still benefit via the warrants if the SPAC is successful but without contributing capital to the company.

Other measures by SGX include a minimum equity participation by founding shareholders and allowing SPAC mergers to be completed within three years instead of the typical two years seen in U.S. SPACs.

LONDON (Reuters) -The blockage of the Suez Canal for nearly a week will result in a ""large loss"" for Lloyd's of London, its chairman said on Wednesday, as the insurance market recorded a 900 million pound ($1.2 billion) pretax loss in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Canal is working to clear the backlog after the refloating this week of a stranded giant container ship. The blockage threw global supply chains into disarray.
Bruce Carnegie-Brown told Reuters it was too early to estimate the exact loss, but ""it's clearly going to be a large loss, not just for the vessel but for all of the other vessels that were trapped and unable to get through"". 
He added this could mean a loss for Lloyd's of around $100 million or more.
Liability insurance claims for ships and cargo impacted by the delay are expected to fall initially to the container ship Ever Given's liability insurer, UK P&I Club. But UK P&I Club will also use reinsurance, some of it in the Lloyd's market, industry sources say.
Carnegie-Brown said Lloyd's may be on the hook for around 5-10% of the total reinsurance claims. 
Fitch Ratings said this week that global reinsurers were likely to face hundreds of millions of euros of claims due to the incident.
The 2020 loss for the 330-year-old Lloyd's market, home to around 100 syndicate members, compares with a 2.5 billion pound profit in 2019.
Lloyd's expects to pay out 3.4 billion pounds in 2020 COVID-19 claims net of reinsurance, with Carnegie-Brown saying many of those payments would be related to the cancellation of major events such as the Wimbledon tennis tournament. COVID-19-related payments will continue this year, he added.
But Lloyd's said premium rates had risen 10.8% last year and rate rises had continued into 2021. Insurers typically increase rates after experiencing large losses.

After several closures due to the pandemic, the Lloyd's underwriting floor will reopen on May 17. Carnegie-Brown said surveys showed most market employees expect to return to the office ""three-plus days a week"".

Investing.com - European stock markets edged lower Wednesday, handing back some of the gains from the previous session after food delivery company Deliveroo’s float disappointed.
At 4 AM ET (0900 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded flat, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1% and the U.K.’s FTSE index dropped 0.3%.
European stocks posted strong gains Tuesday, with the CAC 40 and Amsterdam's AEX hitting a new 52-week high and the DAX topping 15,000 points for the first time.
However, this positive tone hasn't lasted long as the region struggles to cope with a surge of new coronavirus cases,  which has caused many countries to tighten restrictive measures, mindful of their lack of progress in vaccinating their populations.
French President Emmanuel Macron will deliver a televised address to the nation on Wednesday evening, after the country’s health ministry said on Tuesday that the number of people in intensive care units with COVID-19 had reached the highest level this year. The number of new cases increased 6.3% on the week, the sharpest rise since the end of November.
In the corporate sector, Deliveroo (LON:ROO) stock fell as much as 30% from the IPO price after making one of the most anticipated London stock market listings, the largest float on the London Stock Exchange since Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) in May 2011.
Peers Just Eat Takeaway (AS:TKWY) and Delivery Hero (DE:DHER) fell 0.8% and 1.1%, respectively.
H&M (ST:HMb) stock slipped 1.2% after the Swedish retailer reported a quarterly loss and said it would not propose a dividend at its annual general meeting.
Capgemini (PA:CAPP) stock rose 1.7% after the French consulting and IT services provider raised its mid-term margin targets on Wednesday, while Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) stock rose 0.1% after the German car manufacturer repeated that it expects 2021 to be a significantly better year for revenue and pretax profits than 2020. The guidance is almost equivalent to an upgrade, given that the global shortage of semiconductor chips has appeared to worsen since it first made that forecast.
In economic news, U.K. GDP grew by 1.3% between October and December last year from the previous three-month period, an improvement from an earlier estimate of 1.0% growth, while the German unemployment rate remained at 6.0% in March.
Oil prices rose Wednesday ahead of Thursday’s meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, which is set to decide production levels into May.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google will contribute 25 million euros ($29.3 million) to the newly set up European Media and Information Fund to combat fake news, the company said on Wednesday, amid criticism tech giants are not doing enough to debunk online disinformation.
The COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. election last year spurred a massive spike in misinformation, with some blaming social media for not being more proactive in tackling the issue while regulators have indicated they may take action via heavy-handed restrictions.
The European Media and Information Fund, launched by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and the European University Institute last week, aims to enlist researchers, fact-checkers, not-for-profits and other public interest-oriented bodies to help in the fight against fake news.
""While navigating the uncertainty and challenges of the last year, it has proven more important than ever for people to access accurate information, and sort facts from fiction,"" Matt Brittin, head of Google's EMEA Business & Operations, said in a blog post.
The fund has a duration of five years. The European Digital Media Observatory, which is a European Commission project set up last year and whose members include fact checkers and academic researchers, will evaluate and select the projects. (This story corrects to 25 million euros from dollars)

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -H&M reported a quarterly loss on Wednesday and said that it was dedicated to regaining the trust of shoppers in China following a recent backlash there after comments it made last year the on the Xinjiang region.
The world's second-biggest fashion retailer has come under fire from consumers and officials in China after an H&M statement from 2020 resurfaced on social media. In those comments, H&M had expressed concern over reports of forced labour in the western region of Xinjiang, saying it would no longer source cotton from there.
In a statement alongside quarterly results on Wednesday, H&M said that its commitment to China remained strong and it was dedicated to regaining the trust and confidence of customers, colleagues and business partners there. 
""By working together with stakeholders and partners, we believe we can take steps in our joint efforts to develop the fashion industry, as well as serve our customers and act in a respectful way,"" it said.
The latest statement made no specific mention of Xinjiang.
China is H&M's fourth-biggest sales market and its biggest sourcing market.
""We have seen brands like  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and H&M weather similar controversies in the past and maintain relatively strong sales, however short term we think H&M may see a negative impact on its sales in the large and growing Chinese market,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Richard Chamberlain said in a note.
Shares in H&M fell 2% in early trade.
With many of its shops closed because of the coronavirus pandemic, H&M reported a pretax loss for the December-February period, its fiscal first quarter, of 1.39 billion crowns ($159 million) against a year-earlier profit of 2.50 billion.
Analysts polled by Refinitiv had on average forecast a 1.41 billion crown loss.

Sales from March 1-28 were up 55% measured in local currencies.
H&M said it would not propose a dividend at its annual general meeting but saw good prospects of one in the second half of the year. ($1 = 8.7416 Swedish crowns)

110,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2021 03:27AM ET</span>","Analysis: Shaken by Greensill, German towns pull millions from banks","By John O'Donnell and Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German towns and cities are pulling money from small, private banks, spooked after losing millions in the closure of Greensill Bank, an experience they said has shattered their faith in the country's government and financial system.
Part of financier Lex Greensill's insolvent Greensill Capital, the bank collapsed this month and triggered a 2 billion euro ($2.34 billion) bill for Germany's deposit protection scheme.
But towns and cities are excluded from this shield and are nursing losses of hundreds of millions of euros. 
They are also increasingly wary of the other smaller lenders that grasped an opportunity to win new business in Germany in response to European Central Bank (ECB) policies that increased the cost of banking with traditional savings banks.
""I'm devastated,"" said Rainer Schnitzler, mayor of Poecking, a town in Bavaria that had 5 million euros on deposit with Greensill. He learned about the bank's closure while scrolling through online news. 
""We've decided we won't put any more money into private banks,"" he said.
Germany's towns and cities began turning to banks such as Greensill after the ECB drove interest rates to below zero around the middle of the last decade as it sought to prop up the eurozone, one of the world's largest economies. 
The aim was to bolster spending, but the many Germans and the wealthy German cities and states intent on saving faced a dilemma: whether to pay fees for the luxury of storing their cash with traditional savings banks, or seek a more tempting deal among the little-known banks with branches in Germany. 
Daniel Toepfer, mayor of Weissach outside Stuttgart who has since recalled his town's holdings with Russian bank VTB and Dutch lender NIBC, said the ECB's polices ""make it unbelievably difficult for us"".
""We can't buy gold bars. We can't build a safe...This is fatal for the municipalities,"" he said. 
BACK TO THE STATE
Nine mayors and treasurers told Reuters they would withdraw savings from the commercial banks they had preferred as the way to avoid paying penalty interest charges on deposits, and put the money into state-backed banks instead. 
Others said they were considering such a move.
The southwestern town of Boetzingen had 13 million euros with Greensill.
""We're worried about the entire banking sector,"" said Mayor Dieter Schneckenburger, criticising German authorities for failing to learn the lessons of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the financial crisis of 2008 and of the payments firm Wirecard.
Thuringia, the eastern German state known for its sausages that had 50 million euros at Greensill, said it would no longer use private banks.
In total, German towns and cities had 500 million euros saved with Greensill, two people familiar with the matter said, on condition of anonymity. 
But far more is at stake, with more than 220 billion euros of deposits held by public authorities in Germany, an important part of the country's 2.5 trillion euro plus savings market. 
Foreign banks with subsidiaries in Germany have been especially successful in luring investors who sought to avoid paying fees, with deposits up 14% over the past year, accelerating a trend of the last decade. (Graphic: Parking cash: Investors turn to German subsidiaries of foreign banks, https://graphics.reuters.com/GERMANY-BANKS/azgpodxwlvd/chart.png) 
Although the public officials did not name all the banks they had withdrawn their money from, one also singled out Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Bank. 
Volkswagen said it saw no change in investor behaviour and enjoyed the trust of customers, while VTB and NIBC did not respond to requests for comment. Insolvency managers for Greensill Bank and its parent Greensill Capital declined to comment.
'A MISTAKE'
The largest loss for a single town was 38 million euros for the northwestern town of Monheim am Rhein, whose mayor Daniel Zimmermann has been leading a movement for towns to join forces for a united response.
""Most of the deposits, about 30 million euros, were put in in December. It was a mistake. But we didn't even have a hint of anything being out of the ordinary,"" Zimmermann said.
Giessen, a university town north of Frankfurt known for its U.S. military presence during the Cold War, was keeping 10 million euros of its 60 million with Greensill when the bank collapsed. ""The money was a cushion for bad times,"" said Dirk During, chief of staff at city hall.
Giessen has since withdrawn all such deposits ""just to be safe,"" During said.
Vaterstetten, outside Munich, started placing its extra proceeds with Greensill well before Leonhard Spitzauer became mayor last year. When Greensill went bust, the town of nearly 25,000 people had 5.5 million euros there.
""At first I thought, uh-oh, it's like Lehman,"" Spitzauer said. Spitzauer pulled its funds parked with Volkswagen Bank, he said, to avoid what he saw as a similar risk. 
Fears other problems are lurking are widespread.
A Reuters analysis of supervisory data shows that Germany has spawned one of the biggest banking centres in Europe, with more than 1,000 lenders.
    One official put the tally of banks under special observation at over 100. Concerns include low profitability, exposure to sectors hit by the pandemic and big property portfolios.
    ""It is possible that there are other problem banks out there that may be lurking and not on the radar of regulators,"" said Volker Weinreich, a lawyer who advises towns.
The episode has also reignited a debate about central bank money printing and how that devalues savings.
""As a kid, I went to the bank with my piggy bank, said Schnitzler, the mayor of Poecking. ""I got gifts for my money. Now I have to apologise if I want to deposit money.""

LONDON (Reuters) -Mastercard is among five companies which broke the law for cartel behaviour when offering pre-paid cards to vulnerable members of society, Britain's Payment Systems Regulator said on Wednesday.
Mastercard (NYSE:MA), allpay, APS, PFS and Sulion agreed not to compete or poach each other's customers on cards used by local authorities for welfare payments including to the homeless, victims of domestic violence and asylum seekers, the PSR said.
The investigation is ongoing and the companies can make representations on the provisional findings, the PSR said.
Mastercard, allpay and PFS have admitted liability and if the regulator ultimately concludes there is wrongdoing have agreed to pay maximum fines totalling more than 32 million pounds ($44 million), the watchdog said.
The PSR alleges two infringements of Britain's 1998 competition law. 
One breach took place over six years between 2012 and 2018 and involved all five firms, the PSR said.
The other lasted between 2014 and 2016 and involved APS and FPS, the watchdog said.
""Pre-paid card services, like these, can provide significant benefits to local authorities as one way to make welfare payments to some of the most vulnerable people in society,"" said Chris Hemsley, managing director of the PSR.
""By colluding in this way, we consider the parties were acting as a cartel... Collusion in payments is absolutely unacceptable. Where we see it happening, we will take action, stop it, and seek to impose significant penalties.""
Mastercard said it took the issue very seriously and had put further controls and training in place, adding the incident was isolated to UK prepaid cards.
""We apologise that the actions of two former employees resulted in the standards expected of us not being met in this instance,"" a Mastercard spokesman said.

PFS said it would make an announcement in due course. 
Allpay and APS were not immediately available for comment. Sulion could not be reached.

Investing.com -- Shares in Deliveroo (LON:ROO) slumped on their debut on the London Stock Exchange, as concerns about governance and profitability overshadowed the biggest IPO of the year so far in Europe.
By 5:05 AM ET (0905 GMT), Deliveroo shares were quoted at 305 pence, some 22% below their IPO price. The shares were priced at the bottom of their marketing range, at 390p, after a number of high-profile U.K. institutions chose not to subscribe.
A recent Supreme Court decision forcing ride-hailing company Uber (NYSE:UBER) to treat its gig-economy drivers as workers has cast doubt over Deliveroo's own path to profitability, given that it, too, depends on a legion of low-paid contract riders and drivers.
The IPO pricing had valued Deliveroo at 7.6 billion pounds ($10.5 billion). As such, the initial drop of 30% wiped over 2 billion pounds off its valuation.
In addition to concerns about its exposure to labor regulation risk, there have also been concerns about the company's dual-class share structure, which leaves founder Will Shu in majority control of the company despite owning less than 10% of all shares outstanding. The model has been common in the U.S. and has encouraged many tech firms to go public without subjecting their founders' vision to short-term pressure from outside shareholders. Critics say it amplifies ""key person risk"", while the institutional investors that avoided the IPO have said that it reduces their scope to exert influence on management to address their ESG-related worries."
113,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2021 03:05AM ET</span>",Record Asia equity fundraising seen slowing as 'hot money' eases,"By Scott Murdoch
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Equity fundraisings in Asia are expected to slow down in the near term after two straight record quarters as 'hot money' flows that had propped up new issuances ease amid rising volatility in markets, bankers said. 
Driven by follow-on equity offerings in Hong Kong such as Chinese search giant Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU)'s $3.1 billion secondary listing in March and electric vehicle maker BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF)'s $3.9 billion share sale in January, companies raised $108.5 billion in Asia in the first quarter of 2021.
That was the highest ever in a first quarter and more than double the $49.8 billion raised in the year-ago quarter, according to Refinitiv data.
But the figures for the region, including Japan, were down by a third from the record final quarter of 2020, in the absence of big-tickets deals in China that had boosted the volume then.
Abundant liquidity and lower interest rates have largely fuelled a global capital markets rally in the last few quarters, but concerns are growing that the gains could reverse due to a pickup in inflation as vaccine rollouts lead to a reopening of economies.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asia, ex-Japan, co-head of equity capital markets (ECM) William Smiley said while more volatility had emerged in the past six weeks, capital markets remained open which was positive in the long term for issuers and investors.
""Expectations for the second quarter are more balanced and that's not a bad thing,"" the Hong Kong-based Smiley said.
""When exuberance prevails and markets only move up, hot money chases deals and supports opportunistic activity – not the backdrop for sustained capital markets activity.""
More than half of the first quarter's total equity fundraising in Asia was by listed companies through follow-on deals, worth $56.72 billion. 
Still, the pace of new equity floats in the region surprised bankers.
""This is a very unique quarter that we have had, globally it's probably the busiest quarter ever by the number of IPOs and the proceeds from those,"" said Tiger Cong, Chinese investment bank CICC's head of capital markets.
""In terms of the market window, the old adage that 'you should raise money when you can, not when you have to' still makes sense.""
Technology deals are expected to again dominate the remaining quarters of the year and investors are closely watching China's ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, which plans to list one or more of its businesses possibly in 2021. 

""The equity market plays on the growth story. TMT and healthcare are the sectors that remain hot, and these sectors are the most interesting to investors,"" said Tucker Highfield, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s co-head of Asia Pacific ECM.

114,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2021 02:56AM ET</span>",Markets in first quarter: Riding a tiger and waking some bears,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - A new U.S. president with $1.9 trillion to spend, amateur traders taking on seasoned hedge funds, hot oil, digital art selling for tens of millions of dollars and grizzly bears in the bond markets. It has been an eventful start to 2021.
A year into the coronavirus pandemic and the focus has been on the vaccines vs variants battle crucial to getting some normality back into the world economy. 
It has given oil its best start to a year since 2005, with a 25% gain. World stocks have hit a few new highs too but it's a very different story from last year's. Whisper it, but some of the fabled FAANGs and other stratospherically valued stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will end Q1 down.
Then there's been the bond bears, who have given the government debt markets their worst run since the 2013 ""taper tantrum"". U.S. Treasuries and German Bund have lost 6%-6.5%; emerging market currency debt holders are down 7%. 
The Democrats' surprise clinching of the U.S. Senate in January cleared the way for a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan. That has raised bets on growth and inflation, and some worry the Federal Reserve might be spooked into reeling in support. 
BCA strategist Arthur Budaghyan said the Senate wins forced a change the view from investors and likened the market impact of the bumper stimulus plan to riding a tiger.
""Riding a tiger is fun,"" Budaghyan said. ""The only hitch is that no one can safely get off a tiger.""

https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdvzglkkpw/Pasted%20image%201617146544506.png
The knock-on effects have been widespread. 
From their January peaks, funds, stocks or currencies linked to innovation – the ARK Innovation Fund, Solar Energy stocks, BioTech shares, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and special purpose acquisition companies or SPACs – are down 20-25%.
The dollar has made the multitude of investment banks that predicted its fall look like fools by having its best Q1 since 2015 and any quarter since 2018.
Oil's hot streak has seen the Canadian dollar and Norwegian crown outperform. Britain's pound has too thanks to the UK's rapid COVID vaccine rollout programme, but emerging markets have been skittled. 
Brazil's real and Turkey's lira have followed last year's 20% batterings with further 10% drops. Remarkably the lira was the world's best performer for the first six weeks of 2021. Then bond yields and energy prices kicked higher, and then President Tayyip Erdogan sacked another central banker. 
""It is all been about the decoupling between the U.S. and the rest of the world,"" said Axa's chief economist Gilles Moec, highlighting that at over 6%, the U.S. is set to grow at its quickest rate since 1984 this year and faster than China for the first time in at least 20 years.

MEME MAYHEM
While oil and an industrial metals like copper have soared on global reopening hopes, safe-haven gold has dumped 11%, marking its worst start to a year since 1982, albeit after a near 25% leap in 2020.
Last week's blockage of Egypt's Suez canal saw some shipping rates double, and electric car demand means palladium and platinum and are still 5-10% higher this year, but wheat and other key food prices have wilted badly.
At the other end of the investment spectrum, battles still rumble between online retail investors and the hedge funds who bet big money against so-called meme stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME).
The video-game retailer's shares soared as much as 2,700% in January when millions of small investors, egged on by social media, employed a classic Wall Street short squeeze on Wall Street itself. It is still up 950% whereas the main world stock index is up only 3%.
And if that doesn't bamboozle the mind, a digital-only artwork sold for nearly $70 million this month. The buyer? A crypto asset investor going by the pseudonym ""Metakovan.""
""Compared to the unusualness of Q1’s catalysts – a last-minute Democratic sweep, a surprisingly large $1.9 trillion U.S. stimulus, meme stock trading, bubblettes bursting – Q2 will probably look less dramatic."" said JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s cross-asset strategist John Normand.

115,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2021 02:11AM ET</span>","In Archegos fire sale, Credit Suisse, Nomura burned by slow exit","By Matt Scuffham, Elizabeth Dilts Marshall and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
NEW YORK/ZURICH (Reuters) -While banks including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) were able to exit their trades with Archegos Capital relatively unscathed,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Nomura have been burned in the fire sale. 
The blowup of the Archegos fund, a family office run by former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang, is still reverberating across the financial system, with global banks so far standing to lose more than $6 billion.
Switzerland's Credit Suisse and Japan's Nomura are expected to bear the brunt of that. 
They had hoped that rival banks that had also financed and processed trades for Archegos would hold off from exiting their positions, but were left exposed when Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley began unwinding their trades with the fund, according to three people with direct knowledge of the matter.
So far, it appears the banks that got out of the trades the quickest have suffered the least and Goldman Sachs may even have profited, said three sources familiar with the trades. 
Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Credit Suisse has yet to confirm its losses, but the sources said the Swiss bank faces losses of up to $4 billion. Nomura, Japan's largest investment bank, warned on Monday of a possible $2 billion loss.
The Archegos saga is a major blow for both banks, which had been trying to expand their investment banking and trading businesses in the United States, and underscores the challenges of striving to compete with hefty U.S. rivals on their own turf. 
""Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley got out quicker and got better prices. They know more about what's going on. Credit Suisse and Nomura don't have the same standing,"" said Viola Risk Advisors analyst David Hendler.
Morgan Stanley and Nomura declined to comment. Credit Suisse did not respond to requests for comment.
Free from regulatory scrutiny as a family office gambling Hwang's personal fortune, Archegos had amassed large positions in stocks, including ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC), using risky derivatives known as ""total return swaps."" 
Those swaps allow investors to bet on stock price moves, often with high levels of leverage, without owning the underlying shares. Instead, banks buy and hold the stocks and give the fund a performance-related return. The fund has to secure the trades by giving the bank collateral, such as cash or equities. 
Archegos had assets of around $10 billion but held positions worth more than $50 billion, according to one of the sources, suggesting Hwang was highly leveraged. Leverage is risky because just as it magnifies potential returns, it magnifies losses too. 
Archegos declined to comment beyond its statement on Monday when it said this was a ""challenging time.""
SHARE SALE SPIRAL
Investor disappointment in last Wednesday's stock sale by media giant ViacomCBS, to which Archegos was heavily exposed, appeared to be the catalyst for its meltdown, the sources said. 
As ViacomCBS's stock slumped last week, falling 30% from last Monday's close to around $68 on Thursday morning, alarm bells went off at Archegos' banks, the sources said. 
They called on Archegos for more collateral to cover the increased exposure on its swap positions, but the fund did not have enough liquidity. By failing to meet the margin call, the fund had defaulted under the terms of its trades with the banks. 
In a bid to stave off a crisis, Hwang arranged a conference call with the banks later on Thursday to ask them to agree to hold off selling the shares that underpinned his swap trades in the hopes they would bounce back, two of the sources said. 
Some of the banks, including Credit Suisse, favored holding off, but Goldman Sachs and others were keen to start selling shares to free up cash so Archegos could pay them what was owed. 
No agreement was reached and Goldman began offloading shares before the market opened on Friday. It sold more than $10.5 billion of shares held in Viacom, Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) and  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (NYSE:TME), among others. 
Morgan Stanley also offloaded $8 billion worth of shares. 
All told, Archegos' banks sold millions of shares in companies the fund had bet on, dragging down stocks across the media and other sectors.

That left other banks, primarily Credit Suisse and Nomura, sprinting for the exit before it slammed shut. By the time they decided to start selling, the stocks had fallen too far for the banks to avert major losses.
""The first one out is not panicking,"" said Matt Freund, co-chief investment officer at Calamos Investments. ""It doesn't make sense to join a panic but sometimes it makes sense to start one.""

116,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 31, 2021 02:09AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Edge Lower; Inflation and Unemployment Data Ahead,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening marginally lower Wednesday, handing back some of the gains from the previous session ahead of key inflation and unemployment data.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.3%.
European stocks posted strong gains Tuesday, with the CAC 40 and Amsterdam's AEX hitting a new 52-week high and the Dax topping 15,000 points for the first time, buoyed by the lack of broader fallout from the U.S. hedge fund default that hit global banking stocks on Monday.
However, this positive tone is unlikely to last long as the region struggles to cope with a surge of new coronavirus cases, causing many countries to tighten restrictive measures. France's health ministry said on Tuesday that the number of people in intensive care units with COVID-19 had reached the highest level this year, while the number of new cases saw a week-on-week increase of 6.3%, the highest such increase since the end of November.
With this in mind, investors will be watching for the latest inflation data from the euro zone in March and German unemployment data, both releases likely to be good indications on the health of the region’s economy as it battles this third wave of Covid-19 cases.
In the corporate sector, French consulting and IT services provider Capgemini (PA:CAPP) raised its mid-term margin targets on Wednesday, citing the rapidly expanding use of cloud solutions and artificial intelligence across industries.
Oil prices rose Wednesday ahead of Thursday’s meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, which is set to decide production levels into May.
A panel of experts advising the group warned that rising Covid cases and lockdowns globally are likely to hit demand growth, according to a report seen by Reuters, and thus the producers are expected to extend their supply curbs into May. 
Data from the American Petroleum Institute industry group on Tuesday showed U.S. crude oil stocks rose by 3.9 million barrels in the week to March 26, well above expectations.
Data on U.S. inventories are due on Wednesday from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $60.81 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.4% to $64.45. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,682.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1707.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's bourse, Tadawul, has invited banks to pitch for roles in its highly-anticipated flotation, three sources told Reuters on Wednesday.
With a market capitalisation of $2.5 trillion, Tadawul is the Arab world's largest stock exchange. 
Tadawul hired HSBC in 2016 to manage an initial public offering (IPO) initially planned for 2018 but put that on hold due to oil giant  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222)'s record $29.4 billion listing at the end of 2019.
A request for proposals (RFP) was sent to a number of international and local banks to determine their roles for the bourse's upcoming share offering, said the sources, declining to be named as the matter is not public. 
Tadawul was not immediately available to comment when contacted by Reuters on Wednesday.
A timeline for an IPO would be provided this year, Tadawul's chief executive Khalid Alhussan told Reuters in January.
Alhussan said 2020 was a good test for the Saudi market when, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, liquidity tripled, there was a 26% increase in the number of qualified foreign investors opening portfolios, and more than 100,000 local investors joined the stock market.

The bourse has benefited from Aramco's listing. It has welcomed a slew of companies since the pandemic including healthcare firm Suleiman Al Habib and Riyadh-based vehicle rental company Theeb Rent-a-Car.

118,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2021 01:45AM ET</span>",Analysis: Cathie Wood's ARK funds still in favor despite poor first-quarter performance,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cathie Wood failed to repeat her stellar 2020 performance with ARK Invest funds in the first quarter, but the celebrity fund manager still managed to attract a steady pile of cash into her red-hot funds.
Wood outperformed every other actively managed equity mutual or exchange-traded fund manager last year, according to Morningstar, helping propel the firm's assets under management of its flagship ARK Innovation fund from $1.86 billion at the end of 2019 to nearly $22 billion as of March, according to Lipper data.
But for the first quarter her flagship fund is down 10.7% through March 29, ranking in the worst 1 percentile of the 601 U.S. mid-cap growth funds, according to Morningstar data performance. Over a five-year period, its annualized gain is 44.6%.
ARK's Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKX) also slipped on Tuesday in their Wall Street debut.
ARK Invest did not respond to a request to comment.
Despite this year's performance, ARK still attracts retail investors at a time when many have given up on stock pickers in favor of passive index investing. Wood's ARK Innovation ETF has brought in nearly $5.5 billion in new funds so far this year, the most of any actively managed equity fund, while three other ARK funds attracted inflows that ranked among the top 10, according to Morningstar.
The inflows could signal that retail investors are focusing on frothy stocks rather than fundamentals, said Phil Toews, chief executive of financial advisory firm Toews Corp, which has about $2 billion in assets under management.
""I used to feel that at some point we could reach the highs of the late '90s during this rally. Witnessing the rise in ARK and the stocks that support it helped me realize we are already there,"" said Toews.
A fixture on financial media and Twitter, Wood is among the few mutual or exchange-traded fund managers whose remarks can move markets. When Wood said earlier in March that she expected Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shares to top $3,000 by 2025, shares of the electric automaker popped nearly 5% in morning trading.
    Still, rising concerns about inflation have stalled a rally in Wood's portfolio companies like  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc and  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) that outperformed during the pandemic. Wood, for her part, has said that she still considers companies like Zoom Communications Inc ""undervalued"" and has been buying on dips.
Wood is not alone in her tepid performance since the start of the year. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell into a correction - a 10% decline from its most recent highs - on March 8. For the quarter as a whole, the Nasdaq is up 1%.
Technology and high-growth stocks that Wood favors have suffered as investors price in the likelihood of above-average inflation that would raise borrowing costs for consumers and companies. The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries hovered near a 14-month high of 1.72% this week, as investors priced in the effects of the Biden administration's $1.9 trillion stimulus plan and the Federal Reserve's pledge to keep monetary policy loose, boosting economic growth and inflation.
Wood's adherence to her investment approach despite the movements of the broader markets could be a double-edged sword, said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer of wealth management at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), who has known Wood for over 30 years. 
""She's a gifted, brilliant portfolio manager because she is so committed and disciplined to her style and rides the rollercoaster of the markets because sometimes that style goes out of favor and sometimes that style has spectacular bear markets,"" she said.
Some investors and analysts said that Wood remains correct in her bullish outlook despite the short-term hiccups.
Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said higher bond yields and inflation would have less of an effect on the technology and growth stocks in Wood's portfolio than the market expects.

Wood has ""been dead right over the last three to four years,"" said Ives.

119,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2021 01:20AM ET</span>","Google, BMW, Volvo, and Samsung SDI sign up to WWF call for temporary ban on deep-sea mining","(Reuters) - Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), BMW, Volvo and Samsung (KS:005930) SDI are the first global companies to have signed up to a World Wildlife Fund (WWF) call for a moratorium on deep-sea mining, the WWF said on Wednesday.
In backing the call, the companies commit not to source any minerals from the seabed, to exclude such minerals from their supply chains, and not to finance deep seabed mining activities, the WWF said in a statement.
Deep-sea mining would extract cobalt, copper, nickel, and manganese - key materials commonly used to make batteries - from potato-sized nodules which pepper the sea floor at depths of 4-6 kilometres and are particularly abundant in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone in the North Pacific Ocean, a vast area spanning millions of kilometres between Hawaii and Mexico.
""With much of the deep sea ecosystem yet to be explored and understood, such activity would be recklessly short-sighted,"" WWF said in a statement.
The moratorium calls for a ban on deep seabed mining activities until the risks are fully understood and all alternatives are exhausted.
BMW said raw materials from deep-sea mining are ""not an option"" for the company at present because there are insufficient scientific findings to be able to assess the environmental risks. Google and Volvo did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment. 
South Korea's Samsung SDI said it was the first battery maker to participate in WWF's initiative.
In the meantime, deep-sea mining companies are pushing ahead with preparatory work and research on seabed licence areas.
Companies that hold exploration licences for swathes of the sea floor, including DeepGreen, GSR and UK Seabed Resources - a subsidiary of  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT)'s UK-based arm - hope to eventually sell minerals from the seabed to carmakers and battery companies.
DeepGreen, which recently announced plans to go public in a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), has previously said seabed mining will be more sustainable than mining on land because it creates less waste and the nodules containing minerals have higher concentrations of metals than deposits found on land.

Meanwhile Norway has said it could license companies for deep-sea mining as early as 2023, potentially placing it among the first countries to harvest seabed metals.

Komori, 81, will take a new role as chief adviser while Teiichi Goto becomes CEO and Kenji Sukeno the chairman. The transitions are subject to approval by shareholders, Fujifilm said in a release.
Komori is credited with helping Fujifilm transform its business and survive the collapse of the film industry that drove its main rival Eastman Kodak Co into bankruptcy. 
Fujifilm's push into healthcare has become all the more apparent amid the pandemic, as its antiviral drug Avigan is being studied as a COVID-19 treatment.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian stocks were on the backfoot on Wednesday while the safe-haven dollar held near a one-year high as Treasury yields resumed their upward march, hitting sentiment even as Chinese data underpinned signs of a solid global economic recovery.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan eased from a one-week high of 682.36 points to be last at 680.04 and still a fair distance away from an all-time peak of 745.89 touched just last month. 
For the month so far, the index is down 1.6% to be on track for its first loss in five months. It is poised for its fourth consecutive quarterly gain though it would be the smallest increase since a 21% fall in March 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic brought the world to a standstill.
""Markets are watching closely to gauge the damage and potential ripple effects caused by the Archegos Capital Management crisis,"" ANZ analysts wrote in a note. 
Some global banks are facing billions of dollars in losses after U.S. investment firm Archegos Capital Management LP defaulted on margin calls, putting investors on edge about who else might be exposed.
""For some this serves as a timely reminder that while pandemic risks are abating, financial market risks remain elevated,"" ANZ added.
The risk-off mood lately has been set off by a surge in bond yields. U.S. Treasury yields skyrocketed 83 basis points just this quarter, the biggest increase in over a decade, making equity valuations look lofty particularly for major tech companies which have borne the brunt of the sell-off. 
On Wednesday, 10-year Treasury yields rose as high as 1.742% from Tuesday's 1.708%.
Analysts at Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) said they still liked tech stocks.
""Tech is a diverse sector and the driver of higher yields matters more than the rise itself,"" Blackrock said in a note to clients.
""Our new nominal theme implies central banks will be slower to raise rates to curb inflation than in the past, supporting our pro-risk stance and preference for tech.""
Over a 6-12 month period, Blackrock is ""overweight"" equities and ""underweight"" U.S. Treasuries, expecting a nominal increase in yields.
""The 'term premium tantrum' mostly reflects investors requiring higher compensation for the now greater risks to portfolios presented by government bonds and inflation, in our view,"" Blackrock said.
""This makes equities even more appealing than bonds in a multi-asset context – and suggests any further sell-offs in tech may present opportunities."" 
Sentiment in Asia remained downbeat despite data showing China's factory activity expanded at a faster-than-expected pace in March while the country's services sector surged too.
Chinese shares started in the red and deepened their losses, with the blue-chip index off 1.1%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slipped 0.2%.
Japan's Nikkei slid 0.7% as the country's industrial output fell in February due to declines in the production of cars and electrical machinery. 
Australia's benchmark index bucked the trend to be up 1.5%, New Zealand rose 0.8% while South Korea's KOSPI index added 0.1%. 
E-mini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) were a shade higher. 
In foreign exchange markets, currencies were mostly a sea of red against the U.S. dollar which hit a one-year high of 110.48 against the yen as investors bet that massive fiscal stimulus and aggressive vaccinations will boost the U.S. economic recovery. [FRX/]
The dollar is on track for a third straight monthly rise against the yen and its biggest since end-2016. 
The dollar index held above 93 after surging as high as 93.357 on Tuesday. It has climbed from close to 90 at the start of March, on course for its best month since 2016.
Australia's dollar edged up to $0.7606, consolidating after its drop to $0.7564 last week, the lowest level seen this year.
In commodities, Brent crude rose 6 cents to $64.20 a barrel while U.S. crude added 27 cents to $60.81 barrel.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down Wednesday morning, bracing for their first monthly loss since October 2018. Bond yields pushed upwards, and investors awaited more details on the next U.S. stimulus measure.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.78% by 11:23 PM ET (3:23 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component slid 1.42%. Data released earlier in the day said that the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for March was 51.9, outperforming both the 51 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and February’s 50.6 reading. The non-manufacturing PMI also surpassed its February reading of 51.4 with a 56.3 reading in March.
The Caixin manufacturing and services PMIs for the private sector are due later in the week.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.43%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.60%. Banks dragged Japanese shares lower after Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group Inc. (T:8306) joined Nomura Holdings Inc. (T:8604) and  Credit Suisse Group  (NYSE:CS) in a group of banks taking a hit from the collapse of Archegos Capital Management.
South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 0.09%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 jumped 1.58%. Residents in the state of Queensland await a decision on whether to lift the three-day snap lockdown imposed earlier in the week ahead of the Easter holiday.
Some investors remained optimistic, however.
“We believe that the equity market rally and cyclical rotation have room to run as improving economic expectations make their way to reality via earnings growth,” Lauren Goodwin, portfolio strategist at New York Life Investments, said in a note.
Investors continue to monitor the pace of the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19, as well as any signs of inflation, as concerns that bond yields renewing their gains could impact some stocks. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields gained as the Asian session opened but were subsiding from the 14-month high of 1.77% touched during the previous session.
U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to outline later in the day how he plans to fund a $3 to $4 trillion infrastructure plan.
Positive economic data also gave investor sentiment a boost. Tuesday’s Conference Board CB Consumer Confidence Index climbed to 109.7 in March, its highest level since the beginning of COVID-19. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a 96.9 figure, while the index was at 90.4 in February.
Investors now await the U.S. employment report for March, including non-farm payrolls, which is due out on Friday. With the Federal Reserve citing a lackluster labor market to justify its continued dovish stance on interest rates, inflation worries continue to persist even as the stance has boosted the economic outlook, it also continues to raise inflation worries.
The International Monetary Fund will also upgrade its forecast for global economic growth in the following week."

Korean Air in November announced it would spend 1.8 trillion won ($1.59 billion) to become Asiana's top shareholder, in aviation's first major consolidation since COVID-19 brought the industry to its knees.
It is also the biggest shake-up in South Korean air travel since Asiana's founding ahead of the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
In a written briefing to media on Wednesday, Korean Air President Woo Keehong said his airline hoped to receive competition approvals for the Asiana deal from nine countries by the end of the year.
""Korean Air plans to fully integrate with Asiana Airlines about two years after Korean Air completes the acquisition and Asiana Airlines becomes its subsidiary,"" he said. 
Korean Air also expects to merge the airlines' low-cost arms Jin Air Co Ltd, Air Busan Co Ltd and Air Seoul into a single budget carrier that can better realise economies of scale, Woo said.
""By consolidating these three airlines, it can become a top-level low-cost airline not only in Korea, but also in Asia,"" he said.
Korean Air and Asiana will look to integrate their large aircraft fleets, which in some cases have different engine types for the same model, Woo said, adding that it would be easier to phase out Asiana's planes, as many have leases expiring within five years. 
Korean Air expects about 1,200 roles between the airlines will overlap, but it will manage the situation through attrition and retirements rather than direct job cuts, he said.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 huffed and puffed Tuesday, but ultimately struggled to cut its losses as megacap tech couldn't find a way to return to the top of the list of fashionable investing despite a slip in U.S. bond yields. 
The S&P 500 was 0.2% lower, but had been down nearly 1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.31%, or 104 points, the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1%, but had been down more than 1%.
Tech stocks closed off the lows as ({23705|U.S. rates}} turned negative after hitting 14-month highs, but with rates expected to resume their climb higher, investors continue to abandon longer-duration stocks.   
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was exception to the selling in the so-called fab 5 stocks, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) ended lower.
As well as the impact of rising rates, Amazon was in the spotlight as investors await the results of a historic vote in Alabama that could establish the first union for Amazon workers.  
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, racked up a 4% gain, helping the broader Nasdaq end above its lows, as investors digested bitter-sweet news.
Tesla warned it was facing problems scaling up production of its semi-truck, blaming battery tech supply issues. The electric automaker, however, is believed to be mulling a deal with Toyota to develop a small SUV platform, according to media reports.
Energy stocks also kept the broader market on the defensive, extending its weak start to the week ahead, as the risk premium in oil prices from supply disruptions linked to the Suez Canal saga faded after the container ship -- that had blocked the key maritime trading route—was freed.

129,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 30, 2021 04:36PM ET</span>","Billionaire Westons Trade Food for Real Estate, Seeking Growth","George Weston Ltd. said last week that it would sell off Weston Foods, the commercial bakery business that gave the company its start in 1882. In turn, the company said it will focus more on its real estate portfolio, which it cobbled together through decades of building out new grocery stores and keeps growing in value as Canadian property prices boom.
“Right now we probably have more potential development sites than anybody,” Mario Barrafato, chief financial officer of Weston’s publicly traded property vehicle, Choice Properties Real Estate Investment Trust, said in an interview. “When you look at the amount of properties we have in the Greater Toronto Area, Greater Vancouver and Montreal, there’s a long, long-term potential over time.”
With its plans to transform some retail locations into mixed-use developments, including residential towers, Weston joins major North American shopping-mall operators like Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE:SPG). and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. in trying to wring more value from their existing real estate assets. Weston’s core properties are anchored mostly by supermarkets and pharmacies that have done well during the pandemic -- in contrast to enclosed shopping malls, which have been clobbered by e-commerce and government-ordered shutdowns.
Weston executives and public officials appeared together Tuesday on a videoconference with reporters to discuss the site of a new neighborhood under development on Toronto’s east side. The C$1.5 billion ($1.2 billion) project will redevelop a shopping mall with local developer Daniels Corp., with the first phase of the 19-acre project to include two condominium towers, one block of rental apartments, offices, retail and educational space in partnership with the University of Toronto.
Executives say the redevelopment of the Golden Mile Shopping Center in Toronto’s Scarborough area is emblematic of its ambitions for some of the 700-plus properties it controls in cities where housing costs and property values are soaring.
Long View
The new strategy is years in the making, led by family scion Galen G. Weston. First the real estate assets were spun out from Weston-controlled grocery chain Loblaw Cos. in 2013. Five years later, Choice acquired a competitor and is now Canada’s biggest REIT by market value.
Although Loblaw still accounts for the vast majority of George Weston’s annual revenue, Choice Properties’ plans to redevelop more sites and add tenants beyond its own grocery stores are intended to increase its weight within the group.
“We are ultimately owned by a family and therefore we can take a very long view,” Rael Diamond, Choice Properties’ chief executive officer, said in an interview. “It’s taking land in a well-located area which generally has retail uses, and densifying that land. And residential will be the most significant part of that mixed-use community.”
The strategy has its risks. By moving away from food-making and toward real estate, George Weston is trading a largely recession-proof business for a more cyclical one. This may be particularly true in Canada, where frenetic condo development in Vancouver and Toronto in recent years has fueled fears of a bubble. At the same time, a shortage of housing supply overall has pushed home prices across Canada to record highs.
Choice Properties’ development pipeline includes four other mixed-use projects like the one in Scarborough, 15 projects on land that’s currently empty, six projects dedicated solely to residential use and 17 sites devoted to expanded retail.
“The existing footage will increase significantly, and therefore you can generate far more income, and therefore the property will be worth significantly more in value,” Diamond said. Speaking of the Weston family, whose net worth is more than $10 billion, he said: “That particular family, as you know, has a very, very long term view and a very long term horizon. Therefore we’re investing for the long term.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended down slightly on Tuesday, with investors selling tech-related growth shares following a rise in U.S. Treasury yields.
At the same time, S&P 500 financials, industrials and consumer discretionary rose, extending the recent rotation out of growth and into so-called value names.
The Nasdaq was on track for its first monthly loss since November following the recent rise in Treasury yields. Tech stocks, which have a low-rate environment heavily baked into their high valuations, have been among the hardest hit by the rise in yields.
""It's somewhat of a leadership-less market,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""Investors' preferences are flipping around here almost on a daily basis, primarily between tech plus and cyclicals.
""Cyclicals have certainly had the upper hand here for a while, trading off the reopening of the economy. Tech plus holds in there because it's really the promise of the future - it should provide investors with steady growth."" 
The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield hit a 14-month high of 1.776% early on Tuesday, but was at about 1.717% by late afternoon in New York.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 100.3 points, or 0.3%, to 33,071.07, the S&P 500 lost 12.21 points, or 0.31%, to 3,958.88 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 14.25 points, or 0.11%, to 13,045.39.

On Wednesday, President Joe Biden will unveil more details about the first stage of his infrastructure plan, which could be worth as much as $4 trillion.
Bank stocks rebounded as investors took heart from signs that the impact from the fall of a U.S. hedge fund did not ripple out to broader markets.

 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co jumped after the lender said it had a prime brokerage relationship with Archegos Capital and that it no longer had any exposure and did not experience any losses.

Looking ahead to Q1 2021, adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of 86 cents to 90 cents for the quarter on revenue of between $1.10 billion to $1.13 billion.
The company opened six net new company-operated stores during the quarter, ending with 521 stores.
For 2021, adjusted EPS was guided in the range of $6.30 to $6.45 for the year on revenue of $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion. Wall Street was looking for EPS of $6.75 on revenue of $5.43 billion.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 eased from session lows Monday as traders snapped up bank stocks following a dip a day earlier, while battered tech stocks pared some losses after rates retreated from 14-month highs.
The S&P 500 was 0.1% lower, but had been down nearly 1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.16%, or 52 points, the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.04%, but had been down more than 1%.
With one eye on the earnings season which kicks off early April, and optimism that rising rate environment will boost bank stocks, investors took advantage of Monday's slump in major Wall Street banks.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) was one of the biggest gainers after announcing that it ""did not experience losses related to closing out our exposure” related to the $20 billion liquidation of Archegos Capital Management.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) were up around 2%.
Other Archegos-linked stocks also rebounded, with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) and ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) in the green.
Tech stocks pared some losses as ({23705|U.S. rates}} turned negative after hitting 14-month highs, but they are expected to continue their climb amid expectations for steady economic growth ahead.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was exception to the selling in the so-called fab 5 stocks, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were lower.
As well as the impact of rising rates, Amazon was in the spotlight as investors await the results of a historic vote in Alabama that could establish the first union for Amazon workers.  
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, was up more than 3% helping the broader Nasdaq off its lows, as investors digested bitter-sweet news.
Tesla warned it it facing problems scaling up production of its semi-truck, blaming battery tech supply issues. The electric automaker, however, is believed to be mulling a deal with Toyota to develop a small SUV platform, according to media reports.
Energy stocks also kept the broader market in red, extending its weak start to the week ahead, as the risk premium in oil prices from supply disruptions linked to the Suez Canal saga faded after the container ship -- that had blocked the key maritime trading route—was freed.

Brussels and Rome have been in talks since the beginning of this year over Italy's plan to restructure the airline through the launch of a new, state-owned company called ITA.
""Alitalia's situation was assessed in the light of the stalled talks with the European Commission,"" Giorgetti said in a statement after meeting Alitalia's special commissioners.
""We therefore believe need a new plan of action is necessary... to allow the company to keep operating,"" Giorgetti added, without saying what this plan might be.
Flights to and from Italy have dwindled due to COVID-19, but Rome is hoping for a pick-up in time for the summer tourist season so that ITA can get off to a solid start.
To keep the prospect alive and continue to pay Alitalia staff, the government could push on with the sale of its aircraft and other assets to ITA while it tries to break the stalemate with Brussels, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
The main stumbling block in talks between Rome and Brussels is an EU request that the new ITA company give up a significant number of the slots held by Alitalia at Milan's Linate airport, two other sources told Reuters last week.

Alitalia operated more than 50% of the Linate slots before the coronavirus pandemic hit, and ITA has so far refused to accept a major reduction.

The commercial-van unit of  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) will build the next-generation eSprinter at its plant north of Charleston, South Carolina, alongside a combustion-engine version of the van, Mercedes said Tuesday in a statement. It’s spending about 350 million euros ($410 million) to convert three plants -- the one in South Carolina and two in Germany -- to make the new vehicle.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). helped spark demand for electric commercial vehicles in 2019 when it ordered 100,000 vans from Rivian Automotive Inc. Amazon, which is a Rivian shareholder, also bought 1,800 eSprinter vans from Mercedes last year for use in European markets.
Electric delivery vans will sell at a rate of about 190,000 a year globally by 2030, according to a forecast from Guidehouse Insights. Electric trucks of all kinds, including work vehicles and garbage trucks, will be 600,000 a year.
Detroit Will Fight Startups Over Commercial Vans: Hyperdrive
Mercedes’s announcement comes a day before President Joe Biden is set to unveil an expansion of government spending, which may include infrastructure investments to combat climate change and support electrification.
The eSprinter is based on a modular platform that can be used for a larger variety of body types than the current model, Mercedes has said.
The German automaker will have plenty of competition in the electric-van market. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co., the largest commercial-vehicle maker in the U.S., says it will start selling its E-Transit van later this year. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). has said it will launch a new unit called BrightDrop, with plans to sell an EV600 van that can go 250 miles on a charge.
There are also cash-rich startups thanks to the boom in blank-check companies. U.K. upstart Arrival plans to open a second plant in the U.S. to make delivery vans for  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS)., while Electric Last Mile Solutions has confirmed plans to build plug-in vans in a former Hummer factory in Indiana this fall.

141,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2021 02:30PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Investors press companies on human rights in Xinjiang,"By Ross Kerber and Victoria Waldersee
BOSTON/LISBON (Reuters) - A group of religious and socially conscious investors and other funds are ramping up pressure on Western companies over alleged human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang region, highlighting the challenges for brands trying to maintain their business ties amid rising tensions.
The group of more than 50 investors, backed by the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, said it is in the process of contacting more than 40 companies, including H&M, VF Corp (NYSE:VFC), Hugo Boss and Zara-owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX), requesting more information about their supply chains and urging them to quit situations that could lead to human rights abuses.
Anita Dorett, program director for the Investor Alliance for Human Rights, which put together the request to the fashion brands and other big corporate names, said she was worried that some companies had moved to scrub language about policies on forced labour from their websites, or pledged to buy more cotton from Xinjiang, in fear of a backlash from Chinese social media and companies.
""Companies do not prioritise resources to digging into their supply chains and mapping them out. As investors, we want transparency and accountability,"" Dorett said in an interview. She added that ""This is their business. If they don't know what's happening, who will?""
'COMMERCIAL RETALIATION'
Over the past week, H&M, Burberry,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) and other Western brands have been hit by consumer boycotts in China after raising concerns about forced labour in Xinjiang.
The wave of boycotts coincided with sanctions imposed by Britain, Canada, the European Union and the United States over what they say are human rights abuses taking place in Xinjiang.
China denies all accusations of abuse. 
The investor alliance alleged that companies removing or moving statements in relation to Xinjiang were doing so in fear of commercial retaliation from the Chinese government. It also said compliance rules were being developed in other markets, including the European Union, obliging them to fully disclose their supply chains. 
The Human Rights section of H&M’s website hmgroup.com on Friday no longer carried a link to a 2020 statement on Xinjiang. The statement could still be accessed through the page’s direct address.
Inditex's statement on forced labour on its website was no longer available as of last Thursday.
H&M and Inditex did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the investor group's approach. 
H&M has declined to comment on the removal of details from its website. Inditex has not responded to requests to comment on removal of information from its website. 
VF Corp's original statement on Xinjiang was no longer available, with a new statement published on a different section of the site. A VF spokeswoman said on Tuesday the company had ""not changed our position, our policies or our practices"" but did not address the new location of its statement.
Hugo Boss said last week on Chinese social media that it would continue sourcing Xinjiang cotton. Company spokeswoman Carolin Westermann said on Friday an undated English-language statement on its website stating that ""so far, HUGO BOSS has not procured any goods originating in the Xinjiang region from direct suppliers"" was its official position and that the Chinese statement was not authorised.
Westermann reiterated the company's position on Tuesday, adding that it was in ""active exchange with NGOs and other key stakeholders, including investors, to outline our standards, values and sustainability initiatives in more detail.""
GROWING PRESSURE 
Among investors, environmental, social and governance funds have taken in big inflows of cash, putting companies on the spot and prompting new financial disclosures on topics that were once considered fringe issues best left to governments to address.
Assets in sustainable funds hit a record $1.7 trillion in 2020, based on data from fund management industry tracker Morningstar.
The Investor Alliance for Human Rights has more than 160 institutional investors and other organisations as members, representing more than $5 trillion in assets under management currently, its website said.
The New York-based Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which is backing the approach to the companies, has a broad range of members, including religious groups, public and union pension funds, and a number of other asset managers.
The investor alliance does not include top U.S. fund groups BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard Group Inc. With $16 trillion in assets between them both companies are large shareholders in many of the companies under pressure in China, based on Refinitiv data.
Both companies have ramped up their ESG efforts by publishing more details of their engagements and proxy votes at portfolio companies and by introducing new funds using ESG criteria to pick holdings.
A BlackRock spokesman noted a recent paper it published stating: ""Failure to address human rights-related risks can reverberate across a company’s entire value chain, which may ...impact shareholder value.""
A Vanguard spokeswoman said that it ""takes human rights issues very seriously, including allegations of forced labor. If a company’s business practices or products put people’s health or safety at risk, they too can present long-term financial risks to investors.""

Analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu raised the 2023 profit estimate by 2% to $2.10 from $2.05, accounting for higher yields, with some offset from the increase in fuel prices. 
American Airlines got hit hard as the pandemic led to suspended flights around the world amid lockdowns. As vaccinations are starting to become widely available, shares have increased, with the stock rallying some 60% this year. 
American is the best positioned of the network carriers to outperform through the recovery thanks to its younger fleet at less than 11 years compared to peers at about 15 years and a strong network as the sole operator of 37% of routes vs 25% for peers, StreetInsider reported Jefferies as saying.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday signaled it could narrow the scope of a class action lawsuit against  TransUnion  (NYSE:TRU) in which thousands of people sought damages after the credit reporting company flagged their names as matching those on a government list of suspected terrorists and drug traffickers.
The justices heard arguments in TransUnion's appeal of a lower court ruling that upheld a jury verdict against the Chicago-based company in a class-action suit and ordered it to pay $40 million in damages. Credit reporting companies provide information on an individual's borrowing and bill-paying history to lenders and other businesses.
The legal issue before the Supreme Court is whether the lawsuit, which focused on a federal law called the Fair Credit Reporting Act that requires consumer reporting agencies to provide correct information, should ever have been certified as a class action. The case offers the justices an opportunity to further scale back class actions by requiring stricter criteria for plaintiffs to join, a goal of the business community.
The lead plaintiff, a California man named Sergio Ramirez, and other consumers were incorrectly identified by TransUnion as possible security threats. 
During the arguments, some justices indicated there was not sufficient evidence that all of the class members had suffered a ""concrete injury"" as required when filing such a lawsuit. There were 8,185 class members in the litigation whose names matched names on the government list. At trial it was established only that TransUnion had revealed that information publicly on 1,853 of them.
""I think you have a good argument with respect to the 1,853 ... but I'm more concerned about 6,632 whose information was not in essence published,"" conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh told the plaintiffs' lawyer, Samuel Issacharoff.
Conservative Justice Samuel Alito questioned TransUnion's lawyer, Paul Clement, on his claim that for most of the class members no harm was done. 
""The class members whose information was disclosed to third parties certainly had reasons to worry about that, wouldn't you say?"" Alito asked.
The justices possibly could send the case back to lower courts for further litigation on how many plaintiffs could potentially recover damages.
Ramirez sued in federal court in 2012 after an incident the previous year at a Nissan (OTC:NSANY) automobile dealership. When the dealership performed a credit check using TransUnion, the report noted that Ramirez's name appeared to partially match two names included on a federal government list of people barred from conducting business in the United States because of national security concerns. Neither person was Ramirez.
Although his wife was able to purchase a vehicle, Ramirez said he was embarrassed and shocked and ended up canceling an overseas vacation over concern about the list. After requesting a copy of his credit file, TransUnion sent him a separate mailing stating that his name was matched with two on the list. 
The lawsuit noted that the mailing that mentioned the match incorrectly stated that such notification was not part of the actual credit report that creditors or employers would see when, in fact, it was part of it.
TransUnion argued that merely being sent the mailings was not a concrete injury. 
A jury in 2017 awarded damages of around $60 million to the class as a whole, including $52 million in punitive damages. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2020 upheld the jury verdict but reduced the damages to about $40 million.

The business community has long sought to curb class action lawsuits, which can lead to big payouts to plaintiffs and their lawyers. TransUnion is backed in the case by various business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as well as companies including The  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD), eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google.

Investing.com --  Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG) jumped 9% after re-announcing plans to build a green hydrogen production plant with Brookfield Renewable.  
The same news was published on Sept. 24, but it failed to move the market at the time. 
Plug Power, which supplies hydrogen fuel cells for forklifts, will use renewable energy from Brookfield Renewable’s Holtwood hydroelectric facility as part of a previously announced partnership, the company said in a statement. The plant will be located along the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania, and is expected to be online by late 2022. Once operational, the plant is projected to produce approximately 15 metric-tons of 100% emissions-free liquid hydrogen per day. It is also expected to create more than 25 green energy jobs in Pennsylvania. 
“This is another step in our quest to build the green hydrogen economy in the USA and globally thereafter,” Plug Power Chief Executive Officer Andy Marsh said in a statement Tuesday. “We are proud to be able to bring quality jobs and invest in the local economy in Lancaster County, PA through this green hydrogen production facility.”
“We are excited to be partnering with Brookfield Renewable, a global leader in renewable generation, and anticipate opportunities to build upon this relationship in the coming years,” Marsh said in a statement in September. “This marks important progress in our steady march to achieve our overall hydrogen strategy of building green liquid hydrogen generation facilities with strategic partners in the U.S. and globally thereafter.”
It has been what they like to call a rollercoaster year for Plug Power. Shares rallied through January, up about 1,000%, over the previous 12 months. They have since fallen by 50%, in part because the company said March 16 that it was restating financial statements for fiscal 2018 and 2019 after finding accounting errors mostly related to noncash items, including how it classified some costs. It did not mess with its expected gross billings of $1.7 billion in 2024.

It will the first time that the government collects data on private wheat stocks based on information provided by both producers and millers, Conab said. 
The survey will be carried out between April 5 and April 23 in all regions of the country, and is expected to reveal the volume available for each of these products in private stocks.

(Reuters) -The National Labor Relations Board has begun reviewing ballots from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s workers in Alabama, who have voted on whether to form a union, with momentum for future labor organizing at America's second-largest private employer hanging in the balance.
Agents from the labor board began sifting through ballots sent to more than 5,800 workers at Amazon's Bessemer, Alabama-based warehouse at 10 a.m. CT (1500 GMT) on Tuesday, as part of a prolonged process expected to last days and spark legal challenges.
Tallying votes might not begin until later this week or next, after both Amazon and the union check the eligibility of ballots cast, said a person familiar with the process. Subsequent procedures and objections could further forestall a certified result, the person said.
Amazon has aggressively discouraged attempts by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) to become the first ever to organize one of the online retail giant's facilities in the United States.
A union victory would leave Amazon, second only to Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc with more than 800,000 employees nationwide, vulnerable to additional organizing efforts and represent a watershed moment for the U.S. labor movement, said Wilma Liebman, a former NLRB chair during the Obama administration.
""If the union manages to do this, this is really groundbreaking,"" Liebman said, noting the difficulty of forming unions in southern states, which have laws that discourage workplace organizing. ""Amazon is right to be worried.""
In a statement, Amazon said, ""Our employees know the truth—starting wages of $15 or more, health care from day one, and a safe and inclusive workplace. We encouraged all of our employees to vote and hope they did so."" 
RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum said: ""This campaign has already been a victory in many ways. Even though we don't know how the vote will turn out, we believe we have opened the door to more organizing around the country.""
The union drive has drawn significant attention from elected officials in Washington. U.S. President Joe Biden at the end of February defended workers' rights to form unions free from intimidation and pointed to voting in Alabama while not specifically mentioning Amazon.
A congressional delegation visited Bessemer earlier in March and Senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont Democrat, descended on the area Friday to hold a rally with workers and support the organizing push.
Amazon has mounted its own campaign, sending text messages urging current and also former workers to vote against forming a union and telling them that they might sacrifice certain benefits if the push succeeds, a notion the union has disputed.
A vote-count battle between Amazon and the union may ensue over the validity of former employees' ballots, Reuters previously reported.
Dave Clark, chief executive of Amazon's consumer division, last week railed against Sanders on Twitter ahead of the visit, questioning the senator's progressive bona fides while juxtaposing the e-commerce company's $15 starting wage with a figure of $11.75 in Vermont.

""So if you want to hear about $15 an hour and health care, Senator Sanders will be speaking downtown. But if you would like to make at least $15 an hour and have good health care, Amazon is hiring,"" Clark tweeted.
Sanders, responding on Twitter, questioned why so much money has been spent to discourage union organizing for better pay, conditions and benefits.

Investing.com –  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) shares jumped 4% on Tuesday after a statement on its relationship with the troubled Archegos Capital calmed traders’ concerns.
The 169-year-old Wells Fargo said it had a prime brokerage relationship with Archegos Capital and that it no longer had any exposure and did not experience any losses.
Nomura (NYSE:NMR) and  Credit Suisse  (NYSE:CS) are among the major banks hit by their exposure to Archegos, the private investment office of former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang.
The Japanese investment bank has warned of a possible $2 billion loss, while Credit Suisse (SIX:CSGN) said a default on margin calls by a U.S.-based fund could be ""highly significant and material"" to its first-quarter results. Many had speculated Wells Fargo to be in that unfortunate list, as well.
Losses at Archegos sparked a fire sale of stocks that singed ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC), Discovery Class A (NASDAQ:DISCA), GSX Techedu (NYSE:GSX), Vipshop (NYSE:VIPS) and Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) over last two trading sessions. 
A Reuters report said Archegos was unable to meet banks' calls for more collateral to secure equity swap trades they had partly financed. After those positions fell sharply in value, lenders sold big blocks of securities to recoup what they were owed, Reuters said.

Losses at Archegos, a family office run by former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang, sparked fears among investors that banks would be forced to take big write-downs after extending billions of dollars in leverage to the fund. 
""We were well collateralized at all times over the last week and no longer have any exposure,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said https://refini.tv/31xJVrC in a short statement. 
The bank's shares were up 3.6% in morning trade. 
J.P. Morgan research analysts said in a note earlier on Tuesday that Wells Fargo's likely involvement in the Archegos Capital fallout comes as a surprise and carries the risk of additional regulatory scrutiny for the bank or a delay in its asset cap being lifted.
""Our key concerns for Wells Fargo are reputational risk and whether this would increase regulatory scrutiny or delay its asset cap being lifted if it incurs any losses and/or probes that expose inadequate risk and controls,"" the analysts said.

Wells Fargo has been in regulators' penalty box since 2016 when details of a sales scandal first emerged, leading to the departure of two chief executives, billions of dollars in litigation and remedial costs and the Fed ordering the bank in 2018 to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion.
Bloomberg News reported on Monday that five block trades valued at a combined $2.14 billion were executed by Wells Fargo. The bank solicited interest in 18 million ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) shares at $48 per share before the market opened Monday, the report said, citing a person familiar with the matter.

Investing.com -- Gap jumped more than 4% after analysts called it a post-pandemic winner amid the sale of a premium children's fashion brand.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) see the company ready for a comeback amid an attempt to turn around the business, Dow Jones reported. The company also unloaded Janie and Jack, which makes high-end clothing for kids, for an undisclosed amount to Go Global Retail, a fashion and retail investment platform.
Analysts expect demand for new clothes to jump with vaccinations increasing and a massive accumulation of consumer savings.  
""We could see returns to pre-pandemic activities that should catalyze stagnant apparel spending -- such as a return to offices, taking long-delayed vacations or social gatherings. We believe as outside-the-home activities are more widely adopted, a flood of pent-up demand could drive a major rebound in apparel by 2H21,"" Wells Fargo said, according to Dow Jones. 
Gap acquired Janie and Jack in 2019 amid the Gymboree bankruptcy. 
“As part of Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS).’s Power Plan 2023, and exemplified by this transaction, we are prioritizing strategic focus and resources behind the growth and potential of our billion-dollar brands in Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic and Athleta,"" said Sally Gilligan, head of strategy for Gap.

Investing.com –  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) shares rose 4% Tuesday after Truist analyst Matthew Thornton upgraded the stock to buy, influenced by attractive valuations and an anticipated boost from its platform business.
Thornton previously had a hold on the stock. His target price is $367, which implies a gain of 18% from the current price.
Roku last week launched an ad brand studio ahead of TV upfronts. On March 19, it announced the acquisition of ""This Old House,"" a popular TV home improvement program.
Thornton noted that the firm's gross margin estimates for the platform business are 4% higher than consensus for the first quarter as well as for the full year and 7% ahead for 2022. Truist sees similar upside levels for revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Catalysts for the upside could include TCL Roku TVs rolling out in the U.K. and Brazil, and Roku's ""progress with linear addressable"" TV, which could ""add low-hundreds-of-millions gross profit.""
Merrill Lynch analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya reiterated a buy on Roku on March 22, setting a price target of $500. This is 60% higher than the stock's current price."

(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) said on Tuesday that it aims to place 50,000 people in jobs that require technology skills as part of a broader push being undertaken with its professional networking website LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) to help workers affected by the coronavirus pandemic move into new fields. 
The jobs will be in what Microsoft calls its ""ecosystem"" of companies that use or help sell its products.
The effort started last year as pandemic-related business closures hit service workers much harder than technology workers and other white-collar employees who could work from home. LinkedIn made free many of its paid digital skills training courses, covering topics such as software development, data analysis and financial analysis.
LinkedIn said it will extend the free courses until the end of this year. Microsoft and LinkedIn had aimed to get 25 million people to try the courses and said Tuesday that the figure hit 30.7 million, most from the United States but with many from almost every other part of the world.
""I wasn’t expecting 91 participants from Antarctica,"" Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a blog post announcing the results.
Microsoft, which said it found that digital training courses work best when supported by local nonprofit groups who help people learning new skills, said it would work with those groups to place 50,000 people in jobs that require technology skills over the next three years. The program will initially focus on the United States but expand beyond that starting next year.

The push is one of the first times that Microsoft has worked closely with LinkedIn and its GitHub software coding tool service, both of which Microsoft has allowed to operate with relatively autonomy.

162,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2021 10:15AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse in firing line after Archegos losses,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Matt Scuffham
ZURICH/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Pressure was mounting on  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) on Tuesday over losses linked to the downfall of Archegos Capital, with analysts and investors warning dividend and share buyback plans may need to go on hold.
Losses at Archegos, a family office run by former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang, sparked a sell-off in bank stocks on Monday as investors feared they would be forced to take big write-downs after extending billions of dollars in leverage to the fund. 
Global lenders may lose more than $6 billion on Archegos, sources familiar with trades involving the U.S. investment firm have said.
Credit Suisse and Japan's Nomura are set to bear the brunt of this, according to statements from the banks and sources, with one source close to the Swiss lender saying its losses could be as high as $4 billion. The bank has declined to comment on the size of losses.
Credit Suisse's shares fell further on Tuesday, trading down 3.6% at 1355 GMT, taking their loss so far this week to 16%. Shares in most other major European banks were up in morning trade.
U.S. banks were trading slightly higher premarket, with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) up 0.7%, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) up 0.3%, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) 0.2% higher and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) up 0.2%. 
The prospect of big losses at Credit Suisse is piling pressure on the lender's management, already reeling from the fallout surrounding collapsed supply chain finance company Greensill.
On Tuesday Ethos, which advises shareholders on corporate governance, said Credit Suisse investors should vote against board and executive pay at its upcoming annual meeting.
""These new cases add up to an incredible number of governance failures,"" Ethos Foundation Chief Executive Vincent Kaufmann said.
Investors are likely to question why Credit Suisse appears to have suffered larger losses on Archegos than some of the fund's other brokers.
The brokerage arm of Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group on Tuesday flagged potential losses at its European subsidiary of around $300 million related to a U.S. client, declining to comment on whether that client was Archegos.
Two sources close to the matter confirmed reports that several of Archegos' biggest banks discussed through Thursday night whether they could come to an agreement to limit the impact of unwinding the firm's positions.
However no firm agreement was reached, and Goldman Sachs made a large block trade of stock, of around $3 billion-$4 billion, before the market opened Friday in a trade agreed with the fund, according to one of the sources. 
""THE HITS JUST KEEP COMING""
Several analysts flagged on Tuesday that Credit Suisse's share buyback programme and dividend may be at risk as a result of the scandal. 
""The hits just keep coming for Credit Suisse,"" wrote Eoin Mullany at Berenberg.
""We believe Credit Suisse will need to suspend its share buyback while in the longer term we believe it will lead to it reassessing the way it takes and manages risk.""
One Credit Suisse debt investor said the bank was unlikely to be able to restore its share buyback programme before 2023. 
The bank is also likely to face regulatory demands for a larger capital buffer and incur higher borrowing costs, the investor said, adding Credit Suisse may consider shrinking its private banking operations. 
Analysts at Citi said they estimated the bank's pretax losses at around $3.5 billion. 
Credit Suisse declined to comment on its buyback plan or dividend policy. The bank had planned to buy back at least 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.06 billion) worth of stock this year. 
Its regulator has already told it to hold more capital due to the Greensill fallout, which the bank said at the time would not affect its buyback plans. 
Other major banks have so far not said they expect a major impact from the downfall of Archegos, with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) saying on Monday it had not incurred losses after ""de-risking"" its Archegos exposure.
Goldman and Morgan Stanley were quick to offload shares on Friday, averting a material financial impact, sources familiar with their trades have said.
Archegos's problems started last week when a disappointing stock sale by media giant ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) triggered devastating bank margin calls for the fund, three sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.

Regulators in the United States, UK, Switzerland and Japan have all said they are closely monitoring developments.

Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said on a webcast on Tuesday that the recovery in air travel in Europe had been ""very disappointing"" so far in 2021 but that traffic was rebounding in the United States.
The aerospace industry has been attempting to estimate how long it will take to return to record pre-pandemic traffic levels seen in 2019, with average estimates focusing on 2024.
""We think on the single-aisle business, on the narrowbody planes, it is probably going to be around 2023, and for the widebody planes around 2024, 2025: We don't really know,"" Faury said.
""There is more uncertainty on how fast and how strongly the international traffic will recover,"" he added.
The Airbus CEO played down concerns that air travel would be permanently dented as a result of the pandemic, as companies cut costs and increasingly adopt video-meeting technology.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) earlier cut Airbus to ""neutral"" from ""buy,"" citing a glut of planes and a risk that business travel would be permanently impaired, leading to long-term traffic demand 10% below pre-coronavirus expectations. 
But speaking on the webcast, hosted by air traffic control agency Eurocontrol, Faury said that once it did recover, travel demand would be ""not very different from what it was before"".
For now, Eurocontrol says domestic air passenger travel and freight flights are rising in Europe but that ""normal operations are still severely damaged by the pandemic"".

Low-cost airline traffic is around 84% below pre-pandemic levels, director general Eamonn Brennan said on the webcast.
Key to reopening markets will be the pace of vaccine rollouts, with progress expected in coming weeks, he added.

Investing.com – McCormick (NYSE:MKC) gave investors a pinch of good news, boosting its full year sales forecast as the company expects us to keep up the home cooking. 
Shares rose 4.5% after the spice maker said the shift in consumer demand to at-home consumption to be sustained at higher than pre-pandemic level, with sales expected to increase by 8% to 10% compared to 2020, up from a previous project of 7% to 9%. McCormick reported earnings per share for the quarter ended in February of 72 cents compared to the expected 58 cents, on sales of $1.48 billion versus the estimated $1.37 billion.
McCormick reported a 22% sales increase in the first quarter from the year-ago period as the pandemic kept us homebound and rediscovering home cooking (as well as take out and delivery). Sales from Cholula Hot Sauce and FONA, acquired late last year, added 4% to the sales increase.  
The current consensus among 5 TipRanks analysts is for a ‘hold’ rating of shares in McCormick, with an average target of $89.40. The analysts’ price targets range from a high of $97 to a low of $71, a variation of 8% to 21% from the stock’s current level.

166,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2021 09:50AM ET</span>",Analysis: Nomura faces tough questions over global plans after U.S. client loss,"By Makiko Yamazaki and Sumeet Chatterjee
TOKYO/HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) will have to sharpen its focus on risk management systems and may need to rein in its U.S. ambitions, analysts said after the Japanese bank flagged a possible $2 billion loss tied to a single U.S. client.
Nomura and other investment banks may lose more than $6 billion after lending to Archegos Capital, a U.S. investment firm run by former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang that was forced to liquidate large equity bets last week in a sell-off that rocked Wall Street.
It raises tough questions for Nomura, Japan's biggest brokerage and investment bank, which has been on a drive to expand beyond its domestic market, mainly with a push in the United States, and as it seeks to join the top league of global investment banks.
""The key question that comes up is what were the compliance and risk folks doing all this while?"" said one person with knowledge of a debate now going on inside Nomura.
""There were definitely plans to do more (in the United States) and those plans will now be put on the hold until they sort out this mess. The exact extent of the losses is not clear yet,"" said the person, who was not authorised to speak to the media and asked not to be named.
Some brokerages have cut their ratings on Nomura, whose shares have fallen 17% in two sessions. 
Nomura is not alone.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) warned of losses linked to a U.S. client, which like Nomura it did not name, although sources said it was Archegos. The brokerage arm of Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group on Tuesday flagged potential losses of about $300 million, also related to an unnamed U.S. client. 
Yet it deals a particular blow to Nomura and Chief Executive Kentaro Okuda, who has been running the bank for about a year. He has been driving the Japanese firm's global expansion after stop-start efforts in the past decade.
MARKET TURBULENCE
""Nomura has been repeating this cycle – expanding the overseas business and restructuring it after a financial hit. This is exactly the same pattern again,"" said Fumio Matsumoto, chief strategist at Okasan Securities.
""To become a top global bank, Nomura would have to take risk with emerging clients and increase its share, in the hope of eventually getting conventional clients. It's extremely hard, but Nomura has no choice,"" Matsumoto said.
Nomura declined to comment.
Till now, under Okuda, international operations have grown strongly. Overseas business, including the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia excluding Japan, tripled its profit in the nine months to December to 167.2 billion yen ($1.52 billion).
Nomura's U.S. income in the same period surged to 126.8 billion yen, after its reported just 7.4 billion yen in profit in the year to March 2020 and a 114.1 billion loss in the year to March 2019, according to its latest financial filings.
""I still feel that our international business is seen as unstable, affected by market conditions,"" Okuda, who previously headed U.S. operations, told an investor event in December.
But he added: ""We are transforming into an organization capable of delivering consistent revenues despite market turbulence.""
Turbulence looks set to continue for now.
""If it proves that there has been a big loss on transactions with only one client, there will be questions asked about the company's risk management system,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) wrote, as it lowered its rating on Nomura stock to ""underweight"" from ""neutral"".
Morningstar Equity Research said Nomura could decide to take fewer risks in some areas where it had been more aggressive, such as U.S.-listed equity options.
""We think the unexpected loss may end the relative honeymoon new CEO Kentaro Okuda has enjoyed since assuming the top post last April,"" it said.

The company's shares, which were at the heart of a Reddit-driven retail trading frenzy early this year, rose nearly 5% in pre-market trading.
GameStop is in the process of shifting its business away from the brick-and-mortar retailer model into an e-commerce business that can compete with large-scale retailers like  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, as well as technology companies  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony Corp (T:6758). 
Signaling a broader overhaul, at least two executives have recently departed - Chief Customer Officer Frank Hamlin and Chief Financial Officer Jim Bell.
Wilke, who has spent nearly seven years at Amazon and last led its Fresh Stores business, will oversee growth strategies and marketing at GameStop.
The company had hired another former Amazon executive, Jenna Owens, as Chief Operating Officer earlier this month. She had managed multi-channel fulfillment and distribution at Amazon.
This was preceded by the appointment of Matt Francis as its first ever Chief Technology Officer last month. He was also an Amazon head of the engineering team at Amazon Web Services.
The shakeup proliferated the company's board as it announced the expected retirement of eight directors at its annual meeting this year.
Earlier this month, GameStop had announced the formation of a three-member committee chaired by Ryan Cohen, which is responsible for the moves leading to a re-jigging of the company's leadership.

The company on Tuesday also named former Chewy (NYSE:CHWY).com executives Andrea Wolfe and Tom Peterson to lead brand development and merchandising, respectively.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - German automaker Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY)'s U.S. unit confirmed Tuesday it will rename its U.S. operations as ""Voltswagen of America"" as it shifts its focus to electric vehicles.
The revised name takes effect in May and the announcement came after several outlets on Monday reported on a draft release mistakenly posted on the automaker's U.S. website. 
""We might be changing out our K for a T, but what we aren't changing is this brand's commitment to making best-in-class vehicles for drivers and people everywhere,"" said Scott Keogh, president and CEO of Voltswagen of America in a statement.
The German automaker has committed to sell one million EVs worldwide by 2025. 
The traditional VW Dark Blue color logo will remain for gas-powered vehicles and it will use a new light blue logo for electric vehicles. The company will use ""Voltswagen"" as an exterior badge on all EV models and gas vehicles will only have the VW emblem.
The name change will not impact other VW brands like Audi, Porsche or Bentley.
VW says new exterior and interior signs will soon appear on all U.S. properties and dealerships.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) in 2015 admitted using illegal software to rig diesel engine tests in the United States, sparking Germany’s biggest corporate crisis and costing the carmaker more than 32 billion euros ($38 billion) in fines, refits and legal costs.
The German automaker, which has operated in the United States since 1955, said on Twitter: ""We know, 66, is a unusual age to change your name, but we've always been young at heart."" 
The world's second-largest carmaker expects to double electric vehicle deliveries and boost profits for its core brand this year after stepping up its switch to fully electric vehicles.

The Volkswagen brand aims to invest 16 billion euros ($19 billion) in electrification and digitalisation by 2025.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Tuesday, as bond yields continued to exert pressure on tech stocks, while cautionary messaging from U.S. health authorities kept a temporary chill on reopening trades. 
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 30 points, or 0.1%, at 33,141 points, while the S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down 0.7%.
With the data and earnings calendars light, attention is largely on the launch of investment guru Cathie Wood's new space-themed exchange-traded fund, the first launched by Wood's company in two years. The fund's largest holding, Trimble (NASDAQ:TRMB) stock, enjoyed its moment in the spotlight, rising 3.1% to a new all-time high. However, Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE), which has a weighting of just under 2% in the ETF, was less fortunate, falling 0.6%.
Gainers were led by the stocks dumped so aggressively at the end of last week by the banks servicing Archegos Capital Management, the family office of former hedge fund manager and convicted fraudster Bill Hwang. The rises were largely unspectacular, but appeared to suggest that the forced selling by Archegos' banks was over.
Vipshop (NYSE:VIPS) stock rose 7.6%, while GSX Techedu  (NYSE:GSX) stock rose 3.6% and Discovery A (NASDAQ:DISCA) shares rose 3.8%. ViacomCBS Inc (NASDAQ:VIAC) stock also eked out gains of 1.5%.
The market largely shrugged off news from the Federal Housing Finance Agency and Standard & Poor's that house prices rose at their fastest rate in at least seven years in February, given that the rise in mortgage rates since the start of the year seems likely to put a brake on that development soon.  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) stock fell 0.9% while Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) stock, which is down some 40% from its February peak, rose 0.4%.
Treasury yields have consolidated just below their highs for the year over the last 24 hours, with the market bracing for President Joe Biden's announcement on infrastructure spending on Wednesday. The rising trend in bond yields has been supportive of banking stocks for most of this year, and that was true again on Tuesday, with JPMorgan  (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) all rising by between 1.9% and 2.6%. Goldman and Morgan Stanley were helped by reports that they had managed to dump their Archegos-related stocks before Nomura and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), thus limiting their losses. By contrast, Credit Suisse  (NYSE:CS) ADRs fell another 3.8%. "

""Demand is no problem, but near-term cell supply makes it hard to scale Semi. This limitation will be less onerous next year,"" the billionaire entrepreneur said https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1376843024303583236.
Musk's statement was in response to a tweet which referred to a news report about the electric carmaker receiving an order for ten Semi trucks from MHX Leasing LLC.

When Musk unveiled the prototype of the futuristic, battery-powered Semi in 2017, he said the Class 8 truck would go into production by 2019. That timeline was later pushed to 2021 and the company said it expects to start delivering the model too.
Last week, Musk had suggested the bottlenecks would cause the mass production to be delayed until 2022.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Inc said on Tuesday it has purchased Betty Labs, the company behind sports-focused social audio app Locker Room, to accelerate its move into live audio.
New voice-based platforms, including invite-only social app Clubhouse, have seen rapid growth in recent months during the COVID-19 pandemic. Locker Room, launched in October 2020, became a popular spot for sports fans to chat and hold watch parties.
The music-streaming service said in the coming months it would ""evolve and expand"" Locker Room to offer sports, music, and cultural programming as well as live discussions with professional athletes, musicians and other personalities. 
""Creators and fans have been asking for live formats on Spotify, and we're excited that soon, we'll make them available to hundreds of millions of listeners and millions of creators on our platform,"" said Gustav Söderström, Chief Research & Development Officer at Spotify.
Spotify did not disclose the cost of the acquisition. Betty Labs was initially backed by Lightspeed Venture Partners and later by GV, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's venture capital arm, and Precursor Ventures. Last October, Betty Labs raised $9.3 million in seed funding led by GV.
""We are excited to join forces with Spotify and continue building the future of audio - we'll invest more in our product, open the experience to Spotify's audience, diversify our content offerings, and continue expanding the community we've built,"" said Betty Labs founder and CEO Howard Akumiah.
Spotify has also been making a push into podcasting, and has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to boost its podcast range and debuted a podcast advertising marketplace. 

Screenshots shared by a Twitter user last week showed Spotify was surveying some users about how often they used Clubhouse.  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) is also testing a live audio app Spaces, which it plans to publicly launch by April, and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) is reportedly dabbling with its own live audio offering.

MILAN (Reuters) - Leading investor advisers have urged shareholders in UniCredit to reject the proposed pay package of incoming Chief Executive Andrea Orcel at the April 15 annual meeting.
Orcel, the former head of investment banking at UBS, next month will take the reins of Italy's No. 2 bank, replacing Jean Pierre Mustier, who left in February following a strategy clash with the board. 
Orcel will receive an annual fixed salary of 2.5 million euros ($2.9 million) alongside variable remuneration worth up to twice that amount in shares, according to documents released before the meeting.
For the first year alone, the variable compensation is not subject to any performance conditions or claw-back clauses.
""This item warrants a vote against because of the problematic pay package of the new CEO,"" influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) said in a report seen by Reuters, taking aim in particular at the fully guaranteed bonus for 2021.
""UniCredit's generosity towards its new CEO clashes with the current global context, European Central Bank recommendation on executive compensation, and the sobriety of the Mustier era,"" ISS added, noting also Orcel has been unemployed since 2019.
The Italian banker left UBS to become the new Santander (MC:SAN) CEO, but the Spanish bank withdrew its offer. Orcel has sued Santander and a twice-postponed hearing in the 112 million euro court case is now scheduled for May 19.
In joining another employer, Orcel is relinquishing tens of millions in deferred payments that would have been due from UBS, and UniCredit has said it will not compensate him. 
Rival Glass Lewis also issued a similar recommendation, which was first reported by the Financial Times.
UniCredit declined to comment.
Orcel's pay is ""higher than most European peers with the exception of UBS (and Santander in a normal year) and higher than new Lloyds (LON:LLOY) CEO Charlie Nunn who is to receive 5.6 million pounds ($7.7 million),"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts wrote this month.
It also marks a stark change from Mustier, who had cut his salary by 40% to 1.2 million euros when he arrived at UniCredit in 2016 to preside over a restructuring that led to thousands of jobs being cut.
Mustier had further lowered his 2020 salary by 25% because of the pandemic and forfeited his 2.4 million euro variable pay. He left without any severance payment, as agreed when he joined, other than termination payments due by law.
By contrast, UniCredit next month will ask shareholders to amend its severance policy to more than double the maximum amount it can pay to 15 million euros.
Glass Lewis recommended rejecting the new policy, while ISS suggested voting in favour though it said the changes raised concerns. 
UniCredit has said changes to the remuneration policies aimed to improve its ability ""to attract and retain top-class talents"" with a target total compensation set at between the median and upper quartile of its European peers.

The actively managed ARK Space Exploration ETF (ticker ARKX) will primarily track U.S. and global companies engaged in space exploration and innovation.
When Ark filed for the fund in January it triggered an industry-wide rally -- such was the hype surrounding Wood, whose ETFs were among the best-performing of 2020. Since then Ark’s bets have been rattled amid a broader tech selloff.
The flagship Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) has posted investor exits for five days running, according to the latest data, the longest stretch of consecutive outflows since the fund started in 2014.
Nevertheless, Ark ETFs overall have attracted almost $16 billion of new cash this year, signaling demand for a new offering could be robust. Despite recent turbulence, all five of Wood’s existing actively-managed products are up more than 130% in the past 12 months.
At the outset, ARKX’s top two holdings are Trimble Inc. (NASDAQ:TRMB) and another Ark fund called the 3D Printing ETF (NYSE:PRNT) with weights of 8.6% and 6%, respectively. Other large stakes include  Kratos Defense &  Security Solutions Inc. (NASDAQ:KTOS), L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD). The fund aims to invest at least 80% of its assets in the space industry.
Possible competitors include the Procure Space ETF (NYSE:UFO), which was among those that rallied when Ark filed for the new fund. Assets in UFO have roughly tripled since then to $129 million.

Investing.com – PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD) rose Tuesday as the digital payments company enhanced its adoption of cryptocurrencies.
PayPal shares climbed almost 1% in Monday’s premarket following the announcement that customers with cryptocurrency holdings in the U.S. will be able to choose ‘check out with crypto’ within the wallet. The shares gave back some of their gains after the opening bell, trading flat. The announcement comes a day after  Visa Inc  Class A (NYSE:V)said it would start processing payments using a cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin rose 2%, at $59,150. ETH/USD rose nearly 3% and Litecoin 1%.
It’s important for a currency to be stable and have a predictable value, a major reason the high volatility in cryptos has held them back from winning a wider acceptance with payment companies and consumers.
PayPal already allows customers to buy and sell bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, and bitcoin cash. Customers will be able to convert these holdings into fiat currencies at checkouts to pay for goods and services. That means merchants will not take on the volatility risk.
Cryptos are slowly moving away from being speculative instruments to a stage where experts now see them as a hedge against inflation and also as an option to gold. PayPal’s extended offering is being seen as a step in that direction."

176,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 30, 2021 08:09AM ET</span>",StockBeat: The Wheels Come Off at Credit Suisse,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Credit Suisse has spent a decade trying to reinvent itself as a more transparent, less cavalier player in global financial markets, but the events of the last month suggest that it may all have been a sham.
Already last week, the Swiss bank was reportedly facing losses of anything between $1 billion and $3 billion from its exposure to Greensill Capital, the collapsed supply chain finance lender. It’s now facing another multi-billion loss on loans made to Archegos Capital Management, the prop trading vehicle of a man already convicted of securities fraud.
One unconfirmed wire report, citing unnamed sources, said the bank could lose up to $7 billion unwinding its Archegos trades, although JPMJPMorgan Chase analysts pegged the loss somewhere between $2.5 billion and $5 billion.  The bank itself said on Monday it’s too early to know how big the hit will be but said it “could be highly significant and material to our first quarter results.”
As such, a conservative estimate suggests that losses from the two episodes will total at least $3.5 billion, while the worst-case scenario would see $10 billion of   equity gone. For context, the bank has made total profits of just under $3 billion last year and a little less than $8 billion over the last four years combined.
Either incident would be enough to raise serious questions about the bank’s internal risk management, but the two together – originating in completely different areas of the group – suggest that the responsibility for the lack of control lies at the very top.
This is in no way surprising, given the extraordinary level of dysfunction evident in the exit of Tidjane Thiam as CEO in 2020 after a spying scandal that showed how far above the normal rules of ethics top management considered itself to be. The bank’s asset management arm doubled down on its exposure to Greensill even after the supply chain finance group blew up GAM, a rival Swiss-based asset manager, in 2018. Assumptions of superior in-house risk management now look complacent in the utmost. The arrival in five weeks’ time of new chairman Antonio Horta-Osario to replace the discredited Urs Rohner cannot come soon enough.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)shares were down another 2.2% in Zurich on Tuesday and are now down 22% on the month.
Were the risks unmanageable, or just unmanaged? The latter is certainly what Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) will be arguing before the Securities and Exchanges Commission, which is now looking into the affair. However, Wall Street’s blue bloods are unlikely to have heard the last of this. How prime brokers colluded to let Hwang – a convicted securities fraudster – use complex, leveraged structures to take massive directional bets on single stocks without disclosing his beneficial interest is a story that goes way beyond shortcomings in Zurich."

BERLIN (Reuters) -German air shuttle startup Lilium said on Tuesday it would float on the U.S. stock market via a reverse merger with Qell Acquisition Corp, a blank-cheque acquisition company, in a deal valuing the combined business at $3.3 billion.
Munich-based Lilium is competing with other aviation companies to deploy battery-powered aircraft that can take off and land vertically, offering a new way for travellers to beat traffic and hop between cities.
It joins U.S. rival Joby in merging with a listed shell company to attract capital at multi-billion-dollar valuations, on top of hefty funding already raised from venture capital backers.
Lilium said the combination with Qell, led by Barry Engle, former president of General Motors (NYSE:GM) North America, would support its objective of launching commercial operations in 2024.
""In Qell, we have found a partner who shares our ambition for sustainable mobility and brings tremendous experience in running mobility and hardware businesses,"" Daniel Wiegand, CEO and co-founder of Lilium, said in a statement.
Total gross proceeds are expected to be $830 million, including $380 million held in trust and proceeds from a $450 million private placement.
Investors in the placement include fund manager Baillie Gifford, funds and accounts managed by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Tencent, Ferrovial, LGT, Palantir, Atomico, FII Institute and private funds affiliated with PIMCO.
The transaction implies fully diluted pro forma enterprise value of $2.4 billion, which works out at 0.7 times forecast revenue of $3.3 billion and at 3.4 times forecast core profits of $708 million in 2026, a company presentation said.
NEW SEVEN-SEATER 
In addition to its five-seater fixed-wing prototype, the company also unveiled a seven-seater model, which it said was the most economically viable for the regional trips that will be its mainstay business.
The seven-seater Lilium Jet will be the first model to go into serial production. It will have a cruising speed of 175 miles per hour (280 kph) and a range of more than 155 miles (250 kilometres).
It received the CRI-A01 certification basis last year from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, its primary regulator. The next step is to obtain equivalent recognition from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.
""Our objective is to achieve almost simultaneous certification on both sides of the Atlantic,"" Yves Yemsi, Lilium's chief program officer, told an investor presentation.
Lilium rival Joby has already announced plans to go public via a $6.6 billion deal to merge with Reinvent Technology Partners, a U.S.-listed shell company.
German air taxi startup Volocopter also plans to raise fresh funds, CEO Florian Reuter said this month, adding that a deal to go public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) was one option.
Lilium intends to launch its first network in Florida, where it will site its first Vertiport at Lake Nona, a smart city being built near Orlando International Airport.

The combined company will add Engle to the board, joining current members including Tom Enders, former CEO of Airbus.
JP Morgan and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) advised Qell while Citi advised Lilium. The three banks acted as lead placement agents for the private placement.

180,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 30, 2021 07:29AM ET</span>","Canoo Trades Weak On Pivoting Away From Selling EV Tech, CFO Exit","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Canoo (NASDAQ:GOEV) shares were down nearly 4% in Tuesday’s premarket, suffering from twin blows of the company junking its previous plan of selling electric vehicle technology to other automakers on the one hand and the departure of its chief financial officer on the other.
Speaking during an investor call Monday, Canoo chairman Tony Aquila said the company will now focus more on making and selling its own vehicles to commercial operators. That appeared to spell bad news for its partnership to build electric vehicles with Hyundai (OTC:HYMLY).
The Korean carmaker's name was missing from Canoo’s latest investor presentation that it uploaded Monday.
The deal, announced February last year, would have led to both Hyundai and Kia building vehicles on Canoo’s EV platform. Canoo was just two years old then and the partnership was seen as a major vote of confidence in the startup.
Aquila said he believes the new strategy will help protect the intellectual property Canoo has developed.
The CFO’s exit is the second major departure in recent weeks following that of its head of corporate strategy."
181,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2021 07:20AM ET</span>",Auto industry urges Biden to back 'comprehensive' EV plan,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major automakers, parts companies and the United Auto Workers (UAW) union urged U.S. President Joe Biden to support a ""comprehensive plan"" on electric vehicles and called for hefty government tax credits and numerous other financial incentives.
The requests, made in a six-page letter dated March 29, come as Biden is set to unveil on Wednesday a $3 trillion or more infrastructure proposal that could include significant support for manufacturing and charging electric vehicles (EVs).
The letter from the UAW and two major auto industry trade groups noted there are currently only 1.5 million EVs out of 278 million registered passenger U.S. vehicles. 
""We need a comprehensive plan that takes the present market realities into consideration,"" said the letter, which was seen by Reuters. ""Neither the current trajectory of consumer adoption of EVs, nor existing levels of federal support for supply- and demand-side policies, is sufficient to meet our goal of a net-zero carbon transportation future.""
The White House did not immediately comment on the letter.
John Bozzella, who heads the Alliance for Automobile Innovation that represents General Motors (NYSE:GM), Toyota, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and others, noted EVs account for just 2% of U.S. sales today.
""To fully transition is going to require an enormous effort across the economy in every sector,"" said Bozzella who signed the letter along with Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association CEO Bill Long.
Some lawmakers and others are worried about the impact of the shift to EVs on auto jobs.
United Auto Workers Union President Rory Gamble, who also signed the letter, said in a separate statement to Reuters ""workers will disproportionately suffer if we do not get it right. The reality is that we have a long way to go in terms of battery technology, refueling infrastructure and, importantly market demand in order to successfully make this transition."" 
INCENTIVES
The letter urged Biden to back significant government tax incentives and subsidies for manufacturing and buying EVs and boosting federal government fleet EV purchases.
It called for government grants to automakers and suppliers ""to reequip, expand, and establish facilities"" for EVs and components and to ""accelerate the domestic manufacture of batteries, power electronics (and) electric motors.""
The letter encouraged developing ""U.S.-
based supplies of critical minerals (extraction, processing, recycling), battery and fuel cell manufacturing"" and new government efforts to boost hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.
As a candidate, Biden pledged to invest $2 trillion in infrastructure spending, including fixing highways, bridges and airports; encouraging fuel-efficient vehicle manufacturing and installing 500,000 EV charging stations.
The letter noted there are currently 100,000 public charging outlets nationwide.
Some Democrats in Congress want Biden to follow California and set a target date to end gas-powered passenger car sales. California plans to end those sales in 2035. 
Last week, a group of 71 U.S. House Democrats urged Biden to set tough emissions rules to ensure that 60% of new passenger cars and trucks sold are zero-emission by 2030, while 10 U.S. senators urged Biden ""to set a date by which new sales of fossil fuel vehicles will end entirely.""

Biden is currently reviewing the Trump administration's 2020 decision to roll back Obama-administration vehicle emissions standards.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Tuesday, with the rotation into value stocks continuing on recovery expectations while tech companies struggle under the weight of higher Treasury yields.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 85 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded flat, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 70 points, or 0.5%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.3% higher at a new record on Monday, while the S&P 500 ended 0.1% lower and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.6%.
This mix is set to continue Tuesday, with the blue-chip Dow benefiting from increased optimism of a swift economic recovery, after a study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that the mRNA-based vaccines of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Pfizer/BioNTech stopped not only infection, but also transmission of Covid-19 90% in 90% of cases. 
CDC data show that more than 143 million vaccine doses have been administered in the U.S., with over 93 million people having received at least one dose and more than 51 million now fully vaccinated.
Even so, CDC chief Rochelle Walensky issued a warning against restrictions and guards being lowered, expressing a sense of “impending doom” after seeing new infection and hospital admission numbers rise over the last week.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq has underperformed of late as rising bond yields have raised concerns about inflated valuations. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield traded at 1.77%, its highest level since the start of the pandemic.
Attention will remain Tuesday on the likes of ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) after they suffered heavy losses when hedge fund Archegos was forced to liquidate positions. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) may also be in the spotlight given their links with the fund.
There are two earnings reports of note Tuesday, from online pet store Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) and fitness apparel maker  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) - companies that have benefited from the pandemic shutdowns as people shopped online.
Oil prices edged lower Tuesday as shipping resumed through the Suez Canal and the focus turned to the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, later this week.
The market is expecting the surge of Covid cases in Europe, not to mention the rising numbers in important emerging markets like India and Brazil, to keep the cartel from increasing supply levels to any great degree when they get together on Thursday.
Also on the supply side, U.S. crude oil supply numbers from the American Petroleum Institute are due later in the day.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.3% lower at $60.77 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1% to $64.25. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 1.1% to $1,695.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1731.

U.S. President Joe Biden’s plan for an infrastructure spending spree, with details expected on Wednesday, is leading to a fresh selling burst in Treasuries, consistent with stop outs of long positions.
Yields on five year Treasuries rose above 0.90%, prompting a block sale in the notes, before touching a one-year high of 0.93%. The benchmark 10 year bond then breached 1.75%, with a wave of selling in bond futures seen just as the London trading session got underway.
Market participants had been prepared for a period of grace in bond markets.
Quarter-end re-balancing flows into bonds from stocks had been expected to boost demand in the short term. The start of Japan’s fiscal new year from April 1 also had many anticipating fresh demand from one of the biggest buyers of Treasuries in the past. Bond market volatility has tended to cool off in April in the past.
Other markets are getting rocked too. Australia’s 10 year bond yield rose as much as 10 basis points, with losses amplified by concerns ahead of Wednesday’s A$2 billion ($1.5 billion) debt sale, the first of material size in a month. German 10 year yields rose three basis points as trading kicked off in Europe.

The carmaker, which is based in Sweden but owned by China's Geely Holding, has over 40,000 employees. From next month, all staff who have worked in Volvo plants and offices for at least a year will be entitled to the leave each time they have a child and will receive 80% of their base pay during the period, the company said on Tuesday.
Sweden is one of few countries that already offers leave by law for either parent.
""Some countries do not offer any paid leave to new parents, or exclude certain groups of parents – the latter is particularly true for fathers,"" the company, which previously did not have a global policy but adapted to local regulations, said in a statement.
Around a third of Volvo's senior managers are currently female. 
The company aims to raise that share to 50%, a spokeswoman said, adding that Volvo's new policy will improve conditions for staff on parental leave not least in China and the United States.
""When parents are supported to balance the demands of work and family, it helps to close the gender gap and allows everyone to excel in their careers,"" said Volvo Cars CEO Hakan Samuelsson.
The global policy applies to either parent and the leave can be taken anytime within the first three years of parenthood.

In Sweden, new parents are in general entitled by law to around a year of parental leave on up to 80% pay.

TAIPEI -Major Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn on Tuesday posted a lower fourth-quarter profit that lagged expectations as the pandemic hit margins, and warned of the impact of ""materials shortages"" amid tight global chip supplies.
The Taiwanese firm, the world's largest contract electronics maker booked an October-December net profit of T$45.97 billion ($1.61 billion), a 4% decline from a year earlier, and compared with the T$50.89 billion average of 11 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
Chief Financial Officer David Huang said the company's gross margin was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic but strong smartphone sales still contributed to stronger-than-expected performance in the fourth quarter, though he did not elaborate.
Formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, Foxconn's fourth-quarter revenue rose 15% on the year. 
That was mainly driven by a more than 15% revenue increase on the year from consumer electronics including smartphones, which accounted for 63% of its business in the quarter, Foxconn said.
The company had previously forecast fourth-quarter revenue to be in a range of a decline of 3% and gain of 3% from a year earlier. 
Chairman Liu Young-way said he expected first-quarter revenue to be ""better than normal"" for the season thanks to strong sales of smartphones and telecommuting devices amid a coronavirus-induced work-from-home trend. 
Liu, however, said the company is closely monitoring ""materials shortages"" in the consumer electronics supply chain and that could hit less than 10% of client orders, though described the impact as limited.
""The pandemic and the materials shortage could impact our performance going forward. That's why we are being cautious,"" he said, adding that he expected the shortage to continue until next year. 
While Liu did not give specifics on the shortage, industry sources have said a chip shortage that first hit the auto industry is now spreading across the electronics business including smartphones. 
Foxconn had previously said it expected revenue to grow about 10% in 2021.
Liu said Foxconn was in talks with ""related foundries"" on possible collaboration to make chips for electric vehicles (EV), touting the company's little-noticed strength in speciality chips manufacturing. He gave no details. 
The company has in recent months announced plans to become a major player in the global EV market.

Shares of Foxconn have climbed almost 41% this year. They ended up 0.78% on Tuesday, compared with a 0.48% rise in the broader market.

LONDON (Reuters) -  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) will announce later on Tuesday that it has started allowing U.S. consumers to use their cryptocurrency holdings to pay at millions of its online merchants globally, a move that could significantly boost use of digital assets in everyday commerce. 
Customers who hold bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash and litecoin in PayPal digital wallets will now be able to convert their holdings into fiat currencies at checkouts to make purchases, the company said.
The service, which PayPal revealed it was working on late last year, will be available at all of its 29 million merchants in the coming months, the company said.
""This is the first time you can seamlessly use cryptocurrencies in the same way as a credit card or a debit card inside your PayPal wallet,"" President and CEO Dan Schulman told Reuters ahead of a formal announcement.
Checkout with Crypto builds on the ability for PayPal users to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies, which the San Jose, California-based payments company launched in October. 
The offering made PayPal one of the largest mainstream financial companies to open its network to cryptocurrencies and helped fuel a rally in virtual coin prices.
Bitcoin has nearly doubled in value since the start of this year, boosted by increased interest from larger financial firms that are betting on greater adoption and see it as a hedge against inflation.
PayPal's launch comes less than a week after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc said it would start accepting bitcoin payments for its cars. Unlike PayPal transactions where merchants will be receiving fiat currency, Tesla said it will hold the bitcoin used as payment. 
Still, while the nascent asset is gaining traction among mainstream investors, it has yet to become a widespread form of payment, due in part to its continued volatility. 
PayPal hopes its service can change that, as by settling the transaction in fiat currency, merchants will not take on the volatility risk.
""We think it is a transitional point where cryptocurrencies move from being predominantly an asset class that you buy, hold and or sell to now becoming a legitimate funding source to make transactions in the real world at millions of merchants,"" Schulman said.

The company will charge no transaction fee to checkout with crypto and only one type of coin can be used for each purchase, it said.

Sentiment in Asia was mixed early, then turned positive, with most of the region's major markets trading higher.
Nomura and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) are facing billions of dollars in losses and regulatory scrutiny after a U.S. investment firm, named by sources as Archegos Capital, defaulted on equity derivative bets, putting investors on edge about who else might be exposed. 
Nomura shares were down a further 1.1% Tuesday after dropping as much as 16% on Monday, when it revealed it could take a $2 billion loss from the hedge fund fallout. 
""From a market perspective with contagion looking limited ... despite the news flow of further forced liquidations and prime brokerage losses, this looks at this stage to be a positioning- driven sell-off in U.S. futures and various single stock names,"" said Eleanor Creagh, market strategist at Saxo Bank. 
Creagh added that further forced deleveraging was still a risk if prime brokers tighten margin requirements. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.6% higher. Mainland China's CSI300 index rose 1%.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 1.2% to reach 28,668, driven up by a rebound in the city's tech stock index. That index has been under pressure from concern over the Chinese government's move to increase regulation of those companies.
Japan's Nikkei was flat, dragged down by Nomura's share price weakness. Australia sounded a weaker tone when the S&P/ASX200 closed down 0.9% at its lowest point for a week.
Credit Suisse's Asia Pacific senior investment strategist Jack Siu said the prospect of Asian travel bubbles had sparked enthusiasm among some investors in the region.
""Tourism-dependent Asian economies will benefit,"" he said.
Hong Kong's commerce secretary, Edward Yau, flagged Monday the government had restarted talks with Singapore to re-establish a potential travel bubble between the cities. 
Investor sentiment was still closely tied to the pace of the global vaccine rollout, said  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) equity derivative solutions director Elizabeth Tian.
""Investors will also be watching the number of COVID cases as rises in Western Europe and the Philippines sees the return of renewed restrictions, while vaccination attempts threaten to stall amidst supply constraints and vaccine nationalism,"" Tian said.

189,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2021 04:55AM ET</span>",Deliveroo IPO puts London's tech credentials to the test,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) -When food delivery firm Deliveroo joins the London stock market on Wednesday, it will be Britain's biggest listing in a decade, even though some of the country's leading investors - worth over $1 trillion between them - will be conspicuous by their absence.
British Finance Minister Rishi Sunak has hailed the company's decision to go public in London as a ""true British tech success story,"" and said he hopes it will set the stage for more listings by fast-growing technology companies.
But strong demand for the IPO - it was fully subscribed within hours of the order book being opened - has been overshadowed by complaints over its share structure, questions about potential legal problems for its gig-economy business model and the threat of strike action from some of its workers. 
Heavyweight investors Aberdeen  Standard Life  (LON:SLA),  Aviva  (LON:AV), Legal & General Investment Management and M&G are sitting this one out, citing concerns about gig-economy working conditions and the outsized voting rights that will be handed to founder Will Shu.
    Some of them also question whether the loss-making business can ever justify its valuation.
Having initially looked for up to 8.8 billion pounds ($12.1 billion), the British tech firm went with a narrower price range and said on Tuesday it would price at the bottom of the new range, valuing the company at 7.6 billion pounds.
""Given volatile global market conditions for IPOs, Deliveroo is choosing to price responsibly and at an entry point that maximises long-term value for our new institutional and retail investors,"" a spokeswoman for Deliveroo said.
One question is whether the Amazon-backed company will face the kind of clampdown experienced by Uber (NYSE:UBER) over the employment status of its staff.
""Deliveroo's narrow profit margins could be at risk if it is required to change its rider benefits to catch up with peers, in an industry that is already facing severe competitive pressure between the large tech platforms,"" Andrew Millington, head of UK equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said.
PANDEMIC SURGE
Deliveroo has seen demand soar during the pandemic as restaurants were closed for several months of the last year. 
Its self-employed riders, distinctive in their cyan and white uniforms, have often outnumbered other traffic in cities during lockdown.
One rider Reuters spoke to - Krzysztof - said he had few complaints about his treatment, although he wished he could get an electric bike. He said he earns 300-350 pounds a week delivering food to families in Walthamstow in east London. 
""I was working in a construction site nearby but I lost my job after COVID-19 and I found this quite easy to switch to,"" he said, preferring not to give his surname.
    Many riders, including Krzysztof, don't work every day. Deliveroo riders are classed as self-employed contractors and earn a fee for every job. Employees, by contrast, are entitled to the minimum wage, sick pay and holiday pay.
    London's High Court said last month that a group of Uber drivers were workers and thus entitled to the minimum wage in a ruling that could have ramifications across the gig economy. 
    Deliveroo says its riders are self-employed because this gives them the freedom to choose when and where to work.
    ""We are confident in our business model, which has been upheld by UK courts three times, including the High Court twice,"" it said.
It dismissed criticism over conditions.
""We communicate with thousands of riders every week and satisfaction is currently at an all time high,"" it said in a statement.
    'DARK KITCHENS'
    Some critics questioned whether Deliveroo can maintain its growth when restaurants reopen and younger consumers no longer have to eat at home.
But Tim Vasilakis, founder of Greek street food vendor The Athenian in Shoreditch, east London, said customers' habits had changed for good. 
""It is a valid business model and I think it's proven itself now,"" he said. ""I think the pandemic just accelerated something that was already happening.""
    Three years ago he agreed an exclusive deal with Deliveroo, resulting in lower commission and the chance to use the company's ""dark kitchens"", where food is prepared by chefs in delivery-only facilities.
    The Athenian set up its first dark kitchen in Battersea, London, just before the pandemic hit. Sales were comparable to some of the group's eight bricks-and-mortar restaurants, he said. 
    Deliveroo, which is battling competitors, such as Uber Eats, Just Eat Takeaway.com, lost 226.4 million pounds in 2020 despite the pandemic boost. 
    But investors in tech companies are used to losses. Many remember that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) were loss-making for many years before profits shot up. 
In a low rate environment, they are particularly tolerant. 
""We've been in an environment where growth has been scarce, lacklustre and investors have been happy to pay up for growth wherever they can find it,"" Duncan Lamont, head of research and analytics at  Schroders  (LON:SDR), said. 

""So long as investors are happy to finance those losses, companies like Deliveroo can continue to go down that route of losing money to gain scale to become profitable in the long run.""
The broader question of how British fund managers view weaker corporate governance and the possible advent of more expensive regulation on the gig economy, however, will determine London's success in becoming a hub for tech companies.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) said on Tuesday that production at its U.S. chip plant at Austin, Texas had returned to near-normal levels as of last week after more than a month of disruption that exacerbated a global chip capacity crunch. 
Samsung (KS:005930) and other chipmakers with production facilities in the area had seen shutdowns due to severe weather on Feb. 16.
Samsung declined to comment on when production would be fully back to normal.
The disruption will have a definite impact on the global chip contract manufacturing industry that is already battling a severe capacity crunch, research provider TrendForce has said.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) 5G radio frequency chips and Samsung display and image sensor chips account for about 65% of the monthly production at the Samsung plant, TrendForce added. 
Other chips include power management integrated circuits (PMICs) and a small amount of chips that control electrical parts, Seoul-based analysts said. 
The disruption is expected to hurt production of smartphones globally over the April to June period by about 5% and may lower this year's penetration rate of 5G smartphones, TrendForce estimated. 
""This was a problem because it exacerbated a worldwide foundry capacity shortage. But at least it won't get worse as production resumes,"" said Park Sung-soon, analyst at Cape Investment & Securities. 
""Smartphone makers have chip stockpiles, but because vendors' inventories of smartphone sets are currently low, smartphone production may see some impact from the plant's shutdown in the second half of this year."" 
Analysts have estimated losses from the disruption at the plant at around 300-400 billion won ($265 million-353 million), which they expected Samsung to mostly reflect in its January-March quarter earnings, to be announced in April. 
Earlier this month,  NXP Semiconductors  NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) said it expected an impact of about $100 million of revenue from its Texas production shutdown.
German chipmaker Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) said it expected a quarterly hit to revenues in the high double-digit million euro range from its Texas plant outage.

LONDON (Reuters) - BMW has timed its shift to electric cars well and its upcoming products will upend the perception the German carmaker is behind on electrification and could make its stock compete with the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, its top executive said.
""There is a perception that we took a break, but we actually didn't take a break,"" Chief Executive Oliver Zipse told Reuters as part of a series of boardroom interviews entitled ""Delivering Net Zero"".
""We waited for the moment when electromobility is really getting into higher volumes.""
Carmakers are racing to develop electric cars amid tightening CO2 emission standards in Europe and China and BMW says it expects half of its sales to be fully-electric models by 2030. 
Zipse told Reuters that BMW's sustainability plans include reducing its CO2 emissions from the entire lifespan of its vehicles - from raw materials and production process to their use on the road - by a cumulative 200 megatons by 2030, or seven times the annual emissions of London.
BMW on Tuesday said it has signed a 285 million euro ($335 million) contract with U.S.-based Livent (NYSE:LTHM), which will supply the German carmaker with lithium, a key ingredient in battery cells, from 2022.
BMW currently builds combustion engine, hybrid and electric models on shared platforms, which critics say compromise the performance of electric vehicles, and will not launch a dedicated electric platform until 2025.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has developed its own electric vehicle platform from the ground up. Next month  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) will unveil its first Mercedes-Benz model on a dedicated electric platform. 
""If you look at what's happening in the market with these (dedicated electric) platforms, the cars all look alike,"" Zipse said. ""BMW serves very specific, high-paying customers, I think they don't want cars who all look alike.""
Zipse said he expects the European Union will further tighten its CO2 emission targets for 2030.
He said the bloc should not overreach on so-called Euro 7 car emission proposals for pollutants including nitrous oxide and lung-damaging particulate matter due this year. Germany's auto industry says some proposals under consideration could effectively ban combustion engines from 2025.
""We should do it in a reasonable way to keep the combustion engine alive"" because engine improvements will help reach climate goals, he said.
Zipse said BMW's market cap of around 55 billion euros is lower than its equity of around 60 billion euros.
""Something is wrong there,"" he said. ""That would assume that you don't have a future.""
Asked if BMW could become a ""story stock"" like electric carmaker Tesla, which is valued at more than $500 billion, Zipse said: ""Of course we can.""
""The equity story is not finished for BMW,"" he said. ""We have a great future, we will grow.""

LONDON (Reuters) -Food delivery company Deliveroo will price its initial public offering at 390 pence per share, banks working on the deal said on Tuesday, at the bottom end of a previously indicated range for the food delivery group.
That would indicate an overall valuation of 7.6 billion pounds ($10.46 billion), less than initially expected, after a string of major UK fund managers said they would not take part, citing concerns about its dual class share structure and its gig economy business model.
The listing is covered multiple times over, the bookrunners said, with the deal expected to close at 1200 GMT.
""Given volatile global market conditions for IPOs, Deliveroo is choosing to price responsibly and at an entry point that maximises long-term value for our new institutional and retail investors,"" a spokesperson for Deliveroo said.
The listing of London-based company, founded by boss William Shu in 2013, is set to be London's biggest IPO since Glencore (OTC:GLNCY)'s in May 2011 and also the biggest tech float on the London Stock Exchange.
Heavyweight investors Aberdeen  Standard Life  (LON:SLA),  Aviva  (LON:AV), Legal & General Investment Management and M&G have all said they will sit the deal out, amid criticism of its workers' rights.
Some of them also question whether the loss-making business can ever justify its valuation.
Having initially looked for up to 8.8 billion pounds, the British tech firm on Monday went with a narrower price range, indicating a maximum valuation of up to 7.85 billion pounds, citing market volatility.

Deliveroo's self-employed drivers have seen a boom in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing food from otherwise-shuttered restaurants to housebound customers.

(Reuters) -Imperial Brands Plc said on Tuesday it is off to a ""good start"" this year as the maker Gauloises and Winston cigarettes looks to capitalise on higher tobacco prices and ""significantly reduced"" losses in vaping.
On aggregate it has started to increase its tobacco market share in its top five markets with gains in the United States, UK and Spain offsetting declines in Germany and Australia, the FTSE-listed company said.
New CEO Stefan Bomhard two months ago laid out a five-year plan that focuses investment on five markets that generate 72% of its profits. 
Imperial will also target tobacco-heating products in Europe and e-cigarettes in the United States, reducing losses from its previous one-size-fits-all approach.
The company reiterated its forecast for low-to-mid single digit growth in organic adjusted operating profit growth for the year and said overall tobacco volume sales were in line with its expectations. 
In the first half it expects group net revenue to grow by at least 1% on an organic, constant currency basis, due to higher tobacco prices and higher next-generation product (NGP) revenue growth. It also expects higher profits from Logista, its logistics operations in Europe.
Imperial has lowered its NGP aspirations, mainly e-cigarettes, after missing several sales targets over the last five years. 
Its NGP sales fell 27% last year, prompting a 124 million pound ($170 million) writedown on the business.

In contrast, rival British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) said it would put more resources behind such products after seeing three million more customers use its e-cigarette, tobacco heating and oral nicotine products during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
Imperial shares were down 0.4% in early trading.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Tuesday, helped by growing French consumer confidence while fears of a broader fallout from the U.S. hedge fund default eased. 
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.7% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.8%, while the U.K.’s FTSE index climbed 0.7%.
French consumer confidence rose unexpectedly in March, with the INSEE stats agency saying its monthly consumer sentiment index rose to its highest level since December to reach 94 points from 91 in February. 
This comes despite new coronavirus restrictions on large parts of the country and the prospect of more curbs on the way, after Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said ""all options are on the table"" to protect the public from rising numbers of infections in a third wave of the Covid-19 virus.
The news is more positive in the U.K., where the vaccination program has been more successful, as a stay-at-home order and some other lockdown measures have been lifted in England. Prime Minister Boris Johnson still urged the population to be cautious, having warned last week that Europe's wave was likely to ""wash up on our shores"" sooner or later.
The European market was also helped by a positive handover from Wall Street, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closing Monday at a new record high.
Banks tied to the Archegos saga fell, dragging broader financials indices into the red, but losses were limited and eased fears that the issue would become systemic.
Back in Europe,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) stock rose 1% Tuesday, rebounding from Monday’s sharp losses after it announced a “significant” hit from Archegos’ default of margin calls.

197,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2021 03:25AM ET</span>",Asian SPAC listings face stern test as regulators consider rule changes,"By Alun John and Anshuman Daga
HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian bourses from Tokyo to Singapore are considering rule changes to allow listing of SPACs, but some industry players say the region may not attract the kind of frenzy, or the massive billions of dollars, seen in the U.S. for such blank cheque firms. 
The trend to list through Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) has seen such floats raise $96 billion in the United States this year after a bumper 2020.
In Asia, industry executives worry that low valuations in some markets and the need for SPAC regimes to include strong investor protection safeguards would keep such listings from rapidly taking off.
""We don't get the sense that anyone is rushing to do this,"" said one person with knowledge of Asian exchanges' informal consultations with industry executives, referring to SPAC listing prospects in Asia. 
""Hong Kong is more strongly leaning to the no side, while Singapore, because it has less equities activity, has more pressure,"" said the person, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
With the hot new method of floating a company taking the U.S. tech world by storm, Asian exchanges are stepping up efforts for SPAC listings although the response has been tepid in Europe.
Earlier this year, Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY)'s regulatory unit said it was exploring a consultation on SPACs, while the Hong Kong government directed the city's exchange and regulator to look into allowing such listings.
Indonesia's bourse has also said it would consider allowing SPACs, and in Japan, a government panel said SPACs listings should be considered to boost growth. 
SPACs or shell companies, raise funds via IPOs to merge with operating firms and then take them public by enticing them with shorter listing timeframes and strong valuations.
One problem for SPACs in Hong Kong are recent rule changes brought in to resolve long standing worries about illegal practices linked to the formation and trading of shell companies.
""A lot of the changes that were introduced from 2016-2019 would need to be changed to accommodate SPACs,"" said Christina Lee, a capital markets partner at Baker McKenzie, adding that she had received inquiries from clients, many from mainland China, about listing SPACs in Hong Kong. 
DESIGNING RULES 
Singapore, which has attracted listings mainly of real estate investment trusts, could find it tougher.
""Singapore doesn't have as deep liquidity and the velocity of the leading markets and that could be an issue particularly when it comes to the adoption of new investment models,"" said Yang Eu Jin, co-head of corporate and capital markets practice at RHTLaw Asia.SGX consulted the market on SPAC listings in 2010 but this didn't take off due to lack of market interest.
Stefanie Yuen Thio, joint managing partner at TSMP Law in Singapore, said a quick roll out of regulations this year and more interest for SPAC listings for Chinese tech targets, due to the unrest in Hong Kong and U.S.-China tensions, could help Singapore.
""The important thing will be to ensure that our rules are, as far as possible, aligned with U.S. listing rules for SPACs so that Singapore can be seen as the Asian alternative bourse,"" she said.

""That may be more of a challenge but if Singapore wants to stay competitive and relevant as a stock exchange, we will need to resist the urge to create a Frankenstein's monster of the SPAC listing rules.""

198,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2021 02:50AM ET</span>",Asian countries scramble for vaccine supplies after India export curbs,"By Sangmi Cha and Neil Jerome Morales
SEOUL/MANILA (Reuters) - Several Asian countries scrambled to find alternative sources for COVID-19 inoculations on Tuesday after export restrictions by manufacturer India left a World Health Organization-backed global vaccine sharing programme short of supplies. 
South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines are among countries to be hit by shipment delays to vaccines they have been promised under the COVAX programme, which was created mainly to ensure supplies for poorer countries. 
""Our planned increase in daily vaccinations will be affected,"" Carlito Galvez, Philippines' vaccination chief, told reporters. 
India, the world's biggest vaccine maker, put a temporary hold on exports of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s vaccine being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), as officials focus on meeting rising domestic demand. 
The Serum Insitute was due to deliver 90 million vaccine doses to COVAX over March and April and, while it was not immediately clear how many would be diverted for domestic use, programme facilitators warned that shipment delays were inevitable.
South Korea confirmed it would only receive 432,000 doses of the 690,000 it had been promised and delivery of those would be delayed until around the third week of April. 
""There's uncertainty over global vaccine supplies but we're working on a plan to ensure no disruptions in the second quarter and making efforts to secure more vaccines,"" Kim Ki-nam, head of South Korea's COVID-19 vaccination task force team. Officials said they were in talks with AstraZeneca to accelerate shipments procured through a separate deal.
Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte loosened government restrictions on private sector imports of vaccines, pleading with companies to obtain supplies no matter the cost, as his country battles a resurgence of the pandemic.
In Vietnam, officials have similarly asked the private sector to step in after their COVAX supplies were slashed by 40% to 811,200 doses and shipments were pushed back by weeks. 
In Indonesia, health ministry official Siti Nadia Tarmizi told Reuters that 10.3 million doses from COVAX were likely delayed until May.
India has not provided details on the length of its export curb but UNICEF, a distributing partner of COVAX, said at the weekend that deliveries are expected to resume by May.
India's decision is the latest in a series of setbacks for the COVAX facility, relied on by 64 poorer countries, after production glitches and a lack of funding contribution from wealthy nations.
CHINA AND RUSSIA
China and Russia are primed to step into the breach.
""We have good diplomatic relations with China and Russia and we are asking if we can have access to their vaccines in April,"" the Philippines' Galvez said. 
Both the Philippines and Indonesia are currently relying heavily on vaccines from China's Sinovac Biotech to run their inoculation drives. The Philippines and Vietnam have both approved Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, along with more than 50 other countries, mainly developing nations. The Philippines expects to receive its first batch of Sputnik V in April.
Chinese vaccine maker Sinopharm, meanwhile, plans to produce its COVID-19 vaccine at a new plant in the United Arab Emirates. 
The spate of export curbs is also being felt by wealthier countries that are reliant on foreign manufacturing, including Japan, where the national vaccine rollout has been slow due to the limited number of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) vaccines shipped from Europe.
""Some people are using vaccines for diplomacy, some people are trying to prioritize. Some people are buying like three to five times as many vaccines compared to their population. That's unnecessary,"" Japan's vaccine minister, Taro Kono, told Reuters on Monday in an interview.

""We really need to have the global leaders sit down and think this is a global issue, not the domestic issue, and try to solve this together.""

199,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2021 02:15AM ET</span>",Analysis: Debacle at Archegos throws excessive risk-taking into spotlight,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Highly leveraged Archegos Capital's downfall is the latest signal of investors' hunger for risk-taking being far from satiated even after a run that has lifted the S&P 500 index around 80% in a year.
The impact of the hedge fund’s troubles seems to have been limited so far to a handful of stocks - from ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) to the shares of investment banks who dealt with the fund, such as  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) - without rippling out into broader markets.
Yet, there are other signs that the mood has turned exuberant in recent months, leading to potentially excessive risk-taking across asset classes.
Among those are the market’s robust appetite for special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) and the popularity of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. And an 850% rally in the shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME), fueled by retail investors with the help of options on sites such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets. 
""My guess is we are going to see a whole series of these examples and we will be looking back on this in several years and saying this was a period of phenomenal widespread risk-taking where standards were lowered,"" said Andrew Beer of Dynamic Beta Investments. 
Equities now account for 50% of all assets held by households, mutual funds, pension funds, and foreign investors, the highest level since the tech bubble of two decades ago, research from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) showed. Many investors are leveraging that stock exposure through options, with equity options trading volume up 85% last year from 2017, according to data from Trade Alert. 
And after a stretch of bearishness following the COVID-19 pandemic’s initial outbreak last year, both institutional and individual investors see better times ahead. Fund managers in a BofA Global Research survey have ratcheted up their exposure to commodities to record highs - a bet on a global recovery - while cash levels stand near eight-year lows.
Nearly 51% of individual investors, meanwhile, believe stocks will rise in the short term, compared with an historical average of 38%, according to the latest American Association of Individual Investors Sentiment Survey.
STIMULUS
Plenty of investors have justified the optimism by pointing to the unprecedented amounts of stimulus doled out by the U.S. Federal Reserve and U.S. lawmakers, as well as a countrywide rollout of vaccines against COVID-19.
Federal Reserve officials earlier signaled they expect growth of 6.5% this year, which if achieved would mark the fastest expansion since the 1980s, compared to a 3.5% contraction suffered in 2020, the steepest annual downturn in more than seven decades. 
While “the path higher for U.S. stocks will be complicated and filled with fresh risks, U.S. stocks will likely finish the year much higher,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. 
But confidence that markets will continue to rise can lead some investors to take risks such as overusing leverage, which helps magnify gains but can also result in mushrooming losses if a trade goes the wrong way. 
Archegos Capital’s troubles may have been one example of leverage gone awry. 
The fund bought derivatives known as total return swaps which allow investors to bet on stock price moves, without owning the underlying securities, according to one source familiar with the trades.
Archegos had assets of around $10 billion but held positions worth more than $50 billion, according to the source, who declined to be identified.

""Sentiment has definitely shifted to very bullish in 2021,"" said Ilya Feygin, senior strategist at WallachBeth Capital. ""When people become very confident, you know what happens - they take more risk.”

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen edging higher at the open Tuesday, following Wall Street higher as fears of a broader fallout from the U.S. hedge fund default ease. Concerns about a surge of Covid-19 cases in the region will limit gains.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.3% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.3%, or 98 points, higher Monday at a new record, while the S&P 500 was 0.1% lower and the Nasdaq Composite ended down 0.6%.
Banks tied to the Archegos saga fell, dragging broader financials indices into the red, but losses were limited and eased fears that the issue would become systemic.
Gains in Europe are still likely to be limited as the region struggles to cope with a third wave of Covid-19 cases, causing many countries to tighten restrictive measures, delaying its economic recovery further.
Germany needs to act quickly to stop infections jumping to 100,000 a day from 20,000 now, according to its top public health official, yet German Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing growing criticism for failing to spell out such a plan.
In France, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said ""all options are on the table"" to protect the public.
The news is more positive in the U.K., where the vaccination program has been more successful, as a stay-at-home order and some other lockdown measures have been lifted in England. Prime Minister Boris Johnson still urged the population to be cautious, having warned last week that Europe's wave was likely to ""wash up on our shores"" sooner or later.
The economic data slate Tuesday largely centers on eurozone economic sentiment and consumer confidence data for March, and these releases will be studied for further clues on how the region’s economic prospects are perceived.
Oil prices edged lower Tuesday as shipping resumed through the Suez Canal and the focus turned to the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, later this week.

The stock fell as much as 6.2% in the first half session of trade. 
Affin Hwang Capital cut earnings forecasts for 2021 and 2022, expecting a larger net loss this year due to lockdowns in Malaysia in the first quarter, closed borders and longer-than-expected timeframe for the COVID-19 immunisation programme.
""We now anticipate AirAsia to report net loss of 92 million ringgit in 2022 due to slower-than-expected recovery in international tourism,"" analyst Isaac Chow said in his note.
AirAsia in a results presentation on its website said it expects a soft first quarter for its Malaysia unit due to lockdowns, but the following quarter could see up to 33% of pre-COVID domestic levels following relaxation on some cross-state tourism.
AmInvestment Bank said in its note that it was highly critical for AirAsia to shore up its liquidity quickly given its cash burn rate.
The research house said while prospects for the air travel industry and airlines have improved, AirAsia may need to raise more fresh capital, ""including potentially a debt-to-equity swap for creditors (that is also highly dilutive to its existing shareholders) to ensure its long-term survival.""
In its presentation, AirAsia said it reduced its average cash burn by 92% in the last quarter of 2020, partly due to continued support from lessors and banks for deferrals.
The airline said ongoing discussions for raising new capital in Indonesia and Philippines were also positive.
AirAsia reported a record $591 million quarterly loss on Monday.

AirAsia has been looking to raise up to 2.5 billion ringgit to weather the pandemic, and said that it expects to secure 1 billion ringgit in loans from three Malaysian banks.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Athletic shoe maker  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) on Monday sued a New York-based company that produced ""Satan Shoes"" purported to contain a drop of human blood as part of a collaboration with ""Old Town Road"" rapper Lil Nas X.
Nike said in the lawsuit that the company, MSCHF Product Studio Inc, infringed on and diluted its trademark with the black-and-red, devil-themed shoes, which went on sale online on Monday. Lil Nas X is not named as a defendant in the suit. 
The shoes are customized Nike Air Max 97 sneakers that contain red ink and ""one drop of human blood"" in the sole, according to a website describing the 666 pairs of limited edition shoes. The back of one shoe says ""MSCHF"" and the other says ""Lil Nas X."" https://twitter.com/mschf/status/1376549518100029443
Several media outlets reported that the shoes sold out in less than one minute at a cost of $1,018 per pair. Lil Nas X said on Twitter he would choose the recipient of the 666th pair from social media users who circulated one of his tweets. 
Nike, in its lawsuit filed in federal court in New York, said the shoes were produced ""without Nike's approval and authorization,"" and the company was ""in no way connected with this project.""
""There is already evidence of significant confusion and dilution occurring in the marketplace, including calls to boycott Nike in response to the launch of MSCHF’s Satan Shoes based on the mistaken belief that Nike has authorized or approved this product,"" the lawsuit said.
Nike asked the court to immediately stop MSCHF from fulfilling orders for the shoes and requested a jury trial to seek damages.
Representatives for Lil Nas X and MSCHF did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.56% and the Shenzhen Component was up 1.06%. Investors look to the manufacturing and non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers Indexes (PMIs) to be released on Wednesday, for further clues about the Chinese economic recovery.
Some traders demanded higher rates to hedge potential losses on the debt of banks caught up in the Archegos saga, including Nomura (T:8604) and  Credit Suisse Group  (NYSE:CS) so far, and the company said via a statement that “all plans were being discussed.”
However, credit markets remained calm as the Asian session progressed on Tuesday.
“It’s never better when you are a shark in the water to be buying from a forced seller,” Spotlight Asset Group chief investment officer, Shana Sissel told Bloomberg. Sissel remains skeptical of the potential for broader market fallout from Archegos, adding, “I find it hard to believe that this would have a systemic massive impact on global markets beyond the few positions that they held.”
The focus is instead on the progress of the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19, with U.S. President Joe Biden to unveil a further stimulus program with a tilt toward infrastructure on Wednesday.
On the COVID-19 vaccine front, Biden also announced that 90% of adults will be eligible to be inoculated in April. A  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) real-world study also showed their doses effectively prevented coronavirus infections, according to U.S. government researchers.
The rapid pace of the vaccine rollout and the prospect of more stimulus measures in the U.S. has revived inflation fears among some investors, however.
“The ongoing smooth vaccination in the U.S. and extensive fiscal support is lifting the growth outlook, and with it, inflation expectations,” said Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers.
However, she added that the rise in yields “has not led to flows out of equities. The fundamental support for risk assets is in place.”"

In October, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said it would not rehear arguments over whether the San Diego, California-based company had engaged in anticompetitive patent-licensing practices to keep a monopoly on the market for modem chips that connect smart phones to wireless data networks. A three-judge panel on that court had ruled in August that the FTC failed to prove its case.
In a statement, Acting FTC Chairwoman Rebecca Slaughter noted ""significant headwinds facing the Commission in this matter"" in deciding to not petition the Supreme Court.
""I continue to believe that the district court's conclusion that Qualcomm violated the antitrust laws was entirely correct and that the court of appeals erred in concluding otherwise,"" she added.
Speaking for Qualcomm, General Counsel Don Rosenberg said: ""We are pleased that the case is over and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal's unanimous decision stands.""
""Now, more than ever, we must preserve the fundamental incentives to innovate and compete,"" he added.

The Tesla driver, a 44-year-old, said he had his cruise control on ""when he momentarily lost focus on the roadway"" and drove his car under the trailer on Monday morning, according to a statement from the South Brunswick (NYSE:BC) Township Police Department. 
""The impact was so severe it shredded the roof off the passenger's side of the vehicle."" 
The Tesla was destroyed in the crash, but the driver received minor injuries. 
""NHTSA is aware of the Tesla crash on March 29 in New Jersey. We have contacted Tesla and local law enforcement regarding this crash and will act accordingly when we have more information,"" a representative of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement to Reuters. 

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comments. 
The NHTSA said earlier this month that it had opened 27 investigations into crashes of Tesla vehicles, 23 of which remain active, and at least three of the crashes occurred in recent weeks.

206,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2021 09:20PM ET</span>",Comeback quashed for faith-driven investor Bill Hwang,"By Lawrence Delevingne
(Reuters) - Bill Hwang’s comeback was nearly complete. Once punished by U.S. and Asian regulators for stock trading rule violations at his former hedge fund, the New York investor rebuilt his fortune to about $10 billion. Major Wall Street banks once again competed for his business. And his charitable foundation’s coffers swelled by hundreds of millions of dollars.
Hwang was making big money again, inspired by a renewed Christian faith. 
“When we create good companies through the capitalism that God has allowed, it enhances people’s lives….God delights in those things,” Hwang said in a video posted online in 2019 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcO5QVVtYiQ. 
But Hwang’s image on Wall Street unravelled again in the last week as Archegos Capital Management LP, the so-called family office that handled his fortune, defaulted on margin calls and triggered a fire sale of stocks, according to sources. As a result, Japanese bank Nomura and Switzerland's  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) are facing billions of dollars in losses.
Hwang did not directly respond to messages seeking comment.
Karen Kessler, a spokesperson for Archegos, said in an emailed statement, “This is a challenging time for the family office...our partners and employees. All plans are being discussed as Mr. Hwang and the team determine the best path forward.”
The son of a Korean pastor father, Hwang moved to the United States as a child and earned business degrees at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Carnegie Mellon University. 
He honed his stock-picking skills from 1996 to 2000 at Tiger Management, billionaire Julian Robertson’s pioneering hedge fund firm famed for betting on pairs of companies from the same industry, going long one seen as a winner and short the other identified as a laggard. 
In 2001, Hwang launched his own hedge fund business, Tiger Asia Management, with seed money from Robertson, making him part of an elite group of Robertson proteges dubbed the Tiger Cubs. 
Tiger Asia specialised in Asian securities and grew quickly to more than $8 billion in assets under management in 2007 after generating a dazzling 40% annualized return, according to a 2011 Institutional Investor arti https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b150y1xsth7v2y/tiger-cub-bill-hwangs-strugglescle.
FIRM CLOSES
But investment losses and regulatory issues in Hong Kong and the United States ultimately pushed the firm to shut in 2012, when Hwang pleaded guilty to wire fraud relating to illegal trading of Chinese bank stocks and separately paid $44 million to U.S authorities to settle insider trading charges https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crime-insidertrading-tiger-idUSBRE8BB1RG20121212. 
Hwang then turned the firm into a family office, renaming it Archegos Capital Management in early 2013. Little regulated, family offices are created to manage the wealth of private individuals and their families, as opposed to hedge funds, which traditionally manage money for outside clients such as pensions and wealthy individuals. He built the assets into $10 billion, according to a source familiar with the situation. 
Hwang has spoken frequently about his faith and business and co-founded a charity, the Grace and Mercy Foundation, which ""supports the poor and oppressed, and helps people learn, grow and serve,"" as well as encouraging the public reading of scripture, according to its website.
The foundation, where Hwang's wife Becky serves as a director, had nearly $500 million in assets in 2018, according to a public disclosure. 
People who know Hwang professionally describe him as a hard- working, smart investor who is willing to make big bets.
""Bill Hwang... runs a very concentrated, highly leveraged book,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital LLC in New York.
The exact financial cost to Hwang of the recent turmoil was unclear. Now in his mid-50s with thick glasses and slicked-back salt and pepper hair, Hwang has previously leaned on the Bible in times of stress. 

""I had really a bad business problem. And I knew no matter how much money I had, and I had a lot of money...and a lot of connections...but they couldn’t help me,"" he said at a Hawaiian Islands Ministries event in 2018 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fPOaGkDGDg. ""So one thing I knew is I had to go to the scripture.""

207,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2021 07:55PM ET</span>",China bonds set for billions of inflows after final FTSE WGBI nod,"(Reuters) - Index provider FTSE Russell gave final approval on Monday for inclusion of Chinese sovereign bonds in its flagship bond index, starting later this year, setting the stage for billions of dollars of inflows into the world's second-largest economy.
Chinese government bonds (CGBs) will be included in the FTSE World Government Bond Index (WGBI) from the end of October and will be phased in over three years, FTSE Russell said in a statement.
Chinese government bonds were previously included in index suites from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC), but FTSE WGBI inclusion is expected to have a larger effect due to the size of passive flows tracking it.
The 36-month phase-in is longer than the one-year process the index provider had flagged in September, and with roughly $2.5 trillion tracking the WGBI, some $130 billion in inflows could be expected given China's eventual 5.25% weighting.
FTSE said ""a more conservative implementation schedule is appropriate"" given feedback it received from market participants, which had included concerns from Japanese investors around settlement and liquidity.
""We commend China on the great progress it has made in market reforms,"" said Chris Woods, head of policy and governance at FTSE Russell.
""We will revisit progress on a regular basis and continue to work with the People's Bank of China to ensure that its reforms continue to yield tangible improvements to market structure.""
Pan Gongsheng, deputy governor at the People's Bank of China, welcomed the move and said in the FTSE Russell release that the central bank would work actively to promote the further opening of China bond market to international investors.
Foreign investors held a record 2.06 trillion yuan ($318.7 billion) of Chinese government bonds (CGBs) in February, even as premiums over U.S. debt shrank as a bond sell-off dented global markets.
FTSE Russell also announced that India and Saudi Arabia had been added to a watch list for potential inclusion in the WGBI and that Malaysia will no longer be on a list for potential downgrade of its status, owing to some market reforms.

208,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2021 07:45PM ET</span>","Ackman stays mum on $4 billion SPAC target, says a second may follow","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Joshua Franklin
BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman said on Monday that there was nothing to report yet on finding a target for his $4 billion blank-check investment vehicle.
Ackman made headlines last year when he raised Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, making it the biggest blank check company ever. It now has between $5 billion and $7 billion of equity capital for its initial business combination.
Speculation grew about Ackman's potential target - with talk about Airbnb Inc, Stripe, and Bloomberg L.P. being on his list. Late last year, he said he hoped to be able to break the news on a target by the end of the first quarter of 2021.
""Eight months since PSTH's launch, we remain convinced that an investment in PSTH will generate highly attractive long-term returns, even from PSTH’s current stock price,"" Ackman said in a report. 
""While we previously believed that we would be able to announce a potential transaction by the end of this quarter, we will not be in a position to do so.""
Ackman's Pershing Square Holdings fund has returned 5.9% this year after surging 70.2% last year.
Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) like Pershing Square Tontine raise money in an initial public offering with the aim of merging with a private company. For the private company, the process is an alternative to it doing an IPO itself. 
Pershing Square Tontine held talks with Airbnb, Reuters reported last year, but the home-rental start-up ultimately opted for a traditional IPO. 
In a regulatory filing for the IPO last year, Ackman's team highlighted the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on financial markets and corporate earnings as a likely constraint on the broader IPO market, creating an opportunity for his SPAC.
The market quickly rebounded, however, resulting in the busiest year for IPOs since 2000. In addition, a record amount of SPAC capital was raised, resulting in more competition.
Ackman said he would likely seek to raise a second SPAC once Pershing Square Tontine completed a merger. 
Pershing Square Tontine has until July 21, 2022 to do a deal or sign a letter of intent, which would then give it another six months to complete the merger. If it does not, the funds are returned to investors. 

Ackman also discussed environmental, social and governance - or ESG - issues, saying they are critical for his investments and play no role in trying to market to potential newcomers because he is not presently raising new capital.

209,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2021 07:40PM ET</span>",Analysis: Ready to roll: China flat steelmakers set to cash in on manufacturing boom,"By Min Zhang and Gavin Maguire
BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China's top flat steel producers are primed for profit from a post-COVID-19 recovery in global manufacturing and goods demand in 2021, as well as from an emissions-cutting drive that will likely knock out high-cost competitors, sector analysts said.
Prices for hot rolled coil (HRC) - flat steel rolled at high temperatures for use in cars, home appliances and machinery - has climbed 50% in the past six months as China's manufacturers cranked to life after coronavirus lockdowns were lifted in mid-2020. 
Profit margins of hot rolled coil in northern China https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/yxmvjwqnjpr/HRC%20profitgs.png
Steel demand from manufacturing is improving significantly and the ferrous sector will have the biggest supply shortage since 2017, when supply-side reforms slashed steel mill capacities, analysts with CITIC Securities said in a note. 
""Profits earned by steel firms are likely to hit a record this year,"" said CITIC Securities. 
MANUFACTURING MANIA 
Flat steel consumption has boomed since the second half of last year as China's mammoth manufacturing engine churned out home appliances, shipping containers, vehicles and other products in high demand across the world. 
That momentum has extended into 2021, with industrial output in January-February gaining 7.3% from December and 35.1% from a year earlier, and it is expected to accelerate as more regional economies recover from 2020's COVID-19 skid.
Shipments of metal-heavy items to overseas market have also jumped this year. Exports of new-made containers more than doubled during January-February compared with the same months of 2020, while vehicle exports rose 85%. 
""We expect flat steel products will outperform construction materials this year ... while overseas recovery will benefit China's exports for such metals,"" said Shen Yonggang, an analyst with Huatai Futures in Beijing.
China's industrial products output https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/jbyprabqove/output.png
SUPPLY-SIDE REFORM 2.0
While robust factory activity has boosted steelmaker profitability all around, it's China's carbon neutrality goal - what some call ""supply-side reform 2.0"" - that stands to reshape the sector in favour of the largest players, said analysts. 
Steelmakers account for 15% of China's carbon emissions, making the sector key to whether the nation can achieve its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2030.
China's environment ministry recently ramped up inspections on steel plants in Tangshan - heart of the nation's steel industry - after it found four mills had failed to adopt emergency pollution measures to improve air quality. 
As a result, output cuts of between 30% and 50% have been enforced for the rest of the year on 23 long-process steelmakers in the city - including plants owned by state-backed HBIS Group and private operators - that were deemed to lack sufficient pollution controls. That is expected to boost the profitability at plants able to operate at full capacity. 
""Half of Tangshan's steel are flat products,"" said Li Wentao, analyst with Tianfeng Futures. 
""If the production curbs continue, overall profits for flat products could reach or even surpass 2018,"" Li said, referring to big gains in the industry after China's supply-side reform to eliminate excess and outdated steel capacities. 
Tangshan's crude steel output stood at 144 million tonnes last year, accounting for 13.5% of China's total, and was 45% more than produced by the world's second largest steelmaker, India.

STOCKS SURGE
Fuelled by the upbeat sentiment, share prices of listed steel firms, which have long underperformed consumer and financial stocks in China, became the top equity market performers so far this year. 
China steel stocks index jump in the first quarter https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/gjnpwokxnpw/INDEX.png
Stocks of China's top listed steelmaker Baoshan Iron & Steel Co Ltd, which is also the biggest auto sheet supplier, have climbed 38% so far in 2021. 
Hunan Valin Steel Co Ltd, which told investors its order books from machine and appliance makers are full for the coming one to two months, saw its shares rise over 44%. 
""The most fast-growing period for steel equities has not come yet,"" according to Tang Chuanlin, analyst with CITIC Securities. 
""The steel (performance) is not just a quarterly matter, but a certainty of the year.""

210,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2021 07:27PM ET</span>",Global bank losses may top $6 billion on Archegos downfall,"By Makiko Yamazaki, John Revill and Matt Scuffham
TOKYO/ZURICH/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global banks may lose more than $6 billion from the downfall of Archegos Capital, sources familiar with trades involving the U.S. investment firm said on Monday, as regulators and investors feared the episode would reverberate more widely.
Japan's Nomura and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) of Switzerland warned of major losses from lending to Archegos for equity derivatives trades, triggering a worldwide sell-off in banking stocks.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) shares fell 2.6% and  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) dropped 1.7%. Nomura shares closed down 16.3%, a record one-day drop, while Credit Suisse shares tumbled 14%, their biggest fall in a year.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) dropped 5% and UBS was off 3.8%.
Losses at Archegos Capital Management, run by former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang, sparked a fire sale of stocks including ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) on Friday, a source familiar with the matter said.
""This is a challenging time for the family office of Archegos Capital Management, our partners and employees,"" company spokesperson Karen Kessler said in a statement. ""All plans are being discussed as Mr. Hwang and the team determine the best path forward.""
Archegos was unable to meet banks' calls for more collateral to secure equity swap trades they had partly financed. After those positions fell sharply in value, lenders sold big blocks of securities to recoup what they were owed, the sources said.
""This is the kind of thing that happens in a speculative environment. You start finding that things go wrong,"" said Richard Bernstein, chief executive of Richard Bernstein Advisors. ""When you have people making certain bets based on what has outperformed in the past and the tide turns they get burned. The question is how much leverage they used.""
Nomura, Japan's largest investment bank, warned of a possible $2 billion loss, while Credit Suisse said a default on margin calls by a U.S.-based fund could be ""highly significant and material"" to its first-quarter results.
Two sources said Credit Suisse's losses were likely to be at least $1 billion. One of them said the losses could reach $4 billion, a figure also reported by the Financial Times. Credit Suisse declined to comment.
But several other banks appeared to be relatively unscathed. The financial impact on Goldman Sachs was immaterial, a separate source said. Likewise, Morgan Stanley, which sold $4 billion in stocks related to Archegos on Friday, did not incur major losses, CNBC reported.
Deutsche Bank said in a statement it had significantly de-risked its Archegos exposure without incurring any losses and was managing down its ""immaterial remaining client positions,"" on which it did not expect to incur a loss.
The broader market impact was muted with the U.S. S&P 500 benchmark closing slightly lower, while financials ended down more than 2%. 
""You continue to see strength in the overall market. There is not fear of selling stocks all together, there's just fear in pockets of the market,"" said Dennis Dick, head of market structure at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. 
REGULATORS WATCHING CLOSELY
Investors questioned if the full impact of Archegos' problem had been realized.
Market observers noted that only in February, hedge funds took major losses on short positions during the run-up in  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) stock. That forced hedge fund Melvin Capital Management to borrow money from another fund to stay afloat. Hedge fund de-leveraging also contributed toward turmoil in the U.S. Treasuries market in March 2020.
In the case of Archegos, the opaque and complex nature of its derivative trades, lightly regulated structure as a family office and high leverage - fueled by historically low interest rates - prompted concern about potential systemic risk.
Regulators in the United States, UK, Switzerland and Japan said they were closely monitoring developments. 
Archegos bought derivatives known as total return swaps, which allow investors to bet on stock price moves without owning the underlying securities, according to one source familiar with the trades. The fund posts collateral against the securities rather than buying them outright with cash.
Archegos' positions were highly leveraged. The firm had assets of around $10 billion but held positions worth more than $50 billion, according to the source who declined to be identified. 
Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital LLC in New York, said Hwang was known to run ""a very concentrated, highly leveraged book.""
The underlying shares were held by Archegos' prime brokers, which lent it money and structured and processed its trades. They included Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and Nomura.
Unwinding the positions led banks to sell large blocks of stock. Shares of ViacomCBS and Discovery each tumbled around 27% on Friday, while U.S.-listed shares of China-based Baidu and Tencent Music plunged as much as 33.5% and 48.5% last week.
Other stocks caught up in Archegos-related liquidations included Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU),  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (NYSE:TME), Vipshop (NYSE:VIPS) Holdings Ltd, Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) Ltd, iQIYI Inc and GSX Techedu (NYSE:GSX) Inc.
Hwang, who ran Tiger Asia from 2001 to 2012, renamed the hedge fund Archegos Capital and converted it to a family office, according to a page capture of the fund's website. Family offices act as private wealth managers and have lower disclosure requirements than other investment companies. 
Hedge fund managers said they wondered why Hwang, whom several described as a ""smart guy,"" had made such big bets on ViacomCBS and Discovery, given the large wagers against the companies. The pair are not seen as high-growth plays, in contrast to other media stocks that have outperformed during the COVID-19 pandemic, the sources said.

Hwang and his firm in 2012 paid $44 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission insider trading charges.

Indexes ended off their lowest levels of the day. Optimism about speedy vaccinations and record stimulus, which drove the Dow and the S&P 500 to record closing highs last week, helped keep a floor in the market along with upbeat estimates for upcoming earnings, she said.

Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc, ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC), U.S.-listed shares of Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and VIPShop, all linked to Archegos, fell, extending recent losses.
The Nasdaq was on track to post its first monthly decline in five months.

Investing.com -- The shipping container broke free and returned the Suez Canal to working order on Monday, meaning people had to find something else to fuss about.
Now that oil, liquified natural gas and goods can flow freely through one of the world’s most important maritime routes, the focus shifts back to the economic reopening. One big beneficiary is  Boeing Co  (NYSE:BA), which got a boost from big news on Monday: Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) will buy 100 737 Max jets from it.

It’s a light calendar for data this week, though President Joe Biden is expected to grab some headlines when he unveils his multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
!. Debut of a new space ETF

 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)’s partner in the vaccine race, BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), is scheduled to report its quarterly results for December on Tuesday. Analysts tracked by Zacks have the consensus for the quarter at a loss of 56 cents, which would be more than the loss of 27 cents reported in the prior year’s quarter. 
The vaccine rollouts have stepped up in recent weeks, with President Biden setting a new target of 200 million shots in arms by the end of his first 100 days in office. On Monday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said people 30 and up are eligible on Tuesday, and those 16 and up starting early next month. New York is just the latest to open vaccine eligibility to all adults.

(Reuters) - Starboard Value LP withdrew its nominations to  Elanco Animal Health  (NYSE:ELAN) Inc's board this month, sparing the U.S. pet drug manufacturer from a battle with the activist hedge fund, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
Elanco did not make any concessions to Starboard, the sources said, and it is not clear why the New York-based investment firm walked away from a board challenge after putting forward three director nominees. It is also not clear whether Starboard has retained its stake in Elanco.
While the Greenfield, Indiana-based company's shares got a boost following the release of its fourth-quarter earnings last month, they nosedived on March 19 after some U.S. lawmakers asked for its popular pet collars that repel flea and ticks to be recalled because of reports linking them to hundreds of pet deaths. Elanco says the collars, named Seresto, are safe.
Neither Starboard nor Elanco immediately responded to a request for comment.
Elanco reported strong fourth quarter 2020 earnings last month with revenue of $1.14 billion, which beat company guidance. It also raised its revenue guidance for 2021.
Some analysts said earlier this month that even though Seresto is likely to be safe, consumer fears could hurt Elanco's business.
""The negative press is apt to pressure Seresto sales, especially as this is an over-the-counter product that does not require interaction with a vet,"" Cowen analysts wrote in a research note earlier this month.
Elanco faced pressure in December from activist Sachem Head Capital Head Management LP, and agreed to hand it three board seats, including one to its portfolio manager Scott Ferguson. 
Starboard also nominated directors at eHealth Inc this month, after the health insurer had just settled with another activist. Last year, Starboard won 24 seats on boards of companies it invested in, more than any other activist hedge fund.

The country’s vaccine advisory committee will recommend authorities “pause” giving the Astra vaccine to people under 55 because of a risk of blood clots, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported, citing people it didn’t name. The federal government has been in touch with provinces on the matter, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said at a news conference Monday.
“The feds are saying it’s still safe for 55 plus and I understand there has been blood clots, some patients in the U.K., female folks about 30, 35 years old,” Ford said. “I’ll tell you, I won’t hesitate to cancel that in half a heartbeat if it’s going to put anyone in harm.”
The move could cast further doubts about the efficacy of the vaccine, after concerns raised in Europe about potential side effects.
It would also represent a reversal in Canada, where only two weeks ago Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sought to reassure Canadians the AstraZenaca vaccine was safe for use. His government is due to receive 1.5 million doses of the vaccine from the U.S. this week.
Last week, Denmark extended its suspension of the AstraZeneca vaccine for another three weeks and Sweden has decided to use it only on people older than 65.

220,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2021 02:00PM ET</span>",Boeing asks Delaware court to throw out investors' 737 MAX lawsuit,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co asked a Delaware court to throw out a shareholders' lawsuit over the safety of its 737 MAX following fatal crashes, saying the board engaged in ""robust and well-established"" oversight of jet's development.
In an amended complaint unsealed in February, New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who heads the state pension fund, and other investors argued that Boeing's board breached its fiduciary duties and acted with gross negligence by failing ""to monitor the safety of Boeing's 737 MAX airplanes."" 
The lawsuit, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, also alleges that the board did not develop any tools to evaluate and monitor airplane safety until after two 737 MAX crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia killed 346 people in a span of five months, and the fleet was grounded. 
It also said the board did not receive a briefing about the basics of airplane safety until the end of April 2019, several weeks after the jet's worldwide grounding. 
In its motion to dismiss the complaint, made public on Monday, Boeing said the plaintiffs ignore ""the robust systems that had long been in place"" to keep the board informed about significant risk issues. 
""Boeing's Directors maintained this high scrutiny, moreover, during a period in which commercial aircraft, and Boeing's in particular, achieved ever higher levels of safety,"" Boeing said, ""a trend that cannot be squared with Plaintiffs' simplistic narrative about a 'safety-engineering culture' that had been 'intentionally dismantled.'""
Boeing had management briefings at the board and an internal corporate audit group to evaluate risks, as well as a mechanism to receive reports on employee ethics and compliance complaints, Boeing said. 
A Boeing representative referred to the filing and declined further comment. A lawyer representing the plaintiffs declined to comment. 
Since 2019, Boeing's board has implemented changes to improve oversight of Boeing's engineering and industrial operations as the company navigated fallout over the nearly two-year grounding of the best-selling 737 MAX after the crashes.
Emails and memos released under court order on March 4 show executives and board members discussing combating negative press coverage, and one veteran board member suggesting the board elevate its attention to safety and quality at their meetings.
""I believe we should devote the entire board meeting (other than required committee meetings and reports) to a review of quality within Boeing,"" veteran board member Art Collins wrote to fellow board member Dave Calhoun, now Boeing's chief executive, days after the second crash in 2019.
Boeing later acknowledged, as part of a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Justice Department in January this year, that the company concealed details about a crucial flight control system at the center of the two crashes from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.

Boeing employees also worked to have references to the system, known as MCAS, omitted from flight crew operating manuals as part of the company's goal of avoiding costlier pilot training requirements, according to the agreement.

Previous administrations distributed mining permits ""like confetti,"" as well as licenses for fuel imports, due to ""speculation,"" he told reporters at a regular news conference. 
""Now they are returning the concessions because they do not want to pay the taxes,"" Lopez Obrador said. ""We hope that the territory that was handed over is recovered,"" he added.
Lopez Obrador did not name any specific companies.
The leftist energy nationalist said the area dedicated to mining concessions was about 120 million hectares.
The president also said that a new hydrocarbons law he sent to Congress on Friday has a similar aim to recoup unused concessions.
That draft legislation could enable the government to suspend permits in the oil industry, although Lopez Obrador reiterated that he would respect existing contracts.
Lopez Obrador said some firms got as many as 10 permits to import gas during what he calls the ""neoliberal era"" before his government, but those companies never built facilities, ports or pipelines to import the gas. 

He has attacked his predecessor, former President Enrique Pena Nieto, for opening the energy market as an illustration of chronic political corruption.

222,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2021 01:45PM ET</span>","In Goldman securities case, U.S. Supreme Court wrestles over investor class actions","By Andrew Chung
(Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Monday struggled in a case involving  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) over how judges should determine when shareholders can collectively sue publicly traded companies for fraudulent statements that keep their stock prices artificially high.
The justices heard arguments in Goldman's appeal of a lower court ruling that permitted a class action suit by shareholders accusing the bank and three former executives of concealing conflicts of interest when creating risky subprime securities before the 2008 financial crisis in violation of a federal investor-protection law. 
The Arkansas Teacher Retirement System and other pensions that purchased Goldman shares between February 2007 and June 2010 sued the company, accusing it of violating an anti-fraud provision of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a related SEC regulation. 
Central to the dispute are the shareholders' claims that when they bought Goldman shares they relied upon the bank's statements about its ethical principles and internal controls against conflicts of interest, and its pledge that its ""clients' interests always come first."" Goldman has argued that these ""aspirational"" statements were too vague and general to have had any impact on the stock price. 
Questions posed by the justices during the arguments indicated that when they rule in the case they could provide guidance to judges to consider the generic nature of a company's statements in deciding whether market price was affected. 
But the justices appeared to struggle over how to make that determination and what evidence may be used. Businesses often seek to limit the ability of plaintiffs to pursue class actions in order to avoid the higher damages often seen in such litigation.
""How are you defining generic or, stated otherwise, what kinds of statements are not generic?"" Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked an attorney for Goldman. 
Some justices wondered how courts would analyze a class action against a company that simply called itself ""nice."" 
""There are people who would regard, 'We are a nice company,' as a fraudulent statement depending upon subsequent events, and how would they make that case?"" Chief Justice John Roberts asked. 
The case stemmed from Goldman's sale of collateralized debt obligations including Abacus 2007 AC-1, which it assembled with help from hedge fund manager John Paulson.
In 2010, Goldman reached a $550 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to resolve charges that it cheated Abacus investors by concealing Paulson's role, including how he made a $1 billion profit by betting the sale of collateralized debt obligations would fail.
The plaintiffs said that the share price would have been lower if the truth had been known about the company's conflicts of interest, adding that they lost more than $13 billion due to Goldman's conduct.
The Manhattan-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year upheld a federal judge's decision to let the plaintiffs sue as a group and rejected the company's argument that generic statements can never impact a stock price. 

A ruling is due by the end of June.

223,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2021 01:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Adam Neumann's final WeWork act - helping SoftBank's SPAC deal,"By Joshua Franklin and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) - An unlikely figure helped set the spark for SoftBank Group Corp's $9 billion deal to take WeWork public. 
Adam Neumann, WeWork's co-founder and ousted chief executive, met in November with the head of the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that would go on to clinch a deal with WeWork, according to people familiar with the matter.
Neumann was locked in a fierce legal battle at the time with SoftBank over a $3 billion deal for a portion of his and other investors' stake in the office space-sharing company. 
The introduction between Neumann and BowX Acquisition Corp co-chief executive Vivek Ranadivé over a Zoom call was facilitated by a senior UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) capital markets banker, the sources said. It preceded discussions the SPAC chief had with WeWork.
Neumann played up WeWork's prospects on the call and the conversation piqued Ranadivé's interest, the sources said. 
Ranadivé's SPAC had been looking for an acquisition target after raising $420 million in an IPO in August.
The ensuing deal announced on Friday cushions some of the blow SoftBank has suffered with its investment in WeWork. It has invested at least $18.5 billion in WeWork since 2017, including $6 billion when a fundraising round valued the startup at $47 billion in January 2019.
The sources described the meeting between Neumann and Ranadivé on condition of anonymity. Representatives for Neumann, WeWork, UBS and SoftBank declined to comment. Ranadivé did not respond to multiple requests for comment. 
Neumann, who has kept a low profile since his unceremonious ouster after WeWork's failed IPO attempt in 2019, has had a contentious relationship with SoftBank.
The Japanese tech investment giant pushed for his ouster before it took over WeWork in a $10 billion rescue financing deal in October 2019. It later backtracked on an agreement to buy $3 billion of WeWork shares from Neumann and other investors, citing criminal and civil investigations into WeWork, the company's failure to restructure a joint venture in China, and the shift to remote work due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
One week before the case was due to go to trial, SoftBank reached a settlement with Neumann and other investors in February to pay out about half of its original commitment. It did not want the potential legal liability to jeopardize the SPAC deal, the sources said. 
Neumann also stands to benefit from the SPAC deal as he still has a roughly 10% stake in WeWork, worth around $790 million.
LIMITED OPTIONS
Neumann had no role in the SPAC deal after his discussion with Ranadivé, the sources said. Ranadivé and his team began discussions with WeWork in December. SoftBank Chief Operating Officer and WeWork Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure led the negotiations on behalf of SoftBank, with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son also stepping in, one of the sources said.
WeWork was apprehensive about opting for a traditional IPO following its failed attempt in 2019, and its options for a SPAC deal were limited. BowX was the only SPAC that expressed a serious interest in WeWork, two of the sources said.
Ranadivé, a 63-year-old technology executive turned investor and owner of the Sacramento Kings basketball team, said last week WeWork stood to benefit from a shift by many companies to a hybrid model of working that calls for employees to come in to a workplace just a few days a month.
He called the shift a tailwind for WeWork.
The deal was received well by Wall Street, with BowX shares ending trade on Friday up 20% following the merger's announcement.
WeWork's valuation was revised down in the final stages of the negotiations. Investors participating in the private investment in public equity (PIPE) transaction managed to drive down WeWork's valuation in the agreement from $9.9 billion to $9 billion, including debt, the sources said. The size of the PIPE increased to $800 million from $500 million. 

Ranadivé and the rest of the BowX senior team will receive WeWork shares worth almost $90 million after investing $11.7 million of their own money. They will be restricted from selling these shares for the first year unless certain share price targets are met.

Investing.com --  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) fell 1% after distancing itself from Lil Nas X, who dropped blood-filled Nike-branded shoes on the heels of a new video that enraged the puritanical contingents.
The singer's new footwear was created using Nike Air Max 97s, though the company said it had nothing to do with the stunt. The black and red sneakers feature pentagrams, inverted crosses and a drop of real human blood in each, and went on sale today for $1,018. There were only 666 pairs made and all but one have been sold. Fear not, for that last pair is still available via lottery to be announced April 1. The shoes are part of a collaboration between Lil Nas X and New York-based art collective MSCHF.
""We do not have a relationship with Lil Nas or MSCHF,"" Nike said in a statement to CNN. ""Nike did not design or release these shoes and we do not endorse them.""
It's unclear whether investors were disappointed that Nike wasn't involved, or fearful that despite saying they're not involved the more conservative among us might boycott the product. But it sure piqued everyone's attention.
Churchgoing types like the evangelical pastor Mark Burns tweeted over the weekend that the shoes are a ""heresy,"" while South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said of the shoes that, ""We are in a fight for the soul of our nation. We need to fight hard. And we need to fight smart. We have to win.""
Lil Nas, citing the long pole down which he slides in the video that would probably be rated R if it was a movie, pointed out via Twitter that ""there is a mass shooting every week that our government does nothing to stop. me sliding down a cgi pole isn’t what’s destroying society.""
The price is apparently a reference to the Bible passage Luke 10:18 that reads: ""I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.""
A MSCHF spokesperson told CNN the blood had been provided by members of the art collective, adding: ""We love to sacrifice for our art.""    "

Chairman Helio Magalhaes and current board members Brandao, Jose Monforte and Fabio Barbosa are not among the names proposed to shareholders by the government. They all had been appointed by Economy Minister Paulo Guedes.
Brandao resigned after Bolsonaro disagreed with cost-cutting measures taken by the CEO, such as the closure of some branches and an employee buyout program.
Bolsonaro named Fausto Ribeiro, currently the CEO of a small business unit of Banco do Brasil, to replace Brandao on March 18. The new CEO's appointment is still conditional on approval by the bank's human resources committee and an official nomination by Bolsonaro.
Ribeiro's appointment was opposed by several existing board's members. Still, it is not clear whether the four outgoing directors decided not to apply for a renewal of their mandate or if the government pushed them out.
Two former Banco do Brasil executives, Aramis de Andrade and Walter Ribeiro, have been designated to replace two of the outgoing directors. Ieda Cagni, a civil servant at the Office of the General Counsel to the National Treasury, has been named to take the third vacant board seat.
If Fausto Ribeiro is approved as CEO, he will also become a board member.
The appointments contrast with Guedes' idea of nominating independent members with experience outside the government to state-controlled companies.

Magalhaes, for instance, previously headed the Brazilian units of  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP).

MILAN (Reuters) - World shares held up on Monday as optimism about the economic recovery and hopes that the Suez Canal could be reopened soon offset uncertainty related to the default of a U.S. hedge fund.
Investors were on edge about who had been caught out in the default of the fund, named by sources as Archegos Capital, after Nomura and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) warned of big losses and block trades on Friday hit some U.S. and Chinese stocks. 
The partial re-floating of the huge container ship blocking the Suez Canal for nearly a week however raised hopes that the vital waterway could reopen soon and ease global shipping backlogs.
Investors were also looking to President Joe Biden to outline this week his infrastructure spending plan, which could supercharge an already accelerating U.S. recovery.
""There is plenty of U.S. fiscal stimulus in supply and therefore growth in the coming quarters is going to be very good,"" said Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia in Milan. 
""I don't see Archegos posing a systemic threat at the moment and don't think its default will represent a watershed between a bull and a bear market,"" he added.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, rose 0.1% by 1205 GMT.
After a mixed performance in Asia, shares in Europe turned higher and were last up 0.3%, while U.S. futures dipped slightly although they came off earlier lows. Nasdaq futures fell 0.1% and S&P 500 futures fell 0.4%.
U.S. and euro zone volatility gauges picked up from last week's lows.
Credit Suisse shares were set for their worst day in one year, down 14%, while Nomura fell 16% in its largest drop on record, limiting gains for Japanese shares. 
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) economist Christian Keller in London said he expected large U.S. fiscal stimulus to expand ""robustly"" at 6.4% with positive spillovers for the rest of the world.
""Rising inflation over the coming months should be transitory, and core central banks seem committed to looking through it,"" he said. 
The prospect of faster U.S. economic growth has spurred speculation of rising inflation and weighed on Treasury prices. 
Yields on U.S. 10-year notes eased a touch to 1.646%, but were not far from the recent 13-month top of 1.754%.
European yields have been restrained by active buying from the European Central Bank, widening the dollar's yield advantage over the euro. The single currency was last down 0.1% at $1.177, just above a five-month low hit last week. 
The dollar index was little changed at 92.769, after reaching its highest since mid-November last week.
The lift in yields has weighed on gold, which offers no fixed return. Spot gold was down 0.4% at $1,724 an ounce.
Oil reversed earlier losses on expectations that the OPEC+ group of leading producers will keep output unchanged when it meets this week.
Investors also bet that operations in the Suez Canal might take weeks to return to normal even though a ship blocking it has been partly refloated. 

Brent were up 0.8% to $65.09 a barrel, while U.S. crude added 0.7% to $61.38 per barrel.

237,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2021 10:30AM ET</span>",Special Report: Money trail from Daphne murder probe stretches to China,"VALLETTA/SHANGHAI, March 29 (Reuters) - By Stephen Grey, Engen Tham, Jacob Borg and Christoph Giesen
A widening investigation into allegations of high-level corruption on the island of Malta, first levelled by murdered journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, stretches to China and a $400 million investment into Europe by a Chinese state power company, Reuters has found.
Caruana Galizia was murdered in October 2017 as she investigated a web of companies that she believed were funneling bribes to Maltese politicians.
Now, Reuters and a consortium of journalists have traced two firms involved in that web to relatives of a senior Chinese executive for Accenture (NYSE:ACN), the global consultancy firm. The executive, 43-year-old Chen Cheng from Shanghai, negotiated investments on behalf of China's state-owned Shanghai Electric Power in Malta and in another small European state, Montenegro, over the past decade, according to Maltese officials and official records.
The revelation of a Chinese connection potentially adds a new international dimension to a scandal that has rocked Malta's government and last year led to the resignation of the prime minister. It also could figure in a series of Maltese official investigations into the events leading up to Caruana Galizia's death.
Backed by Malta's government, the investments by Shanghai Electric Power were portrayed by Maltese and Chinese political leaders as one component of China's multi-trillion dollar Belt and Road initiative to pour money into economic infrastructure in central Asia and Europe.
In 2016, a year before she was murdered in a car bombing, Caruana Galizia identified Chen's key role in the transactions on her blog.
A total of six people in Malta have been charged with Caruana Galizia's killing and await trial. There is no suggestion that Accenture, Chen or any Chinese company or individual is linked with that crime.
Caruana Galizia reported that Chen created a company in the British Virgin Islands in 2014, for an unknown purpose. In the same year, Chen played a central role in negotiations and due diligence for Shanghai Electric Power to invest 380 million euros ($400 million) in buying a share of Malta's state power company, Enemalta. Caruana Galizia did not specify any wrongdoing by Chen. Chen and Accenture did not respond to Caruana Galizia's report at the time.
Now, reporters at Reuters, the Times of Malta, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and the Süddeutsche Zeitung, have discovered that Chen's family set up two further companies in Hong Kong, both with business links to Malta.
Contacted for this article, Chen and Shanghai Electric Power didn't comment. Accenture said in a statement it is taking the matter very seriously and ""carefully reviewing these allegations as they relate to one of our people. We adhere to the highest ethical standards in every market in which we operate and have zero tolerance for any deviation from those standards."" Enemalta declined to answer questions about Chen.
The office of the spokesperson of China's foreign ministry said, ""China's exchanges and cooperation with other countries are all open and transparent.""
The first of the companies set up by the Chen family, known as Macbridge, planned to pay up to $2 million to Panama firms controlled by two Maltese politicians, Reuters has previously reported. The second, called Dow's Media Company, received one million euros ($1.2 million) from a business owned by one of Malta's richest men, Yorgen Fenech, according to financial records seen by Reuters. Fenech is in jail, awaiting trial on a charge of masterminding Caruana Galizia's murder. He has pleaded not guilty.
According to international legal requests seen by Reuters, Maltese law enforcement officials suspect that Macbridge and Dow's Media were part of an elaborate scheme, involving some participants in the China-Malta deals, to make payments to politicians in Malta and siphon off profits for themselves. Reuters was unable to independently determine whether or not that suspicion is correct. Chen has not responded to Reuters' questions on the matter.
Fenech's lawyers declined to comment about any links between their client and Chen.

DAPHNE'S MYSTERY
Caruana Galizia first picked up on the money trail that would eventually lead to China in 2016 when, according to her family and records of her work seen by Reuters, she started to investigate two mystery businesses that she suspected were being used to pay bribes to politicians.
The journalist had few details of the two companies beyond their names, 17 Black Ltd and Macbridge Ltd, and a tip-off from an official source that they were part of a scheme to pay ""kickbacks"" – undeclared profits from government schemes - to some senior politicians. Caruana Galizia texted her son Matthew in April 2016 that she'd heard the two companies were ""crucial to unravelling the web.""
The tip-off followed the discovery by Maltese officials of an email written in December 2015 by accountants for two senior figures – Konrad Mizzi, then energy minister, and Keith Schembri, chief of staff and close friend of the prime minister at the time, Joseph Muscat. That email named 17 Black and Macbridge as ""target clients"" that would pay an estimated $2 million into then-secret Panama companies owned by Schembri and Mizzi.
When news of the email was published in local and international media in April 2018, six months after Caruana Galizia's murder, Schembri confirmed publicly having unrealised ""draft business plans"" with Macbridge and 17 Black but denied any wrongdoing. Last December, he told a public inquiry into the journalist's death that Macbridge had been included in the December 2015 e-mail ""by mistake.""
Earlier this month, Schembri was charged with money laundering, forgery and corruption in an unrelated matter. He denies the charges and is in jail awaiting preliminary court hearings. He didn't comment for this article.
Mizzi said he had no knowledge of Macbridge or 17 Black, nor any knowledge of the email. Mizzi has not been charged in any criminal case. He reiterated in a statement to Reuters that he rejects any suggestion he had business plans with Macbridge or a personal interest in any public project. Mizzi said he knew Chen as a consultant assisting Shanghai Electric Power, ""and my interactions with him were in that official context.""
When Caruana Galizia was killed, she was still following the 17 Black-Macbridge tip, which she believed held the key to understanding why Mizzi and Schembri set up their Panama firms.
""Working out the truth of those two companies was really at the centre of her work. She was determined to get to the bottom of that mystery,"" recalled Matthew Caruana Galizia, her son, who was first on the scene of the car bomb.
A year after the assassination, Reuters and the Times of Malta traced 17 Black Ltd to a bank in Dubai and identified its owner as Fenech, the Malta tycoon.
A year later, in Nov. 2019, Fenech was arrested at sea as he attempted to leave Malta in his luxury yacht. He was charged a few days later with masterminding the journalist’s assassination, an accusation he denies.
The mystery of Macbridge remained.
TRAIL FROM A BUSINESS CARD
When police searched Fenech's flat, they found a business card for the Accenture consultant Chen.
As detectives questioned Fenech, the accused tycoon added another piece to the puzzle. According to records of the interview, reviewed by Reuters, Fenech told police he had information about Macbridge, which he said stood for ""Malta China Bridge."" He gave no further details. It isn't clear if he was asked about Chen or the business card.
After learning of Fenech's disclosure, Reuters searched records in China and found a company called Macbridge International Development Company Ltd, which was registered in Hong Kong on Sept. 30, 2014.
Hong Kong's company register doesn't disclose who owns Macbridge. The sole director was named as a 65-year-old Chinese citizen, a woman called Tang Zhaomin.. Further records found in the Panama Papers, the trove of 11.5 million documents about offshore companies obtained by the Süddeutsche Zeitung, confirmed that Tang, via a company in the Indian Ocean island of Seychelles, was also the ultimate owner of Macbridge.
But who was Tang? The Panama Papers contained only a grainy photocopy of her passport; there was no address or telephone number.
(Graphic: The windfall - https://graphics.reuters.com/MALTA-DAPHNE/CHINA/nmoparbrdva/MALTA-DAPHNE-CHINA-2.jpg)
AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHER
Her name was a rare one, however, and other company databases led reporters to the Chinese city of Shanghai. There, a review of social media showed Tang was a keen amateur photographer, a former manager in a car plant and former manager with Yum China, which operates the Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) brand in China. In recent years, she had registered small investments in several local companies.
By tracing her posts on the social media platform Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), reporters made a discovery. Tang identified herself as the mother-in-law of the Accenture consultant Chen, referring to herself as ""Granny"" to Chen's children. A family member later confirmed the Tang-Chen relationship to Reuters.
Tang could not be reached for comment. Questions delivered to a major outdoor advertising company where she is currently listed in corporate records as a manager and shareholder were not answered.
A subsequent trip by a Reuters reporter to the city of Nanjing, 180 miles from Shanghai, proved more useful. The purpose was to visit a catering company that public corporate records showed Tang co-owns. That company's headquarters turned out to be a KFC franchise, located in a shopping complex and serving American fast food with a Chinese twist: fried chicken meals for around 40 yuan ($6) and gelatinous durian fruit balls.
The visit revealed a new connection with Chen, the Accenture executive, and with Malta. A staff member at another nearby KFC, run by the same catering company that Tang co-owns, said she had no knowledge of Tang Zhaomin but she did know another co-owner, a woman called Wang Rui. Wang is the boss of the catering company, the staffer said, but rarely visits the KFC outlets.
Wang Rui, records showed, is the director of a Hong Kong firm called Dow's Media Company that was set up in 2014 within a fortnight of Macbridge. According to bank records, seen by Reuters, Yorgen Fenech's 17 Black paid one million euros to Dow's Media in 2016.
With a number supplied by KFC staff, Wang Rui was contacted by phone. She told Reuters she is a cousin of Tang Zhaomin and Tang is Chen's mother-in-law. She said she set up Dow's Media at Chen's request and for his purposes, and knew nothing about the million euros or the firm's activities.
""He asked me to set up the company and I thought there wasn't any problem in doing so,"" Wang said of Chen. ""He told me that it would do media-type work."" She added that Chen at the time had told her he could not set the company up himself because of his connection to a state-owned enterprise. Wang didn't name that company or otherwise elaborate.
Maltese investigators are also on the trail of Dow's Media and Macbridge. In international legal requests, reviewed by Reuters, they have sought information about the firms' business activities, their money flows and their ultimate owners. In one such request, via Interpol in 2018, Malta's police asked China about Dow's Media and the one million euros the firm received from Fenech's 17 Black in 2016. The sum may have involved ""illicit funds"" linked to ""possible corruption and money laundering,"" Malta's police said. There was no record of a reply from China, a Maltese official said. The office of the spokesperson of China's foreign ministry said it was unaware of the matter.
Malta made other legal requests for information to the United Arab Emirates related to the potential payments by Macbridge to the Maltese politicians Schembri and Mizzi. These requests also cite possible corruption and money laundering. The UAE told Malta that it found no trace of Macbridge.
PAYMENTS
In June 2020, Reuters and the Times of Malta revealed that Fenech's 17 Black took a secret $5 million profit from a Montenegro wind farm project involving Shanghai Electric and Malta's state power firm Enemalta. Chen had promoted the project in a presentation to Enemalta's board, according to an internal audit by Enemalta.
In 2016, 17 Black received its $5 million profit from the wind farm. Two weeks before that payday, in May of that year, Fenech's firm made the first of three payments to Dow's Media, according to bank records seen by Reuters and the Interpol request to China by Maltese investigators. The payments, totalling one million euros, were completed two months later.
The disclosure of Chen's private businesses may pose a problem for him at Accenture, where he has been employed as a managing director of its energy business, the firm's ethics handbook suggests. Accenture does not outright prohibit its employees from having private business interests, but it warns against possible conflicts of interest, including the use of Accenture information or its position ""for personal gain (or that of family members or close friends).""
Asked about Chen's links to Macbridge and Dow's Media and his relationship via these firms with Maltese business and political figures, Accenture said it is carefully reviewing the allegations. Shanghai Electric Power didn't respond to questions about Chen's role. A spokesman for Enemalta said that following its internal audit of the wind farm deal ""the report was passed on to the Police to assist in any investigations. Any further comments at this stage would be imprudent.""
BURGEONING INVESTIGATION

In Malta, the uncovering of the China connection could play into a series of official corruption investigations. There is a public inquiry into the events leading up to Caruana Galizia's death, a judicial investigation into 17 Black, a judicial inquiry into the Montenegro wind farm deal, and an ongoing investigation by Malta Police's financial crimes unit into 17 Black, Macbridge and wider corruption claims.
In Montenegro, the exposure by Reuters last year of 17 Black's role in financing the wind farm deal has prompted a judicial inquiry. The same report also led to the expulsion of Konrad Mizzi, the former energy minister, from Malta's Labour Party. Joseph Muscat, the former Maltese prime minister, has said he had no knowledge of any business dealings by Mizzi and Schembri.

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares fell 3% Monday as traders chose to be cautious on the stock after Elon Musk’s Saturday tweet indicated continuing challenges for the electric vehicle maker.
Replying to a Twitter user’s query on Tesla’s Semi program, which develops the automaker’s electric semi-trucks, the maverick founder said, “We are too cell-constrained right now, but probably ok next year”.


Tesla shares are off by a third from their lifetime high, reached less than four months ago. Last week, Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment pegged the stock’s price to be $3,000 by 2025.
In a bear and bull case scenario, Ark sees Tesla at $1,400 and $4,000 per share, respectively.
From the U.K. limiting subsidies on EVs to China banning its cars from its military complexes, the list of challenges for Tesla has been getting long longer. The company also faces growing competition from the likes of Germany’s Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Japan’s Honda and China’s Geely."

Investing.com --  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter rallied Monday after getting kudos from analysts.
Facebook got a price target increase to a Street-high $385 from $355 at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), where analyst Lloyd Walmsley maintained a buy rating on the stock. Meanwhile,  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) was upgraded to buy from hold at Truist Securities, with a price target raised to $74 from $64, according to StreetInsider. While both companies are slightly higher for the year, tech has struggled as more people get vaccinated and life after lockdown starts to make a comeback, pushing investors into cyclical companies rather than pandemic darlings. 
Facebook rose 1.3%, while Twitter was up 2.5%. 
Deutsche Bank's Walmsley bumped its revenue estimates higher for Facebook on positive feedback from advertisers, and recent positive commentary from Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, with more ecommerce shifting to the platform.
""We would add to positions as we see a catalyst path that also includes benefits from the largest round of stimulus checks to date, more tests of non-skippable Stories ads, and the potential for FB to start monetizing Reels,"" Walmsley wrote in a note. 
Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali said ""tangible"" progress on its product and tech platform will drive greater traction with users and advertisers. Squali sees higher revenue growth, an ""exciting"" roadmap with platform and operational improvements and growth in monetizable daily average users. 
Twitter is also trading at an attractive valuation, Squali said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed in narrow ranges on Monday, amid concern about further volatility stemming from the unwinding of trades reportedly held by Archegos Capital Management, the family office of former hedge fund manager and convicted insider trader Bill Hwang.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 27 points, or 0.1%, at 33,100, holding above the 33,000 level that it breached for the first time on Friday. The index was supported by heavyweight Boeing (NYSE:BA), which rose 2.8% after a large order for its 737 MAX planes from Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV). 
However, the S&P 500 was down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3%, amid fears that some of Archegos' trades still need to be unwound.  The stocks of the two banks that led the selling on Friday,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), were both underperforming, down 4.1% and 1.6% respectively, both at their lowest in a month.
Overnight,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) had warned of a ""substantial"" hit to its earnings from losses related to its prime brokerage relationship with Archegos, and had also noted that ""other banks are still exiting"" positions tied to its client. That raised some doubt as to how much further any of the stocks affected in Friday's rout may still have to fall. 
Many of the most prominent losers in early trading were part of Hwang's portfolio: GSX Techedu  (NYSE:GSX) stock fell 11.7%, while Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) ADRs fell 4.6% and Vipshop stock (NYSE:VIPS) fell 5.1%. ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) stock was also down 4.5%, while Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) stock was down 3.0%. 
On a day when the earnings and the data calendars were largely empty, market participants have had time to concentrate on the implications of Friday's fiasco, when Archegos' lenders liquidated the stock they had taken ownership of after calling in the fund's margin loans. Reports have indicated that Hwang, who pleaded guilty in 2012 to securities fraud charges after insider trading on Chinese bank stocks, had avoided disclosing the extent of his positions in various stocks by holding them through opaque structures such as equity swaps and contracts for differences. 
Arguably the most worrying element of Friday's trading was the level of leverage implicit in the volume and scale of the price drops. Data from FINRA show that margin debt has exploded in the last year, rising from $545 billion in February 2020 to over $813 billion as of last month.
Hwang has not yet commented publicly on the events of last week and could not be reached for comment on Monday.
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock dipped briefly below the optical support level of $600 for the first time in three weeks. The stock had suffered on Friday from a video compilation released on Youtube and other social media that detailed the gap between CEO Elon Musk's promises on delivering autonomous driving and the current state of Tesla's technology. The video included leaked excerpts from Tesla emails to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that confirms the current software package is not likely to progress beyond Level 2 autonomy. "

244,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 29, 2021 09:09AM ET</span>","Cathie Wood’s ETFs Ditch Ownership Caps, Add SPAC Warning","(Bloomberg) -- Cathie Wood has spent months defending Ark Investment Management from critics who say the money manager has too much cash tied up in too few stocks. The firm’s latest move is handing them fresh ammunition.
In a filing late last week, Ark altered the prospectuses for its exchange-traded funds to remove clauses limiting its exposure and concentration risks.
The changes eliminate a 30% cap on how much of each fund’s assets could be invested in the securities of a single entity, and a 20% limit on the amount of a company’s shares an ETF could own.
It also introduced language acknowledging funds may buy into blank-check firms and noting the risks of buying shares in special-purpose acquisition companies that haven’t yet decided what businesses they’ll own. The ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (NYSE:ARKQ) last week bought shares of a SPAC backed by tennis star Serena Williams.
These are eye-catching changes for Ark, founded by Wood in 2014. Concerns have swirled around the New York-based firm in recent months after a stellar year saw ETF assets surge at one point to more than $60 billion. Ark invests in companies involved with disruptive trends, which mean it has a limited pool of targets in which to deploy that money.
“It seems like they’re willing to take on more single-stock risk if they truly believe in a company,” said Mohit Bajaj, director of ETFs for WallachBeth Capital. “It’s truly active management.”
Testing the Limit
In February as its flagship product, the Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK, peaked, the firm controlled 20% or more of at least three companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This was spread across several funds, so didn’t yet test the 20% cap that’s now removed from prospectuses.
In addition to deleting the general limits, the March 26 filing removed caps on ownership of depositary receipts, rights, warrants, preferred securities and convertibles.
A representative for Ark didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The adjustments come on the eve of Ark’s first new ETF launch in two years. The ARK Space Exploration ETF (ARKX) is due to begin trading on Tuesday, according to its Bloomberg page.

(Reuters) -  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) said on Monday it will allow the use of the cryptocurrency USD Coin to settle transactions on its payment network, the latest sign of growing acceptance of digital currencies by the mainstream financial industry.
The company told Reuters it had launched the pilot program with payment and crypto platform Crypto.com and plans to offer the option to more partners later this year.
Bitcoin, the most popular crypto coin, jumped to a one-week high on the news, rising as much as 4.5% to $58,300 and heading back toward a record-high above $61,000 hit earlier this month.
Visa subsequently confirmed the news in a statement.
The USD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin cryptocurrency whose value is pegged directly to the U.S. dollar.
Visa's move comes as finance firms including BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK), BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) take steps to make more use of cryptocurrencies for investment and payment purposes.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc boss Elon Musk, a major proponent of cryptocurrencies, said last week that customers can buy its electric vehicles with bitcoin, hoping to encourage more day-to- day use of the digital currency.
""We see increasing demand from consumers across the world to be able to access, hold and use digital currencies and we're seeing demand from our clients to be able to build products that provide that access for consumers,"" Cuy Sheffield, head of crypto at Visa, said.
Traditionally, if a customer chooses to use a Crypto.com Visa card to pay for a coffee, the digital currency held in a cryptocurrency wallet needs to be converted into traditional money.
The cryptocurrency wallet will deposit traditional fiat currency in a bank account, to be wired to Visa at the end of the day to settle any transactions, adding cost and complexity for businesses.
Visa's latest step, which will use the ethereum blockchain, strips out the need to convert digital coin into traditional money in order for the transaction to be settled.

Visa said it has partnered with digital asset bank Anchorage and completed the first transaction this month — with Crypto.com sending USDC to Visa's Ethereum address at Anchorage.

Investing.com – Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares were up nearly 3% in Monday’s premarket as a fresh order from Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) for 100 of its 737 MAX 7 planes bolstered hopes that the troubled model still has a future.
The airline also converted 70 MAX 8 firm orders to the MAX 7 and added options for another 155 MAX 7 or MAX 8 aircraft for the years 2022 through 2029.
Two accidents during 2018-2019 forced regulators to ground the 737 MAX, which was at the time Boeing's biggest moneyspinner, in a booming market for narrow body planes.
The plane was still grounded when Boeing had to contend with the pandemic too, leading air travel to collapse in 2020.
The new year has brought some relief to the manufacturer as it booked a United Airlines order for 25 737 MAX aircraft in February. On March 12.  the company said it had got an order from private investment firm 777 Partners for 24 of the airplanes,  potentially rising by another 60."

Production at the plant, where the world's fourth largest automaker makes Jeep Renegade and Compass models and the Fiat 500X compact SUV, has been repeatedly disrupted due to weak demand and semiconductor supply shortages.
The FIM CISL union said last week the firm was considering permanently closing one of its two production lines at the Melfi plant to address excess capacity in Italy.
European car registrations fell 23% year on year in the first two months of this year, according to industry data, as protracted coronavirus lockdowns and consequent uncertainty keep impacting spending decisions among families and businesses.
UILM's Gianluca Ficco said on Monday the company told unions the latest Melfi production freeze was specifically due to low demand and not a result of the global chip shortage.
A spokesman for Stellantis confirmed the plant would be closed in that April 2-12 period. 

All of Melfi's more than 7,000 workers would be put on a furlough scheme for the period.

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks and other financial firms in Britain must set out by March 2022 how quickly critical parts of their business could recover from IT glitches and other disruptions and how to minimise the impact, the Bank of England said on Monday.
The BoE's Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Regulation Authority (PRA), in conjunction with the Financial Conduct Authority, set out rules on operational resilience after glitches at TSB in 2019 and at other banks left millions of customers locked out of their online accounts and facing delayed payments.
Each regulated firm must draw up plans that set out where disruption could hit customers and broader financial stability, and how long it would take to resume normal service.
Each firm will decide the time it would take for a specific part of its business to recover and the time allowed should reflect its importance to customers and overall stability.
""The speed at which vulnerabilities are remediated should be commensurate with the potential impact that a disruption would cause, and will be an area of supervisory focus,"" the BoE said.
Firms are not expected to have fully fleshed out and tested plans by March 2022, but are required to show by March 2025 that they can recover within the ""impact tolerances"" that have been set.
""The PRA expects firms to update their mapping annually at a minimum, or following significant change if sooner,"" the BoE said. 

A senior manager in each firm will be directly responsible for operational resilience plans, with boards required to approve the tolerances that have been set.

The British company has been hit harder than most by the pandemic, with much of its income disappearing when airlines stopped flying, leaving it to post a record $5.6 billion underlying loss in 2020. 
Rolls believes a new engine will be needed by aircraft manufacturers, even if the date when either Airbus or Boeing (NYSE:BA) develop a new jet has been pushed further into the future by the coronavirus crisis.
It hopes the UltraFan, which it describes as the world's largest aero-engine, could deliver a 25% fuel efficiency improvement compared with the first generation of its Trent engine.
It could be the basis for a new family of engines which power both narrowbody and widebody aircraft, and it expects the first test run of the engine to be conducted on 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel, Rolls said.
The company's current engines power widebody jets and not the single aisle jets which sell at higher volumes and are likely to recover from the pandemic more quickly. 
""It is arriving at a time when the world is seeking ever more sustainable ways to travel in a post-COVID 19 world,"" said Chris Cholerton, president of its civil aerospace arm. 
Some analysts have speculated that UltraFan, a geared gas turbine, could be overtaken by new low-carbon technologies. 
But Rolls said gas turbines would be the bedrock of long-haul aviation for many years, and UltraFan's efficiency would help the transition to more sustainable fuels which could be more expensive in the short term than traditional jet fuel. 

The engine's development has been supported by funding from institutions in Britain, Germany and the European Union.

The shares rose to premarket highs, trading nearly flat from Friday after falling as much as 3.4% earlier Monday.
About 45 million shares were offered Sunday on behalf of an undisclosed holder, people familiar with the matter previously told Bloomberg. The most recent block trade known to Bloomberg had offered shares at $46 to $47 each through  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), one of the people said on Sunday. The offering price represents a 2.6% discount to Friday’s closing price.
A Morgan Stanley representative declined to comment on Sunday.
The stock offering represents about 7.7% of the company’s total shares outstanding as of March 24, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stake is worth roughly $2.2 billion based on Friday’s closing price.
The U.S. media giant was also the subject of at least one large block trade on Friday through Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg at the time.
The highly unusual Sunday offer may contribute to further volatility in ViacomCBS, which fell the most on-record Friday. The company’s shares were part of a $20 billion spree of block trades that also included stocks like Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc., Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) Ltd., iQiyi Inc. and GSX Techedu (NYSE:GSX) Inc., according to an email to Goldman clients seen by Bloomberg News.
The drop in ViacomCBS shares also came alongside a series of analyst downgrades that cited the stocks massive runup before this week. Shares had climbed 169% this year through March 22.
The bevy of stock offerings came after the family office of former Tiger Management trader Bill Hwang was forced by its banks to liquidate the positions after some positions moved against him.
 Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc.’s warning of a “significant” potential loss from an unnamed U.S. client is related to the unwinding of trades by Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management, according to people familiar with the matter. The family office founded by Hwang was one of Nomura’s prime brokerage clients, one of the people said, without providing further details.

Investing.com – Bank shares were trading weaker Monday as market makers tried to absorb the impact on the sector arising out of their exposure to a struggling hedge fund. 
The hedge fund has been identified in various reports as Archegos Capital Management, a family office run by Bill Hwang, a veteran of Tiger Management.
Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) said a significant US-based hedge fund defaulted on margin calls it, along with other banks, made last week. Friday’s session saw forced liquidation of more than $20 billion in holdings linked to Archegos.
“While at this time it is premature to quantify the exact size of the loss resulting from this exit, it could be highly significant and material to our first quarter results, notwithstanding the positive trends announced in our trading statement earlier this month,” Credit Suisse said. 
Nomura (NYSE:NMR) said it was owed about $2 billion by an unnamed U.S. client.
“This estimate is subject to change depending on unwinding of the transactions and fluctuations in market prices,” the Japanese bank said in a note.
Nomura and Credit Suisse ADRs were trading 14% and 11% lower after the revelations but the market fears more names will also come up, given that Credit Suisse said that “other banks are in the process of exiting these positions”.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was down 3% while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) was 4% lower. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) was doing a shade better but was still down 1.5%.
According to Bloomberg, much of the leverage used by Archegos was provided by banks including Nomura and Credit Suisse through swaps or so-called contracts-for-difference. It means Archegos may never actually have owned most of the underlying securities -- if any at all.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Monday, retreating from Friday’s record highs as investors fret about the potential fallout from U.S. hedge fund Archegos Capital defaulting on margin calls.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 115 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 11 points, or 0.3%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 5 points, or 0.1%.
All three major benchmarks closed higher in volatile trading Friday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closing about 450 points, or 1.4%, higher at a record high. The broad S&P 500 climbed 1.7% to also hit a record close, and the Nasdaq Composite ended Friday 1.2% higher.
However, these gains hid some sharp selling in companies linked to Archegos, with the likes of Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) and ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) both tumbling over 25% on Friday. 
Continuing the theme, Nomura (T:8604) said early Monday it faced a possible $2 billion loss due to transactions with a U.S. client, while  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) warned of a “highly significant” hit to results due to its exposure to a single client.
Fears that the impact will not be confined to these two banks are putting markets on edge about the scale of the possible fallout. The stocks of both Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are both down premarket.
However, losses are currently seen limited with investors overall buoyed by expectations of strong U.S. economic growth given hefty amounts of fiscal and monetary stimuli as well as a successful vaccination program.
President Joe Biden is expected to add to this stimulus when he unveils his infrastructure plan later this week, which could cost more than $3 trillion. Although there are doubts the whole package will get through Congress, the U.S. economy is still likely to get another hefty injection of cash.
The first quarter winds down this week, and this could prompt more volatility trading, particularly as it’s a holiday-shortened week. The March jobs report is still slated for release on Good Friday, with investors looking for another strong report, particularly as jobless claims fell to a one-year low last week.
Oil prices pushed higher Monday as traders turned their attention away from the disruption of traffic through the Suez Canal and towards the week’s upcoming meeting of the globe’s main producers.
The latest talk ahead of the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, suggests that Russia supports the group rolling over its current oil output into May, with only a small rise for itself.
Back in the canal, the container ship has been partially refloated, raising the possibility that it may be freed in the near future, thus unblocking the key waterway.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% lower at $61.62 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.2% to $65.23. Both benchmarks are still set to post a fourth consecutive quarterly gain this week.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,726.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1765.

257,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2021 06:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive: J&J CEO pay irks investors upset with opioid lawsuits fallout,"By Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is coming under fire from some investors who are raising questions about companies that give their chief executives hefty pay raises despite facing billions of dollars in legal costs over their role in the U.S. opioid crisis.
J&J has always excluded certain one-time costs such as litigation expenses from its calculation of stock payouts to executives, an approach that compensation consultants say is common across corporate America. 
It is attracting investor scrutiny now because it partially shields J&J chief executive Alex Gorsky from some $9 billion in costs over two years that have arisen from lawsuits claiming the healthcare company fueled the opioid crisis and allegations of asbestos in its talc baby powder.
Gorsky's compensation totaled $29.6 million in 2020, up 17% from the previous year. That increase faces a shareholder vote at J&J's annual general meeting on April 22, with some investors expressing displeasure, threatening to overshadow the company's role in producing a vaccine for the coronavirus and the 30% share price rise over the past year.
Such pressure has led to at least one other company involved in the opioid lawsuit settlement discussions to reconsider its position. Drug distributor  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) has said it will engage with shareholders to incorporate their views in its executive compensation plan after a minority of them revolted in November against a similar executive pay structure. A Cardinal Health spokesman did not respond to questions for details on any potential compensation changes.
Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs, who manages the state's $38 billion investment portfolio that includes J&J shares, said the healthcare company's ""significant accomplishment"" in producing a COVID-19 vaccine did not give it license to insulate executives from ""costs and failures that happened under their watch.""
""Those foul-ups also need to be factored into the assessment,"" he said, referring to executive pay. He declined to say how the Illinois fund would vote. Michael Pryce-Jones, senior corporate governance analyst at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, estimates Gorsky was paid an additional $4.4 million over the last two years as a result of the compensation structure. The Teamsters, a labor union, has affiliated funds with investments in J&J. 
A J&J spokeswoman declined to comment on Pryce-Jones' estimate or provide the company's figures on the impact of the litigation on Gorsky's pay. Gorsky did not respond to a request for comment. 
The J&J spokeswoman said that it was the healthcare company's ""longstanding and publicly disclosed practice"" not to include certain non-recurring gains and expenses, such as litigation-related items, in the targets and results of its executives. Litigation items are included in the company's total shareholder return and free cash flow, which determine other aspects of executive pay, she added. 
Some governance experts stressed that J&J's approach of compensating its chief executive without penalizing him for significant corporate liability exposure did not mean that shareholders would be worse off, given the management team's other achievements such as the COVID-19 vaccine. 
""A company of this size, facing a settlement of this magnitude, will manage (the cost of it) in such a way that there will not be an impact on investors,"" said Ric Marshall, executive director in the environmental, social and governance (ESG) research team of MSCI Inc, the world's largest financial index provider. 
The Investors for Opioid & Pharmaceutical Accountability (IOPA), an advocacy group representing about 60 investors with a total of $4.2 trillion in assets under management, wrote to J&J's board in January asking them to review their pay practices in light of the opioid litigation and agreed-to settlements, said Donna Meyer, director of shareholder advocacy at Mercy Investment Services Inc, which co-leads IOPA. J&J acknowledged the letter but made no commitments, Meyer said. 
J&J did not respond to questions from Reuters about the IOPA letter. 
At Cardinal Health and Amerisourcebergen Corp, another drug distributor, 39% and 48%, respectively, of their shareholder votes were cast against their executive pay because investors felt executives were not adequately held accountable for the fallout from opioid lawsuits. 
Shareholder votes on pay typically pass with overwhelming majority, according to data compiled by proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services Inc, making those levels of dissension a major expression of investor unhappiness. BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, was among the shareholders that voted against Amerisourcebergen and Cardinal Health, a spokesman confirmed.
Mercy Investment Services' Meyer declined to comment on how her firm or other IOPA members would vote on J&J's executive pay. ""We will also look at how the incentive pay was decided on and how it rings true with the penalties they had to pay,"" Meyer said.
NOT BINDING, BUT IMPORTANT
Shareholder pay resolutions are not binding, but a significant number of 'no votes' can force management to reconsider executive pay. 
Significant shareholder dissent on pay proposals can also affect companies' ESG scores, said Kasey Vosburg, associate director of ESG research at corporate governance firm Sustainalytics. The scores, which assess a company's societal and environmental impact, as well as its approach to issues such as diversity and pay equity, have gained importance among big Wall Street funds and other investors in recent years.
It is unclear what Amerisourcebergen plans to do after its vote, which was held earlier this month. An Amerisourcebergen spokeswoman said that the company values feedback from investors. She added that executives should be rewarded when they deliver targeted financial results.
Gorsky, who became CEO in 2012, has been at the helm of J&J during the opioid abuse and addiction crisis, which according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has claimed nearly 450,000 lives in the United States between 1999 and 2018. In 2019, 50,000 people died in the U.S. from opioid related overdoses, according to the National Institute of Health.
J&J, along with other drugmakers and distributors, is a defendant in thousands of lawsuits that allege it deceptively marketed its opioid products, fueling the epidemic. 
Separately, J&J also set aside nearly $4 billion in reserves for some 25,000 lawsuits alleging that asbestos-laced talc in its products caused cancer, and that it did not disclose the contamination to investors. https://reut.rs/3w9jrKY
J&J has denied any wrongdoing related to opioids, and has separately said that decades of independent scientific studies support the safety of its baby powder. 
In calculating a portion of the stock awards given to Gorsky and other top executives in 2020, J&J used ""adjusted"" earnings from operations that excluded these litigation costs, the regulatory filings show. 

Ronald Williams (NYSE:WMB), the chairman of the J&J board committee that oversees compensation and benefits, declined to answer questions about the company's executive pay policy.

LONDON (Reuters) - Food delivery group Deliveroo has narrowed the price range on its initial public offering, ensuring its order books were fully covered for what will be London's biggest IPO in a decade.
The London-based company, founded by boss William Shu in 2013, could be valued at up to 7.85 billion pounds ($10.85 billion) in its stock market debut on March 31.
The listing is set to be London's biggest IPO since Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) in May 2011 and also the biggest tech float on the London Stock Exchange, dwarfing The Hut Group last year.
Deliveroo narrowed its price range on Monday to between 3.90 and 4.10 pounds per share, indicating a valuation of between 7.6 billion pounds and 7.85 billion pounds, excluding shares offered as part of an over-allotment issue.
The company opted against pricing the deal at the top of an original price range of between 3.90 and 4.60 pounds - which would have given it a market value of up to 8.8 billion pounds - citing market volatility.
Banks working on the deal said on Monday that order books were covered throughout the price range, showing demand would ""exceed the full deal size.""
""Deliveroo has received very significant demand from institutions across the globe. The deal is covered multiple times throughout the range, led by three highly respected anchor investors,"" a company spokesperson confirmed.
""Given volatile global market conditions for IPOs, Deliveroo is choosing to price responsibly within the initial range and at an entry point that maximises long-term value for our new institutional and retail investors.""
A source familiar with the listing said the company had to take into account the performance of some recent IPO deals, such as U.S. cloud computing firm DigitalOcean and British online reviews platform Trustpilot, which were both trading below their IPO price. 
""By narrowing its target range, Deliveroo is trying to make sure it doesn't hit a bump in the road as it begins its journey on the stock market,"" said  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV)'s senior investment and markets analyst, Susannah Streeter.
Deliveroo has benefited from lockdown demand for takeaway food during the COVID-19 crisis when restaurants across Europe were forced to shut down.
Its revenues have soared and its so-called gross transaction value - a measure of the total value of orders received - jumped 64.3% in 2020 to 4.1 billion pounds. 
'MANAGING EXPECTATIONS'
Deliveroo's order book has so far attracted strong interest from U.S. investors which are familiar with the dual-class share structures and the dynamics of tech listings, the source close to the IPO said.
Yet, some British institutional investors are not comfortable with the company's decision not to pursue a premium listing. This will allow its CEO Shu to retain enhanced shareholder rights but means the company will not join the FTSE indices.
UK fund manager Legal & General Investment Management said last week it was unlikely to participate in the IPO.
""It may be blaming volatile market conditions for the move, but the rejection of the IPO by a slew of institutional investors is likely to also have caused some concern at the delivery company,"" Hargreaves Lansdown's Streeter said.
""It's likely initial orders for the IPO have come in nearer the bottom of the target range, and by setting its sights nearer those prices, it is managing expectations on its ride to listed status,"" she added.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are acting as joint global coordinators on the deal while Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) and Numis are the joint bookrunners.

The affected Ulsan factory produces 311,000 vehicles annually including the Kona Electric and Ioniq 5. 
""No decision has been made on the reported temporary suspension of the facility,"" Hyundai said in a statement to Reuters. 
The Korea Economic Daily said the production at Hyundai's Ulsan No.1 plant is being suspended due to supply issues regarding chips and power electric modules. 
Underscoring the severity of the chip shortage crisis, Hyundai, until recently one of the automakers least affected due to prudent stockpiling, has become the latest automaker to halt manufacturing due to the chip shortage. 
Hyundai had been able to avoid a hit from the shortage so far largely because it maintained a stockpile of chips unlike its global peers, Reuters reported last month.
Last week, Honda Motor Co Ltd and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) both announced that they would continue production suspension at plants in North America for the coming weeks, citing the chip shortage as one of several reasons.
A confluence of factors including factory shutdowns, booming demand for laptops and tablets, and sanctions against Chinese tech companies caused a global shortage of chips to rattle the electronics sector in December.

Originally concentrated in the auto industry, the shortage has widened to affect a range of consumer electronics, including smartphones.

260,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2021 06:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Grindr's U.S. security review disclosures contradicted statements made to others,"By Echo Wang
NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Grindr Inc's Chinese owner sold the popular dating app to an investor consortium last year to comply with a U.S. national security panel order, the parties to the deal gave information to authorities that contradicted disclosures to potential investors and Chinese regulators, Reuters has learned.
They told the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) that James Lu, a Chinese-American businessman who is now Grindr’s chairman, had no previous business relationship with a key adviser to the seller, a man named Ding'an Fei, according to a Reuters review of the parties’ written submissions to CFIUS.
Fei, a former private equity executive, was acting as an adviser to Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd, Grindr's owner at the time, on the deal, the documents show. 
""The investors and Ding'an Fei have at no time conducted business together in their personal capacities prior to the proposed transaction,"" Kunlun and the investor group, called San Vicente Holdings LLC, wrote to CFIUS in a response dated March 27, 2020. 
However, when Lu was raising funds to buy Grindr in the second half of 2019 and early 2020, potential investors were told by firms helping him raise the money that Fei was involved in the effort with him in various capacities, a review of four different fundraising documents shows.
The duo had also done business together in other ventures: Fei was a member of the board of a Chinese restaurant operator in which Lu served as chief executive officer, according to that restaurant company's 2018-2019 annual report. 
The discrepancies and omissions in the parties’ response to U.S. authorities, reported by Reuters for the first time, could prompt a new review from CFIUS, according to six former U.S. officials and lawyers familiar with the panel's rules. If CFIUS were to find the statements were not true, it can also lead to civil penalties and criminal charges under the false statement provisions of the U.S. penal code, they said.
""If a transaction was approved based on misrepresentations, that could well invalidate the approval of the transaction,"" said Brent McIntosh, who served as the Treasury Under Secretary responsible for CFIUS when the Grindr deal was cleared. McIntosh declined to comment on the specifics of Reuters’ findings.
San Vicente spokesman Taylor Ingraham said that ""a complete and accurate account of James Lu's relationship with Ding'an Fei, as well as his investments and business activities in China, was provided to CFIUS prior to the agency's approval of San Vicente Holdings' acquisition of Grindr."" 
Ingraham declined to make Lu, who owns a 17% stake in the buyer's group, available for an interview. Lu, Fei, Kunlun and Grindr did not respond to emailed requests for comment. 
CFIUS and the U.S. Treasury Department, which chairs CFIUS, did not respond to requests for comment. 
CHINA DEALINGS
The documents reviewed by Reuters include a resume for Lu that was put together by the parties in support of the CFIUS application. While the resume lists positions going back to 2002, it does not mention some of his business dealings in China. In particular, Chinese regulatory filings show Lu is chairman of a Chinese investment firm, where a local government is the majority shareholder.
Scott Flicker, a regulatory partner at law firm Paul Hastings LLP who was not involved in the Grindr case and reviewed Reuters' findings, said CFIUS would want to know about Lu's business dealings in China when assessing whether his past could be used by Beijing to compromise him. 
""It is potentially relevant information for the CFIUS review. The integrity of the acquiring party is relevant to the question of threat of exploitation,"" Flicker said. 
However, some lawyers played down the possibility that CFIUS would reopen its review. They noted that there is no publicly known precedent of the panel ever having done so. Were CFIUS to identify misstatements in a review, it would likely take action only if they significantly raised the risk of a transaction harming national security, said Alexis Early, a regulatory partner at law firm King & Spalding LLP who was not involved in the Grindr deal.
Reuters could not determine whether San Vicente and Kunlun disclosed those activities to CFIUS subsequently. 
Reuters first reported about the ties between Lu and Fei in June of last year, after CFIUS had already approved the sale of Grindr to San Vicente for $620 million. Reuters could not determine whether CFIUS had taken any action following that Reuters report.
Since then, Reuters has reviewed three sets of confidential written questions that CFIUS sent to the parties, their responses to them and several supporting documents. Reuters could not determine whether CFIUS knew of the specific discrepancies reported in this article when it approved the deal last year. 
Ingraham did not comment on whether there were any additional communications with CFIUS beyond the set of questions and answers seen by Reuters.
GRINDR SALE
Based in West Hollywood, California, Grindr is especially popular among gay men and has millions of users. CFIUS ordered Kunlun, a Chinese mobile gaming company, in May 2019 to sell Grindr, giving it about a year to complete the deal. The move was among a series of actions the United States took in recent years against Chinese companies. 
Reuters previously reported that Kunlun was ordered to divest Grindr because U.S. authorities worried personal information about Americans could fall into Beijing’s hands. https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1R809L
Lu started raising money from outside investors for the Grindr acquisition in the months after the CFIUS order, according to the fundraising documents and the responses to CFIUS. Lu first sought money for the acquisition through a fund called Duo Capital, and later an entity called TGL Capital. 
In the fundraising documents, Fei is named as associated with the funds in various ways, including as a contact person for Duo Capital, a member of the external advisory team of Duo Capital and as a co-leader of TGL Capital. Reuters could not learn more about his role or independently verify the information.
The ties between Fei and Lu came to CFIUS' attention during the review. In the third set of questions, CFIUS asked, ""Is Mr. Ding An Fei of TGL Capital (formerly known as Duo Capital) the same Dingan Fei"" who is listed as ""an individual who should receive notices on behalf of Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd?""
In their March 27, 2020 response, the parties denied any ties. ""Neither Ding'an Fei nor anyone else employed by or representing Kunlun has ever held a position with TGL Capital, Duo Capital, or San Vicente,"" they wrote. 
Lu did not respond to questions about Duo and TGL.
San Vicente and Kunlun also told CFIUS in their March 27, 2020 response to questions about the relationship between Fei and the San Vicente investors that Lu knew Fei ""because they have each held positions in the investment community working on Asia-U.S. transactions.""
However, Fei sat on the board of restaurant operator Life Concepts Holding, in which Lu served as CEO, according to the company's annual report. Fei stood down from Life Concepts' board in April 2020, amid the CFIUS review, without disclosing a reason, according to a Life Concepts filing with the Hong Kong stock exchange. 

Life Concept, based in Hong Kong, did not respond to a request for comment.

261,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 29, 2021 05:54AM ET</span>","Archegos-Linked Stocks, Goldman Weighed Down by Big Block Trades","(Bloomberg) -- The stocks roiled by a series of huge block trades on Friday remained under pressure at the start of a new week as investors mulled whether there may be more to come following a massive $20 billion selling spree.
ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc. fell 1.3% in premarket trading and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc. edged up 2.2%, while the American depositary receipts of Chinese companies Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). and  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (NYSE:TME) remained within 2% of Friday’s closing levels after the forced liquidation of positions linked to Bill Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management. Those trades wiped out about $35 billion in market value on Friday. Baidu fell 5% in Hong Kong.
The block trades initiated by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were triggered after Archegos failed to meet margin calls, leaving  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG facing potentially “significant” losses and sending their shares plunging. The possibility of additional trades still looms over the market, while the traditional end-of-quarter volatility may contribute to sharper swings on previously high-flying stocks.
“Nobody has the transparency this is over, so buying in volume would be exposing to a potential ‘death event,’” said John Roe, head of multi-asset funds at Legal & General Investment Management. “Which is why I’d have thought additions will likely be gradual, looking for signs of stability first.”
After plunging 50% last week, including a 27% drop on Friday, ViacomCBS started to find some support among analysts, even as Morgan Stanley was said to be shopping a large block of shares. Both Loop Capital Markets and BMO Capital Markets upgraded their recommendations.
Tencent Music announced a $1 billion share buyback Monday, after the New York-listed firm’s stock slumped 34% last week.
Nomura and Credit Suisse both plunged more than 14% on Monday. Goldman dropped 3.3% in premarket trading, even after the investment bank was said to have told shareholders and clients that any losses it faces from the unwinding of trades by Archegos are likely to be immaterial.
Volume Surge
Trading volume exploded last week. More than 607 million Tencent Music shares were traded, up 541% from the prior week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. More than 408 million ViacomCBS shares and about 159 million of Discovery changed hands, more than double the week before. Both ViacomCBS and Discovery fell 27% on Friday, continuing a multi-day selloff.
“While the highs of these names aren’t likely to be seen for a while, they have also probably seen their lows for the near-term and can be traded long versus Friday’s lows,” said Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at BayCrest Partners, referring to stocks such as Tencent Music, Iqiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) Inc. and Vipshop (NYSE:VIPS) Holdings Ltd. that fell at least 30% last week. “The overall volume in these were off the charts and records by a magnitude of three to 10 times.”
Prescient Warnings
Friday’s selloff came as no surprise to some who pointed to the strong surge in some of these stocks leading up to the trades. Warnings from strategists on the ferocious rally are now proving prescient.
ViacomCBS and Discovery had skyrocketed threefold over the past six months before the recent selloff -- making them two of the best performers on the S&P 500 Index. Both stocks posted their steepest declines on record Friday following multiple analyst downgrades and a corporate share sale from Viacom last week. Chinese tech stocks, meanwhile, had soared to record highs last month before tumbling in recent weeks on a combination of rising interest rates and increased regulatory scrutiny in China and the U.S.
“Between a number of unanswered questions about what exactly happened on Friday, a fund blowing up and crazy volumes in names from Viacom to Discovery, it’s likely that we’ll see some volatility on Monday,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) LLC. “Those single-day, 30% selloffs were crazy. I would be shocked if traders just said ‘Let’s move on.’“

The weighting of Shell's energy transition performance on its targeted path to net zero emissions by 2050 would double to 20% of the directors' long-term incentive plan calculation if shareholders vote for the plan at a meeting on May 18.
This places Shell's efforts to curb its planet-warming emissions on an equal footing with financial metrics such as free cash flow generation when it comes to remunerating directors in Shell shares.
The weighting of the energy transition metric to calculate directors' bonuses would increase to 15% from 10% under the changes. 
Shell, which paid its Chief Executive Ben van Beurden no bonus in 2020, also proposed not to raise his salary in 2021.
Shell said its carbon emissions peaked in 2018 at around 1.7 billion tonnes, including greenhouse gases from oil and gas products Shell did not produce itself but sold to its customers. Other oil majors such as BP (NYSE:BP) exclude such emissions from their climate reporting.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed to all-time highs on Monday, helped by optimism of a global economic recovery, although  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) slumped after warning of a “highly significant” hit to results due to its exposure to a single, unnamed client.
At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2%, while the benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 gained 0.2%, climbing to an all-time high. The U.K.’s FTSE index underperformed, falling 0.2%.
Investors are growing confident about a strong global economic rebound from the Covid-19 pandemic, led by the United States, particularly as President Joe Biden prepares to unveil a new infrastructure plan, potentially totaling as much as $3 trillion.
European stocks have lagged their U.S. counterparts in the past six months as new lockdowns in the continent and a relatively slow vaccination program dented the region’s economic outlook.
Despite Monday’s gains, concerns are growing that Europe's biggest economies will have to tighten their restrictions still more, further delaying the region’s economic recovery, after France, for example, posted its highest number for Covid patients in intensive care units this year on Sunday.
French President Emmanuel Macron has defended his decision to introduce partial measures targeting high-infection zones like Paris instead of a third full lockdown, but he did acknowledge that further restrictions would probably be needed.
Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel threatened to invoke federal emergency powers to stop the spread of the disease after the 7-day average case number hit its highest since January. In Poland, the number of new cases hit an all-time record at the weekend, while case numbers continue to rise in Belgium, the Netherlands and Austria. By contrast, Italy's infection curve has flattened, while Czechia's is now in sharp decline after a spike in January and February.
In corporate news, Credit Suisse stock fell over 10% after the Swiss banking giant warned of “highly significant” damage to its first-quarter results as it has taken a knock from a large U.S. hedge fund that defaulted on margin calls last week. Other bank stocks with significant prime brokerage operations were affected, with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) falling 5.6% and UBS (SIX:UBSGE) falling 3.9%.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) stock fell 1.7%.
Earlier Monday Japan’s biggest investment bank Nomura (T:8604) flagged a possible $2 billion loss at a U.S. subsidiary, which the bank said stemmed from transactions with a U.S. client.
 Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) stock slipped 0.5% after the German fashion house became embroiled in the spat between China and the West over accusations of forced labor in Xinjiang.
Oil prices retreated Monday as the container ship stuck in the Suez Canal was partially refloated, raising the possibility that it may be freed in the near future, unblocking the key waterway.
Prices had risen more than 4% on Friday as traders tried to weigh the impact of the blockage of such a key route for global trade, through which  with around 10% of global seaborne oil trade passes.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% lower at $60.07 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1% to $63.80. However, despite these losses, both benchmarks are still set to post a fourth consecutive quarterly gain this week.

269,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2021 03:35AM ET</span>",Alibaba-backed Energy Monster caught in legal dispute ahead of U.S. listing,"By Samuel Shen and Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Energy Monster, China's biggest mobile device power bank startup backed by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and SoftBank, is embroiled in an ownership dispute that could further cloud a Nasdaq flotation already buffeted by new U.S. regulations to delist foreign companies.
Two Shanghai-based venture capitalists are pressing a case through both U.S. and Chinese courts against Energy Monster Chief Executive Guangyuan Cai, claiming he reneged on a deal to give them a joint 3% stake in the business. 
Energy Monster, which rents out power banks, or charging stations, for use by customers in Chinese shopping malls, restaurants, bars and other public places, filed earlier this month for an initial public offering (IPO) on Nasdaq. 
The company has not yet set a date for the anticipated $300 million IPO but a discovery filing by Yiming Feng and Sicheng Yin, partners at Atom Venture Capital, in the United States last week described it as ""imminent"".
Feng and Yin initially filed a lawsuit in China in January, arguing they played a critical role in the conception and development of Energy Monster but Cai reneged on the equity transfer promise, Feng told Reuters.
Seeking to bolster their claims, Feng and Yin last week applied for and won a U.S. court order authorizing them to obtain information ""related to the 3% equity agreement"", from  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets Inc and Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS) LLC, the IPO's underwriters. 
The petition document filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York said the information ""will help (the) petitioners prove their claims in the Chinese litigation.""
""We are very pleased that the Court granted the requested discovery,"" Michael Carlinsky, a managing partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, who represents Feng and Yin, wrote in an e-mailed statement to Reuters.
Energy Monster, Citi and Goldman declined to comment. Cai, who owns 6.6% of Energy Monster, did not respond to a request for comment.
In its March 12 IPO application, Energy Monster said Cai was advised by his China litigation counsel that the plaintiffs' claims ""are baseless and frivolous"", and the CEO is ""contesting the claims vigorously"".
The legal challenge adds to headwinds for Energy Monster's IPO, after the U.S. securities regulator last week adopted measures that would kick foreign companies off American stock exchanges if they do not comply with U.S. auditing standards. Those enhanced powers triggered a sell-off in U.S.-listed Chinese companies. 
Energy Monster's IPO filing cautioned ""there can be no assurance that Mr. Cai will be able to prevail in the lawsuit or that he will be able to settle the lawsuit on terms favorable to him.""
""An adverse ruling could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, capital structure, business and financial condition,"" it said. 
VIE STRUCTURE
The claim against Energy Monster centres on a 3% stake in Shanghai Zhixiang Technology Co Ltd, which is ultimately controlled by Energy Monster's listing vehicle, Cayman Islands-registered Smart Share Global Ltd. 
Chinese technology firms seeking a U.S. listing typically use a variable interest entity (VIE) structure, where an overseas listing vehicle controls onshore operations through contractual agreements, to skirt regulatory hurdles. 
Feng said that if he and Yin secure the 3% stake in Shanghai Zhixiang, they could potentially disrupt the VIE structure.
""If the VIE structure is broken, where is the legality of listing?"" Feng told Reuters.

A unit of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is the largest shareholder in Energy Monster with a 16.5% stake while SoftBank subsidiaries hold 7.7% of the company, according to the IPO filing.

273,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 29, 2021 02:45AM ET</span>","Credit Suisse, Nomura Face Losses as Banks Tally Archegos Damage","(Bloomberg) --  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG said they face potentially “significant” losses as some of the world’s biggest banks tally their exposure to the massive unwinding of leveraged equity bets by Archegos Capital Management.
Lenders to Bill Hwang’s New York-based family office have been racing to contain the fallout after Archegos failed to meet margin calls last week. The forced liquidation of more than $20 billion of positions linked to Archegos has roiled stocks from Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). to ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc. and cast a spotlight on the opaque world of leveraged trading facilitated by some of the biggest names on Wall Street.
Nomura, whose shares tumbled by the most on record Monday, said in a statement that the estimated amount of its claim against an unnamed U.S. client was about $2 billion. That client is Archegos, according to people familiar with the matter.
Credit Suisse said it was in the process of exiting positions after a U.S.-based hedge fund defaulted on margin calls. “While at this time it is premature to quantify the exact size of the loss resulting from this exit, it could be highly significant and material to our first quarter results,” the bank said in an emailed statement, without naming the fund.
Credit Suisse shares were indicated about 7% lower before the official open of trading in Europe. The potential loss is the latest blow to the Swiss bank, already reeling from the Greensill scandal and the write-down on a hedge fund stake and other hits in 2020.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is telling shareholders and clients that any losses it faces from Archegos are likely to be immaterial, a person familiar with the matter said.
The New York-based bank’s loans to Archegos were fully collateralized and Goldman was among the first to begin reducing its exposure, the person said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. The bank has exited most of its Archegos-related positions, the person added. A media representative at Goldman declined to comment.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is also a prime broker to Archegos and was among the banks managing the sale of Archegos positions via block trades on Friday, according to people familiar with the matter. It’s unclear whether the bank faces losses. Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

The central bank last month punished four foreign banks, including  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) for helping grains firms speculate in the deliverable forwards foreign exchange market, as it moved to slow the Taiwan dollar's rise.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorised to speak to journalists, sources told Reuters that Cargill was one of the main grains companies involved. The central bank has not named Cargill in its communications on the matter.
The central bank declined to comment. Cargill did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.
The deal to get roughly $2 billion of funds due to Cargill and one of its fully-owned subsidiaries out of Taiwan came after eight months of negotiations with the central bank, sources said.
The Taiwan dollar is at its highest in more than 23 years against the U.S. dollar as the island's trade-dependent economy booms on global demand for its tech products, fuelled by people working from home amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Taiwan's central bank has been particularly concerned about grain companies engaging in currency speculation through deliverable forwards. 
The central bank has previously said that starting from July 2019, eight grains trading companies ostensibly carrying out routine currency transactions for their business had in fact engaged in currency speculation, and as a result affected the stability of Taiwan's foreign exchange market.

It put the total value of the trades at $11 billion.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening largely lower Monday, weighed by growing concerns the third wave of Covid-19 cases will result in further lockdowns as well as weakness in the banking sector as  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) warns of a “highly significant” hit to results.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.6% lower, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.6%, while the CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1%.
Worries are growing that Europe's biggest economies will have to tighten their restrictions still more, further delaying the region’s economic recovery, after France posted its highest number for Covid patients in   intensive care units this year on Sunday.
French President Emmanuel Macron has defended his decision to introduce partial measures targeting high-infection zones like Paris instead of a third full lockdown, but he did acknowledge that further restrictions would probably be needed.
Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel threatened to invoke federal emergency powers to stop the spread of the disease after the 7-day average case number hit its highest since January. In Poland, the number of new cases hit an all-time record at the weekend, while case numbers continue to rise in Belgium, the Netherlands and Austria. By contrast, Italy's infection curve has flattened, while Czechia's is now in sharp decline after a spike in January and February.
The European Union is trying to speed up a lagging vaccination campaign, marred by shortfalls of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) doses that have caused tension with former EU member Britain.
Elsewhere, the banking sector is likely to be in focus Monday after Credit Suisse warned of “highly significant” damage to its first-quarter results.
The Swiss banking giant said it had taken a knock from a large U.S. hedge fund that defaulted on margin calls last week, and that a number of other banks were also affected.
Earlier Monday Japan’s biggest investment bank Nomura (T:8604) flagged a possible $2 billion loss at a U.S. subsidiary, which the bank said stemmed from transactions with a U.S. client.
Oil prices retreated Monday as the container ship stuck in the Suez Canal was partially refloated, raising the possibility that it may be freed in the near future, thus unblocking the key waterway.
Prices rose more than 4% on Friday as traders tried to weigh the impact of the blockage of such a key route for global trade, with around 10% of global seaborne oil trade passing through the canal.
U.S. crude futures traded 2.3% lower at $59.59 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 2.1% to $63.09. However, despite these losses, both benchmarks are still set to post a fourth consecutive quarterly gain this week.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,728.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1779.

BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China Petroleum (NYSE:SNP) & Chemical Corp, better known as Sinopec (NYSE:SHI), plans to increase capital spending by nearly a quarter and raise refinery throughput by 5.5% this year as oil prices and energy demand recovered as the COVID-19 epidemic subsided.
Sinopec, Asia's largest oil refiner and China's second-largest oil and gas producer, plans to increase capital expenditure to 167.2 billion yuan ($25.55 billion), up from 135.1 billion in 2020.
Sinopec expects to spend 66.8 billion yuan on upstream exploration focusing on shale gas development in southwest China and construction of liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in coastal areas, up from 56.4 billion yuan last year.
""China's economy is recovering and is expected to achieve relatively good growth. Demand for refined oil products is expected to recover strongly and demand for natural gas and petrochemical products will continue to grow,"" the company said in a statement filed to the Shanghai Stocks Exchange on Sunday.
The company on Sunday reported a 42.9% drop in net profit to 32.92 billion yuan last year, the lowest since 2015 and largely in line with analysts' forecast, as the pandemic dented fuel consumption during the months-long lockdowns.
Sinopec plans to raise its crude processing by 5.5% this year to 250 million tonnes, or 5 million barrels per day, more than recouping a 4.7% fall in 2020 as COVID-19 hammered fuel demand.
It also aims to raise its domestic refined fuel sales by nearly 9% this year to bring it on par with its 2019 levels.
In an earnings call on Monday, Sinopec said it booked 28.8 billion yuan worth of provisions for asset impairments, which included 8.5 billion yuan for oil and gas assets due to lower prices last year and another 11.85 billion yuan handed over to a government oil price risk fund.

Investing.com – Nomura Holdings Inc (T:8604) stock tumbled by the most in over a decade on Monday. Japan’s biggest brokerage and investment bank flagged a possible $2 billion loss at a U.S. subsidiary which forced it to press pause on its planned $3.25 billion senior note issuance.
Nomura’s Tokyo shares were down 15.57% to JPY608.5 ($5.55) by 1:09 AM ET (5:09 AM GMT), after dropping to as much as 16% in early Asian trading as investors flooded the bank with sell orders.
The $2 billion loss, stemmed from transactions with a U.S. client, the bank said in a statement. It added that the loss amount, based on estimated market prices as of Mar. 26, could change depending on the unwinding of the transactions and market fluctuations.
Nomura’s woes come in the wake of a series of U.S. block trades totaling $20 billion over the weekend. The trades were linked to former Tiger Management trader Bill Hwang's family office Archegos Capital Management LLC. and caused drops in the stock prices of several companies. As Archegos was a prime Nomura brokerage customer, some investors suggested that the bank’s losses could be related to the trades.
The bank is scrambling to assess the damage of the potential losses on its consolidated earnings for the year ending Mar. 31, which is scheduled for release on Apr. 27. it had expressed confidence in sustaining high earnings just a month ago, after booking a 23% on-year rise in April-December net profit at JPY308.5 billion ($2.81 billion). It also reported its best third quarter in 15 years. The bank’s U.S. business, including investment banking as well as equity and bond trading, drove the recent gains.
""As long as these losses are one-off in nature, 1H FY3/22 should be the timing of recovery, thus the impact on the longer-term outlook is relatively limited,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts said in a note.
Meanwhile, the Japanese government will also monitor the situation carefully, chief cabinet secretary Katsunobu Kato said on Monday, adding that the financial services agency would also share information on the matter with the Bank of Japan."

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp on Monday opened its first commercial hydrogen fuel pump site in the Australian state of Victoria, urging the government to encourage the rollout of more sites to boost the take-up of cleaner cars.
The automaker is bringing in 20 of its Mirai hydrogen fuel cell cars to Australia in April, placing them in fleets to gain feedback on how they run. The site west of Melbourne is also its biggest globally in terms of producing, storing and dispensing hydrogen.
It is the second such fuel station in Australia after ActewAGL last week began selling hydrogen produced by France's Neoen in a trial for 20 Hyundai Nexo sport utility vehicles owned by the Australian Capital Territory government.
Fuel cell vehicles remain a niche segment globally amid concerns about a lack of fuelling stations, resale values and the risk of hydrogen explosions.
Toyota has sold some 10,000 Mirai vehicles, mostly in Japan and the United States.
""Here in Australia, refuelling infrastructure has been the biggest challenge, and still is, to introducing pioneering vehicles like the Mirai. So this is an important step forward to rectifying that,"" said Matthew MacLeod, Toyota Australia's manager of future technologies and mobility.
Australia is seen as a laggard in the global drive to cut carbon emissions from the transport sector, with no targets or subsidies for cleaner vehicles - even for hybrid or battery electric vehicles, in stark contrast to most other rich nations.
The government, however, projects that 26% of new vehicle sales will be electric vehicles in 2030, up from 1% in 2020. 
At the site, Toyota is using rooftop solar to power an electrolyser to split water, producing 80 kilograms a day of hydrogen for the fuel pump. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency provided almost half of the funds for the A$7.4 million ($5.7 million) project.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Nomura Holdings Inc on Monday flagged a possible $2 billion loss at a U.S. subsidiary, prompting Japan's biggest brokerage and investment bank to shelve a hefty bond issuance and sending its stock tumbling by the most in over a decade.
Nomura's stock was greeted by a deluge of sell orders at market open, pushing its price down as much 16% in early trade.
The firm in a statement said the $2 billion hit derived from transactions with a U.S. client. It based the estimate on market prices as of March 26 and said it could change depending on the unwinding of the transactions and market fluctuation.
The announcement came after a series of block trades in the United States on Friday that investors said caused drops in the stock prices of numerous companies. The trades were linked to sales of holdings by Archegos Capital Management, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Nomura's loss was related to Archegos' trades, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter, one of whom said Archegos was a prime brokerage customer of Nomura.
Reuters' calls to Archegos' New York office after hours on Sunday local time went unanswered. Nomura declined to comment on any relationship with Archegos.
CONFIDENCE
Nomura said it is assessing the impact of the potential loss on its consolidated earnings for the year ending March 31 -scheduled for release on April 27 - and would cancel the planned issuance of $3.25 billion in senior notes.
""As long as these losses are one-off in nature, 1H FY3/22 should be the timing of recovery, thus the impact on the longer-term outlook is relatively limited,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts wrote in a research memo.
Just last month, Nomura expressed confidence in sustaining high earnings after booking a 23% on-year rise in April-December net profit at 308.5 billion yen ($2.82 billion), having reported its best third quarter in 15 years on solid global markets and investment banking.
The recent performance has been driven by its U.S. business, which includes investment banking and equity and bond trading.
"" Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) should be able to absorb losses of this size,"" one broker told Reuters, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
""It does raise a question of whether there are losses at other Japanese investment banks that just haven't been revealed yet, but at this point it looks like this problem only affects Nomura. This is not something that will bring down the entire equity market.""

Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato on Monday said the government would monitor the situation carefully and that the Financial Services Agency would share information on the matter with the Bank of Japan.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Top asset managers BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard Group Inc have joined an investor push to limit greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, giving new momentum to the effort despite concerns its goals have some wiggle room.
The two largest U.S. fund firms will now account for roughly half of the $32 trillion of total assets supporting the initiative of groups including the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change in Europe and the United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment.
Signatories to the Net Zero Asset Managers  Initiative, now 73 of them including other new members, commit to press companies in their portfolios to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. That is needed to halt global warming to well below a 2 degrees C increase as called for in the Paris Agreement, which U.S. President Joe Biden recently re-joined.
Net zero refers to a balance between emissions produced and those taken out of the atmosphere through technologies like carbon capture. 
Among other things, asset managers will set interim reduction targets for 2030 and report progress under common standards. Some climate activists say the goals and other private-sector efforts are useful but don't go as far as potential government actions.
Angela Falconer, director of climate finance for the Climate Policy Initiative in London, a non-profit research and advisory group, cited limits in the fund firms' pledges, including that they will take account of emissions from companies' products only ""to the extent possible."" 
""There are a few elements which will need to be defined further,"" said Falconer, though she called the overall effort worthwhile.
Clients are pouring new cash into funds taking account of environmental, social and governance issues. BlackRock has previously called on companies to meet the 2050 net zero goal. Monday's announcement marks a bigger step for Vanguard, which had been less explicit about 2050.

Asked about the change, a spokeswoman for Vanguard referred to a statement by CEO Tim Buckley that it looks forward to establishing ""win-win solutions for long-term shareholder return and the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.""

The trades started dumping Chinese tech and U.S. media conglomerate shares, including those of ViacomCBS Inc (NASDAQ:VIAC) and Discovery Inc Class A (NASDAQ:DISCA), amid margin calls ahead of the weekend.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) reportedly offered the latest batch of ViacomCBS shares on Sunday.
Shares in the two companies could actually recover on Monday, with the market’s fundamentals remaining intact as “the correction was not structural,” Safehouse Global Consumer Fund portfolio manager Sharif Farha told Bloomberg.
Farha expected benign price action as Asian markets opened but added that anticipation for Monday’s U.S. open remains high.
“Traders everywhere know the story and will be glued to their screens,” he added.
Other investors also seemed unworried.
“I don’t necessarily see that we’re going to have a big correction even with these block trades going on in the market... there is not a lot of bad news lurking that’s going to truly cause a major correction at least the next two to three months, therefore your dips are going to be modest,” Pepper International chief executive officer and founder Carol Pepper told Bloomberg.

The Chinese music streaming company may buy back up to $1 billion of its Class A ordinary shares in the form of American depositary shares during a twelve-month period starting March 29, it said in a statement.
Shares in dual-listed Chinese companies including Tencent Music fell sharply last week after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it would kick out foreign firms from U.S. exchanges if they failed to comply with U.S. auditing standards.
The company's shares were further pressured on Friday after a sell off in its stock - and those of several others such as Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) and ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc - by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), according to an email to clients seen by Bloomberg News.
Bloomberg and the Financial Times on Saturday reported that Goldman liquidated more than $10 billion worth of stocks in these companies in block trades.
CNBC reported that the selling pressure was due to liquidation of positions by family office Archegos Capital Management.

U.S.-listed shares of Tencent Music lost more than a third of their value last week.

285,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2021 07:10PM ET</span>","Japan's MUFG, Sumitomo face climate votes at AGMs as activism grows","(Corrects to Sumitomo Corp, not Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group, in first paragraph; removes reference to Japan's biggest banks)
By Aaron Sheldrick
TOKYO (Reuters) - Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group, Japan' biggest bank, and Sumitomo Corp, one of the country's largest trading houses, are being targeted with climate resolutions from activist shareholders at their annual shareholder meetings. 
Shareholders at Mizuho Financial Group, Japan's third-biggest bank, voted on a similar resolution at its annual general meeting (AGM) last year.
While the proposal to align Mizuho's business with the 2015 Paris climate accord was defeated, it was the first listed company in the country to hold such a vote, and support for the resolution, at 35%, showed Japanese attitudes were changing.
Once a rarity and easily rebuffed, shareholder votes on environmental issues have become increasingly common elsewhere and have helped to force corporate and financial change in the United States and Europe.
A shareholder proposal submitted on Friday to Mitsubishi UFJ, which holds its AGM on June 29, called on the bank to outline how it will align investment and financing to Paris goals, according to a copy seen by Reuters.
""The aim of the proposal is to manage the company's exposure to climate change risks, and maintain and increase its corporate value,"" said an explanatory note in the resolution, which is being sponsored by Kiko Network, a Japanese non-government organisation that had also brought the Mizuho resolution, and Rainforest Action Network.
The proposal submitted on Friday to Sumitomo, which holds its AGM this year on June 25, by the group Market Forces called on the company to adopt and disclose a business strategy to align itself with the Paris goal of limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degree Celsius. 
The language of the resolutions is very similar to those used elsewhere by environmentally-conscious investors to push banks out of financing the dirtiest fossil fuel industries, like coal. 
(Graphic: Climate temperature trajectory by region - https://graphics.reuters.com/CLIMATE-CHANGE/AGM/jznpnmjxyvl/chart.png)
Policymakers and regulators are also pressuring banks to do more to accelerate the move to a low-carbon economy.
Already this year 79 climate-related resolutions have been filed by shareholders in the United States, compared with 72 for all of last year and 67 in 2019, recent data showed.
The resolutions generally push companies across sectors, from oil and transport to food and drink, to detail how they plan to reduce their carbon footprints in coming years, in line with government pledges to cut emissions to net zero by 2050.
Japan, which recently pledged carbon neutrality by 2050, is the only major industrialised economy that is expanding use of coal. 
The Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 led to the shutdown of most of the country's reactors, which once supplied about a third of the electricity in the world's third-biggest economy.

AMP said it and Ares continued to work towards a potential deal, with Ares showing interest in buying the entirety of the private markets businesses, against an initial plan for Ares to buy a 60% stake for A$1.35 billion ($1.03 billion).
Under the earlier plan, AMP would retain 40% of the AMP Capital unit, which deals in infrastructure and real estate investments, with the joint venture between the two companies valued at A$2.25 billion. 
Prior to that, Ares had withdrawn a A$6.36 billion takeover proposal for the whole company, instead continuing talks over AMP Capital - considered its most valuable unit.
The wealth manager has seen its value plunge in recent years after a banking royal commission revealed widespread misconduct by the company, leading to an exodus of clients even as other scandals came to light.
Just last week, a media report said AMP's CEO was resigning, forcing the company to reiterate twice that he had not quit, although it confirmed succession-planning discussions were on, raising questions about its leadership stability.

The FT said Gupta was working on plans to raise new loans against parts of the group outside the UK, adding that he also aimed to generate cash from an expedited sale of goods. 
GFG, a holding company for Gupta's assets, was the biggest recipient of financing from Greensill, a British financing company that filed for insolvency this month.
The British government wrote back to Gupta formally rejecting the request last week due to multiple concerns, the FT reported, citing people familiar with the situation.
GFG and the government did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the report.
The conglomerate had been in talks with administrators of its former financial backer Greensill on a so-called standstill agreement.

Last week, Reuters reported that GFG had secured a loan from Trafigura in 2018 by agreeing a six-year deal to sell aluminium to the commodity trader at a discount to market prices.

MILAN (Reuters) - A consortium led by Italian state lender CDP is working on a sweetened offer for Atlantia's stake in Autostrade per l'Italia in a last-ditch attempt to salvage talks over the fate of the motorway business, three sources said.
CDP, together with co-investors Macquarie and Blackstone (NYSE:BX), have been negotiating with Atlantia on Autostrade since last year to try to end a dispute triggered by the 2018 collapse of a bridge ran by Autostrade per l'Italia. 
The consortium, which was expected to submit a revised offer for Atlantia's 88% stake in Autostrade this weekend, said late on Sunday that work on a final bid was still ongoing. 
Sources familiar with the matter said the new offer, which will likely be finalised by Wednesday, still values all of Autostrade at 9.1 billion euros ($10.73 billion) but makes some concessions. 
The consortium is considering offering Atlantia a lower level of exposure to potential legal claims compared with the offer proposed in February, which called on the group to pick up the first 1.5 billion euros in claims should they materialise, they added.
The investors are also willing to allow Atlantia to keep subsidies Rome is expected to grant Autostrade this year as part of support offered to companies to buffer the impact of the coronavirus.
Macquarie and Blackstone declined to comment. 
Atlantia would get the lion's share of some 400 million euros that would be available to the company under the support scheme by the time the deal closes, which is expected to be in the second half of 2021, two of the sources said.
Atlantia, controlled by the Benetton family through holding Edizione, owns 88% of Autostrade, with the rest held by Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG) and funds DIF, EDF (PA:EDF) Invest and China's Silk Road Fund.
Both Edizione and another key investor, banking foundation CRT, said earlier this week the CDP-led bid appeared to be the best option for the sale of Autostrade.
Atlantia's board is expected to discuss the new offer at a meeting towards the end of this week, one source said.

China's credit rating agencies are urged to improve their credit rating models, strengthen corporate governance and bolster information disclosure, according to rules jointly published by five government agencies including the central bank and the finance ministry.
The rules are also designed to create a better eco-system in which bond issuers don't interfere with credit rating decisions, investors rely on multiple sources of rating, and regulators lower the bar of credit rating required for some type of bond investors, said the People's Bank of China in a statement on its website.
The rules will shift more burden on rating agencies, and ""guide them to see reputation as the basis of their very existence"", according to the statement.
China has stepped up opening its giant bond market to foreign investors. Beijing has also deregulated the country's credit rating market to global players such as S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings and Fitch Ratings.
But bond credit rating in China has long been a source of complaint for investors.
Late last year, China's bond regulator flagged the risk of inflated credit ratings and widespread rating industry shortcomings, after defaults by highly rated state-owned enterprises triggered market panic.
Rules published on Sunday urge rating agencies to boost consistency, accuracy, and timeliness of credit rating, and build a quality inspection system using default ratio at the core.
Rating agencies are also encouraged to install independent directors, and urged to take measures to avoid conflict of interest and strengthen internal control.

Government bodies that jointly published the rules also include the National Development & Reform Commission (NDRC), the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC).

LONDON (Reuters) - A trade union called for Deliveroo's UK riders to strike when the meal delivery service floats on the stock market next month, saying on Sunday the action would highlight dissatisfaction with the company's business model and approach to workers' rights.
Deliveroo, whose turquoise-uniformed couriers delivering chicken kormas and American hot pizzas are a common sight in many British suburbs, is set for Britain’s biggest stock market debut in nearly a decade after setting a share price range that values it at up to $12 billion.
But some investment firms have said they will not participate in the initial public offering (IPO). Insurer  Aviva  (LON:AV) for instance highlighted a lack of rights for riders as an investment risk as the company might be forced to change its business model.
Deliveroo said investor demand had continued to build since its roadshow began on Monday, and said the views of the union which announced the strike, the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB), did not represent the vast majority of riders.
The IWGB previously lost a legal challenge to Deliveroo in 2018. The case sought to secure rights such as the UK minimum wage for riders, but the court ruled riders were self-employed.
""Investing in Deliveroo means associating yourself with the exploitative and unstable business model,"" IWGB President Alex Marshall said in a statement, adding the strike was planned for April 7, to coincide with the IPO.
The rights of people who work in the so-called ""gig economy"" have been an increasing focus in Britain. Ride-hailing app Uber (NYSE:UBER) gave its workers more entitlements earlier this month after losing a Supreme Court case.
Deliveroo said job satisfaction levels among its 50,000 self-employed riders in Britain was at an all-time high, and that the flexibility they had was a big attraction.

""Thousands apply to work with us every week, reflecting the strong demand for our on-demand model,"" a company spokeswoman said.

Last October, Swiss announced 1,000 job cuts through attrition over two years. The company has about 9,000 staff 
""From the 1,000 announced positions, we completed 500 of the job cuts through the end of 2020,"" Dieter Vranckx told the newspaper. ""How many additional positions we will potentially have to cut is something I can answer only in the second quarter. We're in the middle of the analysis.""
Like most of the travel industry, Swiss is expecting less business travel in the future as companies will likely use more video conferencing rather than in-person trips even once the coronavirus crisis subsides. 
Switzerland's 1.5 billion Swiss franc ($1.60 billion) state credit guarantee for the airline is currently sufficient, Vranckx said.
""For now, it's enough,"" he said, adding that planes flying now are profitable and the cargo business has grown in significance. 
Vranckx expects summer business to be at 65% of pre-COVID-19 levels. The airline plans to trial digital test and vaccination passes -- including the so-called IATA Travel Pass and the European Union's Green Pass -- on the Zurich-London route starting in April, but hopes to ensure that even those who are not vaccinated can continue to fly, since many people want to get COVID shots but have yet to get the opportunity.

296,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2021 01:30PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Ex-lobbyist sues Eli Lilly alleging sexual discrimination, harassment","By Marisa Taylor and Dan Levine
(Reuters) - A former top lobbyist for pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly & Co (NYSE:LLY) accused a high-ranking executive and another senior manager of engaging in sexual discrimination, harassment and retaliation against women in its Washington D.C. office, according to a lawsuit filed Friday.
The suit, filed in federal court by in-house lobbyist Sonya Elling, alleges that a Lilly senior vice president, Leigh Ann Pusey, repeatedly demeaned Elling and other women, and eventually forced Elling to resign. Elling’s lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for lost pay and alleged reputational and emotional harm.
Pusey, senior vice president of corporate affairs and communications, was one of Chief Executive Officer Dave Ricks’s first appointments upon taking the role in 2017.
Eli Lilly is the only named defendant in the suit. Pusey did not respond to requests for comment.
A Lilly spokeswoman denied the allegations in the suit. “Lilly is committed to fostering and promoting a culture of diversity and respect, and a work environment free of discrimination, harassment or retaliation of any kind,” the spokeswoman, Kathryn Beiser, said. “We hold all employees accountable to our core values and believe our executives carry an even higher burden in ensuring those values are upheld.”
The lawsuit comes as other allegations of inappropriate or retaliatory actions by Lilly executives against employees at Lilly have surfaced. Last month, Lilly announced that the company’s chief financial officer, Josh Smiley, resigned after Lilly said in a securities filing that he had engaged in “consensual though inappropriate personal communications” with employees. Smiley declined to comment.
Reuters reported earlier this month that a former Lilly human resources manager alleged she had been forced out of her job because she repeatedly raised concerns with executives about manufacturing problems at a New Jersey factory. Lilly told Reuters it has rigorous quality assurance programs in place and welcomes employee feedback.
Elling had worked as an in-house lobbyist for Lilly since 2003, rising to become a senior director in 2005.
Pusey, named to her post in the wake of President Donald Trump’s election, has worked for several Republican leaders and organizations including the Republican National Committee, according to her online Lilly executive bio.
The suit alleges that Elling and other women were subjected to sexist comments by Pusey and another senior manager, including that they were “nasty,” “bitches,” “disruptive” “aggressive,” and “rude.” Pusey regularly mocked Elling’s appearance and that of other women while noticeably treating male employees more favorably, the suit states.
In 2018, according to the suit, another woman lobbyist at Lilly filed an internal complaint against Pusey, alleging that she had created a hostile workplace and made several offensive comments about Elling and others. That lobbyist is not named in the lawsuit.
In May of that year, a Lilly human resources investigator interviewed Elling about the other lobbyist’s complaint, which Elling corroborated, the suit said. Ultimately the investigator found the complaint to have merit, according to the suit.
After that, the lawsuit said, Pusey began to exclude Elling and others who participated in the complaint investigation from briefings of senior leaders. 
In 2019, Pusey hired an executive, Democrat Shawn O’Neail, to directly supervise Elling and other lobbyists, the suit states. O’Neail engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior in the office, including “sexual self-groping,” during meetings with Elling in her office, the lawsuit said. 
The lawsuit alleges that O’Neail had a history of misogynist and racist conduct at pharmaceutical giant Novartis AG, where he had previously worked, and that he once used the N-word to refer to a Black executive at a rival drug company. The company,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), declined to comment.
O’Neail, who was not named as a defendant in the suit, did not respond to requests for comment. Novartis declined to comment.
O’Neail was brought in to “clean house,” the lawsuit said, by terminating Elling and another employee, the lawsuit said. According to the suit, O’Neail falsely accused Elling of making disparaging statements about Lilly to congressional staff. He eventually put Elling on a job performance improvement plan, according to the suit.

On December 1, 2019, Elling sent a resignation email to top executives, saying she was forced into the decision due to Pusey and O’Neail’s discrimination and retaliation against her, the suit said.

297,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2021 12:40PM ET</span>",Online lender SoFi to give IPO access to retail investors,"(This March 26th story corrects to fix typographical and grammatical error in quote in paragraph 6)
By Anirban Sen, Krystal Hu and Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) - Online lending startup Social Finance Inc (SoFi) will allow retail investors to buy into initial public offerings (IPOs) of companies, an investment opportunity traditionally reserved for large Wall Street investors. 
SoFi's Friday announcement comes a day after a Reuters report revealed that online brokerage Robinhood Markets was building a platform to ""democratize"" IPOs, including its own, that would allow users of its trading app to snap up shares alongside big funds. 
Large institutional investors and funds have traditionally been first in line for such stocks, as well as the investment banks that earn big money from arranging such offerings.
SoFi's latest move could expand access to buying IPO shares alongside large investment firms to everyday investors, most of whom are only able to buy stock when the shares start trading. Nineteen IPOs of companies in 2020 had seen their shares' value more than double in their first day of trading. 
In an interview, SoFi Chief Executive Officer Anthony Noto said the new IPO offering was designed to encourage more long-term holders and would penalize investors who focus on short-term profits from opening-day pops. 
""We have a very different customer base, members who are high earners, not well served,"" said Noto. ""It's a client base that is interested in investing, is actively managing a portfolio and focused on financial objectives. Their interest is in line with issuers.""
SoFi said the latest IPO offering, which has been in the works since 2019, will be available to anyone with an investment account with the company and a minimum of $3,000 in the account. 
Noto, who has previously headed the technology media and telecom group at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and has worked on more than 50 IPOs in that role, said SoFi will selectively choose the IPOs it plans to offer to investors on the platform, based on the quality of the companies. 
DEMOCRATIZE IPOs
Currently, retail investors and other amateur traders cannot buy shares of a newly listed company until they start trading. Since shares often trade higher when they debut, big funds that get allocations in an IPO have a massive advantage.
The average first-day trading pop on U.S. listings of businesses in 2020 was 36%, according to data provider Dealogic.
SoFi has already obtained regulatory clearances to operate the new IPO platform, Noto said, adding that the company will act as a ""passive"" underwriter on deals. SoFi pitched the allocation plan to issuers and will work with banks and underwriters on allocating shares.
Like other Wall Street banks and underwriters on deals, SoFi will collect underwriting fees from issuers for allocations. 
""I've talked a lot about leveling the playing field for retail investors, and am proud to say @SoFi is aiming to do that starting today,"" tweeted venture investor Chamath Palihapitiya, whose blank-check firm struck a deal to take SoFi public in January.

Greece, which saw its national output fall by around a quarter during a decade of financial turmoil, emerged from recession in 2017. Its economy contracted by 8.2% in 2020 due to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak but the government expects a 4% rebound this year.
""This money is for investments only. It's not for hirings or recurring expenses,"" Skylakakis said, adding he will present the national recovery plan to the cabinet meeting on Monday before it is submitted to Brussels in early April.
Under last year's EU agreement, the European Commission will be allowed to raise up to 750 billion euros on capital markets and pass on the money to member states worst hit by the pandemic through payments linked to jointly agreed reform and investment plans, partly as grants and partly as loans.
The Commission expects the first tranches of the package to be paid out in the summer.

The expected deal would see Air France give up fewer airport flight slots at its Paris base than initially sought by the European Commission, notably at Orly airport, the newspaper said in a report published late on Friday.
Contacted by Reuters, a spokeswoman for the Commission said it was in contact with the French authorities. ""We cannot prejudge the timing or outcome of these contacts,"" she added.
Air France and France's economy ministry declined to comment.
The Air France-KLM group recorded a 7.1 billion euro ($8.38 billion) net loss for last year.
It received 10.4 billion euros in loans and guarantees from France and the Netherlands and has been negotiating a state-backed recapitalisation, with EU regulators seeking airport slot concessions at Paris-Orly and Amsterdam-Schiphol.
Under a plan submitted to Brussels, France would swap a 4 billion euro shareholder loan granted to Air France-KLM last year for hybrid debt or perpetuities, sources have said.
Air France and its unions had baulked at the EU's demands for slot concessions at Orly.
Slot concessions for KLM had yet to be agreed by the Commission and the Dutch government, Le Monde and fellow French daily Les Echos said.

The Japanese automaker, which builds about a tenth of the 1.5 million car output in Britain, made the decision two years after it announced its intention in 2019 to cease production at its Swindon plant. The plant closer is expected to lead to 3,500 job losses.
Honda, which has been struggling in Europe, has said the closure of the plant was not related to Britain's departure from the European Union but it needed to focus activities in regions where it expects to sell most cars. 
Panattoni said it was making a 700 million pounds ($965 million) investment in its logistics-related development, with the aim of creating new jobs, once Honda completes decommissioning of the plant that builds its Civic hatchbacks, likely next spring, the Financial Times reported earlier.
The latest move followed decisions by electronics firms  Sony  (NYSE:SNE) and Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) to move their headquarters to the EU from Britain, while Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) has shelved a nuclear power project in Britain amid Brexit.

Nip said he had personally requested senior management of China's Fosun Pharma to ship a new batch of the vaccines to Hong Kong if there were safety concerns with the existing ones, the SCMP reported.
The BioNTech vaccine is distributed in Hong Kong and Macau through a partnership with Fosun Pharma. BioNTech partners with  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) in markets outside greater China.
BioNTech said on March 24 it had decided to pause further vaccination with the batch until the investigation is complete as a precautionary measure and that no other batches shipped to other regions are affected by this investigation.

303,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2021 12:30AM ET</span>","Chinese celebs, netizens slam 'two-faced' Hugo Boss over Xinjiang","BEIJING (Reuters) - At least three Chinese celebrities on Saturday dropped German fashion house Hugo Boss, the latest foreign brand caught in a concerted boycott by Chinese consumers over Western accusations of forced labour in Xinjiang.
Among the celebrities who ended their pacts with Hugo Boss was actor-singer Li Yifeng, who said in a statement through his agent on the Twitter-like microblog Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) that he would only cooperate with brands that specifically support and procure cotton from the farwestern Chinese region.
Activists and U.N. rights experts have accused China of using mass detainment, torture, forced labour and sterilisations on Uighurs in Xinjiang. China denies these claims and says its actions in the region are necessary to counter extremism.
Hugo Boss, in a post on its Weibo account on Thursday, said it would ""continue to purchase and support Xinjiang cotton."" But it said on Friday that it was not an authorised post, and had been deleted accordingly.
In an email to Reuters on Friday, company spokeswoman Carolin Westermann said an undated English-language statement on its website stating that ""so far, HUGO BOSS has not procured any goods originating in the Xinjiang region from direct suppliers"" was its official position.
On Saturday, the brand's Weibo account issued a new statement saying it cherished all longstanding relationships with partners in China. 
Hugo Boss China did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment. 
Chinese internet users have accused Hugo Boss for backtracking on its position, saying the brand was being ""two faced"", with some vowing to boycott the brand for good.
""A two-faced person is the most disgusting. I'll boycott you forever,"" said a Weibo user.
The United States on Friday condemned what it called a ""state-led"" social media campaign in China against U.S. and other international companies for deciding not to use cotton from China's Xinjiang region over forced labour concerns. 
The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
New Balance, Under Armour (NYSE:UA), Tommy Hilfiger and Converse, owned by  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), are among companies that have come under fire in China for statements that they would not use cotton produced in the far-western Chinese region due to suspected forced labour.
The United States and other Western countries have imposed sanctions on Chinese officials for human rights abuses in Xinjiang, which the United States has said have amounted to genocide.
""Several companies are starting to cave in to China's threats by removing their forced labour policies from their websites, and even going as far as promoting ""Xinjiang
Cotton"" on their websites, which reports show is tainted with Uighur forced labour,"" the World Uyghur Congress said in a statement. 

""This is the ultimate moral test for these companies: opt for respecting human rights or embolden the genocidal regime of the Chinese Commmunist Party,"" said the largest group representing exiled ethnic Uighurs.

305,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2021 08:20PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Investors look to utilities to weather any market rout,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors looking for ways to protect themselves from a potential market downturn and rising inflation have been warming to utilities, sometimes seen as bond substitutes, as attractive alternatives.
The S&P 500 utilities index has outperformed the broader market this month, rising 9.3% so far compared with a 4.3% gain in the benchmark index and leading gains among sectors for March.
Driving the gains may be a defensive move by investors to position themselves against a potential slide in equities, with worries mounting over higher inflation as seen in the jump in 10-year Treasury yields and over pricey stock valuations, some strategists say.
Utilities tend to do better in a downturn because they pay dividends and offer stability.
""It's a little defensive positioning,"" said Joseph Quinlan, head of CIO market strategy for Merrill and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Private Bank in New York.
""We have some clients who want to be more defensive but want to stay in the market.""
While the economy is expected to rebound sharply this year from the impact of the coronavirus, that optimism may be dampened by next year if unemployment remains elevated and growth slows more than expected.
Some investors say utilities also may be benefiting from hopes that there will be a bigger push toward green energy under the Biden Administration. President Joe Biden is expected to unveil next week a multitrillion-dollar plan to rebuild America's infrastructure that may also tackle climate change.
""If you get any acceleration of the decarbonization rhetoric, that's a positive for utilities,"" said Shane Hurst, managing director and portfolio manager at ClearBridge Investments. 
But whether the recent surge in utilities has further room to run is a matter of debate, and many strategists and investors, including Quinlan, still favor cyclicals that benefit from economic growth over defensive-leaning groups such as utilities.
The gains in utilities have come amid a rotation from technology and other growth stocks into so-called value stocks. The Nasdaq Composite has fallen in March after four straight months of gains. (Graphic: S&P 500, sectors performance for March, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/WEEKAHEAD/jbypradnrve/chart.png) 
Cyclicals, which investors dumped during the early part of the pandemic, have benefited the most from the rotation. An end-of-quarter rebalancing of investment portfolios by institutional investors may be adding to the recent rotation from growth into value. 
While utilities still sharply lag gains for the year compared with many cyclical sectors, including energy, they are also considered inexpensive at this point by some investors.
After a weak performance in 2020, utilities ""are just really, really cheap at the moment,"" Hurst said. ""And that is an attractive place to be when you're in a market that's very much earnings driven.""
The utilities sector is trading at 18.3 times forward earnings compared with a price-to-earnings ratio of 22.1 for the S&P 500 index and 26 for technology, according to Refinitiv's data.
David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer for DWS, which has an overweight rating on utilities, said interest rates are still low, but utilities offer inflation protection because they would be able to raise their prices. 
As of Friday, the S&P 500 utilities sector had a dividend yield of 3.3%, the second-highest among S&P sectors after consumer staples, and well above the 1.5% yield for the S&P 500, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Benchmark 10-year note yields were at 1.660% on Friday after reaching a one-year high of 1.754% the week before.

""Utilities is our most preferred bond substitute,"" said Bianco.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s social media team bared its teeth this week to go after two big critics in Congress: Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
Amazon first struck out Wednesday with tweets by Dave Clark, chief executive of Amazon's worldwide consumer business, who criticized Sanders for pushing for a $15 minimum wage and supporting Amazon workers in Alabama who are considering unionizing.
On Friday, the day that Sanders met with Amazon workers in Alabama, Amazon News tweeted that Sanders' home state of Vermont's minimum wage was $11.75. ""Sanders would rather talk in Alabama than act in Vermont,"" the company tweeted.
In his meeting, Sanders urged Amazon workers to vote for the union: ""When you stand up and fight, you are taking on here not only one of the most powerful corporations in this country you are taking on the wealthiest individuals in the world. And you're doing it in an anti-union state.""
The company also went after Warren, who pledged on Twitter that she would ""fight your union-busting. And fight to break up Big Tech so you’re not powerful enough to heckle senators with snotty tweets.""
She had initially called for Amazon to be broken up, along with other Big Tech giants, in 2019 when she was running for president. 
Amazon called her tweet ""extraordinary and revealing.""
""One of the most powerful politicians in the United States just said she's going to break up an American company so that they can't criticize her anymore,"" Amazon tweeted.
Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither Sanders' nor Warren's offices immediately replied to a request for comment.
It may not be just Amazon losing patience with pressure from Washington. 
At a congressional hearing on Thursday, Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey apparently got frustrated with lawmakers pressing for yes or no answers to questions. During the hearing, Dorsey tweeted ""?"" with a poll asking Twitter users to vote ""yes"" or ""no.""
Democratic Representative Kathleen Rice asked: ""Mr. Dorsey, what is winning, yes or no, on your Twitter account poll?""

Dorsey told her that ""yes"" was winning, to which she replied: ""Your multitasking skills are quite impressive.""

(Reuters) - Shares in media companies ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc tumbled around 27% each on Friday, capping a week of declines and putting both stocks roughly 50% below their recent record highs.
ViacomCBS closed down $18.12 at $48.23, marking a record one-day percentage decline, with trading volume more than five times its 10-day moving average. The stock had hit a record high of $101.97 on March 15 before it started losing ground over several sessions. 
Discovery shares dropped $15.85 to $41.90 in what was also its biggest one-day percentage decline, with volume surpassing eight times its 10-day moving average. That stock has now fallen 45.8% over five straight sessions of declines after hitting a record high of $78.14 on March 19. 
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) on Friday downgraded Viacom to ""underweight"" from ""equal weight"" and slashed its price target for the stock from $82 to $59, citing a $2.7 billion equity sale by the company earlier in the week.
Both stocks had soared this year on increased appetite for undervalued names, newly launched streaming services and an unwinding of bearish investor bets. Viacom was still showing a 29% year-to-date gain compared with Discovery's 39%. At their 2021 peaks Discovery was up about 160% year-to-date while ViacomCBS had risen as much as 174%. 
""Maybe reality is setting in,"" said Eric Handler at MKM Partners, who covers Discovery. 
Large blocks of shares in both companies were put in the market on Friday, likely exacerbating the declines, Handler said. 
Chris Marangi, co-chief investment officer for value at Gabelli Funds, which was Viacom's second biggest holder of voting stock as of late January, also cited the outsize trades as a factor in the stocks' sharp fall. 

""It's a massive amount of volume. That's the reason"" for Friday's decline, said Marangi. Also on Friday Fox Corp shares fell 6.2% to $37.80 while News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) fell 1.9% to $25.72.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co has resumed deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner jets, handing over one plane to United Airlines on Friday, an initial step as the U.S. planemaker works through production defects that sidelined dozens of aircraft. 
Reuters reported last week that Boeing remained on course to resume deliveries of a few 787s this month, which a Boeing spokeswoman said remained the goal.
The delivery from its South Carolina factory comes as Boeing undertakes painstaking repairs and forensic inspections to fix structural integrity flaws embedded deep inside dozens of 787s, issues which halted deliveries since October, cutting off a key source of cash.
The inspections and retrofits could take up to a month per plane and are likely to cost hundreds of millions - if not billions - of dollars, depending on the number of planes across the fleet that are impacted and the defects involved, sources told Reuters.
""We have resumed 787 deliveries, following several months of engineering analysis and inspection work,"" Boeing spokeswoman Jessica Kowal said by e-mail.
A United Airlines representative did not immediately return a request for comment. 
Separately last week, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration decided to independently handle final pre-delivery checks on four 787 jets, in the latest signal of the agency's tougher scrutiny of Boeing after two fatal 737 MAX crashes.

The United Airlines 787 was one of those four FAA-inspected planes.

LOS ANGELES/London (Reuters) - A stranded container ship blocking the Suez Canal threatens to make it even more difficult for European and U.S. retailers to keep products in stock during the coronavirus pandemic. 
The Suez Canal saga that began on Tuesday and could go on for weeks, is just the latest crisis to strike the global supply chain that was upended when coronavirus shutdowns spurred house-bound consumers to upgrade appliances, sofas, televisions and backyards. 
IKEA, the world's largest furniture seller, and London-based electronics seller Dixons Carphone (LON:DC) are among the retailers with goods on the stranded vessel, both companies told Reuters.
Amsterdam-based household goods seller Blokker confirmed they have goods that are being delayed, but would not say what. 
The salvage company overseeing the rescue effort has warned it could take weeks to dislodge the massive Ever Given, which got wedged in the canal during a sand storm. 
The resulting surge in imports due to the pandemic to Europe and the United States stranded empty containers in the wrong places, drove up cargo rates and caused seaport bottlenecks that are rippling throughout the transportation sector - and threatening to get worse. 
""Ships, containers and goods are all in the wrong places,"" said Douglas Kent, an executive vice at the Association for Supply Chain Management (ASCM). 
Lloyd's List estimates that roughly $9.6 billion in containerized goods - including exercise equipment, appliances, apparel to consumer electronics - pass through the Suez Canal each day. Thousands of empty containers are also returned to Asian factories via the canal, experts said. 
IKEA has about 110 containers on the ship wedged in the canal and is investigating how many boxes of products are on other vessels waiting to enter the channel.
""Depending on how this work proceeds and how long it takes to finish the operation, it may create constraints on our supply chain,"" said Hannes Mård, spokesman for IKEA brand owner and franchiser Inter IKEA.
""This is a devastating event in an already stressed market, where high demand has caused congestion delays that keep import cargo from reaching store shelves in a timely fashion,"" said Richard Roche, a sub-committee chairman at the National Customs Brokers & Forwarders Association of America.
The risk to container shipping is greatest in Europe - where key seaports like Antwerp in Belgium and Felixstowe in Britain are grappling with backlogs. The United States is exposed on the East and Gulf Coasts. About 45% cargo volume at the Port of New York & New Jersey moves through the Suez Canal, experts said. 
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) , which uses seaports in the Southeast and other parts of the country, and its online rival Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) did not immediately respond to comment. 
U.S. companies like  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) recently made headlines calling out millions of dollars in shipping delay-related costs and product availability disruption. Relief checks from President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus package are expected to boost consumer demand and intensify such pressures.
Within days, the race to reroute cargo could be on - pitting retailers against other industries for precious cargo space.
British supply chain procurement partner OCI Limited Group Chief Executive Oliver Chapman said 134 containers of personal protective gear including gloves and masks eventually bound for organizations like England's National Health Service and New York's Northwell Health are on nine ships stuck behind the Ever Given.
He said alternative rail service from Asia into Europe is already heavily congested, and flying cargo is prohibitively expensive – increasing the cost of one small box of nitrile gloves from about 25 cents for sea to $2-$3 for air into Europe.

His group is already rerouting some U.S. cargo to the Port of Los Angeles, which is digging out from under a mountain of cargo.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge said on Friday  Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB) may sue two offshore funds for allegedly reneging on an agreement to sell the German bank $1.6 billion of claims in the bankruptcy of swindler Bernard Madoff's namesake firm.
Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) had accused the Kingate Global Fund and Kingate Euro Fund, which funneled client money to Madoff before his Ponzi scheme collapsed in 2008, of having ""sellers' remorse"" for agreeing to sell the claims at 66 cents on the dollar in 2011, only to see their value later rise substantially.
In refusing to dismiss the lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos in Manhattan pointed to language that the agreement was ""firm, irrevocable and binding,"" though a formal contract was never signed and much time had passed.
""Here, two sophisticated parties agreed of their own free will to be bound,"" Ramos wrote.
Ramos said Deutsche Bank can also pursue a claim that the Kingate funds acted in bad faith by filing for protection under Chapter 15 of the U.S. bankruptcy code in September 2019 to escape possible litigation by the bank.
Lawyers for the Kingate funds did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment.
In June 2019, the Kingate funds agreed to return $860 million in a settlement with Irving Picard, the court-appointed trustee liquidating Madoff's former firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC.
Madoff, 82, is serving a 150-year prison term.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Rio de Janeiro police have begun investigating allegations brought by Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz that Brazilian miner Vale illegally concealed from its shareholders the conditions under which Steinmetz's company BSGR was supposed to mine one of the world's biggest iron ore deposits, state prosecutors said on Friday.
Vale and BSG Resources Ltd (BSGR), which entered a joint venture agreement in 2010 to develop the vast Simandou field in Guinea, are locked in a long-running legal dispute over the iron ore project.
The concession was later revoked by the Guinean government after it said it had evidence BSGR obtained the rights through corruption. BSGR denied the allegations.
In January, a Swiss criminal court found Steinmetz guilty of corruption and forgery to obtain exploration permits for iron ore and sentenced him to five years in jail over the deal BSGR secured for the project. Steinmetz said he would appeal the verdict.
In an October filing, Steinmetz alleged Vale executives had been ""fraudulently concealing information from their shareholders about the true risks of the billion-dollar transaction and disclosing false information about the terms on which the deal was signed for the past ten years.""
In a memorandum dated March 18 and confirmed to Reuters on Friday, the prosecutors' office said police would interview Vale executives and former directors as part of the inquiry.
The prosecutors' memorandum does not state the specific risks that Steinmetz is alleging should have been disclosed to shareholders. 
It does, however, refer to previous allegations by BSGR that Vale was fraudulently omitting relevant information from its shareholders and disclosing false information about the conditions under which the deal was concluded. The memorandum says that if Vale did what BSGR claims, it would constitute a crime under Brazilian law.
Reuters has no independent evidence that would support or refute this.
In a statement to Reuters, Vale said: ""Vale ...has no knowledge of the aforementioned inquiry."" 
""Any new attempt by Mr. Steinmetz to try to evade his responsibility to indemnify Vale will certainly have the same outcome of the convictions already imposed on him,"" it added.
""Steinmetz will also answer in civil and criminal courts for his fallacious maneuvers.""
Steinmetz was not immediately available for comment.
BSGR is still seeking to reopen an arbitration case in London that ordered it to pay $1.25 billion to Vale for its investment in Simandou. Vale had accused BSGR of fraudulently inducing it to buy the 51% stake in the mine. 

BSGR went into voluntary administration to protect it from legal disputes in 2018.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow rose in a broad-based rally on Friday with technology, healthcare and financial stocks providing the biggest lift as investors bet on a recovery that is expected to deliver the fastest economic growth since 1984.
The S&P 500 and the Dow ended a seesaw week higher as investors rebalancing their portfolios at the quarter's end continued to buy stocks that stand to benefit from a growing economy while they added some beaten-down technology shares.
The Nasdaq also ended higher as less popular tech shares advanced, but the composite index posted its second weekly decline in a row.
Wall Street surged in the last half hour of trading, lifting all three indexes more than 1%.
The Russell 1000 value index, which includes energy, banks and industrial stocks, has gained more than 10% this year, outperforming its counterpart the Russell 1000 growth index, which is just above break-even for the year.

Some of the tech heavyweights slid, such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, but  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) bucked the trend, helping lift the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher. 
""It is less a move out of technology than a move that evidences a broader appetite for equities to include both growth and value,"" said John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management in New York.

L Brands (NYSE:LB) jumped 3.7% after the Victoria's Secret owner raised its current-quarter profit forecast for the second time this month as it benefits from consumers spending their stimulus checks and relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions.
The Federal Reserve last week raised its GDP estimate for 2021 to 6.5% from 4.2% and many economists expect still faster growth, which has spurred fears the economy could run too hot and force the Fed to raise interest rates. 
The dollar eased but remained near four-month peaks on continued optimism about the U.S. economy. 
""It has been hard to restrain our U.S. growth forecast in recent months. We've been upgrading our estimates almost as fast as we lowered them a year ago,"" Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS), told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.
Bank stocks gained 1.9% as the Fed said it would lift income-based restrictions on bank dividends and share buybacks for ""most firms"" in June after its next round of stress tests.
The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose to 1.66%, lower than a spike last week to 1.75% that sparked a selloff on inflation fears and a potential Fed rate hike - something the Fed has pledged not to do. 
The market is concerned that all of a sudden the Fed is forced to tighten against its repeated mantra that it will not, said Marvin Loh, a senior global macro strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets. 
""The real concern is that things overheat and the Fed might be forced to change its mind,"" he said.
Energy stocks jumped 2.6%, tracking a boost in crude prices after a giant container ship blocking the Suez Canal spurred fears of a supply squeeze. [O/R]
Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors rose, with only the communication services index in the red.
Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc slumped 4.8% as the Chinese electric vehicle maker said it would halt production for five working days at its Hefei plant due to a shortage in semiconductor chips.
Latest data showed U.S. consumer spending fell by the most in 10 months in February as a cold snap gripped many parts of the country and the boost from a second round of stimulus checks faded, though the decline is likely temporary.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.30-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.81-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 65 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 51 new lows.

Automakers are expanding and extending production cuts at some North American plants as they cope with a worsening global shortage of semiconductors.
Chips for use in cars and trucks have been harder to come by as semiconductor makers have allocated more capacity to consumer products. The pandemic has caused a surge in orders for smartphones, TVs and computers as people try to make extended life at home more bearable, leaving less capacity for a stronger-than-expected rebound in vehicle demand. Recent weather-related disruptions of petrochemical supplies in the southern U.S. and a fire at a chipmaking plant in Japan have exacerbated the shutdowns.

Consultant AlixPartners has said the global chip shortage could cost automakers $61 billion in lost sales this year. The recent setbacks could further delay an expected second-quarter recovery in output. “Production is shrinking, not increasing, so the balance between supply and demand is only getting worse,” said Takeshi Miyao, an analyst at researcher Carnorama.
Here’s the current situation for major auto manufacturers in North America.
Stellantis NV
March 26: The automaker plans to idle its minivan factory in Windsor, Canada, starting March 29 through early to mid-April, according to a company spokesperson.

Output has been curtailed for Toyota’s Camry, Camry Hybrid, Avalon, Avalon Hybrid, RAV4 Hybrid, Lexus ES 350, Lexus ES 300h, Tundra, Tacoma and Corolla models.
March 21: Toyota said it is trying to gauge the fallout from the fire at the semiconductor plant owned by Renesas Electronics Corp. Japan’s largest automaker accounts for about 6.6% of Renesas’ sales.

Investing.com – The Dow racked up gains Friday, as late flourish of buying pressure lifted broader market to notch a weekly win, with energy and technology leading the charge.   
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.39%, or 452 points, the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.24%, the S&P 500 was up 1.67%.
Energy stocks racked up gains as oil prices rose 4% over the ongoing Suez Canal saga that some estimate is disrupting hundreds of thousands of barrels a day from being transported via the key shipping route.
More than 600,000 barrels a day of Middle East oil destined for the U.S. and Europe and about 850,000 barrels of crude to Asia are transported though the Suez, according to ACM Shipbroker.
While the boost to oil prices from transport disruptions will be temporary, Wall Street continues to suggest that oil prices will head higher as major oil producing countries will refrain from ramping up production too quickly.
""[W]e expect a slower ramp-up in OPEC+ production this spring to help offset both slower EM and EU demand recovery and higher Iranian exports, with global demand still set to increase sharply through the summer,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said.
Financials also participated in the broader market rally following a bid in banks after the Federal Reserve gave banks the green light to resume dividends and stock buybacks after June 30. 
Cyclicals were unfazed by weaker-expected-expected consumer spending February, with economists quick to point out weather-related noise -following the cold snap last month – in the data, and reiterated the expected boost to spending from stimulus.
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO),  NXP Semiconductors  (NASDAQ:NXPI), and Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) led the rally in chip stocks.
""We expect an additional stimulus package passed in March to raise the savings rate again, adding to a powerful tailwind of buying power that has been building among US households – ready to be deployed as the economy is reopening,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said.
The likely wave of consumer spending to come will boost inflationary pressures, with the latest data showing the price consumer expenditure index, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, rose to 1.6% in February year-on-year from 1.4% the prior month. That is still short of the Fed's 2% target, but analysts see further room for an acceleration in price pressures.
""We continue to see core PCE inflation peaking in April and May this year closer to 2.6%,"" Morgan Stanley added.
The United States 10-Year yields topped 1.65%, though that did little to curb investor appetite for the growth trade, with tech stocks pushed higher by a rally in chip stocks.

""I have no problem whatsoever ... trading the volatility that is going on in GameStop right now,"" said Jeff Tomasulo, CEO of Vespula Capital. ""We're not even looking at this fundamentally anymore because it's just gotten so insane.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain and the European Union agreed a new post-Brexit financial services pact on Friday that will allow them to co-operate on regulation but does little to improve the City of London's access to the bloc.
Britain's finance ministry said the two sides have agreed terms on a ""Memorandum of Understanding"" that will set the conditions for how regulators from the EU and Britain share information.
However, Brussels has said the MoU will not automatically lead to Britain's large financial industry being able to sell a wide range of products and services to EU clients again. 
Industry experts said while the framework was useful, it was unlikely to rekindle anything like the kind of access banks and brokers had to the EU before Britain left the bloc.
Brexit has already put a dent in Britain's financial industry and a City of London official has described the framework as a ""talking shop"". 
""This is unlikely to offer solid foundations for bulk cross border business,"" said Simon Morris, a financial services partner at law firm CMS. 
In January, more than 6 billion euros in daily share trading left London for Amsterdam, along with swathes of trading in derivatives. 
In a further potential blow to Britain's financial services might, Brussels is now considering forcing the clearing of euro swaps, still dominated by the London Stock Exchange's LCH arm in London, to move to the bloc.
Friday's MoU agreement is similar to what the EU already has with the United States for arranging regular, informal and non-binding meetings of financial regulators to discuss new rules and air any disagreements.
So far, the EU has declined to grant any long-term direct access for financial firms from Britain, saying this week that it was in no rush.
""Overall, for investors in UK financial services, a greater degree of cooperation between Europe and the UK can only be seen in a favourable light,"" said Alan Custis, head of UK equities at Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Asset Management.
""But it still feels as though the UK needs to continue to plough its own furrow in case there is a change of heart.""
Jonathan Hill, a former EU financial services commissioner, said this week that Britain should not sit around for access, known as equivalence, but focus on making the City more attractive to international investors.

""Achieving a form of equivalence with the EU is essential but it should not detract us from the real challenge: making London and other financial capitals in Europe more competitive relative to the fast growing US and Asian markets,"" said Daniel Pinto, chief executive of Stanhope Capital.

322,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2021 02:40PM ET</span>",BofA sees 'golden decade' for U.S. municipal bond market under Biden,"By Karen Pierog
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Massive fiscal aid, potentially huge infrastructure spending and the prospect of federal tax increases under President Joe Biden's administration will boost the U.S. municipal bond market in coming years, a BofA Global Research report said on Friday.
The market is already cheering the $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus plan Biden signed into law on March 11, with $350 billion heading to states and local governments to help with lost revenue and higher costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""The American Rescue Plan, along with President Biden's forthcoming infrastructure plan, forms the basis of the golden decade that we expect for muni market issuers through 2030,"" the BofA report said.
Aid was a factor in decisions this month by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service to revise the credit outlook to stable from negative for the state and local government sectors. 
The Democratic president is scheduled to unveil his ""Build Back Better"" plan next week that could have involve spending as much as $4 trillion on traditional infrastructure, as well as climate and domestic policy initiatives.
""Added to this is the potential benefit from tax changes that, on balance, should increase demand for munis,"" BofA said.
It pointed to the possibility of raising the 37% top personal tax rate back to 39.6%, limiting deductions for the highest earners to 28% and increasing the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% to help pay for the additional federal spending.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 climbed Friday, led by energy, as oil prices rode bets on crude supply disruptions from the Suez Canal jam while a rally in chip stocks helped boost tech.
The S&P 500 was up 0.27%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.21%, or 67 points, the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.67%.
Energy stocks racked up gains as oil prices rose 4% over the ongoing Suez Canal saga that some estimate is disrupting hundreds of thousands of barrels a day from being transported via the key shipping route.
More than 600,000 barrels a day of Middle East oil destined for the U.S. and Europe and about 850,000 barrels of crude to Asia are transported though the Suez, according to ACM Shipbroker.
While the boost to oil prices from transport disruptions will be temporary, Wall Street continues to suggest that oil prices will head higher as major oil producing countries will refrain from ramping up production too quickly.
""[W]e expect a slower ramp-up in OPEC+ production this spring to help offset both slower EM and EU demand recovery and higher Iranian exports, with global demand still set to increase sharply through the summer,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said.
Financials also participated in the broader market rally following a bid in banks after the Federal Reserve gave the green light for banks to resume dividends and stock buybacks.
Cyclicals were unfazed by weaker-expected-expected consumer spending February, with economists quick to point out weather-related noise -following the cold snap last month – in the data, and reiterated the expected boost to spending from stimulus.
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO),  NXP Semiconductors  (NASDAQ:NXPI), and Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) led the rally in chip stocks.
""We expect an additional stimulus package passed in March to raise the savings rate again, adding to a powerful tailwind of buying power that has been building among US households – ready to be deployed as the economy is reopening,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said.
The likely wave of consumer spending will boost inflation pressures, with the latest data showing the price consumer expenditure index, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, rose to 1.6% in February year-on-year from 1.4% the prior month.
""We continue to see core PCE inflation peaking in April and May this year closer to 2.6%,"" Morgan Stanley added.
The United States 10-Year yields remained in the positive, though that did little to curb investor appetite for the growth trade, with tech stocks getting a boost from a jump in chip stocks.
The communications services sector, however, slumped more more than 1% following slump in Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA), ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) and  Fox Corp  (NASDAQ:FOXA).
Fox Corp. fell 11% after Dominion Voting System filed a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News Network for accusing the company of rigging the 2020 presidential election.

That suit is seeking more than $2.7 billion.Dominion is seeking at least $1.6 billion in lost profits and enterprise value, plus more than $1 million in security expenses and expenses combating disinformation. In response, Fox News said it ""is proud of our 2020 election coverage, which stands in the highest tradition of American journalism, and will vigorously defend against this baseless lawsuit in court,"" NPR reported.

Evercore analyst Kirk Materne called Snowflake the ""data cloud category killer,"" while initiating coverage with an outperform rating and a $311 price target.
The price target is almost a 35% gain from the stock's current price. Snowflake shares jumped 5.5%.
""Snowflake is not for the faint of heart and our bullish view will play out over multiple years, not just the next few quarters,"" he said in his note.
Earlier this week, UBS started Snowflake with a buy, citing the “extraordinary” growth rate.

LONDON (Reuters) -Mastercard, a global payment processor, is battling attempts to add about 14 million deceased people to a 14 billion pound-plus ($19.3 billion) British class action in an effort to limit the scope of the historic case.
A Mastercard (NYSE:MA) lawyer told London's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) on Friday that an application seeking to add those who died between 1992 and 2008 into the country's first mass consumer claim, that alleges the company overcharged people over a near 16-year period, was a ""nullity"". 
""A claim cannot be brought in the name of a deceased person,"" Mark Hoskins, representing Mastercard, said at the hearing.
Former financial ombudsman Walter Merricks, who is leading the claim, alleges that Mastercard overcharged almost 60 million people in Britain - including about 14 million people who are deceased - over the period. The case could entitle adults and their estates to roughly 300 pounds each if successful.
Hoskins said attempts to add new members -- or their administrators, personal representatives, executors or next of kin -- to the ""very serious claim"" was also now time-barred. 
The company is also resisting attempts to add compound interest to any award, which the court heard could push up the value of the claim by more than 2 billion pounds.
Lawyers for Merricks pushed for the deceased to be included, questioned why death might time-bar a valid case and urged the tribunal either to certify the lawsuit with compound interest or defer the question to the trial tribunal. 
The drawn-out case was brought in 2016, one year after the CAT was nominated to oversee Britain's U.S.-style ""opt-out"" class action regime for breaches of UK or EU competition law.
The CAT blocked the case in 2017 but is re-considering authorising it as a collective action and determining its scope -- and establishing a standard for a string of other, stalled class actions -- after the UK Supreme Court in December lowered the bar for allowing such actions to proceed.
Merricks, who is being advised by law firm Quinn Emanuel, alleges Mastercard charged excessive ""interchange"" fees – the fees retailers pay credit card companies when consumers use a card to shop - between May 1992 and June 2008 and that those fees were passed on to consumers as retailers raised prices.
Mastercard says it ""fundamentally disagrees"" with the claim, that people received valuable benefits from its payments technology and that the lawsuit is driven by U.S. lawyers and backed by organisations focused on making money for themselves.

A judgment will be made later.

“The purchase of personal protective equipment, such as masks, hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes, for the primary purpose of preventing the spread of coronavirus are deductible medical expenses,” agency said in a statement.
Taxpayers can qualify for the deduction if they have medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of their adjusted gross income and they itemize their tax returns. Generally, only a small percentage of taxpayers itemize their taxes and an even smaller portion meet the threshold for medical deductions.
For the vast majority of taxpayers that take the standard deduction instead of itemizing, the IRS is also offering tax relief. They can use tax-favored health accounts -- health flexible spending arrangements, Archer medical savings accounts, health reimbursement arrangements, or health savings accounts -- to pay for those costs.
The addition of masks and hand sanitizer adds to a long lists of medical costs that can come with tax benefits. Payments for false teeth, reading or prescription eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids, crutches and wheelchairs all count toward the write-off and can also be paid for by many health accounts.
The IRS has an online tool to calculate whether you can deduct medical expenses.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) said on Friday that Scott Soussa, who co-heads the hedge fund and private equity stakes business, has decided to leave the firm and that Mustafa Siddiqui, who co-heads the business, will be the sole head of the Strategic Capital Holdings unit.
Soussa, a senior managing director in the company's Blackstone Alternative Asset Management unit (BAAM), is leaving for another opportunity but has agreed to remain at Blackstone until the end of the year. 
Siddiqui, also a senior managing director in Blackstone's BAAM unit, has served as co-head of the business, known as the GP Stakes platform, alongside Soussa. Previously he worked in Blackstone's Private Equity Group, where he led the firm's private equity investment activities across the energy sector in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
""We are incredibly grateful to Scott for his significant contributions in building our successful stakes business,"" said Blackstone President Jon Gray, adding that he was promoting Siddiqui and naming firm veteran Mike Nash to a new role. ""Our stakes business has tremendous momentum partnering with world-class GPs and we are quite excited about what's to come,"" Gray told Reuters ahead of an announcement of the changes.
Nash, who co-founded Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies, will become chairman of the GP Stakes platform. The business oversees $7.4 billion in assets.
The unit makes minority investments in a general partner's underlying management company. Some of its most prominent successes include Senator Investment Group, New Mountain Capital, Francisco Partners and Leonard Green.
Blackstone is the world's biggest investor in hedge funds and its BAAM unit manages $79 billion in assets. It has been expanding this year.

(Reuters) - More young adults in the United States reported feeling anxious or depressed during the past six months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and fewer people reported getting the help they needed, according to a U.S. government study released on Friday. 
The percentage of adults under age 30 with recent symptoms of an anxiety or a depressive disorder rose significantly about five months after the U.S. imposed COVID-19 related lockdowns, and reported rising deaths from the fast-spreading virus. 
Between August 2020 and February 2021, this number went up to 41.5% from 36.4%, as did the percentage of such people reporting that they needed, but did not receive, mental health counseling. 
The study suggests that the rise in anxiety or depressive disorder symptoms reported correspond with the weekly number of reported COVID-19 cases. 
The findings are based on a Household Pulse Survey conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Census Bureau to monitor changes in mental health status and access to care during the pandemic. 
""Trends in mental health can be used to evaluate the impact of strategies addressing adult mental health status and care during the pandemic,"" the authors of the study wrote in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report released on Friday.
The study also found those with less than a high school education were more at risk, though it did not provide an explanation for it.
Even with more vaccines gaining authorization beginning late 2020, the effects of the pandemic on mental health continued into 2021. 
During Jan. 20, 2021 through Feb. 1, 2021, about two in five adults aged over 18 years experienced recent symptoms of an anxiety or a depressive disorder, the survey found.

Demand for mental health and meditation apps, and investments in tech startups building these apps have also risen during this period.

Net interest margins remained stable for all three, as analysts predict a positive turn in the key gauge of profitability this year.
During the first three quarters of 2020, Chinese lenders made hefty loan-loss provisions as Beijing urged the sector to step up lending to pandemic-hit sectors, but many have begun to see improvements in earnings in tandem with an economic recovery and are expected to continue to do so throughout the year.
""Banks' average net interest margin is unlikely to narrow further from the 2020 level of 2.1% because of the central bank's gradual return to a neutral monetary policy stance,"" said Moody's (NYSE:MCO) in a March China Banking outlook.
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Bank of Communications Co Ltd (BoCom),, booked a jump in fourth-quarter net profit on Friday of well over 40%.
Meanwhile, China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) Corp (CCB) logged a 58% surge in fourth-quarter net profit.
It was the first profit gain in three quarters for all three lenders.
For ICBC, profit for the full year increased 1.2% to 315.9 billion yuan, while at BoCom, it climbed 1.3% to 78.3 billion yuan. CCB profit over the same period increased 1.6% to 271.1 billion yuan. All three lenders surpassed Refinitive estimates. 
For all lenders, the net interest margin (NIM) - a key guage of bank profitability - stayed mostly steady. Non-performing loan ratios remained flat from BoCom and ICBC, but rose slightly for CCB from 1.53% at the end of September last year to 1.56% end 2020.
LONG COVID
But despite the rosier figures, bankers still warned of lurking uncertainty from the pandemic.
""In 2021, challenges remain for the pandemic prevention and economic growth,"" said ICBC Vice President Wang Jingwu.
In its financial statements, CCB underlined the pressure on asset quality from ""the slowdown in macroeconomic growth, intensified turbulence in the international financial market, and rising uncertainties and instabilities in the economic environment.""

(Reuters) - WeWork said on Friday it has agreed to go public through a merger with blank-check firm BowX Acquisition Corp, enabling the office-sharing company to complete a stock market listing two years after its failed first attempt.
The merger with BowX, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), values WeWork at around $9 billion, a steep drop from the $47 billion the money-losing company was worth in a 2019 private funding round led by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp. 
Later in 2019, WeWork attempted an initial public offering but pulled the plans due to investor concerns over its business model and co-founder Adam Neumann's management style. 
Neumann ultimately stepped down as chief executive. Sandeep Mathrani is now CEO, and his work has included cutting costs by $1.6 billion, according to WeWork. 
""Sometimes you don't pick the path (and) a path picks you. In December, we were approached by BowX and other SPACS,"" Mathrani told CNBC in an interview.
""We had seen a path to profitability and we thought it was a good time to raise additional liquidity to de-risk the balance sheet, and to make sure that we have a path to profitability,"" Mathrani added. 
BowX shares on Nasdaq were up 8% in morning trading. 
SoftBank, WeWork's largest backer, will retain a majority stake in the company after the deal. SoftBank and other investors have agreed to a one-year lock-up on their shares, according to a person familiar with the matter. Current shareholders will own about 83% of the combined company.
SPACs like BowX are shell companies that raise funds in an IPO with the goal of merging with an unidentified private company. For the company being acquired, the merger is an alternative way to go public over a traditional IPO. 
'OPPORTUNITY STOCK'
Prospective investors in WeWork's 2019 IPO were in part spooked by losses that stretched into the billions of dollars with no clear path to profitability. 
WeWork has yet to turn a profit. Its adjusted EBITDA, a measure of a business' underlying profitability, was -$1.8 billion in 2020. WeWork forecasts this will be -$900 million in 2021 but predicts it will achieve operating profitability of $500 million in 2022. 
WeWork has also had to weather the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to many office staffers working from home. WeWork's revenues for 2020 were flat at $3.2 billion, but the company and real estate industry experts expect there will be growing demand after the pandemic for the sort of flexible offices provided by companies like WeWork. 
""We believe that WeWork is going to be the opportunity stock for the recovery,"" BowX co-CEO Vivek Ranadivé told CNBC.
In total WeWork expects to raise $1.3 billion in cash from the merger, funded by the $420 million BowX raised in its IPO in August and an $800 billion private investment in public equity (PIPE) from investors including Insight Partners, Starwood Capital Group and Fidelity Management. 
BowX had initially looked to raise $500 million for the PIPE but increased this due to investor demand, according to people familiar with the matter. 

PJT Partners (NYSE:PJT) was WeWork's financial adviser on the deal. UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) advised BowX.

Darden is expected to also have a better dine-in business post-Covid, on top of continued strong to-go sales.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Auto insurer Root Inc, whose stock price tumbled more than 50% since its public listing late last year, is a bargain that is currently misunderstood by investors and should be trading higher, Andrew Left, founder of Citron Research, said on Thursday.
""We believe Root is a misunderstood short,"" Left said, calling the six-year-old company a ""disruptive tech company"" whose shares should not be trading below their IPO price of $27.
Root's stock gained nearly 5% on Thursday to finish trading at $12.87. It gained more than 4% in after hours trading.
The company relies on smartphone data to keep tabs on drivers' habits which it uses to price risk, leaving it with a usage-based insurance (UBI) score that ""is almost ten times more predictive than an industry leading UBI provider according (international actuarial and consulting firm) Milliman,"" Root wrote in its filing last year.
Still, Wall Street has turned its back on the company as short interest in the company stood at roughly 10.9 million shares on March 15, according to Refinitiv data. It currently ranks among the 10 most widely shorted U.S. companies.
Left, who built his reputation and fortune by publishing reports on stocks that he thought should be trading lower, changed course earlier this year and said he would no longer publish short-seller reports in the wake the trading frenzy around video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME).
In January an army of retail investors took on Left and other investors who were short GameStop and pushed the stock significantly higher, forcing many like Left to rethink their positions. Left said at the time that the skills he used in putting together his short reports could also work with reports arguing that stocks should be higher.
In a presentation aired on Twitter on Thursday, Left said he was not involved in GameStop or Bitcoin at this time but that short selling is not ""dead."" 
Turning back to Root, he noted that blue-chip technology investors like Coatue Management, Dragoneer Investment Group and Silver Lake Partners, who are currently listed as investors likely were not fooled by Root. 
Left noted that last year was a tough year to go public for an auto insurance company but that it has ""great management that knows insurance and technology."" But he added that Root has not done a good job in telling its story to Wall Street, something that can be fixed, however.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Dominion Voting Systems Corp filed a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News, accusing the cable news network of falsely claiming the voting company rigged the 2020 presidential election in order to boost its ratings, Dominion said on Friday.
Dominion - which has already sued former President Donald Trump's campaign lawyer Sidney Powell and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani - argued Fox News ""sold a false story of election fraud in order to serve its own commercial purposes, severely injuring Dominion in the process,"" according to a copy of the lawsuit.
Dominion said it filed the lawsuit in Delaware state court.
Trump, a Republican, lost the November 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden but continued to make false claims of widespread voter fraud. His supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 as Congress moved to certify the election results. 
In its lawsuit, Dominion said Fox News tried to draw viewers loyal to Trump, by amplifying those false claims, including assertions that Dominion's systems changed votes despite efforts by the voting systems company to set the record straight.
""Fox News Media is proud of our 2020 election coverage, which stands in the highest tradition of American journalism, and will vigorously defend against this baseless lawsuit in court,” said a statement from the company, which is owned by Fox Corp. 
""The disinformation campaign waged against our company has caused us severe damage and undermined trust in American democratic institutions,"" Dominion Chief Executive Joe Poulos said in a statement. ""These lies also have threatened the personal safety of our employees and customers. No amount of money will repair the damage done."" 
Eric Coomer, a senior Dominion employee, sued Trump's re-election campaign and the owners of pro-Trump news outlets One America News Network and Newsmax Media in December. Last month, Dominion asked social media outlets to preserve posts from the networks as well as from Fox News, Trump and others.
Smartmatic, which makes voting machines, made similar claims in a defamation lawsuit that alleged Lou Dobbs and two other Fox News hosts falsely accused the company of helping to rig the election against Trump. The day after Smartmatic sued on Feb. 4, Fox canceled the weekday program ""Lou Dobbs Tonight.""
Fox News filed a motion to dismiss the Smartmatic lawsuit.

In apparent response to the growing number of defamation cases, conservative U.S. news outlets have begun to rely on prepared disclaimers or additional prerecorded programming to repudiate pro-Trump conspiracy theories spouted by guests and hosts.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile’s LATAM Airlines (OTC:LTMAQ) is open to signing an exclusive contract with an e-commerce operator in Latin America as it looks to boost its cargo unit due to persistently weak passenger demand resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, an executive told Reuters.
E-commerce has grown substantially in Latin America during the pandemic although it has historically lagged due to poor infrastructure. Argentina's Mercadolibre (NASDAQ:MELI) Inc dominates in the region, especially in Brazil, and has a small fleet of in-house planes. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has also been making inroads in Latin America.
While signing an exclusive cargo contract is a possibility, Andres Bianchi, the chief executive of LATAM's cargo division, said the company may also create a system ""where different players who want to participate in e-commerce have access to capacity and use our network.""
""We are seeing e-commerce as a trend in the region that will continue growing, not just domestically but increasingly internationally,"" Bianchi said.
LATAM, the largest carrier in the region, filed for bankruptcy protection last May, hurt by the sudden collapse in air travel caused by the pandemic.
Since then, its cargo division has recovered faster than the rest of the company, and the company is now looking to permanently convert eight of its passenger planes into cargo aircraft.
Bianchi is particularly interested in increasing cargo capacity to Brazil, he said. But he's also working to increase cargo flights from Ecuador and Colombia, which have strong flower exports.
""That's why we are going to add two (cargo) planes in Colombia, as well as supporting the growth of the salmon industry in Chile,"" he said, pointing especially to Asian markets.

MILAN (Reuters) - Talks between the EU and Italy on a restructuring plan for Alitalia face a stumbling block as the European Commission demands the carrier give up a significant number of airport slots, three sources close to the matter said.
Brussels and Rome have been in talks since the beginning of this year over Italy's plan to restructure the ailing airline through the launch of a new, state-owned company called ITA.
Under Rome's plan, ITA should take over the brand, the slots and part of the assets of the old carrier to start flying with a small fleet before the summer.
However, the nationalisation and the injection of 3 billion euros ($3.53 billion) in taxpayers' money into the new carrier need the EU clearance and a further delay in talks between Rome and Brussels could put at risk the Italian carrier's summer season. 
""That's where the problem lies, in (Milan city airport) Linate's slots,"" one source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. 
Another source said that the Commission is demanding a significant reduction in the slots that Alitalia would transfer to ITA, and said the ITA business plan has not been cleared yet by Brussels.
The European Commission declined to comment.
A key meeting between EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager and Italian ministers involved in Alitalia's nationalisation is scheduled for Friday afternoon.
ITA has until now rejected the idea of giving up slots at Milan city airport Linate, where Alitalia operated more than 50% of total slots before the pandemic hit.
Ryanair is interested in taking part in a tender to buy slots at Milan Linate airport and Rome Fiumicino airports if Alitalia puts them on the block, the Irish carrier said in January. 
Germany's Lufthansa, in return for a 9 billion euro bailout last year, reluctantly gave up 24 slots at each of its main hubs, Frankfurt and Munich.

A retreat in U.S. bond yields lured money inflows into U.S. equity funds, which saw net purchases of $14.1 billion; however, it was 27% lower than in the previous week.
The inflows were mainly into large-cap funds, with mid-cap and small-cap funds facing outflows, which indicated investors' preference toward safer stocks amid soaring global risks.
U.S. value funds saw an inflow of just $339 million, the lowest in three weeks, while growth funds attracted over $4 billion for a second successive week.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) will claim damages from former Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn and former Audi boss Rupert Stadler over its diesel emissions scandal, the carmaker said on Friday, trying to draw a line under its biggest-ever crisis.
The German company said that following a far-reaching legal investigation it had concluded Winterkorn and Stadler had breached their duty of care, adding it had found no violations by other members of the management board.
Winterkorn and Stadler have both denied being responsible for the scandal.
Volkswagen in 2015 admitted using illegal software to rig diesel engine tests in the United States, sparking Germany's biggest corporate crisis.
The scandal has cost the carmaker more than 32 billion euros ($38 billion) in fines, refits and legal costs.
Winterkorn resigned as CEO on Sept. 23, 2015, a week after the scandal broke. 
About three years later, Volkswagen terminated Stadler's contract as Audi CEO against the backdrop of a criminal investigation into whether he was involved in emissions cheating by the German group.
Volkswagen said the investigation it launched into the scandal, handled by law firm Gleiss Lutz, included the screening and review of 1.6 million files and more than 1,550 interviews and questionings.
""Both Prof. Winterkorn and Mr. Stadler accomplished great things with the Volkswagen Group ... there is no question that the impressive achievements in their professional careers still stand,"" Volkswagen's supervisory board said in a note sent to staff on Friday.
""However, as successful as their work was, there were aspects that Prof. Winterkorn and Mr. Stadler as Group Board members did not monitor carefully enough,"" it said in the note, seen by Reuters.
As a result, the company had decided to assert claims for damages against Winterkorn and Stadler on account of breaches of duty of care under stock corporation law, it said.
Winterkorn's lawyers said in a statement the former CEO regretted the supervisory board's decision and rejected the accusations against him.
""Mr Prof Dr Winterkorn is aware that the supervisory board is obliged to assess potential claims and to possibly assert them. He will therefore seek to clarify those questions in consultation with Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY),"" the statement said.
Stadler's lawyers declined to comment.
Volkswagen concluded that Winterkorn had breached his duty of care by failing to fully and swiftly clarify circumstances behind the use of unlawful software functions in some diesel engines sold in the North American market between 2009 and 2015.
In Germany, damage claims against former executives are rare but not uncommon. In 2009, former Siemens CEO and Chairman Heinrich von Pierer agreed to pay 5 million euros in a bribery scandal.

Ikea said it’s considering all options to ensure availability of products such as flatpack beds and couches, while Caterpillar is said to be considering airlifting products if necessary. Seabay International Freight Forwarding Ltd., a company that handles Chinese goods sold on platforms such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., has 20 to 30 containers on the ships waiting to cross the blocked canal, according to owner Mark Ma.
“If it can’t be resumed in a week, it will be horrible,” said Ma. “We will see freight fares spike again. The products are delayed, containers can’t return to China and we can’t deliver more goods.”
The challenges for international companies are only likely to worsen with efforts to dislodge the Ever Given vessel seen taking at least another five days, people familiar with the matter said Friday, increasing the likelihood of further disruption of the flow of everything from oil to grain and cars.
The crisis comes as companies were already battling the strain of adapting supply chains to cope with a pandemic-related e-commerce boom, while Covid-19 regulations at ports are slowing the passage of some products.
P&F Industries Inc., a U.S. maker of pneumatic hand tools, said the Suez shutdown only exacerbates delays to trade that have caused the firm to add six to eight weeks to expected delivery times.
When they arrive in the U.S., “shipments are going to sit there for quite a period of time, days, a week, even two weeks before customs and everything else lets you go,” Chief Executive Officer Richard A. Horowitz told analysts this week. “That’s something that’s going on with us for several months now.”
While A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S and Hapag-Lloyd AG are considering sending ships around Africa to avoid the gridlock, Seabay’s Ma said detouring ships may not be a viable solution, due to risks taking unfamiliar routes and extended shipment times.
“What if the canal got cleared in eight to ten days? You lose even more time,” he said.

By Tom Käckenhoff and Vera Eckert
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) is looking for partners and public funding to curb carbon emissions from steelmaking in its German operations where alternative technology plans are far advanced, the European head of the world's biggest steel producer said.
Europe's steelmakers are under pressure to cut carbon emissions while maintaining profitability in a market where there is fierce competition, mainly from China, while pollution permit costs are spiralling higher.[L8N2L94CD] 
""We are looking for partners from the energy sector to deliver renewable power,"" Geert Van Poelvoorde, the new chief executive of ArcelorMittal Europe told Reuters in an interview.
""We want to replace carbon and increase the use of scrap metal.""
The company estimates it would cost between 1 and 1.5 billion euros ($1.18-1.77 billion) to transform its Bremen and Eisenhuettenstadt plants, Van Poelvoorde said.
The company would close a blast furnace in each of the two plants and build electric arc furnaces for scrap smelting.
It would build direct reduction of iron ore (DRI) plants at Bremen and Eisenhuettenstadt, which could be run on gas as a transition fuel initially, and later with hydrogen, which is considered carbon-neutral when derived from renewable electricity.
The DRI process cuts CO2 versus the integrated blast furnace route by two thirds.
The Bremen and Eisenhuettenstadt plans ""have the potential to save five million tonnes of CO2 per year. That is significant,"" Van Poelvoorde said.
Separately, ArcelorMittal's so-called ""smart carbon"" process would use carbon recycled from bioenergy, green electricity, and carbon capture and usage.
Meanwhile in France the French Finance Minister said during a visit to ArcelorMittal's Fos-sur-Mer plant in southern France that ArcelorMittal was investing 63 million euros in cutting the plant's carbon emissions, which will include a 15 million euros subsidy from the French state.
Van Poelvoorde said a positive outcome of applications for subsidies of up to 60% of investments at German and European Union level were essential for the German plans to be finalised probably early next year and to be implemented between 2025 and 2030.
The EU would need to put border protection tariffs on imported steel from countries with heavy carbon loads, he said.
Consumers would also have to be ready to accept higher steel costs, by around 60%, for the cleaner manufacturing process, he said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Friday, led by banking stocks that were bolstered by expectations of share buybacks later in the year after the Federal Reserve said it would lift the current ban. 
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 148 points, or 0.5%, at 32,768 points, while the S&P 500 was up 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was lagging, with a gain of 0.2%.
Late on Thursday, the Federal Reserve had said it will allow banks to resume buybacks and dividends, as long as they pass its annual stress test, which is expected to wrap up by the end of June. Bank of America  (NYSE:BAC) stock rose 1.7% in response, while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock rose 1.3% and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) rose 1.1%. The Fed had last week ended a temporary exemption from capital requirements that had also been introduced last year as the pandemic started. Thursday's announcement creates a certain symmetry to what amounts to a statement that the Fed thinks there is no risk any more of a financial crisis resulting from the economic distress of the last year.
Data published earlier by the Bureau of Economic Analysis had again appeared to support the Federal Reserve's thesis that inflationary pressures in the economy remain muted, as the deflator for core personal consumer expenditures edged down to 1.4% on the year from 1.5% in Februar. The PCE deflator is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, and is faster to adjust to changes in consumer spending patterns such as those seen over the last year.
The data come a day after initial jobless claims fell to their lowest since the start of the pandemic, and a day after President Joe Biden announced a ramp-up of vaccinations against Covid-19 that will now see 200 million jabs administered to Americans by the end of April. Such progress is key to reopening the economy without risking a fresh wave of Covid-19, and is in stark contrast the to infection wave building in the European Union, which has been slower to immunize its population.
Among individual movers, L Brands (NYSE:LB) stock rose 6.8% to a new five-year high after the owner of Victoria's Secret raised its profit guidance with a nod to the latest fiscal stimulus package.
Chinese electric car maker Nio's (NYSE:NIO) ADRs fell 6.2% after it cut its production guidance due to the global shortage of semiconductors, which is forcing it to idle its main factory. 
Elsewhere,  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) stock extended its rebound, gaining 17% on top of its nearly 60% rise on Thursday as its loyal army of retail investors absorbed the shock of a prospective capital increase. 
Chinese Internet giants Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Tencent Music both fell on reports of large block trades being offered by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), while Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) stock fell 2.0% after Dominion, the maker of voting machines, became the second company to sue it for its coverage of the 2020 election.

The company cited the worldwide shortage of semiconductors for its decision. The shares also fell 8% in premarket trading.
Chips have been in short supply for some months but that gap has been exacerbated as economies recover along with more demand for work-from-home accessories.
Nio’s JAC-NIO plant in China’s central provincial capital of Hefei will halt operations for five working days starting March 29, Reuters quoted the company as saying Friday.
“The company expects to deliver approximately 19,500 vehicles in the first quarter, adjusted from previously released outlook of 20,000 to 20,500 vehicles,” Nio said in its release, according to Reuters.
The pandemic caused a surge in demand for chips needed for smartphones, TVs, computers and various other consumer items as people attempted to adjust to a work-from-home lifestyle and also get more productive. EV makers, whose appetite for the chips has also only gotten bigger on the back of surging demand for the greener vehicles, have taken the brunt of the shortage.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will not extend an April 2022 deadline to tighten fuel efficiency standards, in a potential setback for carmakers which are lobbying for more time, government and industry sources told Reuters.
The corporate average fuel efficiency (CAFE) requirements are designed to reduce carbon emissions from vehicles as India pushes auto manufacturers to invest in more fuel-efficient cars or in cleaner technologies like electric and hybrid.
""The deadline to meet CAFE norms will not be extended,"" a senior government official told Reuters, adding that some concessions could be considered if it sees serious intent by automakers to invest in clean technologies.
The push to delay the rules by two years is being led by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), a trade group that represents major carmakers in India including top sellers Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor Co. 
On March 2, executives from SIAM met India's transport ministry officials to discuss, among other things, a delay in implementation of the norms, three industry sources said.
India introduced the first phase of CAFE rules in April 2017, giving carmakers until the end of March next year to cut carbon emissions from new passenger cars to under 130 grams per kilometer. 
In a second phase starting from April 1, 2022, India has proposed tightening carbon emissions to 113 grams per kilometer.
Carmakers have argued that they would find it difficult to make further investments to meet the stricter requirements, especially as profits have been hit by slumping sales over the last two years, three industry sources said.
An economic slowdown in 2019 and the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 caused annual passenger vehicle sales to fall by around 30% over the period.
Sticking to the deadline, however, would allow India to cut its fuel import bill and curb pollution. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set aggressive carbon reduction targets under the Paris Accord and not extending the deadline to tighten the CAFE requirements could be part of this agenda, one industry source said.

""There eventually might be a middle path that does not hurt the companies financially but also allows the government to maintain its aggressive attitude towards carbon reduction,"" the source said.

By Carolina Mandl and Tatiana Bautzer
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Less than a month ago,  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA had nearly 65% of its staff back at their offices, in contrast to Brazil's two largest lenders, who were keeping almost all of their employees working from home.
Now, under pressure from workers and health authorities wrestling to contain the country's worsening pandemic, the Brazilian unit of Spain's Banco Santander SA (NYSE:SAN) is telling more employees to stay home.
""There are no hospital beds left, so banks are sending workers back home"" said Ivone Silva, head of the bank workers' union in the Sao Paulo region. ""After a lot of pressure, Santander reduced the number of employees in their offices to about 30%."" 
On Wednesday, Santander said in a statement to the union it will further reduce the size of the teams working at its Brazil headquarters, but did not disclose by how much.
Santander Brasil declined to comment on Silva's assertion that the move was taken under pressure.
In Spain, a third wave of the pandemic also forced headquarters to send workers home again, reducing office staff to 30-40% in January and February from 50-60% in December. Staffing has since returned to December levels, a spokesman said.
Santander Brasil's retreat is the latest sign of a tension between Brazilian companies' eagerness to re-open offices and the growing risk of contagion as the country's COVID-19 crisis worsens. 
In another case, Banco BTG Pactual SA, Latin America's largest independent investment bank, in recent weeks retreated from an effort to return 30% of staff to its Sao Paulo headquarters, reducing that to just 10%, Mateus Carneiro, BTG partner and head of Human Resources, told Reuters. 
Even with health protocols in place at the office, remote work is ""unavoidable"" at the moment, Carneiro said, citing high infection rates and the overwhelmed Brazilian health system.
Those working at the office are tested twice a week, Carneiro said, and social distance from colleagues. 
""We expected to be in a different situation now, but now it's a safety issue,"" he said, adding that the bank hoped to have just 15% to 30% of its 3,800 employees working remotely in the longer term, as it considers physical presence important for mentoring young employees and investment banking activities. 
In a sign of broader sentiment against the idea of working from home, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who for months played down the pandemic, called ""unacceptable"" outgoing Petroleo Brasileiro SA Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco's practice of running the oil company remotely. 
""We still have some companies with a very controlling management style, that want their employees close by,"" said Tatiana Iwai, a professor specializing in work culture at the Insper business school, referring to mid-sized Brazilian companies.
Santander Brasil Chief Executive Sergio Rial has been an outspoken critic of working from home, saying it prevents dissemination of the company's culture. 
""I don't see this as a great revolution,"" he said on one conference call. ""It's no panacea, nor something transformative as you might imagine.""
Banks are among Brazil's largest employers and 450,000 people work for financial institutions in jobs ranging from tellers to traders and investment bankers.
Banco Bradesco SA and Itau Unibanco Holding SA have kept 94% and 97% of employees working from home. CEOs for the banks said earlier in March they had no estimate for a return to the office, but they are planning to adopt part-time remote work when the pandemic is over.
In Europe, HSBC, Lloyds (LON:LLOY), Nationwide Building Society and Santander UK have said they will slash office space and combine working from home with offices. 
At the same time, Santander and Itau in Brazil failed to follow a government suggestion that they open their branches less than five hours per day, the union said, adding that most banks cut their branches' working hours by one hour, but some slowly returned to longer hours.
In a note to clients on Wednesday, Santander said it would temporarily close some branches for the next two weeks to help curb the spread of the virus and cut working hours by one hour. Itau also said in an e-mail to Reuters that branches will close an hour earlier starting on Friday.

357,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2021 08:30AM ET</span>",Asda workers win key victory in equal pay dispute,"LONDON (Reuters) - Workers at Britain's Asda supermarkets won a key victory on Friday in a long-running dispute over equal pay, with the UK's top court ruling they can compare themselves to staff at the group's distribution centres.
Law firm Leigh Day is representing 44,000 current and former Asda shop floor workers in an equal pay claim against Britain's third largest supermarket group, in what is seen as a test case ahead of similar cases against the UK's other big supermarket groups.
Asda appealed to the Supreme Court against a Court of Appeal judgement in 2019 that lower-paid store staff, who are mostly women, could compare themselves with more highly paid distribution centre workers, who are mostly men, in pay claims.
That ruling followed defeats for Asda in the Employment Tribunal and Employment Appeals Tribunal. 
The Supreme Court's ruling on Friday only relates to the first part of the Asda workers' claim and a full legal process could last several years.
For overall victory the workers also need a ruling that the different jobs are of equal value. A third stage in the process would then consider if there are any factors other than gender why the roles should not be paid equally. 
""The Supreme Court’s dismissal of the appeal (by Asda) does not mean that the claimants’ claims for equal pay succeed,"" the Supreme Court said.
""At this stage all that has been determined is that they can use terms and conditions of employment enjoyed by the distribution employees as a valid comparison.""
The GMB union hailed a ""massive victory"" for workers but Asda said it would fight on.
""We remain confident in our case,"" Asda said in a statement.
It argues that retail and distribution are two different industry sectors and it pays workers the market rates for these sectors.
Britain's other big supermarket retailers face similar equal pay claims.
Leigh Day is representing 45,000 current and former shop floor staff at Britain's five biggest supermarket groups – market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's, Asda Morrisons and the Co-op - in equal pay cases. Most are from Asda.
The law firm's total estimate of the groups' potential liability is 8 billion pounds ($11 billion). Between them Britain's top four grocers employ nearly 800,000 workers.
Last month Mohsin and Zuber Issa and private equity company TDR Capital completed their purchase of a majority holding in Asda from U.S. giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT).
Asda declined to comment on who would be liable for any future payout in the workers' case.

PARIS (Reuters) - French investment bank Natixis will on Monday stand trial over accusations a statement about its financial strength it issued in 2007 on its sub-prime exposure was misleading. 
Natixis was one of the French banks hardest hit by the crisis in 2007 when the collapse of bonds backed by poor quality mortgages - dubbed sub-prime - spread through financial markets. 
Natixis eventually had to be rescued by its parent bank BPCE and was later restructured.
The trial, which will last until April 8, follows a complaint filed in 2009 by French shareholders association Adam on behalf of hundreds of retail investors, demanding investigations into Natixis' financial communication from 2006, when the bank was listed, until 2009. 
Prosecutors initially opened a probe over two statements Natixis released in July and November 2007 over its exposure to the subprime crisis. 
Magistrates dismissed bringing a case based on the earlier one, and in 2019 ordered a criminal trial over the November filing. 
The bank can be fined up to 7.5 million euros if convicted.
Natixis has denied any wrongdoing. It has said that the sub-prime crisis was unprecedented and that the bank had no way of anticipating the chain reaction of consequences it would unleash.
""Natixis considers it has provided the public, in all sincerity, all the information available on its exposure gradually as it was identifying the underlying risks"", the bank said in a statement in July 2019 after a magistrate ordered a trial.
The court can take several weeks or months before announcing a verdict.
Natixis' CEO at the time was Dominique Ferrero, who has since left the bank.

Financial watchdog AMF also looked into whether Natixis misled investors during the 2007 sub-prime crisis and decided not to bring any charges against the bank.

Investing.com – Shares of  BowX Acquisition  (NASDAQ:BOWX), a blank-check company that counts Shaquille O’Neal as an adviser, were up 3% in premarket trading Friday on news it has got a merger candidate -- WeWork.
The transaction values the shared-office space provider at $9 billion including debt, a far cry from 2017 when it was valued at $47 billion ahead of its IPO, which subsequently unraveled in spectacular fashion.  
The market disruptor had to call off its IPO as murky details of the state of affairs at the company emerged, many related to its co-founder, the talented but erratic Adam Neumann. He had to quit as its chairman and CEO.  
As the Softbank-promoted company struggled in the aftermath of a very public implosion, it went about shedding jobs, renegotiating rentals as well as closing office spaces to put its house back in order. Covid-19 gave that exercise more impetus as companies also looked to cut costs and go along with the work-from-home trend.
WeWork is a big player in the market for flexible office space. It signs long-term leases with landlords, renovates the spaces and then subleases small or entire offices and buildings for as little as a month at times.
Bow Capital Management, the SPAC’s sponsor, is run by Vivek Ranadivé, owner of the NBA’s Sacramento Kings and founder of Tibco Software.
A SPAC is a shell company that uses proceeds from an IPO to take private firms public. It is usually set up by high-profile people with relevant industry experience and that’s what gets it the valuation since as such it doesn’t have running operations at the time of going public."

The comments come as a number of overseas retailers face a public backlash from Chinese consumers who circulated statements from the brands on social media announcing they will cease sourcing from Xinjiang. BCI counts many of the brands in question, including H&M,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), and Adidas (OTC:ADDYY), as members.
""The BCI Shanghai representative office once again solemnly reiterates that the China project team strictly abides by BCI's audit principles,"" the trade body said in a statement. 
""Since 2012, the Xinjiang project site has performed second-party credibility audits and third-party verifications over the years, and has never found a single case related to incidents of forced labor."" 
The branch added it would remain in communication with its Chinese partners in Xinjiang.
Earlier this week, Chinese citizens launched a social media backlash against H&M by circulating a notice the company published last year stating it would cease sourcing cotton from Xinjiang. The backlash quickly extended to other overseas brands.
Human rights organisations have accused China of running forced labour camps for Uighur Muslims living in the western region. Beijing has repeatedly denied the accusations, calling the camps in question vocational training centres.

363,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2021 07:26AM ET</span>","China rare earths extend surge on worries over Myanmar supply, inspection threat","By Tom Daly
(Reuters) - Looming inspections and concerns over Myanmar supplies are adding fresh momentum to a rally in prices of the rare earth minerals used in industries from turbines to telecoms that are already at their highest in nearly a decade. 
A price index published by China's rare earths association shot up more than 40% from October last year to the end of January, and has climbed an additional 25% since, fuelled by the risks to supply.
These are unrest in neighbouring Myanmar following a Feb. 1 military coup and worries over environmental inspections planned in a key Chinese rare earths production hub.
While analysts say there have been no disruptions yet to supply from the southeast Asian nation, there are market concerns there could be in the wake of the coup.
Prices for ingredients of rare earth magnets, used in wind turbines and electric vehicles, have been on a tear since the fourth quarter of 2020.
The surge was driven by booming demand and concerns that dominant producer China would seek to limit rare earths exports and tighten control of a strategic industry.
The rally has extended into this year, with terbium oxide and dysprosium oxide, used as magnet inputs, gaining 36% and 58% each, to touch levels this month unseen since 2012, Asian Metal data shows.
Graphic: China rare earth prices hit multi-year highs on ramped up demand, Myanmar supply disruption - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/nmoparoakva/ChinarareEarthPrices.png
""The current magnet rare earth price levels in China have baked in a high probability that Myanmar supplies could be disrupted,"" said Ryan Castilloux, managing director of consultancy Adamas Intelligence. 
But this has not happened yet, he added.
""So far our sources in China confirm this has not been the case."" 
About half of China's feedstock of heavy rare earths comes from Myanmar, and the coup unleashed fears of a supply cutoff even though the mines are in northern areas controlled by autonomous militias that face no clear threat. 
Graphic: China's 2020 rare earth imports by country - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/ygdvzeqrrpw/myanmar.png
Television images of attacks on Chinese businesses by protesters in Myanmar who believe Beijing backed the coup have done little to ease concerns, however.
While China's rare earth imports held firm in January and February, a March 21 report in the state-backed Global Times newspaper said material could not be shipped, but did not delve into the problem further. 
The Myanmar volumes go to state-run producers, mainly in southern Jiangxi province and its rare earth hub of Ganzhou, to be separated and processed so they can be used by magnet makers. 
Jiangxi-based China Minmetals Rare Earth Co and China Southern Rare Earth Group Co declined to comment when asked about supply disruption, while Chinalco Rare Earth & Metals Co did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
INSPECTORS IN TOWN
Castilloux believes a new round of environmental inspections in Ganzhou, where authorities held a videoconference last week to schedule the Beijing-mandated audits, could play a bigger role in tightening supply, as they cause small plants to halt output.
Rare earth mining and smelting has a chequered environmental record in China, producing toxic waste that requires careful disposal. In 2012, China said it needed to spend 38 billion yuan ($5.8 billion) to repair the environmental damage in Ganzhou.
Graphic: China's half-year rare earth output quotas in tonnes - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/rlgpdexmbvo/quotas.JPG
Downstream, a source at a Chinese maker of auto parts based in eastern Zhejiang province told Reuters this week a shortage of rare earths supply was hitting the company's deliveries to multinational clients, though it does not rely on imports and attributed the squeeze to tighter domestic controls.
Chinese makers of electric vehicle batteries Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) and BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF) Ltd said they were not aware of any impact on production from tighter supply, when asked about Myanmar disruption.
There is no significant shortage of feedstock from Myanmar now, but any stoppage would be ""pretty catastrophic"" for China, said David Merriman, a manager at consultancy Roskill.
In that case, the restart of mines in southern China closed for environmental reasons would be the only short-term feasible option to fill the gap, despite dealing a setback to Beijing's efforts to clean up the industry's image, he added.

364,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 26, 2021 07:18AM ET</span>",China EV Maker Nio Halts Production for 5 Days on Chips Shortage,"(Bloomberg) -- Nio (NYSE:NIO)  will temporarily halt production at one of its factories in Anhui province because of the semiconductor shortage, becoming the first high-profile Chinese carmaker to succumb to a chip snarl that’s silenced the factory lines of auto manufacturers globally.
Nio’s JAC-NIO plant in the central provincial capital of Hefei will cease operations for five working days starting from March 29, the company said in a statement Friday.
“The overall supply constraint of semiconductors has impacted the company’s production volume in March,” Shanghai-based Nio said. “The company expects to deliver approximately 19,500 vehicles in the first quarter, adjusted from previously released outlook of 20,000 to 20,500 vehicles.”
Automakers the world over have expanded and extended production cuts that first began in late December to cope with a worsening global shortage of semiconductors. The coronavirus pandemic caused a surge in chip orders that are needed for smartphones, TVs and computers as people try to make extended life at home more bearable, leaving less capacity for a stronger-than-expected rebound in vehicle demand.
Weather, Fire
Recent weather-related disruptions of petrochemical supplies in the southern U.S. and a fire at a chipmaking plant in Japan have exacerbated the shutdowns.
Nio posted a wider-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter, a year after a government cash injection saved the company from bankruptcy. The U.S. listed company’s shares climbed more than 1,100% in 2020, pulled higher by excitement around the prospects for growth in China’s EV market, which is the world’s biggest.
The investor enthusiasm for electric cars comes as Nio, along with Chinese rivals Xpeng Inc. and Li Auto Inc. consider second listings in Hong Kong, according to people familiar with the matter. Nio’s shares were seen 0.6% lower in pre-market trade Friday.
As of January, Nio had delivered 82,866 electric cars in China since its first model came to market in June 2018. Its high-end sport-utility vehicles have proven a hit with wealthy consumers, helping to push Nio’s gross margin to 17.2% in the December quarter.
Chief Executive Officer William Li flagged at the release of the company’s latest results earlier this month that production capacity may be constrained by the global chip shortage.
While monthly capacity has risen to 10,000 units, production will remain at 7,500 “due to supply-chain limits, including the chip shortage,” he said on March 2. “Though we believe we are able to meet expected demand for the second-quarter, there’s indeed a higher risk.”

Wall Street closed higher Thursday, boosted by a late rally, with the S&P 500 ending up 0.6%, snapping a two-day losing streak, the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.1% higher, but had been down more than 1% intraday.
These late gains broke a recent trend of poor finishes, with the Dow and S&P 500 now potentially recording a positive week, meaning March could be the fourth strong month in five. The Nasdaq Composite is still 1.8% lower, heading for its first down month since October.
Bank stocks are likely to be in the spotlight Friday after the Federal Reserve announced late Thursday that these financial institutions can resume buybacks and raise dividends in the second half of the year, pending the results of stress tests in June
While these restrictions were originally meant to be lifted in the first quarter, even this delayed move will be received positively with investors gaining more clarity.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) stock rose 1.8% premarket, while shares in JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) both rose 0.9%.
Helping the tone has been expectations of a strengthening economic recovery, particularly on the back of large doses of fiscal and monetary stimuli and a successful vaccination program.
Weekly jobless claims fell to a one-year low and fourth-quarter GDP growth beat expectations on Thursday. Friday sees the release of personal income and spending figures for February as well as the final print of the University of Michigan reading for March.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) lifted its forecast for U.S. GDP growth in 2021 to 7.0% from 6.5%, citing its expectation for strong consumer spending on the back of the stimulus payments.

367,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2021 06:25AM ET</span>",Analysis: Money no object as governments race to build chip arsenals,"By Douglas Busvine and Mathieu Rosemain
(Reuters) - Governments around the world are subsidizing the construction of semiconductor factories as a chip shortage hobbles the auto and electronics industries and highlights the world's singular dependence on Taiwan for vital supplies.
But beyond a consensus that something must be done to diversify supplies, divisions over strategy are emerging along with concerns that free-spending governments could spur over-building in an industry that has historically been highly cyclical. 
Governments in the United States, the European Union and Japan are contemplating spending tens of billions of dollars on cutting-edge ""fabs,"" or chip fabrication plants, as unease grows that more than two-thirds of advanced computing chips are manufactured in Taiwan. Earlier this week, a top U.S. military commander told U.S. lawmakers that a Chinese takeover of the island was the military's foremost concern in the Pacific.
China has also offered a myriad of subsidies to the chip industry as it tries to reduce its dependence on Western technology, including setting up a $29 billion investment fund in 2019, helping feed arguments that Western governments need to step up.
The need for chip plants outside Asia has helped prompt Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd - the only two chip contract manufacturers capable of making the most advanced computing chips - to draw up plans for new factories in the United States and vie for what could be $30 billion or more in U.S. subsidies.
And  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), another of the ""Big Three"" which also makes cutting edge chips, dramatically changed the playing field on Tuesday when it disclosed plans to throw open its factory doors to outside customers and build a new factory in Europe in addition to two new ones in the United States.
The net result could be a government-backed restructuring of the semiconductor industry after decades in which American and European chip firms outsourced their manufacturing to Taiwan and Korea in the name of efficiency and delivering ever cheap computing power to billions of people.
""We're in a situation now where every country is going to want to build their own fab,"" Dan Hutcheson, chief executive officer of VLSI Research, told Reuters. ""We're going from this global interconnectedness to vertical silos everywhere.""
TENSIONS AND COMPLEXITIES
In Japan, Canon Inc, Tokyo Electron Ltd and Screen Semiconductor Electron will join a government funded 42 billion yen ($385 million) program that will work with firms such as TSMC to develop advanced 2-nanometer chips. Japan wants to ensure it is able to build advanced semiconductors in the future and aims to build a test line near Tokyo with help from TSMC.
Even India, with little chip manufacturing infrastructure, hopes to build on its strengths as a design center for global chip firms and lure factories with new subsidy programs.
Lawmakers in the United States, meanwhile, are preparing to authorize $30 billion or more for chip investments via an existing Pentagon funding bill and a clutch of new measures being championed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.
Local officials, as well as the companies, are already scrambling for the bounty. Intel this week committed to Arizona, which has a generous state tax-abatement program as well as an established chip-making ecosystem, and analysts expect it to be a big recipient of the federal funds.
TSMC has also agreed to build a $12 billion fab in Arizona, partly at the behest of the Trump Administration. Samsung (KS:005930), for its part, is negotiating a second factory in Austin, Texas.
The most complex tensions are in Europe, where EU officials are clashing with national governments over whether Europe should jump into the costly race for advanced computer chip factories - a policy promoted by powerful EU internal market chief Thierry Breton - or double down on its existing strategy of specializing in niche chips. That approach is favored by the German government and many companies.
Intel in its announcement this week indicated its interest in building in Europe, and became the first of the ""Big Three"" chipmakers to back an EU goal of doubling its share of high-end chip output to 20% over the next decade. 
""Europe dropped out of this race a long time ago and no longer has the necessary local know-how,"" said Helmut Gassel, head of strategy at German chipmaker Infineon (OTC:IFNNY), which has specialized in power chips and is the leading supplier to the car industry. 
At the same time, frustration is growing about slow progress of an existing EU project on microelectronics. German officials have said 50 companies - virtually all of them pursuing the niche chip strategy that has been successful in recent decades - have applied for funds from the program.
A resolution of the split could come by summer. Peter Altmaier, Germany's economy minister, and French counterpart, Bruno Le Maire, regularly discuss along with Breton the possibility of attracting a foreign semiconductor giant to improve Europe's advanced chip-making capacity, a senior official at France’s finance ministry said.
“Each time they see each other they talk about it. The goal is to have a decision by June,” the official said, adding that the cost of such a project could be as high as $20 billion.
THE BIG GAMBLE 
If the plans among world governments come to pass, the semiconductor industry could come to look much more like it did in the 1970s and 1980s, when each nation viewed chips as critical to their communications and defense.
But the risk, said VLSI's Hutcheson, is that the world builds too much chipmaking capacity, sending prices down and wiping out big swathes of the industry, similar to a crash in the 1980s that shuttered chip factories from Australia to South Africa.

""From a taxpayer perspective, it really begins to be this question of, do we really want to start another Cold War, where semiconductor fabs are the equivalent of nuclear weapons, where we're wasting all these resources?"" Hutcheson said.

368,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2021 06:15AM ET</span>","Chemicals giant BASF, spurred on by customers, allocates up to $4.7 billion for CO2 cuts","By Ludwig Burger and Patricia Weiss
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BASF, the world's largest chemicals producer by sales, pledged on Friday to spend up to 4 billion euros ($4.7 billion) to slash greenhouse gas emissions by a quarter by 2030.
Chief Executive Martin Brudermueller said BASF faced growing pressure from carmakers and other big customers to cut emissions and the spending plan included a goal to become carbon neutral by 2050.
The results would give the German company a competitive edge, Brudermueller said, but the emissions goal also posed a challenge, given the group's unchanged commercial ambitions to grow faster than the market. 
The new goal to cut CO2 relative to 2018 levels replaces a commitment Brudermueller made in 2018, shortly after taking office, to keep emissions constant until 2030 despite output growth. BASF had previously not publicly assigned an investment budget to those efforts.
The plan to be net-zero by 2050 draws BASF level with promises made over the last two years by rivals such as Dow Inc and DuPont (NYSE:DD), who aligned themselves with a key pillar of the 2015 Paris climate accord.
Brudermueller told Reuters he was initially hesitant about the 2050 goal. ""I'm really not that interested in the last few steps of the way but much more in the first steps... Our focus is on what we do by 2030."" 
But recent technology advances and pressure from industrial customers such as auto makers or consumer goods giants have tipped the balance, he said.
""I'm receiving letter after letter from our customers, saying by this or that deadline we need your products to be CO2-neutral... Market pressure is building and investor pressure along with that,"" Brudermueller said in an interview.
BASF makes catalytic converters, insulation foams, coatings, vitamins and engineering plastics, among other products.
The main thrust of the climate investments, up to 1 billion euros by 2025 and another 2 billion-3 billion by 2030, will be replacing fossil fuel with renewable electricity for the company's vast energy needs, which will likely inflate electricity consumption three to four times.
That compares with 3.1 billion euros that BASF spent on plants, equipment and other long-term assets overall in 2020 and 3.6 billion earmarked for this year, driven by the construction of a new chemical complex in China and as it seeks to become a major supplier of battery chemicals.
Brudermueller said climate change was the biggest challenge of the century but being able to offer CO2-free plastics and chemicals also gave a competitive edge, provided that consumers and society at large are prepared to pay a premium for that feature.
BASF's 2018 greenhouse gas emissions were 21.9 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents.
The CEO said he also needs lawmakers' support for the drive towards becoming carbon neutral, for instance urging Germany to end a scheme known as EEG that puts a surcharge on all electricity use, not just based on fossil fuel, to fund solar and wind power.
Brudermueller said the push was close to his heart but also existential for the group. ""Does this company find a way into a CO2-free future or not? If not, would you invest your money in it? Probably not.""

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's BASF is benefiting as people under lockdown fix up their homes but its CEO said the chemical maker may be left out of the party after the pandemic as consumers turn their spending to entertainment.
Lockdowns are spreading as a third wave of COVID-19 infections hits Europe and the Americas, even as vaccination campaigns take hold.
CEO Martin Brudermueller told Reuters that BASF, whose chemicals and plastics go into items including cars, furniture and construction materials, has benefited from purchasing activity amid lockdowns. 
""What's happening now is that consumers are purchasing quite a lot of things. They are redoing the house, buying furniture, a new kitchen, they get a paint job done, buy a home trainer. That creates a lot of demand for chemical products,"" he told Reuters.
But he said he believes that when lockdowns end, people will shift their spending to ""leisure activities like travel, restaurant visits and culture events"".
""We should anticipate that parts of the current demand has been brought forward and will get a little weaker in the second half. That is why we have a little question mark behind our outlook,"" Brudermueller told Reuters.
In January, BASF, the world's largest chemicals maker by sales, beat fourth-quarter earnings expectations.
But the group's profit growth outlook in February was slightly cautious. The maker of engineering plastics, coating additives, insulation foams and automotive catalytic converters forecast 2021 adjusted core earnings of 4.1-5.0 billion euros ($4.8-5.89 billion), up from 3.6 billion, but analysts had expected it to reach the upper end of that range.
BASF attributed its caution to uncertainty about virus mutations and the progress of global vaccination campaigns.

370,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2021 06:00AM ET</span>",Shares and bond yields rebound; dollar shows strength,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares and the dollar zig-zagged higher on Friday, as hopes for economic recovery and the week’s easing of global bond market yields helped lift the mood.
As the last full week of a hectic first quarter drew to a close, traders were still watching the world's most costly traffic jam build up in the Suez canal and the global COVID-19 case count rising again.
Asian stocks had clawed off a three-month low overnight as Chinese markets rebounded from their latest U.S. relationship worries while a near 3% jump in commodity stocks and weak euro put Europe on course for a fourth straight weekly rise. 
Euro zone bond yields edged up but benchmark German bonds were set for their best weekly performance in 3-1/2 months as the bloc's coronavirus woes supported its safe-haven assets. 
The euro's struggles are part of that too but the dollar bulls are on the charge again with the U.S. vaccine programme ramping up. The greenback's rise on Friday meant it had almost clawed back all its post-U.S. election fall. Emerging markets currencies have had their worst run of the year this week.
""We left 2020 with the validation of the consensus view the dollar would weaken,"" said the chief investment officer at Indosuez Wealth Management, Vincent Manuel. 
""We have woken up in 2021 facing the reality that the U.S. is growing much quicker than Europe... so we have a massive divergence"".
Weekly money flow data from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) showed global investors have been darting for safety amid this week's drama. They pumped $45.6 billion into cash funds, the largest since April 2020 when COVID-19 was spreading like wildfire. 
The end of the week news flow has been slightly more friendly though. 
U.S. Labor Department data on Thursday showed claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a one-year low last week, a sign that the U.S. economy is on the verge of stronger growth as the public health situation improves.
U.S. President Joe Biden's first formal news conference was a boost too as he said he would double his vaccination rollout plan after reaching the previous goal of 100 million shots 42 days ahead of schedule.
SUEZ STRIFE
Turkey's markets continued to settle after the lira's 9% slump triggered by President Tayyip Erdogan's latest central bank chief sacking. 
Bluechip Chinese stocks rebounded more than 2% too after a three-day losing streak, which, like emerging market shares generally, had left them at the lowest level of the year.
""All the sanctions (on China) so far have been largely symbolic and should have little economic impact. But the Sino-U.S. confrontation is affecting market sentiment. It could take some time for them to come to any compromise,"" said Yasutada Suzuki, head of emerging market investment at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Bank.
The dollar also rose to a new nine-month high on the Japanese yen of 109.44 yen. The euro licked its wounds at $1.1794 after falling to a four-month low on Thursday.
The ongoing efforts to dislodge a beached tanker in the Suez canal saw oil prices rebound a tad from a 4% drop on Thursday, though they are on course for their third straight week of losses on worries about further reduction in demand. 
In addition to Europe, major developing economies such as Brazil and India are also struggling with a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.
Brent was at $62.62, up 1.08%, U.S. crude was last up 1.33% at $59.35 per barrel, gold was flat and copper, though more than 1% higher on the day, was still in its $8,600 - $9,200 a tonne recent range. 

Reeling from the blockage in the Suez, shipping rates for oil product tankers have nearly doubled this week, and several vessels were diverted away from the vital waterway.

Germany's biggest bank is one of the few major banks in the world to assign day-to-day oversight of investment banking to its chief executive. At most banks, other board members oversee the division.
The person, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Sewing never intended to permanently keep this role that he had added to his duties in a management overhaul in 2019.
Deutsche Bank and its regulators, the European Central Bank and BaFin, declined to comment. 
Reuters reported in January that Sewing was under pressure from regulators to relinquish day-to-day oversight of the investment bank. Regulators are worried that Sewing has too much on his plate, potentially leaving the investment bank open to operational hazards. 
Handelsblatt reported earlier on Friday that there is movement on the topic of the Sewing's dual role. 

The investment bank is the German lender's main profit driver, but also represents a concentration of risk for a bank that is deemed ""systemically important"" in terms of the functioning of the global financial system.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.8% by 0810 GMT, hitting a one-week high. The benchmark was on course for its fourth straight weekly rise.
Mining and oil & gas stocks were the top gainers in Europe, up 2.1% and 1.8%, helped by higher commodity prices. 
UK-listed copper miner Kaz Minerals Plc rose 2.9% after it received a final bid worth 4.02 billion pounds ($5.53 billion) from Chairman-led Nova Resources.
Market sentiment, for most part of the week, was weighed down by worries about new lockdowns and a slow pace of vaccination in the euro zone, but optimism about a stimulus-driven recovery in the United States brightened the outlook for global growth. 

British insurer  Aviva  (LON:AV) was up 2.1% after it sold its Polish operations to Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG) for 2.5 billion euros ($2.94 billion) in cash. Allianz gained 1.3%.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening higher Friday, helped by late gains on Wall Street overnight, although the positive tone will be tempered by ongoing concerns over rising Covid-19 cases and the region’s slow vaccine rollout.
At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.7% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.8%.
U.S. stocks rose in a late-day rally on Thursday, with the S&P 500 closing up 0.6%, snapping a two-day losing streak, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite ended up 0.1%, but had been down more than 1% intraday.
Asia largely followed this positive lead, and European equity markets look set to end the week pointing higher.
However, the region's third wave of Covid-19 cases still shows few signs of easing: while Italy and Czechia have flattened their infection curves, cases continue to rise in Germany, the Benelux, Austria and, most alarmingly, France. Poland also registered a new record high for cases on Thursday. 
A virtual meeting between EU leaders to discuss the issue continues later Friday, having started on Thursday in a fraught fashion after French President Emmanuel Macron expressed frustration over vaccine rollouts that are far behind those of Britain and the United States. 
The EU has already unveiled plans to tighten oversight of vaccine exports that would allow greater scope to block shipments to countries with higher inoculation rates.
Another reason for concern is the rising tension between the West and China, after the EU joined the U.S. and a number of Western countries this week in imposing sanctions on officials in China's Xinjiang region over allegations of human rights abuses.
Beijing has targeted a number of Western companies in retaliation.  Burberry  (LON:BRBY) became the first luxury brand assailed by the Chinese backlash earlier Friday, with its well known tartan design removed from a popular video game.
U.K. retail sales fell by 3.7% on the year in February, slightly improvement from the 5.9% drop the previous month, but still indicative of a difficult situation with a lot of the country locked down.
Oil prices rebounded Friday amid worries that it may take weeks to free the container ship stuck in the Suez Canal, blocking supply through the key waterway for a prolonged period of time.
“The Suez Canal is a vital point for global trade, including energy markets. Around 10% of global seaborne oil trade passes through the canal, whilst around 8% of global LNG trade also uses the canal,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.9% higher at $59.67 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.7% to $62.98. However, both benchmarks are on course for a weekly loss of about 3%, with the fresh coronavirus lockdowns in Europe hitting the outlook for demand.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,725.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1776.

378,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2021 01:56AM ET</span>",Burberry becomes first luxury brand to suffer Chinese backlash over Xinjiang,"By Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - Burberry has lost a Chinese brand ambassador and its hallmark tartan design was scrubbed from a popular video game, becoming the first luxury brand assailed by the Chinese backlash to Western accusations of abuses in Xinjiang. 
China on Friday sanctioned organisations and individuals in the United Kingdom over what it called ""lies and disinformation"" about Xinjiang, days after Britain imposed sanctions for alleged human rights abuses in the western Chinese region.
Burberry is a member of the Better Cotton Initiative, a group that promotes sustainable cotton production which said in October it was suspending its approval of cotton sourced from Xinjiang, citing human rights concerns.
Award-winning Chinese actress Zhou Dongyu terminated her contract with Burberry as the brand's ambassador, as Burberry has not ""clearly and publicly stated its stance on cotton from Xinjiang,"" her agency said on Thursday.
The company's iconic plaid design was also removed from the clothing worn by characters in Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd's wildly popular video game ""Honor of Kings"", according to a post on the game's official Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) account, winning praise from China's netizens.
Burberry China did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Burberry cotton is sourced from the United States, Australia, Turkey, India and Egypt, according to its website. 
The backlash - particularly in social and traditional media - has also enveloped mass-market brands like H&M, Adidas AG (DE:ADSGN) and  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) which have previously expressed critical views on labour conditions in Xinjiang, China's biggest cotton-producing region.
Activists and U.N. rights experts have accused China of using mass detainment, torture, forced labour and sterilisations on Uighurs in Xinjiang. China denies these claims and says its actions in the region are necessary to counter extremism.
In a letter to British lawmakers in November, Burberry said it did not have any operations in Xinjiang or work with any suppliers based there, adding that it did not condone any form of modern slavery among its suppliers, including forced, bonded or involuntary prison labour. 
The China National Textile and Apparel Council in a statement on Friday urged international brands to cease ""wrong behaviour"", including the exclusion of cotton from Xinjiang in their supply chain, out of respect for Chinese customers.
Hong Kong lawmaker Regina Ip said she would stop buying Burberry. 

""Burberry is one of my favorite brands. But I will stop buying Burberry products. I stand with my country in boycotting companies that spread lies about Xinjiang,"" Ip wrote on her Twitter account.

BEIJING/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Widely watched airfares in China are recovering to pre-pandemic levels as domestic tourists lead a patchy air travel recovery, scattering crumbs of hope to a shattered global travel sector. 
With international markets like Europe still in partial lockdown, the global tourism industry's attention is riveted on China's new travel patterns as it brings COVID-19 under control and lifts curbs on movement. The Chinese domestic market quietly overtook the once-dominant U.S. market in size during the pandemic, but multiple coronavirus outbreaks before last month's Lunar New Year halted the rebound and could lead to first-quarter losses. 
Now, with temporary testing and quarantine restrictions once again lifted, average prices for an economy seat during the April 3-5 Qingming festival, or tomb-sweeping holiday, have rebounded to 96% of 2019 levels, according to data from Ctrip. 
Economy-class airfares for trips over the Labour Day holiday in early May have risen 11% compared with 2019 levels, says Ctrip, run by online travel giant Trip.com Group Ltd. 
""It seems like demand has really caught up with capacity once again and airlines are deciding discounts are no longer needed to stimulate demand,"" said Luya You, transportation analyst at BOCOM International in Hong Kong. 
""I think the pent-up demand that everyone has been expecting is finally showing up in full force,"" said You, adding she expects yields and revenues to reach normal by the second half. 
Over the last year, Chinese domestic capacity had risen faster than demand, depressing airfares as carriers sought to fill as many seats as possible. A return to fare growth is seen as a final step in the recovery.
There are signs the United States, a close second in domestic capacity, is following a similar trajectory months behind China as vaccination rates rise, case numbers fall and airlines add more flights. 
Average round-trip U.S. domestic fares for May to August remain up to 20% lower than 2019 levels, but are up as much as 36% higher than 2020, online travel agent Hopper said.Europe, however, is bracing for a second lost summer in part because of a hobbled COVID-19 vaccine rollout and a heavy reliance on cross-border traffic.
When travel restrictions are lifted, the European market should expect a ""bloodbath"" with low-cost airlines like Ryanair and Wizz Air competing to offer the lowest possible fares, CAPA Centre for Aviation Chairman Emeritus Peter Harbison said this month.
STOCK GAINS
In China, the Lunar New Year holiday is usually the busiest time for local airlines. But this year's celebration was a wash-out for air travel, with capacity slashed and ticket prices plunging to five-year lows. Now, Chinese airlines are ramping up domestic capacity for the next few months, diverting aircraft from the largely closed international market. 
Chinese carriers are scheduled to operate 20.7% more domestic flights from April to October compared with 2019, according to flight master, a Chinese aviation data provider. 
China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) will overtake China Southern Airlines to operate the most domestic flights, while planned flights by Spring Airlines will surge by 62.25% from 2019 levels, the company said. 
Investors have noticed. Stock prices for the three biggest Chinese airlines have recouped pandemic-related losses.
But all airlines are facing new headwinds from rising oil prices - exacerbated this week by a shipping blockage in the Suez Canal - and concerns over COVID-19 restrictions in international markets.
Parash Jain, head of Asia Pacific transport research at HSBC, expects 2021 to be another loss-making year for the three biggest Chinese airlines and warns their shares already look like they have overshot.

""What we're seeing is the initial rebound in share prices has reflected the recovery in domestic market for now, with oil as a headwind, with foreign exchange no longer a tailwind and the rest of the world not favourable,"" he said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up Friday morning, as raised hopes for an economic recovery from COVID-19, boosted by a U.S. pledge to double its vaccine plan, helped to end the week on a high note.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.63% by 11:06 PM ET (3:06 AM GMT) as the Tokyo Core Consumer Price Index (CPI), released earlier in the day, slowed its annual pace of decline for a third consecutive month. The CPI fell 0.1% in March, a small drop that the 0.2% fall in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and above February's 0.3% drop.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.70% and in Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.44%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.92%.
China’s Shanghai Composite rose 1.18% and the Shenzhen Component rose 1.17%. U.S.-China tensions were on investors’ radars as U.S. President Joe Biden warned that China would not be the most powerful country on his watch during his first news conference since taking office.
The World Bank’s East Asia and Pacific Economic Update also said that China is expected to lead the economic recovery of East Asian and Pacific economies from COVID-19 in 2021. The report predicts that China’s economy will expand by 8.1% in 2021, compared with 2.3% in 2020.
Global shares hovered near record highs as signs of economic recovery from COVID-19 continue to emerge.
In the U.S., weekly jobless claims fell to a one-year low of 684,000, down from the 781,000 claims filed during the previous week and the 730,000 claims in forecasts prepared by Investing.com. Further data on personal spending in February is due later in the day.
Biden also doubled the U.S. vaccination rollout plan, after reaching the previously set goal of 100 million shots more than a month ahead of schedule.
Meanwhile, ten-year U.S. Treasury yields saw small gains after a muted auction of seven-year notes on Thursday.
“The markets are stuck in a lull where they are still taking some direction from the move in interest rates... at this point, we’re trying to get some more news globally that will be the next catalyst,” Verdence Capital Advisors director of portfolio strategy Megan Horneman told Bloomberg.
Investors will also continue to keep a wary eye on the dollar, which edged down on Friday morning but was near four-month highs.
“The dollar is absolutely critical... if the dollar starts rallying, that becomes a problem. It means commodity weakness and emerging-market weakness and it starts to provide a disinflationary countervailing narrative,” Aberdeen Standard Investments investment director James Athey told Reuters."
382,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2021 10:10PM ET</span>",New wave of ‘hacktivism’ adds twist to cybersecurity woes,"By Joseph Menn
(Reuters) - At a time when U.S. agencies and thousands of companies are fighting off major hacking campaigns originating in Russia and China, a different kind of cyber threat is re-emerging: activist hackers looking to make a political point.
Three major hacks show the power of this new wave of ""hacktivism"" - the exposure of AI-driven video surveillance being conducted by the startup Verkada, a collection of Jan. 6 riot videos from the right-wing social network Parler, and disclosure of the Myanmar military junta's high-tech surveillance apparatus. 
And the U.S. government’s response shows that officials regard the return of hacktivism with alarm. An indictment last week accused 21-year-old Tillie Kottmann, a Swiss hacker who took credit for the Verkada breach, of a broad conspiracy.
""Wrapping oneself in an allegedly altruistic motive does not remove the criminal stench from such intrusion, theft and fraud,"" Seattle-based Acting U.S. Attorney Tessa Gorman said.
According to a U.S. counter-intelligence strategy released a year ago, ""ideologically motivated entities such as hacktivists, leaktivists, and public disclosure organizations,"" are now viewed as ""significant threats,"" alongside five countries, three terrorist groups, and ""transnational criminal organizations.""
Earlier waves of hacktivism, notably by the amorphous collective known as Anonymous in the early 2010s, largely faded away under law enforcement pressure. But now a new generation of youthful hackers, many angry about how the cybersecurity world operates and upset about the role of tech companies in spreading propaganda, are joining the fray.
And some former Anonymous members are returning to the field, including Aubrey Cottle, who helped revive the group’s Twitter presence last year in support of the Black Lives Matter protests.
Anonymous followers drew attention for disrupting an app that the Dallas police department was using to field complaints about protesters by flooding it with nonsense traffic. They also wrested control of Twitter hashtags promoted by police supporters.
""What’s interesting about the current wave of the Parler archive and Gab hack and leak is that the hacktivism is supporting antiracist politics or antifascism politics,” said Gabriella Coleman, an anthropologist at McGill University, Montreal, who wrote a book on Anonymous.
Gab, a social network favored by white nationalists and other right-wing extremists, has also been hurt by the hacktivist campaign and had to shut down for brief periods after breaches.
DISRUPTING QANON
Most recently, Cottle has been focused on QAnon and hate groups.
""QAnon trying to adopt Anonymous and merge itself into Anonymous proper, that was the straw that broke the camel’s back,"" said Cottle, who has held a number of web development and engineering jobs, including a stint at Ericsson (BS:ERICAs).
He found email data showing that people in charge of the 8kun image board, where the persona known as Q posted, were in steady contact with major promoters of QAnon conspiracies https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2021/01/07/exposed-email-logs-show-8kun-owner-in-contact-with-qanon-influencers-and-enthusiasts.
The new-wave hacktivists also have a preferred place for putting materials they want to make public - Distributed Denial of Secrets, a transparency site that took up the mantle of WikiLeaks with less geopolitical bias. The site’s collective is led by Emma Best, an American known for filing prolific freedom of information requests.
Best’s two-year-old site coordinating access by researchers and media to a hoard of posts taken from Gab by unidentified hackers. In an essay this week, Best praised Kottmann and said leaks would keep coming, not just from hacktivists but insiders and the ransomware operators who publish files when companies don’t pay them off.
""Indictments like Tillie's show just how scared the government is, and just how many corporations consider embarrassment a greater threat than insecurity,"" Best wrote https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/hacktivism-leaktivism-and-the-future. 
The events covered by the Kottmann indictment https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/press-release/file/1377536/download?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery took place from November 2019 through January 2021. The core allegation is that the Lucerne software developer and associates broke into a number of companies, removed computer code and published it. The indictment also said Kottmann spoke to the media about poor security practices by the victims and stood to profit, if only by selling shirts saying things like “venture anticapitalist” and “catgirl hacker.”
But it was only after Kottmann publicly took credit for breaching Verkada and posted alarming videos from inside big companies, medical facilities and a jail that Swiss authorities raided their home at the behest of the U.S. government. Kottmann uses non-binary pronouns.
""This move by the U.S. government is clearly not only an attempt to disrupt the freedom of information, but also primarily to intimidate and silence this newly emerging wave of hacktivists and leaktivists,"" Kottmann said in an interview with Reuters.
Kottmann and their lawyer declined to discuss the U.S. charges of wire fraud for some of Kottmann's online statements, aggravated identity theft for using employee credentials, and conspiracy, which together are enough for a lengthy prison sentence.
The FBI declined an interview request. If it seeks extradition, the Swiss would determine whether Kottmann’s purported actions would have violated that country’s laws.
DISDAIN
Kottmann was open about their disdain for the law and corporate powers-that-be. “Like many people, I’ve always been opposed to intellectual property as a concept and specifically how it’s used to limit our understanding of the systems that run our daily lives,” Kottmann said. 
A European friend of Kottmann’s known as ""donk_enby,"" a reference to being non-binary in gender, is another major figure in the hacktivism revival. Donk grew angry about conspiracy theories spread by QAnon followers on the social media app Parler that drove protests against COVID-19 health measures.
Following a Cottle post about a leak from Parler in November, Donk dissected the iOS version of Parler’s app and found a poor design choice. Each post bore an assigned number, and she could use a program to keep adding 1 to that number and download every single post in sequence.
After the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riots, Donk shared links to the web addresses of a million Parler video posts and asked her Twitter followers to download them before rioters who recorded themselves inside the building deleted the evidence. The trove included not just footage but exact locations and timestamps, allowing members of Congress to catalogue the violence and the FBI to identify more suspects.
Popular with far-right figures, Parler has struggled to stay online after being dropped by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Donk's actions alarmed users who thought some videos would remain private, hindering the its attempt at a comeback.
In the meantime, protesters in Myanmar asked Donk for help, leading to file dumps that prompted Google to pull its blogging platform and email accounts https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2B20WD from leaders of the Feb. 1 coup. Donk's identification of numerous other military contractors helped fuel sanctions that continue to pile up.
One big change from the earlier era of hacktivisim is that hackers can now make money legally by reporting the security weaknesses they find to the companies involved, or taking jobs with cybersecurity firms.
But some view so-called bug bounty programs, and the hiring of hackers to break into systems to find weaknesses, as mechanisms for protecting companies who should be exposed.

""We're not going to hack and help secure anyone we think is doing something extremely unethical,"" said John Jackson, an American researcher who works with Cottle on above-ground projects. ""We're not going to hack surveillance companies and help them secure their infrastructure."" (This story corrects spelling to Kottmann from Hottmann, paragraphs 3, 16, 18-25)

SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A planned Biden administration executive order will require many software vendors to notify their federal government customers when the companies have a cybersecurity breach, according to a draft seen by Reuters.
A National Security Council spokeswoman said no decision has been made on the final content of the executive order. The order could be released as early as next week. 
The SolarWinds Corp hack, which came to light in December, showed “the federal government needs to be able to investigate and remediate threats to the services it provides the American people early and quickly. Simply put, you can’t fix what you don’t know about,"" the spokeswoman said.
In the SolarWinds case, hackers suspected of working for the Russian government infiltrated its network management software and added code that allowed the hackers to spy on end users. 
The hackers penetrated nine federal agencies and 100 companies, including  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other major tech companies. 
The proposed order would adopt measures long sought by security experts, including requiring multi-factor authentication and encryption of data inside federal agencies.
The order would impose additional rules on programs deemed critical, such as requiring a ""software bill of materials"" that spells out what is inside. An increasing amount of software activates other programs, expanding the risk of hidden vulnerabilities.
The notification requirement will have the most immediate impact. The rule aims to override non-disclosure agreements, which vendors have said limited information sharing, and allow officials to view more intrusions.
The order also would compel vendors to preserve more digital records and work with the FBI and the Homeland Security Department's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA, when responding to incidents. 
In practice, the changes will occur through updates to federal acquisition rules. Major software companies that sell to the government, like Microsoft and SalesForce, will be affected by the change, said people familiar with the plans.
In the past, Congress has tried to establish a national data breach notification law but has failed because of industry resistance. Such a bill would have obligated companies that experience hacks to disclose them publicly through government agencies.
If finalized in close to the draft form, the executive order would partially achieve the broad disclosure goal. A new law on public disclosure may also be introduced.

The draft order would also create a cybersecurity incident response board, with representatives from federal agencies and cybersecurity companies. The forum would encourage vendors and victims to share information, perhaps with a combination of incentives and liability protections.

385,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2021 07:55PM ET</span>",Judge questions police witness’s refusal to testify in Huawei CFO extradition case,"By Sarah Berman and Moira Warburton
VANCOUVER (Reuters) - The Canadian judge overseeing Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's extradition case questioned a federal prosecutor on Thursday about why a retired police officer, considered a key witness by the defense, had declined to testify.
The exchange came as prosecutors defended the refusal of Ben Chang, a former Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer, to take the stand. Chang is accused by the defense of improperly sharing identifying details about Meng's electronic devices with U.S. authorities.
Chang has denied the allegation in an affidavit submitted to courts.
Meng's lawyers asked British Columbia Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes on Monday for Chang's testimony to be taken with adverse inference, meaning the court would accept that if Chang was subjected to cross-examination, evidence unfavorable to him and the prosecution would emerge.
Meng, 49, was arrested in December 2018 at Vancouver International Airport on a warrant from the United States, charging her with bank fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC about Huawei's business dealings in Iran and potentially causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions.
She has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition to the United States from house arrest in Vancouver.
Meng's legal team wants the extradition request to be dismissed, arguing abuses of process occurred before and after her arrest. Federal prosecutors have pushed back, arguing that authorities were doing their jobs under difficult circumstances, and that the defense's story is ""based on speculation.""
On Thursday, federal prosecutor John Gibb-Carsley urged Holmes to apply ordinary logic and experience in assessing the truthfulness of a sworn statement submitted by Chang in October 2019, rather than adverse inference.
Holmes said it was ""difficult to work with the idea that I should apply ordinary logic and experience"" when she had no information about the context of Chang's actions, due to his refusal to submit to questioning.
She also suggested that Chang's refusal to testify was not ordinary.
""The known facts include that he was a senior police officer,"" she said. ""Generally, retired police officers testify.""
Court documents show that prosecutors initially declined to release notes relating to Chang's affidavit due to ""witness safety"" concerns.

Prosecutors are expected to continue their arguments through Friday. Meng's case is set to wrap up in May.

Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Kenneth Salinger did not rule on whether or not drivers are misclassified, but his decision allows Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey to pursue her claims against Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and Lyft Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) in court.
""(T)he allegations in the complaint plausibly suggest that Uber and Lyft misclassify their drivers and, as a result, deprive some drivers of required minimum wages, overtime, and sick leave,"" Salinger wrote in his decision.
Uber and Lyft deny that their drivers are misclassified, saying the vast majority enjoy the flexibility that comes with on-demand work. The companies argue that flexibility would disappear if they were forced to reclassify drivers as employees. 
The companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday's ruling.
Healey in a statement called the decision a ""major victory in our ongoing fight to support and protect Uber and Lyft drivers from unfair and exploitative practices."" 
The lawsuit is the latest in a line of challenges over the rights of gig workers, most of whom have few legal rights and benefits. It follows a heated battle in California, where voters last year cemented app-based workers' contractor status in a ballot measure sponsored by Uber, Lyft and other gig economy companies.

The Massachusetts lawsuit, filed in July, is asking for a court order declaring that ride-hail drivers are employees.

(Reuters) - Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted his frustration with U.S. lawmakers' questions on the social media platform during a hearing about misinformation on Thursday, leading one member of congress to call out his multi-tasking. ( https://twitter.com/jack/status/1375152199433527296?s=20)
Lawmakers grilled Dorsey and the CEOs of Facebook and Google's parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for almost five hours. Tensions were high as they asked them to answer ""yes or no"" to questions ranging from whether their platforms bore any responsibility for the Jan. 6 riot to whether they understood the difference between the two words. 
During the hearing, Dorsey tweeted ""?"" with a poll asking  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) users to vote ""yes"" or ""no."" Democratic Representative Kathleen Rice asked: ""Mr. Dorsey, what is winning, yes or no, on your Twitter account poll?""
Dorsey told her that ""yes"" was winning, to which she replied: ""Your multi-tasking skills are quite impressive.""
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet Inc CEO Sundar Pichai were also witnesses at the joint hearing by two subcommittees of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Lawmakers from both parties tried throughout the hearing to pin down the tech CEOs with questions needing only ""yes"" or ""no"" answers, interrupting them when they tried to give longer ones. Lawmakers quizzed the executives over concerns from COVID-19 misinformation, harassment, hate speech and extremism. 

As the hearing took place, Dorsey also liked tweets criticizing aspects of the session, including asking why members of Congress were mispronouncing Pichai's name, and replied to a tweet confirming that he was barefoot during the call. His poll on Thursday afternoon had more than 71,000 votes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously ruled against Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co in a case in which the second-largest U.S. automaker had sought to bar two state courts from hearing product liability suits involving a pair of serious crashes.
Ford had appealed rulings by the top state courts in Montana and Minnesota that had allowed the litigation to proceed. The crashes occurred in those two states. Ford argued that the state courts should have jurisdiction only if its conduct in those states had given rise to the claims.
The automaker also contended that since it designed the vehicles in Michigan, manufactured them in Kentucky and Canada and originally sold them in other states that Montana and Minnesota courts should not decide the cases.
In an 8-0 ruling, the justices disagreed with Ford.
""We reject that argument. When a company like Ford serves a market for a product in a state and that product causes injury in the state to one of its residents, the state's courts may entertain the resulting suit,"" Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the court. 
Ford does substantial business in the two states, Kagan added, ""by every means imaginable - among them, billboards, TV and radio spots, print ads and direct mail - Ford urges Montanans and Minnesotans to buy its vehicles.""
One case involved a woman killed when the tread separated from a rear tire on a 1996 Explorer in Montana and the vehicle spun out and rolled into a ditch. The other involved a Minnesota passenger in a 1994 Crown Victoria who suffered serious brain damage when an air bag failed to deploy after the driver rear-ended a snowplow and landed in a ditch.

Ford said in a statement said the ""justices provided clarity about jurisdiction for certain types of product-liability cases - precision which is good for all parties, including companies across multiple industries whose interests were represented by briefs filed in support of our request.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose in a late-day rally on Thursday as investors bought stocks likely to do well in the recovery and picked up beaten-down Apple and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares in anticipation that the U.S. economy grows at its fastest pace in decades this year.
President Joe Biden cited as economic progress Labor Department data that showed a declining number of Americans claimed unemployment insurance, news investors shrugged off earlier as Wall Street traded lower most of the session.
The labor report on Thursday showed claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a one-year low last week, a sign that the U.S. economy is on the verge of stronger growth as the public health situation improves and temperatures rise. 
An end-of-quarter rebalancing of investment portfolios by institutional investors added to another mostly seesaw session in which the major Wall Street indexes rose and fell amid the ongoing rotation from growth into so-called value stocks.
Value stocks again outperformed growth stocks, rising 1.2% in the former compared with a 0.1% slide in the latter, even as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc led the rally. Tesla added 1.6% and Apple 0.4%. 
""It's a very confused stock market, there isn't real leadership,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.
""One day cyclicals are in favor, the next day it's tech-plus is in favor,"" he said. ""But on the positive side, there isn't what I call aggressive selling.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 199.42 points, or 0.62%, to 32,619.48. The S&P 500 gained 20.38 points, or 0.52%, to 3,909.52 and the Nasdaq Composite added 15.79 points, or 0.12%, to 12,977.68.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.69 billion shares, compared with the 13.84 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 
Earlier, the Dow was higher while the Nasdaq fell, a reverse correlation that already has occurred far more this year than is typical in an entire year, said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at the Bahnsen Group in Newport Beach, California.
""Any reverse correlation between the Dow and Nasdaq is pretty embedded right now, and I expect it will continue,"" Bahnsen said. ""There is ongoing rotation out of tech, there's ongoing de-risking for some of the small caps.""
The Nasdaq Composite has fallen in March after four straight months of gains as rosy economic projections lifted demand for undervalued cyclical stocks, but also raised fears of higher inflation as seen in the jump in 10-year Treasury yields.
The rapid rise in the 10-year is not bearish but rather a bullish indicator, Bahnsen said.
The yield of the benchmark Treasury note rose to 1.6297%. 
""It is happening because we're vaccinating, it is happening as the economy reopens, it is happening because we're going to get a really big, high single-digit GDP number this year,"" he said. 
The CBOE volatility index also seesawed, closing down at 19.84.

(Reuters) -GameStop and other so-called meme stocks surged on Thursday, as investors piled into the shares after a tumble in the previous session.
Shares in video-game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) closed up 52.7% at $183.75 with brisk trading volume after rising as high as $187.50 late in the session. 
The company's shares remained down 8.2% for the week so far following losses after a lackluster earnings report late Tuesday during which the company disclosed it was evaluating the possibility of a share sale. They are up 875% year-to-date, though still far from their record high of $483 reached in late January.
The company has benefited from a push by retail investors, often on online forums such as Reddit's popular WallStreetBets, to drive up prices of stocks they believe undervalued.
Investors have also been eyeing efforts by billionaire investor and Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) Inc co-founder Ryan Cohen, who is on GameStop's board, to transform the retailer into an e-commerce firm that can take on big-box store rivals such as  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. 
GameStop, which added three new directors including Cohen to its board in January as part of a settlement, said in its quarterly filing https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html on Tuesday it expects eight incumbent board members to retire at its 2021 annual meeting in June. The company said it has not yet determined who it would nominate to replace departing board members.
CFRA analyst Camilla Yanushevsky said some investors believe the plan for a board overhaul is a promising sign for GameStop's efforts to expand e-commerce.

395,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2021 05:05PM ET</span>",Ford idles F-150 truck plant through Sunday due to global chip shortage,"DETROIT (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it will idle production of its highly profitable F-150 pickup truck at a plant in Michigan through Sunday due to the global semiconductor chip shortage.
Ford and other automakers have stressed they are trying to protect production of its most profitable vehicles, but the loss of even some full-sized pickups shows the shortage has hit Ford where it least wants. 
Ford's Dearborn, Michigan, plant will be idled from Friday through Sunday, and resume work on Monday. A spokeswoman declined to say how much volume would be lost.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker previously said it would assemble its flagship F-150 truck without certain parts and hold them for a ""number of weeks"" until they can be completed and shipped.
Ford said the latest action is part of its prior forecast that the chip shortage could shave $1 billion to $2.5 billion off its 2021 profits.
The chip shortage came as North American auto plants were shut for two months during the COVID-19 pandemic last year and chip orders were canceled, and as demand surged from the consumer electronics industry as people worked from home and played video games. That has now left carmakers competing for chips.

Semiconductors are used extensively in cars, including to monitor engine performance, manage steering or automatic windows, and in sensors used in parking and entertainment systems.
On Wednesday, Ford said it would cut output this week of the Transit van at its Kansas City, Missouri, assembly plant due to the shortage. Production of the flagship F-150 pickup at the plant is not affected.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Part of the reason why U.S. stocks are struggling for a second straight week may be quarter- and month-end rebalancing by pension funds, which could also keep pressure on equities through the end of March next week. 
With the S&P 500 up nearly 2% for the month and more than 3% for the quarter while bond prices have struggled, pushing the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note to a 14-month high last week, many analysts expect money to shift into the fixed income segment. 
But as the benchmark S&P index has struggled of late while pressure on bond prices has eased, with the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury hitting a one-week low on Thursday,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analysts now expect U.S. pensions to move an additional $19 billion into fixed income for rebalancing, down from their initial estimate on March 18 of $28 billion. 
In a note on Wednesday,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) estimated combined selling of $32.6 billion in U.S. equities from pension funds that rebalance on a monthly or quarterly basis. Using the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond Fund ETF as a proxy, the firm anticipates about $45 billion to buy as funds boost their fixed-income exposure. 
But not all analysts expect rebalancing to cause a downdraft on stock performance. Marko Kolanovic, J.P. Morgan's chief global markets strategist believes recent trends in portfolio rebalancing have taken the bite out of the dreaded quarter-end rebalancing. These include tweaks to portfolios being more opportunistic rather than strictly at quarter-ends, and reallocations geared towards volatility levels rather than fixed target weights for particular asset classes.
""A lack of these flows, and broad anticipation of 'month/quarter-end' effect, could result in the market moving higher near term, all else equal,"" Kolanovic said.

Each of the firms cautioned the actual timing of the rebalancing can vary, and in some cases may have already begun.

400,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2021 04:30PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Robinhood aims to allow users to buy into IPOs - sources,"By David French and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) - Robinhood Markets Inc is building a platform to ""democratize"" initial public offerings (IPOs), including its own, that would allow users of its trading app to snap up shares alongside Wall Street funds, according to people familiar with the matter.
The move could further erode Wall Street's grip on stock market flotations. It would be easier to implement for Robinhood's own IPO, given how companies and their investment bankers tightly control allocations to investors in new listings.
Currently, Robinhood users and other amateur traders cannot buy into stock of a newly listed company until its shares start trading. Since shares often trade higher when they debut, big funds that get allocations in the IPO have an advantage. The average first-day trading pop on U.S. listings of businesses in 2020 was 36%, according to data provider Dealogic.
Robinhood plans to carve out a chunk of its shares on offer in its IPO for its 13 million users, and to use technology it is building to administer this part of the offering, the sources said.
While Robinhood's technology would be new, the concept of reserving shares for users is not. Deliveroo Holdings Plc, the Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc-backed food delivery firm that announced plans this month to list in London, is doing this, although a third-party provider is administering the process.
More novel are Robinhood's ambitions to let users directly buy into IPOs of other companies. It would need to negotiate agreements with companies and their brokerages and get the blessing of U.S. regulators, the sources said. Robinhood could have leverage in these negotiations by arguing it would be acting as a bridge between the IPO and a major pool of investor demand, the sources added.
It was not clear what kind of arrangements Robinhood would seek to put in place, and no certainty its ambition will come to fruition, said the sources, who requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Robinhood declined comment.
Providing access to IPOs could boost Robinhood's appeal with users, some of whom criticized it over restrictions it placed on trading of heavily shorted ""meme stocks"" such as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) following a Reddit-driven buying frenzy earlier this year. Robinhood said its clearinghouse forced it to place the curbs because it lacked sufficient capital to settle the trades.
The move could also boost Robinhood's valuation in its own IPO, as the offering would price in additional demand for the shares that would normally have come through only after the stock market debut.
On Tuesday, Robinhood announced it had confidentially filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its IPO. While the company has yet to disclose details, the offering could happen in coming weeks and value Robinhood at up to $50 billion, the sources said.
Robinhood's plans to let amateur traders buy into IPOs represent the latest attempt by Silicon Valley firms to disrupt the traditional IPO. A number of companies, including Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) and Palantir Technologies Inc, have listed directly without using investment bankers.
The move would antagonize Wall Street, which is accustomed to getting big allocations in IPOs. Fund giants such as BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) have argued they are better owners of companies than day-traders, because they stick with companies for the long run.
The Menlo Park, California-based company was founded in 2013 by Baiju Bhatt and Vladimir Tenev with the aim of ""democratizing finance"", by giving people access to markets normally dominated by professional investors.

Backed by investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Ribbit Capital and 9Yards Capital, its platform allows users to make unlimited commission-free trades in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options and cryptocurrencies.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 snapped a two-day losing streak Thursday as tech found its footing following a recent drumming that some on Wall Street say pressured stocks to oversold levels that may be too attractive too ignore.  
The S&P 500 was up 0.55%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.62%, or 199 points, the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.12%, but had been down more than 1% intraday.
""We believe the action today may be pushing stocks into moderately oversold territory on a short-term basis once again,"" Janney Montgomery Scott said. ""[W]e are on guard for some choppy action ahead with the likelihood of a trading rally materializing soon.""
The dip buying in tech comes even as leaders of megacap tech including Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) are under scrutiny on Capitol Hill.
Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), meanwhile, also appears to be one of those stocks that could be flashing attractive valuations after Ark Investor's Cathie Wood snapped up positions in the stock following a more than 5% slump a day earlier.
Still, rising U.S. bond yields, the overarching headwind for growth, kept a lid on tech as a weaker-than-expected seven-year Treasury auction continued to suggest investors are betting on rates going higher.
The backdrop of rising rates continued to offer support to bank stocks, with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),.  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) the standout performers.

Investing.com -- Markets closed higher, strengthening after an early dip as investors went bargain-hunting. Choppiness, however, is likely to continue.  
Tech was responsible for much of the bounce, while lower oil prices dragged down energy stocks. Oil ended lower 4% as European Covid worries continue.
President Joe Biden said in his first press conference that he's doubling his target to have 200 million vaccinations within his first 100 days. He also said he'd run for reelection in 2024. Already, people?
The heads of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were on the hot seat in Congress answering angry lawmakers. Social media has been widely blamed for amplifying calls to violence and spreading misinformation that contributed to the Jan. 6 coup attempt in D.C., Reuters said.
In good economic news, jobless claims fell more than expected and fourth-quarter GDP beat economists' estimates.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Personal habits
Personal income and spending for February are due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), and economists are expecting a drop in both. That's what happens in the month between payouts of the $600 stimulus checks in January and the $1,400 one on its way. Look for a 7% decline in spending and a 0.2% drop in consumption.
2. Feeling Sentimental
The final print of the University of Michigan sentiment reading for March is expected to tick up in light of the aforementioned stimulus checks and the passage of the larger federal aid package. The quicker pace of vaccinations throughout the country should also contribute to the expected 83.6 reading, up from 83.
3. March madness?
No not that March Madness. Will stocks close out the week on a high note, or turn in another down week? It all depends on how Friday plays out. The S&P 500 finished last week down 0.8% after back-to-back positive weekly performances to start the month. Right now it's little changed through Thursday. It's a slightly different story over on the Nasdaq, which has bounced from negative to positive to negative in March. It will need a big day tomorrow, as it's down a little over 1.5% on the week."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of Democratic U.S. lawmakers presented legislation Thursday whch will set new maximum levels of toxic heavy metals in baby food and require manufacturers to comply within one year.
The bill will be formally introduced Friday.
The Baby Food Safety Act of 2021 would set maximum levels of inorganic arsenic, lead, cadmium and mercury in baby food and cereal that manufacturers would have to meet within one year.
The bill requires levels to be lowered further within two years through U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance, and three years through regulation. It mandates manufacturers test final products – not just ingredients – for toxic heavy metals and post results online.
Representatives Raja Krishnamoorthi and Tony Cárdenas and Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tammy Duckworth will introduce it.
""For too long, industry has been allowed to self-regulate baby food safety, and the results have been appalling and extremely harmful to our kids,"" Krishnamoorthi said.
Earlier this month, the FDA said it would boost sampling of baby foods and increase inspections after Krishnamoorthi's House oversight subcommittee released a report finding ""dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals"" in some baby foods.
The FDA, which did not comment Thursday, has not committed to issuing new regulations, said earlier it was moving ahead with a ""plan aimed at reducing toxic elements in foods for babies and young children to levels as low as is reasonably achievable.""
The FDA has declared the heavy metals dangerous, particularly to infants and children. The FDA in August finalized guidance to industry, setting an action level of 100 parts per billion inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal.
The bill would limit inorganic arsenic to no more than 15 parts per billion for cereal. 
FDA said testing shows ""children are not at an immediate health risk from exposure to toxic elements in foods"" and noted toxic elements are present in the environment and can enter the food supply through soil, water or air. 

Baby food companies say they are working to reduce levels of metals that occur naturally in food products.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on Thursday he was unaware of any support by the Biden administration to ban gas-powered vehicles after 2035 as California aims to do.
Asked by a lawmaker at a U.S. House hearing if the Biden administration supported California's plan to ban the sale of new gas-powered passenger cars and trucks in 2035, Buttigieg said he had ""not heard of anything to that effect at the national or federal level.""
He did note that automakers like General Motors (NYSE:GM) have set a goal of ending gas-powered passenger vehicle sales by 2035. ""I've not heard of that in a mandatory context but that certainly seems to be where the U.S. auto industry is headed.""
During the 2020 campaign, Biden declined to endorse California's plan.
This week, a growing number of Democratic lawmakers have called on President Biden to endorse banning gas-powered vehicles by a specific date.
On Wednesday, a group of more than 70 U.S. House Democrats led by Representative Doris Matsui urged Biden to set tough emissions rules to ensure that 60% of new passenger cars and trucks sold are zero-emission by 2030, while 10 U.S. senators led by Democrat Edward Markey urged Biden ""to set a date by which new sales of fossil fuel vehicles will end entirely.""
Markey's letter, which was also signed by Senators Richard Durbin, Sheldon Whitehouse, Elizabeth Warren, Jeff Merkley and others, said it is essential ""to ensure that we are on a trajectory to achieve the near-zero emission fleet that scientists have called for by 2050."" 
The House letter urged Biden to adopt ""ambitious post-2026 standards that put us on the path to having all light-duty vehicles be zero-emission by 2035.""

On Monday, California's two senators Alex Padilla and Dianne Feinstein also urged Biden to set a date to end gas-powered vehicle sales.

GameStop (NYSE:GME), the most favorite of the Reddit gang, and Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS) were up over 40% each while their partner in the party, AMC (NYSE:AMC), rose 22%.
Meme stocks have a cult following of their own and it all started January when a gang of Reddit followers, WallStreetBets, came together online to teach the biggies a lesson, all of whom were short on the video game retailer.
The coming together of the retail traders led to a short-squeeze and burned a hedge fund or two. But since then, the picture has gotten so murky that none knows who is the winner and who the loser. But the wild party continues, ignoring all fundamentals, be it disappointing results in case of GameStop or delayed movie releases that would hurt AMC.
Tuesday, GameStop reported earnings that came below expectations. It reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $1.34 on revenue of $2.12 billion compared with consensus estimates for EPS of $1.35 on revenue of $2.21 billion.
Wedbush analysts downgraded the stock to underperform from neutral after the quarterly results, saying the short squeeze has boosted the share price to levels that are completely disconnected from the fundamentals of business.

The company has more than 80 undelivered Dreamliners in storage and factories, Bloomberg said.
Shares of Boeing tumbled in 2020 amid the pandemic lockdowns. Airlines canceled orders for new aircraft and suspended flights as the world sat at home to largely unsuccessfully stem the spread of the coronavirus that has upended everything.
The first delivery could come as soon as Friday, Bloomberg said.  
“We continue to expect to resume delivering 787s by the end of March,” Boeing said in an emailed statement.
Boeing reported a massive loss of more than $15 a share for the quarter ended in December, compared to an expected loss of $1.64.

409,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2021 01:11PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Credit Suisse considers Greensill investor payout - sources,"By Oliver Hirt and John O'Donnell
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) is considering compensating investors hit by the collapse of funds linked to insolvent finance firm Greensill, four people familiar with the matter said, as the bank attempts a damage-limitation exercise.
Switzerland's second-largest bank this month closed around $10 billion of supply-chain finance funds that bought notes from Greensill. Of this, $3.1 billion has so far been repaid and more than $1.2 billion in cash remains in the funds, leaving more than $5 billion outstanding.
While Credit Suisse hopes more can be salvaged, the fact it is considering making investors in the funds good underscores concern that the debacle could see ultra-rich customers turn their back on it, three of the people said.
""Money is going to flow,"" one person with direct knowledge of the discussions within the bank told Reuters. ""Investors will get compensation. That's unavoidable. It's going to hurt."" 
The total cost has yet to be determined, but ""there is a proposal on the table to take over about 50% of the losses.""
One of the people said the compensation plans are also under discussion with Swiss financial supervisor FINMA, which is keen that Credit Suisse does not deplete its finances. 
Credit Suisse management are aware that leaving clients hanging during what is likely to be a long-winded recovery process will damage customer relations and could lead to withdrawals from the 1.5 trillion Swiss francs ($1.6 trillion) it manages.
""We do not comment on market speculation,"" a spokeswoman for the bank said on Thursday.
In its recent annual report, the bank said some investors had threatened to sue over Greensill and conceded that there was ""considerable uncertainty"" over the value of ""a significant part of the remaining assets"".
It also highlighted that it could ""suffer reputational harm ... that might cause client departures"".
The Greensill fund fiasco is the latest blow to Credit Suisse following a spying scandal last year that saw the departure of its then CEO, Tidjane Thiam. 
His successor, Thomas Gottstein, had been in the new role barely a year at the time of the collapse of Greensill, which lent money to firms by buying their invoices at a discount and later collecting the money. 
Greensill, which collapsed when it lost insurance underpinning these deals, repackaged the loans into bonds that Credit Suisse sold to clients, including pension funds and wealthy investors.
Credit Suisse, which made a 2.7 billion franc profit last year, has said it intends to continue a 1 billion franc share buyback this year.

Investing.com – Genesis Park Acquisition (NYSE:GNPK) shares rose 3% on Thursday following news that space infrastructure provider Redwire will merge with the special purpose acquisition company.
Genesis Park Acquisition raised $166 million through its November 2020 initial public offering.
Redwire provides space infrastructure technology and services. The combined company will retain the Redwire name and is expected to trade on the NYSE.
A SPAC is a blank-check shell company that uses proceeds from an IPO to take private firms public. It is usually set up by high profile people with relevant industry experience and that’s what gets it the valuation since as such it doesn’t have running operations at the time of going public.
The booming private space industry is projected to grow 4x by 2040, driven by lower launch costs and greater national security requirements.

(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) began testing their COVID-19 vaccine in children under 12, with hopes of expanding vaccination to that age range by early 2022, the U.S. drugmaker said on Thursday.
The first volunteers in the early-stage trial were given their first injections on Wednesday, Pfizer spokesperson Sharon Castillo said. 
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was authorized by U.S. regulators in late December for people age 16 and older. Nearly 66 million doses of the vaccine had been administered in the United States as of Wednesday morning, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The pediatric trial, which will include children as young as 6 months, follows a similar one launched by  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc last week. 
Only the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is being used in 16- and 17-year-olds in the United States. Moderna's shot was cleared for those age 18 and older, and no COVID-19 vaccine has been authorized in younger kids yet.
Pfizer and BioNTech plan to initially test the safety of their two-shot vaccine at three different dosages - 10, 20 and 30 micrograms - in a 144-participant Phase I/II trial. 
They plan to later expand to a 4,500-participant late-stage trial in which they will test the safety, tolerability and immune response generated by the vaccine, likely by measuring antibody levels in the young subjects.
Castillo said the companies hope to have data from the trial in the second half of 2021.

Meanwhile, Pfizer has been testing the vaccine in children from age 12 to 15. The company expects to have data from that trial in the coming weeks, Castillo said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) is delaying signing a contract to supply its COVID-19 vaccine to the European Union, an EU official involved in the talks told Reuters, as the U.S. biotech company warned it was struggling to source some raw materials. 
Prolonging the talks might further complicate the EU's vaccination plans as the bloc had planned to sign a deal early this year for at least 100 million doses of Novavax's vaccine, with an option for another 100 million.
The EU official, who asked not to named as the talks are confidential, said the company had postponed signing a deal for weeks, citing legal issues in meetings with the bloc's vaccine negotiators.
""They are slowing down the process of finishing the contract,"" the official, who attended the meetings, told Reuters.
Informally, a Novavax executive had said a slow pace in negotiations was warranted because the company was having production problems, the EU official said.
A Novavax spokeswoman said in an email that talks with the EU over a supply deal continue, but declined to say more about the discussions.
She said the company was working ""through some pandemic-related raw materials supply shortages"", without giving details.
The European Commission, which coordinates talks with vaccine makers, declined to comment.
Facing supply problems from other COVID-19 vaccine makers, notably AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), the EU's immunisation campaign is lagging far behind those in the United States and Britain, a situation that has become more critical as a third wave of infections sweeps the bloc. 
Novavax is planning to produce key components of its two-dose vaccines for the EU in several of its factories, it said, including one in the Czech Republic, which makes antigens, the inactivated organisms that trigger an immune response.
The EU official said production capacity at the plant, the only one in the EU, was too small the meet the needs of the 27-nation bloc.
A spokesman for the plant declined to comment.
Novavax has eight manufacturing locations, including the Serum Institute of India, the world's biggest vaccine maker.
Serum warned earlier this month that a temporary U.S. ban on exports of critical raw materials could hurt its production of vaccines, including Novavax's.
Serum is also making AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine and has suspended major exports of the shot.
It's not clear if Serum's issues are affecting Novavax's potential supplies to the EU.
Novavax executives said in an investor call earlier this month its vaccine production plants should all be fully functional by April.
CEO Stanley Erck told Reuters on March 1 the company expected to have tens of millions of doses stockpiled and ready to ship in the United States when it receives regulatory approval there, possibly in May.
PRELIMINARY ACCORD
Novavax concluded exploratory talks with the EU in mid-December, a step that has usually been followed by the signature of a contract within two or three months, according to EU deals with other COVID-19 vaccine makers.
At a meeting in mid-February, the Commission told EU ambassadors a deal with Novavax was likely to be finalised in a week, an official who attended that meeting said. A second EU official, involved in talks with the firm, also said in February that a deal was close.
But the same official told Reuters on Thursday that talks were ongoing and the company was now saying it aimed for a deal by June, although the official added the timeline was not clear.
Novavax says it is working towards submitting an application for regulatory approval in the EU in the second quarter.
Regulatory approval is a precondition for a vaccine to be rolled out in the bloc, but its absence has not prevented the EU from signing vaccine supply deals. 
All EU supply contracts have so far been signed before regulatory approval, with the EU usually making upfront payments to companies and agreeing the full price for vaccines would only be paid after regulatory authorisation.
Novavax's vaccine has been assessed by the EU drugs regulator under a rolling review since early February.

Earlier in March, Novavax said its vaccine was highly effective in a late-stage trial in the United Kingdom.

415,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2021 12:20PM ET</span>","U.S. bank profits may leap, then fade, as investors look under the hood","By David Henry
(Reuters) - Big U.S. banks are on track to produce blockbuster first-quarter profit gains, but enthusiasm might fade when investors look under the hood.
Banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) are poised to report that net income jumped 60% to 250% from a year earlier, according to analyst estimates. 
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co earnings per share are expected to rocket to 61 cents from a single penny. 
Analysts said banks may move another a chunk of ""reserves"" – money they had set aside for expected pandemic loan losses – to the bottom line, as the credit outlook has improved. The expense of building those reserves is what crushed results last year.
They also anticipate capital-markets revenue to keep flourishing. Wall Street-centric banks like  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) might produce huge revenue for units that include trading, underwriting and investment banking.
U.S. bank stocks have jumped on expectations that vaccines will lift the economy, as well as bond-market moves that suggest banks will earn more money from the difference in what it costs for them to borrow and what they receive to lend.
Bank shares are up 50% on the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index since October, which was right before investors learned that vaccines were effective. That's more than twice the 20% gain for the S&P 500.
'ECONOMIC GREEN SHOOTS'
However, loan growth has been weak during the first quarter, according to Federal Reserve data. This is the main factor driving investors' view on banks, analysts said.
""Everyone is still trying to find evidence that the economic green shoots are coming through,"" said bank analyst Brian Kleinhanzl of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
Management outlooks for net interest income could move the stocks sharply this quarter because the shares have climbed so much, Kleinhanzl said.
Much of the investor hope for interest income is on the idea that banks will see building demand for loans from businesses and consumers.
Business borrowing could accelerate later this year with confidence in the economy, said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Jason Goldberg.
And, consumers could borrow more on credit cards as they start to travel again, he added.
But analysts will be checking for evidence from banks that their customers have marshaled so much cash that they won't need loans for a while.
If loan growth is not evident, investors will want to know whether banks plan to use deposits on their balance sheets more profitably. Although yields on 10-year Treasury notes have risen recently, yields on the 2-to-3 year securities that banks typically invest in have barely moved.

""Near-term, net interest income will continue to be pressured given very subdued loan growth and the lingering impacts of low short-term interest rates,"" said Goldberg.

Ark Investment Management’s new space ETF could make its debut as soon as the start of next week, based on regulatory filing dates. The actively managed exchange-traded fund would track U.S. and global companies involved in space exploration and innovation.
If it comes it will be the first new product from Ark since the 2019 launch of the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) and follows a stellar 12 months in which Wood’s ETF assets skyrocketed to $47 billion from just $3.3 billion.
Her funds -- which include five that are actively-managed and two that track indexes -- had a rough ride as tech shares sold off in recent weeks. But the flagship fund is still up 154% over the past 12 months and her products have taken in about $16.4 billion just this year, suggesting a new one would be met with strong demand.
“It’s certainly what the market has appetite for right now,” said Matt Benkendorf, chief investment officer of Vontobel Quality Growth. “Ark has shown a tremendous propensity to attract money, and all eyes are on them.”
Wood’s firm filed for the fund on Jan. 13, which means the earliest Ark could complete the Securities and Exchange Commission approval process and release the ETF to investors is March 29, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, although its application may get held up. A spokesperson from Ark declined to comment since the fund is still in the SEC quiet period.
News of the upcoming fund sparked an industry-wide rally earlier this year, with both peer ETFs and individual stocks like Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc. soaring. Assets in the Procure Space ETF (UFO) have more than tripled since Ark filed for ARKX, now up to $130 million.
ARKX’s sister products offer a compelling performance picture. Three of them -- the $22 billion flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), and the ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) are up more than 150% in the past year.
“They’ve certainly built up a loyal following of investors that will seed that fund well,” said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird. “It just seems like a good encapsulation of the market moment that we started the year in, with all the money going into these super high-growth, long-term ideas.”
In fact, retail traders have been anxiously awaiting the new product launch, with TikTok videos hyping the fund. Mark Leclair, a 43-year-old who lives in Texas and does software support, has already set aside some money to invest in ARKX when it debuts.
“I’m going to jump all over that,” he said in a phone interview. “Cathie is doing her own research and analysis, and she is making conclusions that the Street just doesn’t see. It really aligns with what I believe in which is trying to make smart investments in industry disruptors.”

That includes expectations of at least 50% sales growth for the first quarter, the company said in a statement. The company reported earnings that beat estimates, including a profit of $5.07, versus the expected $4.72. 
Restoration Hardware has been a major beneficiary of the pandemic and low interest rates as demand for renovations and new homes has skyrocketed as we've all been stuck at home for what seems like forever. That said, like others including Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON), Restoration Hardware is facing supply challenges.
""While we expect to face continued difficulties ramping vendor production to meet demand and don’t see the challenges with ocean freight or port congestion resolving themselves anytime soon, it’s hard not to forecast first quarter revenue growth of at least 50%, and adjusted operating margin in the 20% range,"" said Chief Executive Officer Gary Friedman in a statement.  
Shares are still down about 7% since hitting a record this week. The stock has rallied some 400% from March 2020.
Analysts lauded the results, with firms from UBS to  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) upping their price targets on the retailer.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) also raised its price target and reiterated its buy-equivalent rating, noting that guidance may be conservative. Cowen followed suit in increasing the price target for Restoration Hardware, seeing ""plenty of room to outperform,"" StreetInsider reported.  
“The luxury housing market remains incredibly strong, with February accelerating to +81% Y/Y following January's decline to +77% Y/Y, as sales have increased above +90% on average over the past six months,"" according to Cowen. ""Overall, given the ongoing housing strength combined with a longer furniture purchase cycle, we anticipate demand can remain elevated for at-least the remainder of 2021.”

By 9:50 AM ET (1350 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 266 points, or 0.8% at 32,502 points. The S&P was down 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.7%.
Overnight, the head of a Dutch company contracted to help unblock the Suez Canal said it might “take weeks” to free the stricken Ever Given container ship. That has fed concerns of fresh strains on global supply chains that are already visible in a worldwide shortage of semiconductors and - since the cold snap in Texas - plastics.

ADRs in Swedish fashion retailer H & M  (OTC:HNNMY) were down 3.2% as the government-directed outrage targeted its stores, too.
Even worse was in store for Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) stock, which fell as much as 20% in early trading after the company reported a weaker-than-expected quarter. Its sales of cold and flu medicines, in particular, suffered as lockdowns stopped the transmission channel of less harmful viruses than Covid-19.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock also fell sharply at the open before bouncing amid fears of redemptions by fund manager Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK), where Tesla is the largest holding, accounting for some 10% of assets under management. The move may also have owed something to a 6% slump in Bitcoin prices – with which Tesla has been increasingly correlated since making a $1.5 billion bet on the digital currency with its corporate treasury.
Elsewhere, GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock rebounded 13% after a losing one-third of its value on Wednesday in disappointment at the company's intention to raise more capital to fund its transition to a digital-first retailer.

Rite Aid Corporation estimated the unanticipated impact on fourth quarter results of between $50 million and $60 million, with cough, cold and flu-related product categories down almost 37%. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the fiscal year ended Feb. 27 is expected at between $425 million to $435 million, down from a previous forecast of $490 million to $520 million.
Bad weather also disrupted the supply chain and depressed sales, Chief Executive Officer Heyward Donigan said in a statement.
Rival Walgreens traded down by more than 2%, while CVS shares traded slightly lower. Higher expenses due to a one time hero-pay bonus, cleaning costs, pandemic sick leave and other incremental operating costs also hurt results. On the upside, fewer people have suffered and died of the flu.
“Looking ahead, we have seen acute prescriptions return to positive levels in March, and we are proud to be selected as one of the retail providers administering COVID vaccines in the majority of our key states and cities,"" Donigan asid. ""We are significantly ramping up the number of vaccines we are administering on a daily basis, and have administered approximately 1 million COVID vaccines in March to date."""

MILAN (Reuters) - Stellantis is studying a plan which would involve closing one of two production lines at its Melfi car plant in southern Italy, the head of the FIM CISL union told Reuters.
Jeep's Renegade and Compass models and the Fiat 500X compact SUV are produced at Melfi, which is considered the most efficient Stellantis plant in Italy, but could be moved to a single production line. 
Closing a Melfi line could mark a first step by Chief Executive Carlos Tavares to tackle excess capacity in Italy.
The carmaker's production is under scrutiny in the country for costing more than elsewhere, as Stellantis seeks more than 5 billion euros ($5.9 billion) a year in savings.
FIM CISL's Ferdinando Uliano said on Thursday that the plan was being assessed, but Stellantis had not taken any decision on it, and the union had yet to receive official confirmation that such project was being considered. 
Tavares had committed not to cut jobs or close plants following the creation of the company from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA earlier this year.
""We're very worried,"" Uliano said. ""Once you have reduced production capacity at one site, it's very difficult to gain it back"".
Stellantis was not immediately available for comment.

He resigned as chairman of U.S. vaccine developer Vaxcyte Inc following a company request and quit Centessa Pharmaceuticals, which named him chief scientific officer at the newly-formed company last month. 
Slaoui did not respond to a request for comment on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) on his resignations from the two companies. 
He had on Wednesday night acknowledged his dismissal from Galvani Bioelectronics, a GSK-controlled firm, and issued an apology to the employee.
""I am deeply sorry for any distress caused. I would also like to apologize to my wife and family for the pain this is causing,"" Slaoui said in a statement. 
He was appointed the head of the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine development program by former U.S. President Donald Trump last year and has held top positions at several drugmakers, including GSK.
The British drugmaker said an investigation into his conduct, performed on its behalf by an independent law firm, had substantiated allegations of harassment and inappropriate contact.

The probe, which is ongoing, was the result of a letter received by GSK containing allegations of inappropriate conduct toward a company employee years ago. 
Slaoui joined Vaxcyte's board in July 2017 and became chairman in May 2018. He is also a partner at investment firm Medicxi.

429,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2021 09:05AM ET</span>",Dividend over digging: Miners pay shareholders but need new projects,"By Zandi Shabalala
LONDON (Reuters) - Major miners need to increase spending to secure fresh copper supply, analysts say, amid worries that availability of the red metal, crucial for the shift to a low carbon world, will slide just as demand surges.
Copper -- which hit 9-1/2 year highs last month at $9,617 a tonne -- is an efficient conductor and is set to benefit from the rising use of electric vehicles (EVs) and wind and solar power generation. Miners including BHP, Glencore (OTC:GLNCY), Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) have benefited from soaring metals prices, which have underpinned earnings, boosted dividends and debt reduction. 
Amid a dearth of new mines coming on stream, analysts are predicting deep structural supply deficits by 2025 for copper, currently mostly used in power and construction industries. 
This would mean higher for longer pricing but the lack of metal could also hobble the ""green revolution"".
""Clearly for a few years not spending on projects was warranted, because you didn't have a lot of demand growth but what we are facing now is demand rapidly outpacing what miners can produce,"" said Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analyst Michael Widmer.
By 2025, miners need to spend $80 billion annually on extracting cyclical metals to meet demand and contain shortages compared to expectations of around $45 billion this year among the world's top 10 miners, BofA analysts said last month.
Commodity analyst CRU Group projects miners need to commit over $100 billion on new projects to avoid a supply gap of 5 million tonnes by 2030. Looking further out, Wood Mackenzie sees a shortfall of around 16 million tonnes by 2040 if substantial investments aren't made. Capital spending on projects and mines peaked in 2012 and has not recovered, BofA said. 
Anglo American, in its February results, kept capital expenditure for the next three years fairly stable as it flagged another possible rise in shareholder returns this year. Glencore, Rio Tinto and BHP are expected to do the same if commodity prices keep up. 
The dividend yield of London-listed miners has climbed to 4.67%, outpacing the wider FTSE 100 index which sits at 3.3%, according to Refinitiv data, enabled by stronger balance sheets. 
The peak of the last commodity cycle a decade ago - still fresh in the shareholders' minds - was marked by cost overruns and expensive deals that ended in billions in writedowns. 
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Chris LaFemina said the supply growth that many copper miners pledge is more likely to be replacing what they already produce rather than new growth. 
Certainly, some miners are bucking the trend. Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) Inc's is eyeing expansions at several of its U.S. copper mines to capitalize on surging demand.
Its ramp up of the Grasberg mine in Indonesia,  Ivanhoe Mines  (OTC:IVPAF)' Kamoa project in Democratic Republic of Congo and Anglo's Quellaveco in Peru are among a handful of large projects expected to deliver more copper within the next two years. 
But some shareholders remain uneasy with large expansions. 
""We would be wary of mining companies expanding capex too aggressively, as it would potentially harm the positive supply/demand dynamics were production to grow too quickly,"" said Richard Marwood, senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management. 
""If the electrification demand comes through, with supply somewhat constrained in the near term, copper prices could remain well supported.""

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares were down 5% Thursday premarket after a cautious analyst report and a slide in Bitcoin prices both weighed on the stock.
Alexander Potter, a senior research analyst at Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR), was quoted in various reports as warning of the risks of delays to the ramp up of production at the company's new factories in Germany and Texas, the latter being home to Tesla's electric truck project.
Tesla has frequently missed its own production targets in the past but its record deliveries of over 500,000 last year have fostered hopes that it has improved on that score. 
The analyst has an ‘overweight’ rating and $1200 price target on the electric vehicle maker.
The Piper Sandler came a relatively high degree of background noise for the stock. Chinese automotive group Geely overnight launched a new premium brand - Zeekr - that it intends to compete directly with Tesla. Rising U.S.-Chinese animosity in recent months has reminded many in the market of Tesla's high dependence on the Chinese market.
In addition a sharp slide in (Bitcoin) prices is casting a different light on CEO Elon Musk's boast at the weekend that Tesla will now accept Bitcoin as payment.

431,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2021 08:52AM ET</span>","After H&M, Nike feels Chinese social media heat over Xinjiang","BEIJING (Reuters) -  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) came under fire on Chinese social media on Thursday after Beijing's propaganda offensive against Swedish fashion brand H&M sparked by the company's expression of concern about labour conditions in Xinjiang. 
The sportswear companies were the latest to be caught up in a backlash prompted by a government call to stop foreign brands from tainting China's name as internet users found statements they had made in the past on Xinjiang. 
Chinese state media had singled out H&M on Wednesday over a statement that was reported last year in which the Swedish retailer said it was deeply concerned by reports of accusations of forced labour in Xinjiang, and that it did not source products from the Chinese region. 
It was unclear why the H&M statement was back in the public eye but diplomatic tensions between China and the West have been rising. 
Earlier this week, China denied allegations of human rights abuses by its officials in the western region of Xinjiang after the European Union, United States, Britain and Canada imposed sanctions on the officials. 
Beijing hit back with retaliatory sanctions on European lawmakers, scholars and institutions. 
Some internet users said they would stop buying Nike and will support local brands such as Li Ning and Anta, while others told Adidas to leave China. 
Shares of Anta Sports Products Ltd and Li Ning Co surged, while shares in Adidas,  Inditex  (MC:ITX) and H&M fell when European markets opened on Thursday. 
State tabloid Global Times said Spain's Inditex, owner of Zara, had ""quietly removed"" a statement on Xinjiang from its English and Spanish-language websites. 
Inditex did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
BOYCOTT
Internet users also targeted the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), a group that promotes sustainable cotton production which said in October it was suspending its approval of cotton sourced from Xinjiang for the 2020-2021 season, citing human rights concerns.
BCI members include Nike, Adidas, H&M and Japan's Fast Retailing.
""If you boycott Xinjiang cotton, we'll boycott you. Either Adidas quits BCI, or get out of China,"" one internet user wrote. 
Nike, Adidas and the BCI did not respond to requests for comment.
H&M said on Wednesday it respected Chinese consumers and that it was committed to long-term investment and development in China.
But by Thursday morning, H&M did not exist on some Chinese store locator maps. Searches for H&M stores on Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) Maps yielded no results. The retailer's official store on  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s Tmall, an e-commerce platform, was inaccessible. 
At a daily media briefing at China's foreign ministry, spokeswoman Hua Chunying, when asked about H&M, held up a photograph of Black Americans picking cotton. 
""This was in the U.S. when Black slaves were forced to pick cotton in the fields,"" she said. 
Hua then held up a second photograph of cotton fields in Xinjiang. 
""More than 40% of the cotton in Xinjiang is harvested by machinery, so the alleged forced labour is non-existent."" 
People's Daily, the main newspaper of the Communist Party, rolled out a social media campaign in support of cotton sourced from Xinjiang. 
The graphic ""I support Xinjiang cotton"" posted by the newspaper on the Twitter-like microblog Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) has since attracted about 2.2 million likes. 
Japanese retailer Muji, owned by Ryohin Keikaku Co, told the Global Times that it uses Xinjiang cotton, winning praise from Chinese internet users, who lauded the firm's ""survival instincts"".

Ryohin Keikaku recently conducted due diligence for Xinjiang factories, with which it has an indirect relationship via its supply chain, and also commissioned an independent audit group to make onsite audits, but found no significant issues, the company told Reuters on Thursday.

432,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2021 08:40AM ET</span>",Offshore galore! Wind farms go on the block as valuations spike,"By Arno Schuetze and Christoph Steitz
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European utilities are offering a slew of offshore wind farms, eager to cash in on high valuations as investors hungry for stable returns increasingly flock to the sector, people close to the matter said.
Demand for such assets has surged as environmentally-conscious investors and industries such as oil and gas seek green power in order to meet goals to achieve net zero emissions in line with the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
Denmark's Orsted (OTC:DOGEF), Switzerland's Axpo, Germany's EnBW and Sweden's Vattenfall are all marketing offshore wind assets that are either at project stage or completed, four people familiar with the matter said. 
Specialised infrastructure investors including FSI, Equitix, PGGM, APG, MIRA, Omers, Glennmont, IFM, CDPQ, Omers, Ardian, as well as oil majors are being targeted in the various auctions, the people said.
""There is a massive influx of capital and it is driven by pension funds and insurance companies,"" said Mortimer Menzel, partner at Augusta & Co, which specialises in renewables deal advisory.
""It drives utilities to recycle their assets because, quite frankly, they're getting a higher price today than they did last year and the window won't be open forever,"" he said, adding there was a huge scarcity of assets at the moment.
For utilities, selling stakes in farms or projects is part of their strategy to get these assets, which usually require spending of at last 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) apiece, off the ground.
Orsted, the world's No.1 developer of offshore wind farms, is in talks to sell part of its 900 megawatt (MW) Borkum Riffgrund 3 project to an investor in a deal worth up to 2 billion euros, the people said.
Glennmont Partners has been seen in pole position as a buyer but talks have not yet been finalised, they added.
Meantime, Axpo has already kicked off the sale of its 24.1% stake in the 400 MW Global Tech I farm, located about 100 kms (62 miles) off Germany's North Sea coast, the people said.
Axpo has already approached potential buyers including owners of adjacent wind parks like APG and Macquarie as well as EnBW, which may be able to reap synergies from a potential combination, one of the people added.
Other investors in Global Tech I, which entered operation in 2015 and produces enough electricity to supply about 450,000 households, have also signalled their willingness to exit, and a buyer could get a majority in the business, the people said.
Orsted, Glennmont and Axpo declined to comment.

Valuations for renewables assets have soared, with the global FTSE cleantech index more than doubling over the past year on demand from investors, including oil majors who are under increasing pressure to find new sources of profit.
""The historical gap between returns from oil & gas upstream and renewables has significantly narrowed,"" said Maria Garijo, co-head of EMEA power investment banking at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
""However, big oil is likely to prefer to tread carefully when investing in renewables in the near term as they continue to adapt their financial frameworks and fulfil their dividend commitments.""
Despite the pandemic, 2020 has been a record year for offshore wind financing in Europe, climbing to 26.3 billion euros last year, according to industry body WindEurope.
EnBW is expected to mandate advisors for the sale of a stake in its 900 MW He Dreiht project, to be located about 110 kms west of Heligoland in the North Sea, in autumn, potentially launching an auction later this year or in 2022, the people said.
The company said that while for now its operating focus regarding He Dreiht remained developing the project until an investment decision has been taken, funding partnerships are part of its renewables business model.
In May, Vattenfall is expected to send out information packages in the planned sale of a stake in its Dutch 1.5 GW Hollandse Kust Zuid wind park, which is slated to go online in 2023, the people said.
Vattenfall, which communicated the sales plans last year, declined to comment on the timeline of the deal, adding that RBC Capital Markets is helping it to find an investor. ""We call this asset ownership flexibility,"" it said.
In a sign of how big interest in renewables assets currently is, Spain's Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY) is getting unsolicited bids for some of its wind farms, including Germany's 476 MW Baltic Eagle project, the people said.
But while the company, which in 2019 sold a stake in its East Anglia One wind park, is looking for partners to finance the construction of Baltic Eagle, it is aiming to retain full ownership, they added.
Iberdrola declined to comment.

The stocks are “inexpensive enough to make one look for things that could go right, rather than things that could go wrong,” analysts including John Lomax and Cihan Saraoglu wrote in a report dated March 24. HSBC trimmed its overweight position on Turkish stocks on March 9, but said Wednesday it’s not cutting the weighting further.
Turkish markets were pummeled after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s weekend firing of central bank governor Naci Agbal, whose November appointment encouraged investor optimism of a return to more orthodox monetary policy. The benchmark Borsa Istanbul 100 Index has slumped more than 7% this week, dragging the price-to-estimated earnings multiple of its members to a record discount of 58% to emerging-market peers.
The Istanbul benchmark is the worst-performing index in the world this month in dollar terms among 92 markets tracked by Bloomberg, aside from a gauge of Turkey’s 30 largest stocks. But, HSBC says the March slump isn’t purely down to domestic factors, given surging U.S. bond yields that damped appetite for riskier assets, and the analysts expect the country’s stocks to benefit as these conditions improve.
The potential for more dovish monetary policy following the change in central bank leadership increases the chance of higher growth, and earnings could be stronger rather than weaker, resulting in even cheaper valuations, they said.
HSBC selected grocery chain operator BIM, steelmaker Erdemir, conglomerates Koc Holding and Sabanci Holding, and lender Isbank as its five preferred Turkish stocks.

434,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2021 08:35AM ET</span>",AstraZeneca vaccine's global rollout faces more complications,"(Reuters) - The rollout of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine, the shot much of the world is relying on to beat the pandemic, faced further complications on Thursday as India halted exports of the vaccine and Europe discussed its own export controls.
India has put a temporary hold on all major exports of the Anglo-Swedish firm's vaccine from the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest vaccine maker, to meet domestic demand as infections rise, two sources said.
That could delay supplies to dozens of lower-income countries also relying on SII production under the COVAX vaccine-sharing scheme backed by the World Health Organization.
""We understand that deliveries of COVID-19 vaccines to lower-income economies participating in the COVAX facility will likely face delays...,"" the programme's procurement and distributing partner UNICEF told Reuters.
India's move comes as the European Union meets on Thursday to consider giving member states greater scope to block vaccines being exported outside the bloc, much of which is struggling to bring infections down and ramp up immunisation campaigns.
The proposal would apply to all vaccines including AstraZeneca's, on which the EU had originally been relying to meet a goal of inoculating 70% of its adult population by this summer.
AstraZeneca's vaccine is seen as crucial in tackling the pandemic as it is cheaper and easier to transport than many rival shots.
The EU accuses the drugmaker of over-selling its vaccine and unfairly favouring Britain, where AstraZeneca developed the shot with Oxford University - a charge denied by the company.
Brussels agreed with London this week to strive for a ""win-win"" solution, but even if the EU resists export controls, it faces another problem: declining confidence in the AstraZeneca shot due to concerns over side-effects and efficacy data.
Denmark will suspend its use of the vaccine for another three weeks pending further investigations into a potential link between the vaccine and blood clots, Danish broadcaster TV 2 reported on Thursday, citing sources.
More than 10 other nations also suspended rollout of the vaccine over similar concerns but most have since restarted. The European Medicines Agency said last week it was safe and not linked with a rise in overall risk of blood clots.
However, many Europeans remain wary.
A third of Danes would refuse the AstraZeneca vaccine, according to a survey published by Danish media on Wednesday. Confidence has also taken a big hit in Spain, Germany, France and Italy.
AstraZeneca revised down, slightly, the vaccine's efficacy to 76% in a new analysis of its U.S. trial. Interim data published on Monday had put the vaccine's efficacy rate at 79% but had not included more recent infections, leading to a highly unusual public rebuke from U.S health officials.
AstraZeneca, which is awaiting U.S. regulatory approval, also reiterated the shot was 100% effective against severe or critical forms of COVID-19.
""The vaccine efficacy against severe disease, including death, puts the AZ vaccine in the same ballpark as the other vaccines,"" said William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert from the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, adding he expects the shot to gain U.S. approval.
The vaccine has already been granted conditional marketing or emergency use authorisation in more than 70 countries. 
In Europe, the leaders of France and Germany admitted on Thursday that the problem of slow vaccine rollouts inside the EU went beyond the question of whether to control exports.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said EU leaders would also discuss how to boost internal production of vaccines.
""British production sites are manufacturing for Britain and the United States is not exporting, so we are reliant on what we can make in Europe,"" she told German lawmakers.
French President Emmanuel Macron said the EU itself should take some blame - that its vaccine plans had lacked ambition.

""We didn't shoot for the stars,"" he told Greek television channel ERT. ""That should be a lesson for all of us.""

By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) -Two-thirds of senior company executives believe it is not currently commercially viable to operate as a net-zero emissions business, a global survey commissioned by British lender Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) showed.
The survey of 250 executives, in a report called 'Zeronomics', found that a focus on shorter-term returns meant 77% of companies ""struggle to justify"" giving up reliable revenue from a proven business model in exchange for uncertain future returns.
""Companies also doubt whether the work needed to transition their organisations will be worth it,"" the report said, with 62% of executives believing the expected benefits of transitioning to a lower-carbon business do not outweigh the costs.
Companies are under pressure from investors to ensure their businesses are ready to prosper in the global transition to a low-carbon economy, as policymakers retool economies in response to the challenge posed by climate change.
However, the pace of change remains slow, frustrating investors who are calling on companies to move more quickly and be more open about their plans.
Despite that, the survey found the executives saw a number of hurdles in the way of progress, including the need for greater levels of finance, particularly in emerging economies, and better measurement and reporting standards.
Among factors that could help drive quicker change were more evidence of the potential cost benefits, increased pressure from supply chain partners and investors, and an effective global tax on carbon emissions, the executives said. 
""Despite the need for immediate action, the transition to net-zero carbon is a long-term project with long-term benefits,"" the report said. ""However, companies are not set up to take the long view.""
A concurrent survey of 100 leading investors found 93% believed the relatively short tenure of the average chief executive was hindering their ability to act - a view shared by 79% of the executives.
While 64% of the investors said most business leaders were focused on short-term performance over long-term value creation, 90% said the net-zero plan communicated by a company CEO was a ""critically important"" driver of its appeal as an investment.

""Two-thirds believe that a company’s net-zero transition strategy and leadership is now a better predictor of future corporate success than its past financial performance,"" the report said.
""If CEOs become climate leaders, this may pave the way to net zero.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Cboe Global Markets (NYSE:CBOE) Inc said on Thursday it was expanding into Asia by acquiring share trading platforms in Australia and Japan to broaden its footprint in the increasingly competitive sector of financial market data.
Cboe said the acquisition of Chi-X Asia Pacific Holdings, combined with a recent takeover of U.S. and European block trader BIDS, would make it possible to offer a global service to big investors who want to buy and sell large chunks of shares.
Chicago-based Cboe, long established in North America and Europe, is buying Chi-X Asia Pacific, which had net revenue of $26 million in the year to December, from investment firm J.C. Flowers & Co with cash in hand and existing credit agreements, if need be. The value of the deal was not disclosed. 
Chi-X is Australia's second biggest securities exchange with an 18.4% market share, behind only ASX, while the Japan unit is the third largest platform in the country with a 2.7% market share.
Last year, ASX had a major outage that underscored the need for more competition in the market and triggered a review by the regulators.
Cboe expects to close the deal in the second or third quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory approval.
""With a single deal we get to enter the two remaining markets open to competition in the world and create a truly global exchange network,"" Cboe Europe president David Howson told Reuters. Elsewhere in Asia, share trading is dominated by the incumbent national exchange.
Howson, who will become Cboe president for Europe and Asia Pacific, said the deal would broaden its data footprint beyond North American and Europe, enabling it to create more products for global customers.
Competition in financial market data is hotting up after the recent merger of  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) and Refinitiv, and the planned merger of S&P and IHS Markit, cementing them as the second and third largest players respectively behind Bloomberg LP. 

""For us now, we are truly global, that was our stated aim of our corporate strategy. It's a very solid place to be in our view,"" Howson said.

The penalty was almost twice the largest fine previously laid down by the regulator on any institution, a 21 million euro reprimand for permanent tsb in 2019, also for failing to offer customers a mortgage that tracked the European Central Bank rate that has been at or close to zero for almost a decade.
Irish banks have paid out almost 700 million euros ($826.84 million) to compensate 40,000 borrowers denied the mortgage product that was widely offered during the country's housing boom in the mid 2000s and withdrawn for new customers when the financial crisis hit.
Additional failings that contributed to Ulster Bank's larger fine included what the central bank said was a deliberate strategy to seek to entice customers to convert their tracker rates to fixed rates during 2008.
The bank also failed to meet a statutory deadline to provide information to the central bank, forcing the regulator to take an ""unprecedented step"" of starting potential legal proceedings. Ultimately this was unnecessary as the information was provided. 
""Our investigation identified the numerous opportunities that UBID (Ulster Bank Ireland DAC) had to do right by its customers and the efforts that UBID went to in order to evade its obligations,"" Irish Central Bank Director General, Financial Conduct, Derville Rowland, said in a statement.
""It is unacceptable for any regulated entity to treat its customers in this way.""
Of the 5,940 individual customers impacted by Ulster Bank's failings, 43 lost their properties as a result being unable to meet their mortgage repayments.
The fine for Ulster Bank, which NatWest announced last month it would wind down after years of under-performance, was reduced from almost 54 million euros in accordance with the central bank's settlement discount rules.
The central bank launched a probe into the overcharging in 2015 and also fined KBC Bank Ireland 18.3 million euros last year. Other banks remain under investigation.

The U.S., Canada, U.K. and European Union imposed sanctions on Chinese officials last week in connection with allegations of genocide and forced labor in the region. Beijing retaliated with similar steps against the Europeans.
According to a Reuters report, Chinese state media singled out H&M (ST:HMb) on Wednesday for a statement it made last year in which the Swedish retailer said it was deeply concerned by reports of accusations of forced labor in Xinjiang. The fast-fashion retailer said it did not source products from Xinjiang.
Nike made a similar statement distancing itself from cotton suppliers in the region last November, in particular denying claims made by an Australian think-tank that it sourced materials from firms that used forced labor.
A social media frenzy fueled by the government to stop foreign brands from tainting China's name led to people searching for more statements on Xinjiang made in the past by foreign retailers, Reuters reported.
China's government has reacted angrily to what it sees as interference in its internal affairs, imposing sanctions of its own on European lawmakers. The impasse threatens to stop ratification of a recent agreement between the EU and China on investment flows.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Thursday, helped by positive comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen ahead of key unemployment numbers.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 50 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 6 points, or 0.2%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 33 points, or 0.3%.
Yellen and Powell both reiterated their belief on Wednesday that the U.S. economy will see strong growth in 2021, thanks in large part to heavy doses of fiscal and monetary stimuli.
This is before the U.S. government’s plan to upgrade the nation's infrastructure, which could result in further investment of approaching $4 trillion, is agreed upon by lawmakers.
UBS Global Wealth Management sees 5% to 10% upside for global stock markets, based on expectations that the economic recovery will broaden out and accelerate over the course of the year.
Stocks are expected to rise even as bond yields edged higher. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield edged up to 1.61% Thursday, still significantly below the 14-month high of 1.75% seen last week.
With the focus on the strength of the economic recovery, the weekly jobless claims data, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), will be studied carefully for signs that the employment market is improving along with vaccinations and the easing of business restrictions. They are expected to have fallen to 730,000 from 770,000 the previous week. The final reading of fourth-quarter GDP is also due at the same time.
In the corporate sector, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) will be in focus after the U.K.-Swedish drugmaker updated its U.S. trial results to show a slightly lower efficacy rate for its Covid-19 vaccine. 
 Nike  (NYSE:NKE) stock fell over 4% premarket, with the sportswear retailer among a number of Western companies facing a backlash in China after cutting ties with cotton suppliers in the province of Xinjiang.
Oil prices fell Thursday, reversing Wednesday’s gains on the Suez Canal blockage. This passage remains plugged, but demand concerns have returned to the fore. While the focus has been on lockdowns in Europe, crucial developing economies like India and Brazil have also seen rising numbers of Covid-19 cases. 
Additionally, U.S. crude stocks jumped by 1.9 million barrels last week, according to official data from the Energy Information Administration.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.6% lower at $60.18 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.4% to $63.53.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator has opened an inquiry into Wall Street's blank check acquisition frenzy and is seeking information on how underwriters are managing the risks involved, said four people with direct knowledge of the matter.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in recent days sent letters to Wall Street banks seeking information on their special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, dealings, the four people said. 
SPACs are listed shell companies that raise funds to acquire a private company with the purpose of taking it public, allowing such targets to sidestep a traditional initial public offering. 
The SEC letters asked the banks to provide the information voluntarily and, as such, did not rise to the level of a formal investigative demand, two of the sources said. 
However, one of those two people said letters were sent by the SEC's enforcement division, suggesting they may be a precursor to a formal investigation. 
This person said the SEC wanted information on SPAC deal fees, volumes, and what controls banks have in place to police the deals internally. The second above source said the SEC asked questions relating to compliance, reporting and internal controls.
Representatives for the SEC did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside U.S. business hours. 
Wall Street's biggest gold rush of recent years, SPACs have surged globally to a record $170 billion this year, outstripping last year's total of $157 billion, Refinitiv data showed.
The boom has been fueled in part by easy monetary conditions as central banks have pumped cash into pandemic-hit economies, while the SPAC structure provides startups with an easier path to go public with less regulatory scrutiny than the traditional IPO route. But the frenzy has started to meet with greater investor skepticism, and has also caught the eye of regulators.
This month, the SEC warned investors against buying into SPACs based on celebrity endorsements and said it was closely watching SPAC disclosures and other ""structural"" SPAC issues. 
Investors have sued eight companies that combined with SPACs in the first quarter of 2021, according to data compiled by Stanford University. Some of the lawsuits allege the SPACs and their sponsors, who reap huge pay-days once a SPAC combines with its target, hid weaknesses ahead of the transactions.
The SEC may be worried about the depth of due diligence SPACs perform before acquiring assets, and whether huge payouts are fully disclosed to investors, said a third source. 
Another potential concern is the heightened risk of insider trading between when a SPAC goes public and when it announces its acquisition target, the second source added. 

""Wall Street's biggest banks are being asked: what's going on?"" the person said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Nationwide Building Society and Santander (MC:SAN) UK have become the latest banks to take an axe to their office space, cementing remote working arrangements put in place during the COVID-19 crisis. 
Nationwide has told all its 13,000 office-based staff to work from anywhere in the country.
The lender said on Thursday it will not renew the leases on three of its offices in its hometown of Swindon in the southwest of England but will retain its headquarters there along with other regional hubs.
Santander UK said it will close four offices in Bootle, Newcastle, London Portman House and Manchester Deansgate and switch the location of its headquarters from London to Milton Keynes.
The bank also said it would close 111 branches by August, adding that a long term shift towards mobile and online banking accelerated by the pandemic had prompted the decision.
Around 5,000 staff based at closing office sites would be offered new working arrangements, combining working from home with access to local collaboration spaces, the bank said.
The moves to slash office space are a further sign of how companies are taking advantage of remote working to cut overhead.
Nationwide's decision to let its staff work anywhere goes further than British banks such as HSBC and Lloyds (LON:LLOY), which have said they will cut office space but are likely still to require staff to come in on some days.
The bellwether mortgage lender said it will continue to invest in offices by installing more collaboration spaces, with fewer traditional meeting rooms and well-being measures such as quiet areas.
Branch-based staff will still work in those locations, Nationwide said, with some of their formerly office-bound peers able to join them.
Britain's second-biggest provider of home loans, Nationwide competes with high street banking rivals but unlike them is owned by its customers.

The lender last year offered redundancy packages to around 200 staff with a view to around 100 accepting them, Reuters reported, as it seeks to reduce costs.

445,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2021 06:05AM ET</span>","Infrastructure bill could fuel stocks, but investors temper enthusiasm","By Lewis Krauskopf and David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) -A U.S. government plan to upgrade the nation's infrastructure could further fuel the stock market's rally, but skepticism about a massive spending package navigating political obstacles and the speed of any benefits filtering into the economy stand to temper any enthusiasm.
A wealth of companies, including in construction, materials, and even technology, could see a revenue boost from a spending package that would potentially aim to repair roads and bridges, invest in internet connectivity and address climate change.
President Joe Biden will travel to Pittsburgh next week to unveil the infrastructure plan, which could have a price tag as high as $4 trillion.
But investors say political obstacles exist to passing a bill - particularly if it includes tax increases to fund it - while they expect spending on projects could take years in some cases. 
“If we get a sizable package through, it would contribute further to the already positive economic rebound that we are seeing and the belief that stronger fiscal support for the economy could continue in the coming years,” said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors.
But, Baird said, ""it still has a long way to go to get through a Congress that is very much divided and will have significant questions about how to pay for it.”
Biden's plan is expected to be split between an initial package that deals with traditional transportation projects and a second one that addresses domestic issues, such as universal prekindergarten, national childcare and free community college tuition.
The White House is seeking to advance its agenda on the heels of pushing through a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which has helped give the latest boost to a stock market that has surged about 74% since the throes of the pandemic in March 2020.
There are signs that equities are already incorporating optimism over an infrastructure package.
A basket of infrastructure stocks primarily consisting of construction materials, machinery, and construction and engineering firms returned 27% since the Georgia runoff elections in early January gave Democrats full control of the Senate, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note published Friday. The S&P 500 rose about 5% over that time.
""Stocks have started to price in that there is a good likelihood of infrastructure spending coming down the pike,"" said Eric Marshall, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital, which holds shares of Eagle Materials (NYSE:EXP), a stock that has gained about 23% this year.
Marshall sees more opportunity in companies that would benefit from a build-out of infrastructure for electric vehicles like charging stations. Among the companies in his portfolio is Cree (NASDAQ:CREE) Inc, which makes silicon substrates used at charging stations.
But some are skeptical that an infrastructure package will easily sail through Congress, where Biden's Democratic party holds a slim majority. 
Key will be whether the package is linked to tax increases, such as lifting the levy that companies pay, which also could dampen investor excitement for the spending package.
""What could be an issue for markets ... is if tax rates increase meaningfully for corporations,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at the  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute.
While infrastructure spending has been portrayed as an issue supported by both the Republican and Democratic parties, President Donald Trump was unable to push through a package during his term in office.

Even if an infrastructure bill were to pass, investors said the spending stands to be allocated over years, so the benefits to companies may not be immediate.
“There is a healthy bit of skepticism right now with regard to the markets in terms of how they are thinking about infrastructure,” said Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio manager at Natixis Investment Managers. ""Even if it does get done, the shovel-ready projects, doling out the contracts ... there’s a significant time lag to some of that.""

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Global equities languished close to two-week lows on Thursday, while the dollar cruised to near a four-month high against the euro as nervy investors worried that Europe's COVID-19 response was falling behind that in the United States.
European markets opened lower, with the STOXX index of 600 European shares down 0.1% in early trade following a U.S selloff overnight and not helped by data showing the biggest rise since Jan. 9 in new confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany. The number of people with COVID-19 in French intensive care meanwhile set a high for 2021.
Extended lockdowns and worries about the pace of vaccinations across Europe hobbled the euro, which was down 0.1% against the dollar, at $1.1807.
The dollar index had hit its highest since November 2020 overnight, at 92.697, breaking its 200-day moving average.
""The dollar is absolutely critical,"" said James Athey, investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments. 
""While the 'reflation trade' has been largely driven by U.S. fiscal stimulus and thus growth and inflation expectations, it has also been driven by rising input prices coming from higher commodity prices. 
""If the dollar starts rallying that becomes a problem. It means commodity weakness and emerging market weakness and it starts to provide a disinflationary countervailing narrative.""
MSCI's gauge of world stocks was 0.03% lower, down for a second day and close to its lowest level in more than two weeks.
Its broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.2%, bringing it closer to wiping out all the gains it has posted so far this year.
Weighing on sentiment was a selloff in Chinese technology shares due to concerns they will be delisted from U.S. bourses and worries about a semiconductor shortage.
In Hong Kong, companies with U.S. listings led declines. JD (NASDAQ:JD).com lost 3.57% and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) fell 3.91%.
China's blue-chip CSI300 index edged 0.05% lower, to its lowest close since Dec. 11, weighed down by jitters about policy tightening and rising tensions between China and Western countries over allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang.
U.S. stock futures pointed to a steadier start on Wall Street after Wednesday's tumble, with E-minis 0.3% firmer.
The U.S. securities regulator is introducing measures that would kick foreign firms off U.S. stock exchanges if they do not comply with U.S. auditing standards, and require them to disclose any government affiliations -- measures widely expected to hit Chinese companies.
As well as concerns about extended economic lockdowns in Europe, disruptions to the distribution of COVID-19 vaccinations and potential U.S. tax hikes also dimmed investor sentiment.
""Rising interest rates, uncertainty of tax policy, concern over inflation all remain top-of-mind for investors. However, none of these themes speak to rising appetite for risk,"" said Peter Kenny of Kenny's Commentary LLC and Strategic Board Solutions LLC in Denver.
U.S. crude fell 1.6% to $60.22 per barrel, and Brent fell 1.3% to $63.56 a barrel, giving back some gains made the previous day after one of the world's largest container ships ran aground in the Suez Canal, blocking the vital shipping lane.
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose to 1.6209%, supported by positive data on the U.S. manufacturing sector. 
Investors have focused on the 10-year Treasury yield, pondering if there is room for long-term interest rates to run, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management.
""We know that the economy is primed to begin to really accelerate in the second quarter,"" Kelly said. ""But we haven't seen that acceleration yet so that's what we're waiting for.""

WASHINGTON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Shares in dual-listed Chinese companies fell sharply on Thursday in Asia after the U.S. securities regulator adopted measures that would kick foreign companies off American stock exchanges if they do not comply with U.S. auditing standards.
The move by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adds to the unprecedented regulatory crackdown in China on domestic technology companies, citing concerns that they have built market power that stifles competition.
The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, signed into law by then-President Donald Trump in December, is aimed at removing Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges if they fail to comply with American auditing standards for three years in a row.
The rules also require firms prove to the SEC they are not owned or controlled by an entity of a foreign government and to name any board members who are Chinese Communist Party officials, the SEC said in a statement Wednesday.
China's Foreign Ministry said the SEC decision would hurt the reputation of U.S. capital markets.
""It is clearly discriminatory against Chinese companies, it is wanton political suppression of Chinese companies listed in the US,"" spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Thursday.
""It deprives the U.S. public and investors in sharing in Chinese businesses' growth. It will harm the U.S.’s position as a capital market. 
""We urge the U.S. to stop politicizing security regulation, stop discriminating practices against Chinese companies, and provide a fair just and non discriminatory business environment for all businesses listed in the U.S.""
The China Securities and Regulatory Commission (CSRC) did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
In Hong Kong, the news prompted a sharp sell-off of the U.S.-listed Chinese companies which have also listed on the city's exchange in the past two years.
Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) shares - which debuted on Tuesday - closed down 9.65% Thursday,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd slipped 3.9%, JD (NASDAQ:JD).Com Inc fell 3.57% and Netease Inc was down 2.25%.
The falls came as the broader Hong Kong Hang Seng Index dropped 0.07% and a 1.2% fall in the Hang Seng Tech Index. The tech index has fallen 11.3% in March.
""A lot of investors thought the U.S. and the Biden administration would be more amicable towards China and things would be easier, but this news shows that it is going to be just as tough,"" Wealthy Securities Managing Director Louis Tse said.
DailyFX strategist Margaret Yang said the Chinese-listed stocks were also under pressure after it was reported that China was considering creating a state-backed joint venture with domestic tech firms to oversee user data they collect.
""The latter probably marks a further tightening of government control over the technology sector,"" she said.
But shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd, operator of the city's stock exchange, rose 3.35% which Kingston Securities director Dickie Wong said was the result of investors expecting more homecoming listings from China's U.S.-listed stocks.
The SEC fast-tracked the rules around how companies should submit documentation because it was required to issue them within 90 days of the Act becoming law. 
The SEC is now seeking public comments on a process for identifying companies that fail to meet the standards.
Some analysts said U.S.-listed Chinese firms may be unable to comply with U.S. accounting requirements because they could risk violating Chinese law.
""It is quite difficult for China to open the accounting of all U.S.-listed companies to U.S. regulatory agencies, especially for some listed companies that involve national security or national data,"" Everbright Sun Hung Kai strategist Kenny Ng said.
The new rules come amid simmering tensions between the United States and China, with bipartisan support for a tough U.S. approach.
Last week in Alaska the two countries held their first high-level meeting under President Joe Biden's administration, with both sides leveling sharp rebukes of the others' policies.
A flurry of 11th-hour efforts under the Trump administration led to dozens of Chinese companies being delisted from U.S. exchanges and over-the-counter trading platforms in recent months due to allegations of Chinese military affiliations.

The SEC said it was still assessing how to roll out the rest of the law's requirements, including the identification process and trading prohibition requirements.

(Reuters) - Cineworld will ask shareholders to approve an increase in its debt ceiling next month after the pandemic-stricken cinema group plunged to a $3 billion loss last year.
The Regal Cinemas owner, forced by coronavirus lockdowns to shut most of its almost 800 theatres in October and temporarily lay off about 45,000 staff, sunk to its first pretax loss as a listed company last year, after a $212.3 million profit in 2019. 
Its shares tumbled 9% to 94 pence in early Thursday trading, the worst performance on the UK mid-cap index.
The group, which is set to reopen its U.S. chains next month, said it had secured commitments for a new $213 million 7.5% convertible bond due in 2025 to bolster its finances. It also has waivers on its borrowing terms until June next year.
It expects to reopen cinemas in Britain and the rest of the world in May, and sees pent-up demand after strong industry reopenings in China, Japan and Australia.
Big-budget releases such as Marvel's superhero film ""Black Widow,"" the James Bond movie ""No Time to Die"" and ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" could also give a boost. 
But the London-listed company said there remained material uncertainty about its ability to stay in business, and further coronavirus restrictions, or delays in new movie releases, would probably require it to raise more funds.
Cineworld's net debt at the end of 2020 was $8.32 billion, more than four times its current market value. 
On top of coronavirus lockdowns, cinema groups are grappling with the soaring popularity of streaming services. 
SUPERHERO EFFORT
""Crawling back to profitability after such a big hit will require almost superhero levels of effort,"" Hargreaves analyst Susannah Streeter said.
Adjusted for one-off items, Cineworld's 2020 loss was $1.33 billion, compared with analysts' average forecast for a $1.29 billion loss, according to Refinitiv data. Revenue plunged 81% to $852.3 million. 

The group's debt is rated 'junk' by major credit rating agencies and its combined credit score, a measure of how likely a company is to default in the next year on a scale of 100 (very unlikely) to 1 (highly likely), was ""1"" as of March 25, data from Refinitiv Eikon shows.

""We are concerned about reports of forced labor in, and connected to, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR),"" Nike said in the statement.
""Nike does not source products from the XUAR and we have confirmed with our contract suppliers that they are not using textiles or spun yarn from the region.""
The social media fallout comes as relations between the United States and China have deteriorated in recent years.
In the latest development, the United States, the European Union, Britain and Canada on Monday imposed sanctions on Chinese officials for alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang. China retaliated with sanctions on European lawmakers and institutions.
Earlier this week, at least one Chinese online retailer appeared to drop H&M's products amid social media attacks on the Swedish company for saying it was ""deeply concerned"" about reports of forced labour in Xinjiang.
Activists and some Western politicians accuse China of using torture, forced labour and sterilisations in Xinjiang. China has denied these claims and says it is providing vocational training, and that its measures are needed to fight extremism.

Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the state-run Global Times urged Western companies on Wednesday to be ""highly cautious"" and not to ""suppress China's Xinjiang"" in a social media post.
To do so would ""undoubtedly arouse the anger of the Chinese public,"" he added. He did not single out any companies.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening mixed Thursday, amid cautious trading ahead of a meeting of EU leaders as the Covid-19 situation remains troublesome.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% higher, while CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%.
The main focus for European markets on Thursday will be a virtual meeting between EU leaders to discuss the third wave of Covid-19 cases hitting the region as well as the associated slow vaccine rollout. The leaders are likely to discuss possible curbs on vaccine exports, a source of tension with the neighboring U.K., whose immunization program is more advanced.
Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands have all recently tightened restrictions to combat the increasing number of infections, which are threatening to swamp the region’s hospitals.
France announced late Wednesday that it was ready to take tougher measures if the current ones fail to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
Staying with Covid news, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) announced late Wednesday that its vaccine, developed with the University of Oxford, was 76% effective at preventing symptomatic illness, only a slight drop from the 79% level it initially reported, but enough to raise fresh questions about the company's internal processes.
Elsewhere, the GfK German consumer climate index came in at -6.2 in April, a small improvement from the -12.9 seen in March, but still indicative of a pessimistic consumer in the region’s largest country as lockdowns weigh.
Earnings are scheduled from the likes of Deutsche Wohnen (OTC:DTCWY), Cineworld (LON:CINE) and Smiths Group (OTC:SMGZY).
Oil prices fell Thursday, reversing Wednesday’s gains which came after a container ship got stuck in the Suez Canal, blocking one of the most important supply routes in the world. This passage remains plugged, but demand concerns have returned to the fore.
While the focus has been on lockdowns in Europe, crucial developing economies like India and Brazil have also seen rising numbers of Covid-19 cases, Additionally, U.S. crude stocks jumped by 1.9 million barrels last week, according to official data from the Energy Information Administration.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% lower at $60.31 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.2% to $63.66.

455,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2021 02:45AM ET</span>",Westpac could lead Australian exit from New Zealand banking,"By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) -  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp's potential spin-off of its New Zealand unit due to tighter regulation could see some of the other three Australian-owned banks that make-up the bulk of the kiwi banking system follow its lead, investors and analysts said.
Seeking to safeguard the New Zealand banking system, an increasingly activist central bank has been progressively separating the operations and capital of the local units from their Australian parents.
The high costs involved have challenged the outlooks of the Australian-headquartered Big Four lenders, with analysts estimating their return on equity ratios could fall by between half and a third from the about 15% they used to deliver.
""All banks would be considering the same question, given changes in regulatory and capital requirements,"" said Sean Sequeira, chief investment officer at Australian Eagle Asset Management. 
The units of the Big Four - Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY), and Westpac - dominate over 85% of the New Zealand banking market.
In 2017, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) introduced a requirement to have the ability to run the subsidiaries locally within six hours notice, if needed, and in 2019 it asked them to almost double their local capital levels within seven years.
The capital requirements were extended by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
On Wednesday, freshly sanctioned by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand for the poor risk governance of its unit, Westpac said it was in the ""very early"" stages of assessing a demerger.
RBNZ said Westpac NZ had, for years, operated outside of its own risk settings for technology, and would have to raise its cash holdings until it improves governance.
""Westpac will not be the only Australian bank looking at its NZ operations,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) banking analysts Brian Johnson said.
Like its competitors, Westpac has been offloading businesses it considers non-core to focus on its home market, and spinning off the New Zealand units or selling them would be in line with that strategy.
This week, New Zealand also introduced more measures to cool its housing market that analysts expect will hit mortgage growth in the country.
With profitability becoming more challenging, ""we don't think an Australian bank owning a New Zealand bank makes sense,"" Johnson said.
Representatives from Commonwealth Bank declined to comment. 
ANZ, which owns New Zealand's largest lender, said that its unit remained a ""core part of who we are and our long-term future"", but it added that the capital changes introduced would ""have consequences"" without specifying what those were.
Similarly, NAB said its BNZ unit was a ""critical part"" of its growth strategy and that there were no major changes planned for its asset portfolio. 
""I think there's first mover advantage if Westpac moves first,"" said Jarrod Martin, a senior banking analyst at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). ""There are unlikely to be multiple buyers for banking businesses of that size.""
Westpac's New Zealand unit represents about 10% of its earnings and credit exposure. According to KPMG, it could be valued at over A$10 billion ($7.60 billion). 
""There is a lot of money floating around in New Zealand and around the world at the moment trying to find a home where they can earn some money,"" said John Kensington, KPMG's head of Banking and Finance in New Zealand. 
""So I think there would be definitely appetite for new attractive investments coming into the market, and goodness me, blue chip banking stocks would attract a lot of interest."" 
A full separation and a re-branding of the banks' operations however, would likely be very costly, Kensington added.

456,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 24, 2021 11:41PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Up, Despite Selloff of Chinese Tech Stocks","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up Thursday morning, as investors continue to weigh economic re-opening against inflation worries.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.01% by 11:34 PM ET (3:34 AM GMT). The Shenzhen Component was up 0.27%, even as investors digested a reported Chinese proposal to form a joint venture with some of the country’s biggest e-commerce and payments platforms to oversee the latter's lucrative consumer data.
The proposal, led by the People’s Bank of China, is still in early stages but is an indication that regulators are ramping up efforts to tighten control over the internet sector.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also mulling measures, widely expected to target Chinese firms particularly, to kick non-U.S. companies off the country’s stock exchanges if they do not comply with U.S. auditing standards and require them to disclose any government affiliations.
All this prompted a selloff of Chinese tech stocks.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.22%. The city suspended usage of the BioNTech SE/Pfizer Inc.” until further notice” on Wednesday, as reported manufacturing defects are investigated.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.71% and South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.50%. In Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.12%.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell both tempered their positive assessment of the economic recovery with warnings that the road towards recovery remains long as in their second day of testimony before Congress.
Investors continue to be wary of inflation risks, even as they place bets on which sectors of the stock market are best placed to benefit from faster growth.
“Rising interest rates, the uncertainty of tax policy, concern over inflation all remain top of mind for investors. However, none of these themes speak to the rising appetite for risk... we are seeing last year’s big gains underperform the broader market,” Peter Kenny of Kenny’s Commentary LLC and Strategic Board Solutions LLC, told Reuters.
Wednesday’s auction of five-year Treasury notes saw decent demand and kept U.S. yields steady ahead of a seven-year debt auction later in the day.
On the COVID-19 front, AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) said its COVID-19 vaccine developed with the University of Oxford was 76% effective at preventing symptomatic illness. The figure, from a fresh analysis of a major U.S. trial, was slightly lower than the level announced earlier in the week that was criticized for being outdated.
Meanwhile, the Ever Given continues to block the Suez Canal, the world’s most important waterway, disrupting shipping and causing oil prices to fall. Efforts to dislodge the container vessel via tugs and diggers have so far been unsuccessful but are continuing."

Tencent and Alibaba slid more than 5% in Hong Kong Thursday before paring losses, joining a U.S. selloff that wiped more than 20% off Chinese tech names including Tencent Music Entertainment and iQiyi Inc., Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU).’s Netflix-like streaming subsidiary. The Hang Seng Technology Index slid as much as 5% to its lowest since November.
The losses followed a warning from the Securities Exchange Commission that it’s taking steps to force accounting firms to let U.S. regulators review the financial audits of overseas companies -- the penalty for non-compliance being ejection from exchanges. That threat worsened sentiment in China’s giant tech sector just as Beijing is widening a crackdown on the country’s largest corporations, fearful of their growing clout after years of relatively unfettered expansion.
On Wednesday, Bloomberg News reported China’s government has proposed establishing a joint venture with local technology giants that would oversee the lucrative data they collect from hundreds of millions of consumers. The preliminary plan, which is being led by the People’s Bank of China, would mark a significant escalation in regulators’ attempts to tighten their grip over the country’s internet sector. Tencent executives sought to tamp down the impact of Beijing’s heightened scrutiny after reporting revenue growth that barely met expectations.
“Sentiment got hurt after Chinese technology stocks slumped overnight on Nasdaq,” while local reasons accelerated the selloffs, including a lack of upside surprises in Tencent earnings and worries about government regulation on the sector, said Daniel So, a CMB International analyst.

458,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2021 10:01PM ET</span>",SPAC trading pops deflate as 'exuberance and greed' depart,"By Joshua Franklin and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - Wall Street's appetite for new special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) shows signs of waning. 
First-day trading pops, or share price rises, for SPACs were commonplace earlier this year with gains rising to over 30% but have faded in March amid a broader selloff in many companies that have agreed to go public through a SPAC merger. 
All but one of the 15 SPACs that started trading this week closed below their initial public offering (IPO) price of $10 per unit on their first day of trading, according to financial markets platform Dealogic and market data. Many other deals are also trading below their IPO prices. 
SPACs are shell companies with no operating business and that raise money with the purpose of merging with an operating company to take public. 
SPAC stocks have traditionally traded close to their $10 IPO price until they announce a merger. However, exuberance over the last few months resulted in many being bid up on speculation that the SPAC would ultimately merge with a company that would be well-received by the market. 
So far this month, the biggest first-day pop has been a 3.5% gain for Supernova Partners Acquisition Co II Ltd on March 1, compared with a January high of 32.5% for Altimeter Growth Corp 2 and a February high of 24.9% for CM Life Sciences II Inc.
The decline in enthusiasm has set in a week after news that SPACs had surpassed the $83.4 billion through IPOs the sector raised in all of 2020, which had been a record year.
Some 294 SPACs have raised $95.7 billion so far this year, with a further 229 seeking a little over $58 billion in the pre-IPO stage, according to information provider SPAC Research. 
""We're seeing so many SPACs. There's a finite amount of capital at the IPO level that is available for SPACs and there's not an endless pool of capital,"" said Harris Arch, SPAC Portfolio Manager at asset management firm DuPont (NYSE:DD) Capital. 
The rocky performance of new deals has the potential to slow the pace of new IPOs given that investors can buy existing SPACs below $10 instead of purchasing new SPACs at a $10 price. 
Investors have also voiced concerns over the market reaction to SPACs when they announce merger targets. The likes of Thoma Bravo Advantage and Jaws Spitfire Acquisition Corp have seen their shares fall after confirming merger targets. 
""The market has sold off tech, a lot of the SPACs are tech-focused. People are also beginning to question the euphoria and retail investors are unable to keep up with all these names,"" said Barry Sternlicht, chairman of Starwood Capital Group and of Jaws Spitfire. 
This is in stark contrast to double-digit gains on many announcements only weeks ago. 

""The frenzy and the exuberance and greed we saw a couple months ago have quickly left the market,"" Arch said. (This story refiles to add dropped word in final sentence)

460,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2021 08:10PM ET</span>",Mastercard battles return of $19 billion UK class action,"By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - A specialist London court will this week re-consider allowing an historic 14 billion pound ($19 billion) class action against Mastercard (NYSE:MA) to proceed, which could entitle adults in Britain to about 300 pounds each if successful.
Former financial ombudsman Walter Merricks, who alleges that Mastercard overcharged more than 46 million people in Britain over nearly 16 years, hopes the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) will certify the case after the UK Supreme Court overruled objections to it proceeding in December.
A two-day court hearing will kick off on Thursday and will determine the fate of Britain's first mass consumer claim -- and clarify the rules for a string of other competition class actions that have stalled in its wake.
Merricks, who is being advised by U.S.-headquartered law firm Quinn Emanuel, alleges Mastercard charged excessive ""interchange"" fees – the fees retailers pay credit card companies when consumers use a card to shop - between May 1992 and June 2008 and that those fees were passed on to consumers as retailers raised prices.
Mastercard says the claim should not be brought, that people received valuable benefits from its payments technology and that the lawsuit is driven by U.S. lawyers and backed by organisations focused on making money for themselves.
""We fundamentally disagree with this claim...,"" it said.
THE DECEASED, COMPOUND INTEREST IN FOCUS
Legal arguments this week are expected to revolve in part around whether estates of the deceased should have a claim and whether compound interest should accrue, which are ""significant"" for the ultimate size of the claim, Mastercard says.
The case was filed in 2016, one year after the CAT was nominated to oversee Britain's U.S.-style ""opt-out"" class action regime for breaches of UK or EU competition law -- and 12 years after the European Commission ruled that Mastercard had charged unlawful cross-border interchange fees over the period. 
In such cases, UK-based members of a defined group are automatically bound into legal action unless they opt out.
But the CAT blocked the lawsuit in 2017 because it thought it unsuitable for collective proceedings, triggering drawn-out appeals and causing a bottleneck for other class actions.
If the case proceeds, Merricks is expected to need to prove that Mastercard's domestic fees were illegal -- and to quantify the costs passed on to consumers. 
Litigation funder Innsworth Capital has stumped up 60.1 million pounds to cover the legal costs of the case, including 15 million pounds for Mastercard's legal costs if the claim fails. It will be paid from any unclaimed damages awarded, after agreement from the CAT.
Typically, take-up by claimants is low in such claims. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission found in 2019 that only about 9% made a claim after successful consumer class actions.

461,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2021 07:10PM ET</span>",Kona EV owners say Hyundai mishandling recall for battery fires,"By Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - Some owners of Hyundai Motor's Kona electric vehicles say the South Korean automaker is bungling a major recall with delays and poor communication, and risks losing buyers as it targets the No.3 spot in the fast-growing sector.
Hyundai said last month it would replace the battery systems in some 82,000 electric vehicles globally at a cost of $900 million following fires in 15 Kona EVs. 
But Hyundai has yet to convey a clear plan to owners on when and how they can expect to have a potential fire hazard they are driving fixed, some of the owners have complained.
""When I asked Hyundai's repair centre when exactly my Kona EV will be getting a battery replacement, they just told me that they would put me ahead in the line, but I haven't received the exact date yet,"" a 34-year-old Kona EV owner in Seoul surnamed Kim told Reuters.
Owners who spoke to Reuters declined to give their full names, citing concerns about privacy and a potential backlash from Hyundai.
""There were only a few EV options when I bought my Kona EV back in 2018, but now that there are way more EV models available, I don't think I would go for Hyundai again,"" Kim said.
SAFETY PRIORITY
In response to Reuters queries, Hyundai said the safety of customers was its top priority.
""Hyundai will continue striving to take necessary actions to prevent customer inconvenience from the ongoing recall,"" it said, without addressing questions regarding owner complaints about delays and a lack of communication.
Hyundai has said battery replacements would be available in South Korea starting next week. 
But the lack of clarity has led owners to turn to social media to air their frustrations and to seek compensation. 
In November, 173 Kona EV owners filed a class-action lawsuit, seeking 8 million won ($7,000) compensation each for what they say is the reduced value of their EVs and other losses. 
Lee Hang-koo, an executive adviser at the Korea Automotive Technology Institute, said there could be potential issues with battery supplies and the automaker should communicate more clearly with owners.
""Hyundai should be straightforward with its consumers and let them know what's going on - whether or not battery sourcing has been difficult,"" Lee said, noting competition in the EV market is getting fiercer. ""If Hyundai falls behind on this EV race, that would be problematic. In that sense, they should review how they treat their customers."" 
Hyundai's Ioniq 5, launched last month, is the first in a planned family of electric vehicles (EV) built on a common platform that it hopes will propel it to become the third-largest global EV maker by 2025.
'WASTE OF TIME'
The vehicle fires, dating from within weeks of the Kona EV's 2018 launch, have caused no injuries or fatalities so far. 
In October, Hyundai offered a software upgrade to address the issue. But following a consumer outcry and at least one fire in a vehicle that had been recalled for the upgrade, Hyundai agreed to replace the batteries, made by LG Chem's battery division LG Energy Solution. [nL4N2K10FO]
The 75,680 Kona EVs affected by the recall account for nearly 70% of the 111,000 units sold over the past three years in Hyundai's major markets of United States, Europe and South Korea. 
Another Kona EV owner, a 35-year-old engineer surnamed Lee, said the software update had substantially reduced the battery's charging capacity and he will never buy a Hyundai vehicle again.
Hyundai, in a statement on its website, said the limiting the batteries' charging capacity to 90% until the battery was replaced was an effective way to reduce fire risks.
Lee said he had even been refused service at a public charging station when trying to recharge his Kona EV.
""These recalls already have already wasted my time and I have to charge my car worrying about fire risks,"" Lee said. ""On top of that, I have to worry about what other people think about my car.""

GSK said an investigation into Slaoui's conduct, performed on its behalf by an independent law firm, had substantiated allegations of harassment and inappropriate contact, adding the inquiry was ongoing.
The termination of Slaoui’s contract follows receipt of a letter containing the allegations of inappropriate conduct toward the GSK employee, the company said in a statement, adding that the allegations stemmed from when Slaoui was an employee of GSK.
The company's London-listed shares closed down 1%.
In a letter to staff and reviewed by Reuters, GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley said the company has been dealing with the allegations since February.
""Dr. Slaoui’s behaviours represent an abuse of his leadership position and violate our company policies, our values and our commitment to Trust - a commitment I know is shared by all of you,"" she said.
Appointed by former U.S. President Donald Trump as OWS's chief adviser last year, Slaoui oversaw more than $10 billion in government funding for vaccine development and production. He resigned from the post in January ahead of the incoming administration of President Joe Biden. 
Galvani is a bioelectronic medicines company set up in 2016 by 55% owner GSK and Verily, the life sciences unit of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. 
A GSK spokesman said U.S. law firm Morgan Lewis had carried out the investigation, which was led by partner Grace Speights, 
Her high-profile work on misconduct claims and corporate diversity includes membership of Alphabet's advisory council, set up last year to oversee the technology firm's efforts to promote diversity and inclusion.
Prior to his role at Galvani, Slaoui spent nearly 30 years at GSK and held various leadership roles including head of pharmaceutical research & development and chairman of its vaccines division. He left the GSK board in 2017.
Executive behaviour and treatment of employees have been under scrutiny over the past few years as the #MeToo social media movement prompted a string of high-profile boardroom departures.
Slaoui joined Centessa Pharma last month as chief scientific officer after leaving OWS. 
Since 2017, he has been a partner at Medicxi, the investment firm that founded Centessa by merging 10 of its portfolio companies.
Centessa did not have an immediate comment. Calls and messages to Medicxi and an external communications firm were not answered.
Slaoui said he will take leave of absence from his current professional responsibilities effective immediately.

Christopher Corsico, senior vice president of development at GSK and a board member at Galvani, has been appointed as the new chair, GSK said. Amy Altshul, senior vice president Legal, R&D and global commercial franchises at GSK, has also been appointed to the board, it said.

463,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2021 06:45PM ET</span>","Canada border agents had valid interest in Huawei CFO, prosecutor tells extradition judge","By Sarah Berman and Moira Warburton
VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Canadian Border agents had legitimate reasons to question Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou for three hours before her arrest by federal police, a prosecutor said in court on Wednesday, pushing back at defense arguments.
Meng's lawyers contend that abuses of process took place in the lead-up to her arrest in December 2018 that should invalidate the U.S. extradition request.
Meng, 49, was arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on a U.S warrant at Vancouver International Airport. She has denied any wrongdoing and is fighting her extradition.
She is accused by the United States of misleading HSBC about her company's business dealings in Iran, causing the bank to violate U.S. sanctions.
Diba Majzub, a prosecutor for the Canadian government, responded to accusations by Meng's lawyers that Canadian police and border agents carried out a covert criminal investigation on behalf of the FBI under the guise of a border examination before her arrest.
Majzub said there was ""no evidence"" of such a plan and the border agents had their own grounds for investigating Meng's eligibility to enter Canada. He said Canadian Border Services Agency officers (CBSA) noted criminality and national security concerns in reports created on the day of her arrest.
""You have officials from two agencies investigating the same conduct but for different reasons - both of which are legitimate,"" Majzub told the judge. 
Majzub said the RCMP ""gained no advantage"" by allowing CBSA to go first, and that police did not suggest any particular line of questioning or request that electronic devices be searched, making it ""impossible to ascribe a nefarious motive"" to police.
Shortly after Meng was detained, China arrested two Canadians on espionage charges. The pair faced trials in the past week, although it is not known when their verdicts will be announced.

Meng's case is set to wrap up in May.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 closed lower on Wednesday as optimism about the economic recovery by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was unable to halt a decline in technology shares for a second straight day.
The remarks by the top two U.S. economic officials mirrored what they told Congress the day before, with Powell saying on Wednesday the most likely case is 2021 will be ""a very, very strong year.""
While the three major indexes closed lower, investors sold last year's big performers, the technology shares that doubled the Nasdaq index from year-ago lows, and bought the underpriced value-oriented stocks poised to do well in the recovery.
Wall Street has seesawed this week as a months-long rotation into economically sensitive energy and financial shares, which have gained on an outlook for economic growth, was briefly upended by falling bond yields that prompted beaten-down technology stocks to rise.
The 10-year yield fell to about 1.6%, a slide that in recent days had propped up tech stocks that rely on low-cost capital. Value-oriented shares on Wednesday closed flat, outpacing a 1.4% decline in growth stocks, which include tech shares.
Investors have focused on the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, pondering whether there is room for long-term interest rates to run, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management.
""We're in a little bit of a lull here. We know that the economy is primed to begin to really accelerate in the second quarter,"" Kelly said. ""But we haven't seen that acceleration yet so that's what we're waiting for.""
Adding to an upward bias for most of the session was data showing U.S. factory activity picked up in early March amid strong growth in new orders. But supply chain disruptions continued to exert cost pressures on manufacturers, keeping inflation fears in focus. 
""Everybody's bullish about the prospects of a recovery right now,"" said David Yepez, lead equity analyst and portfolio manager at Exencial Wealth Advisors. ""In order for the market to bottom we need to have more fear, and I don't feel like the market has fear right now."" 
Financials gained 0.4% and industrials rose 0.7%, while energy jumped 2.5% as crude prices rebounded from a 6% fall in the last session. [O/R]
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.09 points, or 0.01%, to 32,420.06. The S&P 500 lost 21.38 points, or 0.55%, to 3,889.14 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 265.81 points, or 2.01%, to 12,961.89.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.72 billion shares, compared with the 14.0 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) led decliners on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. 
 Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) retreated 2.3% after earlier gains as the company, in its efforts to expand chipmaking capacity, announced plans to spend as much as $20 billion to build two factories in Arizona and open its factories to outside customers.
U.S.-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor dropped 5.2%, while semiconductor equipment makers  Lam Research Corp  (NASDAQ:LRCX), Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ:AMAT) and ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) rose. Applied Materials was the third-biggest boost on the S&P 500, after oil giants  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM).
Bitcoin gained after Tesla's founder, Elon Musk, said the company's electric vehicles can now be bought using bitcoin and the option will be available outside the United States later this year.
 GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) tumbled 33.8% after the videogame retailer said it might cash in on a meteoric rise in its share price to fund its e-commerce expansion.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.32-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 42 new highs and 128 new lows.

(Reuters) -WestJet Airlines is restoring some suspended domestic routes beginning in June, as executives hope that a pickup in COVID-19 vaccinations can salvage summer travel, Canada's second-largest carrier said on Wednesday.
While Canada has trailed the United States in the pace of its vaccine rollout, supplies are expected to ramp up over the next two weeks, and Canada's top vaccine coordinator expects there should be enough to give every citizen a first dose by the end of June.
""That's the type of encouraging news that's allowed us to make today's announcement,"" Andy Gibbons, WestJet's director for government relations, told reporters. 
Onex Corp-owned Westjet would resume flights to five airports serving Atlantic Canada and Quebec, beginning on June 24.
Canada's largest carrier, Air Canada, also plans to resume summer service to certain destinations that are seasonal or were suspended due to COVID-19. 
Gibbons called for government to transition away by May 1 from crippling requirements that oblige international travelers to self-isolate for up to three days in a hotel, before completing a 14-day quarantine.
He said WestJet's announcement was unrelated to a government demand to protect regional routes as part of talks to reach a financial aid package for the aviation sector.
Calgary-based WestJet, which currently operates at around 10% of pre-pandemic traffic, is restoring routes of ""its own volition,"" said its chief commercial officer, John Weatherill.

Later in the day, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acknowledged in a radio interview that the country needed to move faster on vaccinations, but he was optimistic about summer. 
""We are going to have all adults fully vaccinated by September and, looking at the horizons some of the provinces have put forward, I think it's possible that many, many Canadians will have their first doses by the time summer rolls around.""

471,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 24, 2021 04:22PM ET</span>","Cruise Lines, Viacom, DigitalOcean: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Tech stocks weighed on markets Wednesday, dampening the Dow and pulling the Nasdaq down triple-digits.
Early enthusiasm about the reopening trade lifted travel stocks and cyclicals, but the momentum faded as the afternoon session moved closer to the closing bell.
It could be just a breather as stimulus checks continue to go out to qualifying individuals, something many expect could be spent on stocks or on discretionary items like restaurants and local businesses. 
The Fed continued its mantra that it would support the economic recovery anyway it could, and that it wasn’t worried about inflation. The 10-year Treasury, which spiked over 1.7% last week, traded around 1.6% on Wednesday.
The weekly jobless claims data is due out Thursday morning, and the trend could confirm the idea that the recovery is spreading along with vaccinations and the easing of business restrictions. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Government says no cruises, yet
Cruise lines lost the wind in their sails (and sales) on Wednesday after the Centers for Disease Control said its no-sail order is in effect until November, dashing hopes that the government would move it back to July 1, as the industry had requested. 
It’s been more than a year since cruise ships could leave from U.S. ports, and no-sail orders have forced operators to look to the Caribbean and other locations where business isn’t as restricted. Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corporation (NYSE:CCL) fell nearly 2% on Wednesday and  Royal Caribbean  Cruises Ltd (NYSE:RCL) fell 2.7%.
2. Viacom makes investors mad
ViacomCBS Inc (NASDAQ:VIAC)was already down 9% on Tuesday, but the shares plunged another 20% on Wednesday after the company priced a $3 billion share offering. The proceeds are supposed to be used to build its streaming operations, something Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said was the right strategy but “hard to execute.”
After falling so far, investors might look to Viacom as a buy opportunity when markets reopen Thursday.
3. DigitalOcean debuts
The small-scale cloud infrastructure provider listed on the NYSE on Wednesday at $41.50 a share, which is actually 12% below its $47 IPO price in a twist on recent IPOs. They closed down 9.6% and were drifting lower in after-hours trading.
 DigitalOcean Holdings  Inc (NYSE:DOCN) competes with giants like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the business of offering computing and storage to others so they don’t have to run their own data centers.

472,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 24, 2021 04:18PM ET</span>",Chinese Stocks’ 15% Plunge Shows What Happens When Stimulus Ends,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s stock market is showing the world what happens when central banks and governments start exiting pandemic-era stimulus -- and it’s not pretty.
The CSI 300 Index has lost 15% since climbing to a 13-year high last month as concern about tighter monetary policy replaced optimism about the economic recovery. Like elsewhere, the rally had been led by investors chasing a small number of stocks, many of whom piled in at the top as a frenzy grew. Now the gauge is trailing MSCI Inc.’s global benchmark by the most since 2016 this month and the most popular mutual funds are getting crushed.
Central banks around the world are dealing with the aftermath of last year’s multiple interest-rate cuts and trillions of dollars in stimulus. Some, like the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have said they’ll stick to their loose policies for now. Others are being forced to act by inflation risks. Brazil last week became the first Group of 20 nation to lift borrowing costs, with Turkey and Russia following suit. Norway is also turning more hawkish.
Investors in February began pricing in higher U.S. growth and consumer prices, bringing forward their opinion of how soon the Fed would be forced to raise interest rates. While that’s meant technical corrections in overpriced markets like the Nasdaq, none of the world’s stock benchmarks are falling faster than China’s.
“China’s stock-market rout may reveal the challenge for stimulus withdrawal globally given that China is ‘first in, first out’ in the pandemic,” said Peiqian Liu, a China economist at Natwest Markets in Singapore.
China has reasons to taper stimulus faster than other major economies. A tighter grip on the pandemic, a fixation with deleveraging, and a lack of investment choices for its citizens are some of them. But there’s little doubt the nation’s stock market has led the way since Covid-19 was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
As the virus began to take root in the first two months of 2020, the CSI 300 slumped 12%, while global stocks continued to climb to new highs. When the MSCI All-Country World Index began sinking a few weeks later amid evidence the virus was spreading globally, China’s stock market was already rebounding on optimism more stimulus was on the way. By July, the rally had made local equities among the world’s hottest. China’s index peaked on Feb. 10, having surged 65% from last year’s low, before tanking.
Analysts at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG cut their recommendation of Chinese stocks to the equivalent of sell this week, saying the country’s markets are likely to “suffer a bigger payback” than others from the gains seen during the pandemic. That’s the brokerage’s second downgrade of Chinese equities in five weeks.
“We took our profit on China A-shares in early February, given the prospects of tighter domestic macro policies,” Jean-Louis Nakamura, Asia Pacific chief investment officer for Lombard Odier Darier Hentsch, wrote in a client newsletter this week.
The Communist Party has good reason to be concerned about excessive stimulus. When the global financial crisis hit in 2008, China turned to credit to bolster its economy. The resulting pile of debt to this day threatens the stability of the country’s financial system. Inflows into onshore stocks and bonds last year are also fueling concern among officials about distortions to asset prices, especially if the money starts to flow back out.
Lessons from the past mean there’s a greater focus in China on the risks caused by too much liquidity, both domestically and abroad. The government has revived a campaign to cut leverage that was shelved amid the trade war with the U.S., as well as efforts to limit the impact of “hot money.”
“China’s policy exit remains one of the most important uncertainties to its own recovery and financial markets ahead,” Li-Gang Liu, managing director and chief China economist at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., wrote in a report this month.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 reversed its intraday gains to close lower Wednesday as tech stocks failed to take advantage of falling bond yields, with analysts warning of further choppy trades ahead.      
The S&P 500 was down 0.53%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.01%, or 3 points, the Nasdaq Composite was down 2.01%.
Unlike in recent sessions, falling United States 10-Year yields didn't prove to be a savior for growth stocks, as a sea of red washed over highly-valued tech stocks. 
The so-called Fab 5 tech stocks including Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were in the red. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which collectively make up a quarter of the S&P 500, ended lower. 
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), meanwhile, gave up its gains to fall 2% as the chipmaker unveiled a $20-billion spending plan to build two new factories that will bolster the U.S. chip supply chain to some of the biggest firms including Microsoft and Google.
The wild swings in the stocks are expected to continue as markets search for direction. 
""The markets are trying to find their next direction / path here- and will typically trade in a choppy, range-bound manner until they do so,"" Janney Montgomery Scott said in a note.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two groups of U.S. Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday urged President Joe Biden to reinstate tough Obama-era vehicle emissions standards through 2025 and do more to shift the U.S. toward electric vehicles, according to separate letters seen by Reuters that are not yet public.
A group of more than 70 U.S. House Democrats led by Representative Doris Matsui urged Biden to set tough emissions rules that ensure ""60% of the new passenger cars and trucks sold are zero-emission by 2030,"" while 10 U.S. senators led by Democrat Edward Markey urged Biden ""to set a date by which new sales of fossil fuel vehicles will end entirely.""
Markey's letter, which was also signed by Senators Richard Durbin, Sheldon Whitehouse, Elizabeth Warren, Jeff Merkley and others says it is essential ""to ensure that we are on a trajectory to achieve the near-zero emission fleet that scientists have called for by 2050."" 
The House letter, which is signed by Democrats, including Carolyn Maloney, Jerrold Nadler, Anna Eshoo, Adam Smith and Rashida Tlaib, urges Biden to adopt ""ambitious post-2026 standards that put us on the path to having all light-duty vehicles be zero-emission by 2035.""
The White House did not immediately comment.
The Trump administration in March 2020 finalized a rollback of fuel economy standards to require 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026, well below the 5% yearly boosts in Obama-administration rules it discarded.
On Monday, California's two senators Alex Padilla and Dianne Feinstein also urged Biden to set a date to end gas-powered vehicle sales.
In September, California Governor Gavin Newsom directed new regulations to require all new cars and passenger trucks sold in California to be zero-emission by 2035.
California's senators said Biden should use a compromise deal that California struck with automakers, including Ford, Honda, BMW and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) that falls between the Trump administration and Obama-era requirements.
The Center for Biological Diversity estimates the California deal improves fuel efficiency 3.7% year over year between 2022-2026.

Some environmental groups say that does not go far enough, while some automakers think the California deal is overly stringent.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) told all but critical staff at its operation in Indian IT capital Bengaluru to return to working from home on Wednesday, reversing moves to get staff back to one of its biggest global offices as coronavirus infections in the city grew.
India earlier reported a new variant of the coronavirus as new infections and deaths nationwide hit the highest this year, prompting the imposition of new restrictions in some states.
Bengaluru reported 1,280 new infections on Tuesday, according to city data, and several sources at Goldman told Reuters that teams had been told to return to working from home ahead of an all-office townhall call at 2 p.m. local time on Thursday.
In March so far, nearly 14,000 new cases have been reported, more than twice the number recorded in February.
""This hasn't come as a surprise given how coronavirus cases have been rising in the city, specifically in the area where the office is located,"" one employee said, asking not to be named.
""There's no word on how long the work-from-home will continue but my guess is that we won't be returning to office for the next three to four months.""
The Bengaluru office seats about 7,000 employees - the bulk of its Indian workforce - who are involved in a variety of functions including technology, finance and human resources, while also providing support for business lines such as trading and the consumer banking business, Marcus.
Goldman Chief Executive David Solomon has been among the most keen of major banking leaders on getting staff back to the office, telling employees on a global conference call earlier this month that he hopes to have them back by this summer.
Asked about the Indian moves, a spokesman for the bank in New York said: ""We continue to work on plans to return our people to office safely, and those plans will vary division by division, country by country, city by city.
""The safety of our people is our most important priority and we will remain flexible as we monitor evolving government guidelines and the uneven global vaccine rollout.""

A spokesman for the bank in India did not respond to texts and emails requesting comment out of local business hours.

(Reuters) - Shares of Reddit-favorite  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) fell nearly 18% on Wednesday, a day after the videogame retailer said it might cash in on a meteoric rise in its share price to fund its e-commerce expansion.
GameStop shares have surged nearly 900% so far this year as retail investors have acted in concert on Reddit forums to bid up prices of heavily shorted stocks.
The company said on Tuesday after reporting quarterly results that it has been considering since January whether to increase the size of the $100 million share sale that it originally announced in December.
GameStop had previously decided against the move as it was restricted under U.S. financial regulations from selling shares because it had not yet updated investors on its earnings.
The stock sale program was assigned to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), whose research arm on Wednesday raised its price target by a whopping $160 to $175, but kept its rating at ""hold"".
That is much higher than the median price target of $25, according to Refinitiv data, and marks the first time a Wall Street brokerage matched its price projections with GameStop's current trading levels.
Reddit's WallStreetBets forum was buzzing about another potential short squeeze, which had sent GameStop's shares as high as 2,300% in January to a record high of $483.
A short squeeze occurs when investors who have bet against a stock need to buy it at much higher levels to cover losing positions.
Short interest in GameStop has since fallen to about 15% of the stock's float as of Wednesday from a peak of 141% in the first week of 2021, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners.
The shares were last trading at $149.92. The company on Tuesday reported a ninth straight decline in quarterly sales and said it would close more retail stores and exit unprofitable businesses, underscoring Wall Street's concerns about its business.
GameStop also skipped a question-and-answer session after the results.
Wedbush analysts downgraded the stock to ""underperform"" from ""neutral"", saying the short squeeze had boosted the share price to levels that were completely disconnected from the fundamentals of business.
Billionaire investor and Chewy (NYSE:CHWY).com co-founder Ryan Cohen, who is on GameStop's board, expects to transform the retailer into an e-commerce firm that can take on big-box players  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and technology firms such as  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony Corp (T:6758).
""We continue to be very skeptical on GME's efforts to address ... the fact that its core market in new and pre-owned physical console gaming is shrinking at a rapid pace,"" Curtis Nagle, an analyst at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s research arm, said in a client note.
Nagle has a $10 price target and an ""underperform"" rating on GameStop's stock.

Of the seven analysts covering GameStop, none has a ""buy"" or a higher rating on the stock.

DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors Co extended production cuts in North America on Wednesday due to a worldwide semiconductor chip shortage that has impacted the auto sector.
The U.S. automaker said its Wentzville, Missouri, assembly plant would be idled during the weeks beginning March 29 and April 5. It will extend down time at its plant in Lansing, Michigan, which has been idled since March 15, by two weeks.
The action was factored into GM's prior forecast that it could shave up to $2 billion off this year's profit, spokesman David Barnas said. GM did not disclose how much volume would be lost by the move, but said it intended to make up as much lost production as possible later in the year.
The chip shortage came as North American auto plants were shut for two months during the COVID-19 pandemic last year and chip orders were canceled, and as demand surged from the consumer electronics industry as people worked from home and played video games. That's now left carmakers competing for chips.
Semiconductors are used extensively in cars, including to monitor engine performance, manage steering or automatic windows, and in sensors used in parking and entertainment systems. 
Vehicles affected by the GM production cuts include the mid-sized pickup trucks, the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon in Missouri, and the Cadillac CT4 and CT5 and Chevy Camaro cars in Michigan.
Meanwhile, GM said its San Luis Potosi, Mexico, assembly plant, idled since Feb. 8, will resume production with two shifts beginning the week of April 5. 
Also on Wednesday, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said it would cut output this week of the Transit van at its Kansas City, Missouri, assembly plant due to the shortage. Production of the flagship F-150 pickup at the plant is not affected. 
Last week, GM said it was building certain 2021 light-duty full-size pickups without a fuel management module, hurting their fuel economy performance by one mile per gallon.
Ford and Stellantis have said they would partially assemble and park their large pickups to finish later when chip supplies allow.
Japanese automaker Honda Motor Co on Tuesday said it would further cut North American production due to supply-chain issues, including the chip shortage.
Exacerbating the shortage was a recent fire at a Renesas Electronics chip plant in Japan. Barnas said GM was assessing the impact of the blaze. Ford is doing the same, while Stellantis and Mazda said their operations have not yet been affected.

German auto supplier Continental said it was assessing the impact of the fire and was in ""daily contact"" with Renesas. 
""We are considering all possible measures, including the evaluation of other alternative technical solutions,"" Continental said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is pressing a U.S. appeals court to immediately reinstate a 2016 Obama regulation more than doubling penalties for automakers who fail to meet fuel efficiency requirements, according to court filings.
The Trump administration on Jan. 14 delayed the start of higher penalties until the 2022 model year. Tesla told the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals the Trump action was ""unlawful"" and ""diminishes the value of performance-based incentives that electric vehicle manufacturers, such as Tesla, accrue under the standards"".
Although President Joe Biden supports tougher emissions standards, his administration opposes Tesla's request for immediate court action, saying the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is scrutinizing the Trump action on penalties and will complete its review in six months. A group representing major automakers also opposes immediate action.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Tesla first asked the appeals court to act on March 4.
In a filing Monday it said that the government's position that there was no immediate harm to allowing the Biden administration time to review the Trump decision ""ignores the ongoing impacts"" on the credit-trading market.
Tesla, whose electric cars produce zero emissions, sells credits to other automakers to reduce their burden of complying with the regulations, and argues that the Trump rule change makes those credits less valuable.
NHTSA said in its interim final rule issued in the final days of the Trump administration that it expected its final rule to cut future burdens on industry by up to $1 billion annually.
Last month, 15 states sued NHTSA for delaying the adoption of the higher penalties for companies that fail to meet fuel efficiency requirements. The Sierra Club and National Resources Defense Council have also sued NHTSA for delaying penalties.
Congress in 2015 ordered federal agencies to adjust civil penalties to account for inflation. In response, NHTSA issued rules hiking fines to $14 from $5.50 for every 0.1 mile per gallon a new vehicle consumes in excess of required standards.

Environmental groups note U.S. fuel economy fines lost nearly 75% of their original value because they had been increased only once - from $5 to $5.50 in 1997 - since 1975.

PARIS (Reuters) - Brigitte Becker knows that her asthma leaves her vulnerable to COVID-19, but brief suspensions of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine in some countries over a small number of blood-clotting cases have deepened her resolve to await a different shot.
""Some say the vaccine leads to thrombosis, that it's rare but that it can happen,"" the 59-year-old nursery minder said. ""I'd rather hold out.""
Millions of doses of the AstraZeneca shot have been safely administered around the world and the EU's medicines watchdog has reaffirmed it safe for all ages, prompting most of the states which briefly halted it to resume giving the jab.
Breaking from this guidance however, France's health regulator said only those over 55 should for now receive the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Becker said she would not hesitate to get vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech shot or  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s vaccine. But France is not offering either to her age group.
Those in France who do not trust the Anglo-Swedish shot cite concerns about the speed of development and possible side effects. Remarks by President Emmanuel Macron in early February that it was ""quasi-ineffective"" for people of retirement age did little to reassure. 
Macron later said he would have the AstraZeneca jab himself if offered it.
Regulators around the world have repeatedly said speed will not compromise safety and vaccine developers have said they will not cut corners in testing for safety and efficacy.
The quicker results have stemmed from conducting parallel trials that are usually done in sequence and can take years. 
Trials for  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), AstraZeneca, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) shots have shown only temporary side-effects.
""We're completely lost. We don't know who to believe,"" said Becker.

AstraZeneca says its vaccine is safe and effective. Citing phase 3 U.S. trial data on Monday, it said no increased risk of thrombosis had been identified. 
Like other wealthy countries, France has made the AstraZeneca shot a pillar of its vaccine rollout. But its faltering campaign has been slowed by bureaucracy, public mistrust and Europe-wide supply delays. 
With all the big vaccine makers experiencing production problems, France cannot afford for people to snub the AstraZeneca shot.
A government spokesman said on Tuesday the COVID-19 situation was worsening across the country. The number of patients in intensive care with the virus has risen to its highest this year.
New restrictions closing non-essential retail and limiting how far people can travel came into effect in Paris and some other regions last week and could be introduced elsewhere. 
A YouGov poll published this week showed the suspensions had damaged confidence in the vaccine's safety in France and elsewhere in Europe. In France, 61% of respondents considered the AstraZeneca shot unsafe compared with 43% in late February.
A French health ministry official said more time was needed to tell if the suspension had really hurt public confidence. 
Doubts still linger in the mind of Chrystel Geoffrey, an administrative clerk in the town hall of Rueil Malmaison, a Paris suburb. Aged 41 and in good health, her turn for the vaccine won't come until the summer.
""I still don't know if I will accept AstraZeneca or not,"" she said, adding that she would have not qualms receiving the Pfizer vaccine. ""There hasn't been the same negative or anxiety-inducing feedback surrounding that vaccine.""
General practitioner Anne Pailliez said she had not received any cancellations for the AstraZeneca shot, though limited supplies meant those who had come forward so far tended to be keen to get inoculated. 
However, difficulties might arise when the target groups were widened further, she said.

""I see some patients grimace when we tell them they'll have to have AstraZeneca,"" she said. ""Persuading them might be tricky.""

493,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2021 11:35AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Incoming Petrobras CEO says he has no plans to push out executives,"By Rodrigo Viga Gaier
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Joaquim Silva e Luna, the incoming CEO of Brazil's state-run oil company Petrobras, told Reuters that at least part of the executive board could stay on when he takes over in April, a signal that he is not planning a wholesale shake-up of management.
The former defense minister and army general added, however, that at least two executives are planning to follow current Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco out the door on their own volition. 
In February, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro announced he was replacing Castello Branco with Luna, amid disagreements over a string of domestic fuel price increases.
Castello Branco's sacking sent jitters throughout financial markets. In years past, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as Petrobras is formally known, was forced to subsidize local pump prices, costing the company tens of billions of dollars.
In more general terms, Brasilia had until recent years called most of the shots at the company, with political appointees often occupying technical positions within the firm.
In a phone interview with Reuters on Tuesday night, Luna said he would attempt to keep the firm free of inappropriate political interference.
""Political appointments aren't part of my management ideas. I've already dealt with political requests. I didn't accept it and it wasn't easy,"" said Luna, who previously managed the Itaipu hydroelectric dam on the border with Paraguay. ""I believe people have to be chosen based on proven competence.""
Luna said he had spoken informally with Castello Branco. He added that he understood at least two executives were planning to leave, though the incoming CEO did not specify which ones. 
""I think that perhaps more people could leave, not immediately, but they'd do it by themselves,"" he said. ""I'm not planning to arrive changing everything, and there won't be any change coming from me.""
Petrobras did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.
Luna and government officials have suggested in recent weeks the possibility of creating a government ""cushion"" to protect Brazilians from fuel price volatility without requiring Petrobras to pick up the tab.
The government has not yet formalized any plans, Luna said, but he added that he hopes such plans are finalized when he arrives at Petrobras in mid-April.
Among the ideas is to use oil royalties collected by the government to fund the cushion.

""The idea is to create a cushion, a price buffer,"" he said. ""It's around and it exists. There's nothing ready. The government is going to work on this and Petrobras will contribute and participate. That doesn't mean pay the bill.""

Investing.com –  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) shares fell 4% Wednesday after reporting third quarter earnings that missed analysts' forecasts even as revenues topped expectations.
The maker of Pillsbury dough and Cheerios and Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereals announced earnings per share of 82 cents on revenue of $4.52 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of 83 cents on revenue of $4.45 billion.
The company’s forecast for 2021 supported the negative sentiment for the stock.
General Mills expects 2021 adjusted operating profit margin to be approximately in line with fiscal 2020 levels, and in line with the guidance the company outlined at the beginning of the year. It sees full-year organic net sales increasing approximately 3.5%, reflecting strong year-to-date growth.
The over-150-year-old company expects higher raw material and logistics costs in the second half to eat into its margins.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis on Wednesday had to correct comments made by Chairman Joerg Reinhardt to a Swiss newspaper, because his portrayal of conduct that led to a $678 million U.S. settlement over kickbacks last year risked violating the agreement.
Novartis's settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in July 2020 resolved decade-old charges that it organised thousands of sham events, lavished doctors with speaker fees and wined and dined them to boost drug prescriptions.
In a SonntagsBlick interview on March 6, however, Reinhardt objected when a reporter said Novartis had bribed U.S. doctors.
""I don't want to let the term 'bribery' stand without comment,"" Reinhardt told SonntagsBlick. ""Doctors were invited to scientific events. We were possibly here and there too generous.""
Reinhardt's comments were inaccurate, said Novartis, whose Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan has prioritized boosting Novartis's ethics performance, including by revising bonus schemes, after scandals over two decades that have cost it some $2 billion hurt its reputation. 
""Mr. Reinhardt described the programs as scientific events and stated that the company may have been too generous on occasion to the doctors in attendance,"" Novartis said in a statement. 
""These comments were inaccurate and inconsistent with the admissions of conduct that Novartis made in its settlement agreement.""
Based on its commitments under the settlement, Novartis said it proactively contacted the U.S. Justice Department after concluding Reinhardt's interview comments were inaccurate and issued the correction after discussions with prosecutors over remedying the issue. 
""Mr. Reinhardt's statements were not intended to minimize or dispute Novartis' admissions of conduct,"" Novartis said, adding that Reinhardt also offered reassurances in the SonntagsBlick interview that the alleged U.S. practices 'are history and will not be repeated.' ""
""Novartis reiterates fully the acknowledgements it made in its agreement,"" the company added.

In its U.S. settlement, Novartis was required to reduce paid-speaker programs and hold them virtually, to reduce potential improprieties.

497,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2021 10:50AM ET</span>","Exclusive: India delays big exports of AstraZeneca shot as infections surge, sources say","By Krishna N. Das
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has put a temporary hold on all major exports of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) coronavirus shot made by the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest vaccine-maker, to meet domestic demand as infections rise, two sources told Reuters.
The move will also affect supplies to the GAVI/WHO-backed COVAX vaccine-sharing facility through which more than 180 countries are expected to get doses, one of the sources said.
COVAX has so far received 17.7 million AstraZeneca doses from the SII, of the 60.5 million doses India has shipped in total, and many countries are relying on the programme to immunise their citizens.
There have been no vaccine exports from India since Thursday, the foreign ministry's website shows, as the country expands its own immunisation effort.
""Everything else has taken a backseat, for the time being at least,"" said one of the sources. Both sources had direct knowledge of the matter, but declined to be named as the discussions are not public.
""No exports, nothing till the time the India situation stabilises. The government won't take such a big chance at the moment when so many need to be vaccinated in India.""
India's foreign ministry and the SII did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
SOME DELAYS ALREADY The SII has already delayed shipments of the AstraZeneca drug to Brazil, Britain, Morocco and Saudi Arabia.
UNICEF, the U.N. children's agency that is procuring and distributing vaccines for COVAX, had no comment. 
COVAX has a deal to buy 1.1 billion doses of the AstraZeneca and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) shots that the SII is making in bulk, mainly for low- and middle-income countries. 
UNICEF in Vietnam said in a statement on Wednesday that vaccine production issues had led to delays in deliveries to all countries that were due to receive vaccines through COVAX. 
It did not specify the origin of those delays, although Vietnam was not expected to receive doses from the SII. 
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet decided this week to widen its inoculation drive by including everyone above 45 from April 1, and many states battling a surge in infections have demanded that all adults be covered. 
With 11.7 million cases, India has reported the highest number of coronavirus infections after the United States and Brazil. 
Currently, only the elderly and those over 45 with other health conditions are eligible for vaccinations in India. Health and frontline workers were first in line when India began its drive in mid-January. 
India has so far administered more than 51 million doses, of which 47 million are the SII's locally-made version of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The rest is the COVAXIN vaccine developed in India by Bharat Biotech. 
The government has so far asked the SII to supply around 141 million doses. The company has also accounted for nearly all of India's vaccine exports.

The SII plans to boost monthly production to 100 million doses from April/May, from up to 70 million now, Reuters reported earlier this month.

The funding round, which came months after its last round, was led by private equity firms Silver Lake, Blackstone (NYSE:BX), Fidelity Investments, Neuberger Berman, Thrive Capital and Major League Baseball, all of which are existing investors in the e-commerce company, signaling strong investor interest in online retailers that have benefited from the coronavirus pandemic.
The company was last valued at $6.2 billion in August. The latest round brought total funding raised by Fanatics to over $1.8 billion since 2011.
The new funds will be used to expand the company's model to design and distribute exclusive licensed merchandise, according to its website. It also plans on international expansion and to pursue mergers and acquisitions, said the sources, who requested anonymity.

Investing.com --  Alcoa  (NYSE:AA) soared more than 9% after the CEO said China's reining in of aluminum production will be a ""game changer,"" Bloomberg reported.
The industry has had years of gluts but China, which produces 55% of the global supply of aluminum, is taking steps to contain companies that rely on coal-fired power in a bid to meet a carbon neutrality goal by 2026. That could end decades of expansion that made China the top producer, Bloomberg said, citing an interview with Alcoa Chief Executive Officer Roy Harvey. Prices for the metal are up 14% this year as China's production is expected to slow. “On the supply side, the real important thing here is China has really started to enforce its laws, it is not issuing operating permits,” Bloomberg quoted Harvey as saying. “That is the game changer, because when they chose to start actually enforcing this need for operating permits is when we started to see some discipline come back into how much capacity was coming into the market.”
Demand should also recover around the world, Harvey said.   On Tuesday,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) upgraded the company to a buy-equivalent from equalweight saying Alcoa will benefit from short- and long-term dynamics in the aluminum industry."

LONDON (Reuters) - British tourists should go ahead and book foreign holidays despite government warnings not to, Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said on Wednesday, as the low-cost carrier announced plans to run 80% of its peak summer capacity.
Vaccine rollouts will tame COVID-19 and reopen travel in time for beach holidays, O'Leary predicted during a news conference in which he also dismissed recent advice from UK ministers that foreign travel is likely to remain off-limits.
""I don't frankly pay too much attention to it,"" he said, citing the UK's ""spectacularly successful vaccine programme"" that aims to reach the entire adult population by late July.
Britain's lead on vaccinations has put UK tourists at the centre of the travel industry's summer hopes - dented by recent setbacks to immunisation campaigns in mainland Europe and a recent surge in infection rates.
O'Leary reported a surge in bookings from Britain and Germany, in comments that contrast with the gloom besetting the industry as it faces the risk of a second ruined peak season.
Airline and travel shares have fallen this week since the UK toughened its stance, but regained some ground on Wednesday with TUI up 7.8%, British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) 5.5% higher, easyJet (LON:EZJ) up 3% and Ryanair 0.6%.
Ryanair staged separate online press briefings on its UK, Spain and Greek travel schedules in what O'Leary said was an attempt to encourage consumers to book.
The Irish budget airline announced 26 new destinations in Greece, Portugal and Spain and plans to operate a total of 2,000 weekly flights on 400 summer routes. 
Vaccinations will have COVID-19 under control across the region by summer, O'Leary forecast, and Britain would then have no grounds to bar foreign trips. 
""If you're fully vaccinated, I'd be very surprised if there was any legal basis for the UK government preventing people travelling on holidays to other European countries,"" he said.
""It is very difficult to persuade the UK population to sit at home, or holiday at home, when everybody's been vaccinated.""
Britain has banned foreign travel until at least May 17, except for essential work, education or health reasons. Consumers should ""hold off booking international travel"", social care minister Helen Whately said earlier this week.

Ministers are due to review that position in April and ""hope to be saying some more by April the 5th"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday.

Intel shares jumped 5% in Wednesday’s premarket trading, but were trading up 1.3% in the U.S. morning session, to a 52-week high around $64.
Announcing the plan late Tuesday, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger declared “Intel is back. The old Intel is now the new Intel.""
The move also comes after several challenging years for the chip maker, both in its traditional PC market and the mobile segment where it has been a bystander.
Intel said it aims to become a major provider of foundry capacity in the U.S. and Europe to serve customers globally. The chip giant is also partnering  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) to work on creating next-generation logic and packaging technologies.
The company’s new Meteor Lake processors, its first 7nm CPU and an upgrade to the Alder Lake chips launching this year, are likely to be in market in two years.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Wednesday, shrugging off a weaker-than-expected set of durable goods orders data as Tuesday's dip attracted bargain-hunters.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 244 points, or 0.8%, at 32,667 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%.
Earlier, the Commerce Department had said that durable goods orders fell 1.1% and core orders fell 0.9%, disappointing hopes for a more modest slowdown in growth.
Additionally, data from the Mortgage Bank Association showed that refinancings fell for the eight time in the last 10 weeks, under pressure from rising long-term interest rates. The 30-year mortgage rate rose another 8 basis points last week to 3.36% and is now up over half a percent from its January low.
Some of the most notable early moves came in chipmaking names, with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock rising 1.3% after announcing a major capacity expansion in Arizona as part of CEO Pat Gelsinger’s new strategy.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) stock was down 4% at the prospect of the former leader in the chip sector trying to regain its lost crown.
ADRs in ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML), the Dutch-based producer of chipmaking machines, rose 4.7% to their highest in a month.
Elsewhere,  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) stock fell 17%, albeit in smaller volumes than has often been the case in recent weeks, in disappointment at the company's admission that it is looking at selling new equity to fund its transformation into an e-commerce powerhouse. The company's results for the three months through January, released after the close on Tuesday, were also a little shy of consensus expectations. 
ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) stock also fell another 11%, taking it down to a 20% loss since announcing a $3 billion equity raise on Tuesday.

The company is pushing back the release of its 'Black Widow' superhero movie and will release it, along with live-action movie 'Cruella' simultaneously in theaters and on the Disney+ streaming channel.
Among the gainers, Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 3.4%, after a back-handed endorsement from Moody's (NYSE:MCO). The company cut its rating on Exxon's long-term debt, citing its commitment to keep paying dividends. The stock currently has a dividend yield of 6.22%.

LONDON (Reuters) -A 200,000-strong Brazilian claimant group said on Wednesday it had failed to resurrect a 5.0 billion pound ($6.9 billion) English lawsuit against Anglo-Australian mining giant BHP over a devastating 2015 dam failure.
The Court of Appeal agreed with a lower court that the vast group action was an abuse of process, that claimants were already able to seek redress in Brazil and that the case would be ""irredeemably unmanageable"" if allowed to proceed.
Tom Goodhead, the PGMBM lawyer representing the claimants, said it was ""a sad day for the English justice system"" after senior judges agreed that the claim, relating to Brazil's worst environmental disaster, should be struck out.
The collapse of the Fundao dam, owned by the Samarco venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale, killed 19 and sent a flood of mining waste into communities, the Doce river and the Atlantic Ocean, 650 km (400 miles) away.
The landmark case was the latest battle to establish whether multinationals can be held liable for the conduct of subsidiaries abroad.
The UK Supreme Court in 2019 allowed Zambian villagers to sue miner Vedanta (NYSE:VEDL) in England for alleged pollution in Africa and in February permitted Nigerian farmers and fishermen to pursue Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) over oil spills in the Niger Delta. 
But the English claim against BHP was first struck out in November after a High Court judge ruled that allowing it to proceed here would be like ""trying to build a house of cards in a wind tunnel"". 
Goodhead said he was surprised and disappointed by the Court of Appeal decision, which sent ""a poor message about corporate responsibility and legal consequences for wrongdoing"".
""We are committed to supporting the victims of this tragedy. We will now take stock and assess our options as to how justice can best be achieved,"" he said.
BHP welcomed the decision, which it said reinforced its view that the proceedings duplicated existing and ongoing remediation efforts and legal proceedings in Brazil. It said it remained fully committed to doing ""the right thing"" for victims.
BHP says it and Vale each poured about $1.7 billion into the Renova Foundation, set up in 2016 by BHP's Brazilian division, Samarco and Vale to manage 42 reparation projects, including providing financial aid to indigenous families, rebuilding villages and establishing new water supply systems.
BHP said Renova has spent nearly 12 billion reais ($2.17 billion) across the projects to date.
A United Nations expert report, published in September, said the disaster decimated the livelihoods of more than three million people, leaving locals exposed to dust and heavy metals in mud, that information about toxicity was inadequate and that all reparation projects were behind schedule.
In October, Brazilian federal prosecutors filed a lawsuit against BHP and Vale, alleging compensation packages were too low and forced victims to waive rights in other legal proceedings.
Renova has insisted that projects such as water quality monitoring and environmental repairs are on track, while the miners reject allegations they are not complying with obligations and of wrongdoing.

The European Union, United States, Britain and Canada on Monday imposed sanctions on Chinese officials accusing them of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. China retaliated with sanctions on European lawmakers and institutions.
H&M had previously said in a statement it was ""deeply concerned by reports from civil society organisations and media that include accusations of forced labour"" and that it did not source products from Xinjiang.
Activists and some Western politicians accuse China of using torture, forced labour and sterilisations of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang. China denies the accusations, says it is providing vocational training and that its measures are needed to fight extremism.
It was not immediately clear why an old statement from H&M, which media had reported last year, about the cotton-producing region was back in the public eye.
H&M's official store on  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s Tmall, an e-commerce platform, was not accessible on Wednesday. The official People's Daily reported that searches for H&M products on platforms JD (NASDAQ:JD).com and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) no longer showed any results. Reuters was unable to determine if such products were previously available.
Alibaba, JD.com, and Pinduoduo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
China is H&M's fourth-biggest market with sales of 2.9 billion Swedish crowns ($339 million) in the 12 months through November 2020. 
""Spreading rumours to boycott Xinjiang cotton, while also wanting to make money in China? Wishful thinking!"" the Communist Youth League, the youth wing of China's ruling party, said in a post on the Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) social media platform.
In another post, the League referred to remarks made by China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, at a combative meeting with his U.S. counterparts last week in Alaska, where, referring to various U.S. actions, he said the Chinese people ""won't swallow this"".

Actor Huang Xuan said on his official Weibo social media page he had terminated his contract as a representative for H&M, saying he opposed ""slander and creating rumours"".
H&M also said in its original statement it would phase out its relationship with a Chinese supplier accused of forced labour.
A graphic in a commentary from the official CCTV that slammed the company for its stance said that ""H&M you are no longer at all fashionable"".
Some people on Weibo called for H&M to leave China and for a boycott.
""It is so shameless to smear Xinjiang and we don't buy your products,"" one person said.
H&M China said it respected Chinese consumers and that it was committed to long-term investment and development in China. 
H&M does not source cotton directly from any supplier, it added.
""H&M Group has always managed our global supply chain in an open and transparent manner, ensuring that our suppliers worldwide comply with our sustainability commitments such as the OECD Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct and do not represent any political position,"" it said in a statement.
The editor-in-chief of the state-run Global Times newspaper, Hu Xijin, urged Western companies to be ""highly cautious"" and not to ""suppress China's Xinjiang"". 

To do so, he said in a social media post, would ""undoubtedly arouse the anger of the Chinese public"". He did not single out any companies.

Investing.com – Exxon (NYSE:XOM) shares rose 1.5% on Wednesday in premarket trading, setting aside Moody's (NYSE:MCO) downgrade of the company’s debt rating.
On Tuesday, Moody’s downgraded the debt ratings of Exxon by a notch to Aa2 from Aa1, saying that the company’s policy to maintain its large dividend will slow down its debt-reduction process. The downgrade came as the ratings agency said Exxon’s policy favors shareholders over its bondholders.
The ratings agency assigned a ‘stable’ outlook for Exxon’s Aa2 rating in its second downgrade for the company in almost a year.
“The company is prioritizing debt reduction through capital spending restraint and free cash flow generation going forward, but by maintaining its large dividend the progress will be slow and subject to the uncertainties regarding commodity prices, downstream earnings recovery and asset sales,” Reuters quoted Moody’s Senior Vice President Pete Speer as saying.
ExxonMobil's dividend payments to shareholders have grown at an average annual rate of 6.1% over the last 38 years. The company is committed to its dividend payout, even going as far as curtailing its capex if lower crude prices force it to.
The coronavirus pandemic hammered energy prices and reduced the value of the U.S. oil producer’s shale gas properties by more than $20 billion, Reuters said. The company posted a historic annual loss of $22.44 billion in 2020.

(Reuters) - Chinese gaming and social media group Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd on Wednesday reported a market-beating 26% jump in quarterly sales, helped in part by a surge in revenue from its online gaming business.
Revenue rose to 133.67 billion yuan ($20.5 billion) in the quarter ended December, versus market expectations of 132.19 billion yuan, based on data from Refinitiv. 
Tencent, which has benefited from a surge in paying users for video games in China and international markets, said online games revenue rose 29% to 39.1 billion yuan.
Profit rose 175% in the same period to 59.3 billion yuan, largely thanks to fair-value gains in companies Tencent has invested in, and sales of stakes.
Tencent's two hit games, Honor of Kings and PUBG Mobile, continued to top the rank in China and internationally, respectively, in this quarter. 
However, Tencent is facing mounting competition from ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, and the similar short-video platform Douyin, which have made sizeable inroads into the video games business.
ByteDance outbid Tencent last week to acquire Shanghai-based gaming studio Moonton Technology, which is most famous for its Southeast Asia sensation Mobile Legends.
Tencent is also locked in litigation battles with ByteDance, which has alleged that Tencent has engaged in monopolistic behaviour. Tencent has alleged that ByteDance ""illegally obtains WeChat users' personal information"".
REGULATORY CRACKDOWN
China's tech giants have been faced this year by an antitrust crackdown by authorities, which analysts fear could target other internet groups after first focusing on billionaire Jack Ma's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) business empire.
Tencent's founder Pony Ma met with China's antitrust watchdog officials this month to discuss compliance at his group, Reuters has reported, citing two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
In a media call post-results, Tencent president Martin Lau said during the meeting, which was voluntary, ""we have discussion about a broad range of topics, and the main focus is actually on creating a healthy environment for innovation to happen in China.""
China has issued new rules to regulate financial holding companies, and directed Alibaba-affiliate Ant Group turn itself into a financial holding company with capital restrictions and other requirements. 
Asked about the prospect of creating a financial holding company for Tencent, Lau said the financial holding company corporate structure provides an operating framework and is neutral in nature. 
""As we understand, turning into a financial holding company should involve organisational change but does not impact businesses,"" he said.
Pony Ma, who attended the call, said Tencent was working with regulators on compliance, including combing through some of its previous investments, while James Mitchell, chief strategy officer, said the company will stick with its normal practice of acquiring minority stakes in Chinese startups.

Investing.com – GameStop (NYSE:GME) shares were down 14% in Wednesday’s premarket trade after the videogame retailer said it's looking at raising fresh capital to fund its much-touted digital transformation.
The company said it was considering the step as it released its results for the quarter through January, which fell short of expectations.
GameStop reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $1.34 on revenue of $2.12 billion compared with consensus estimates for EPS of $1.35 on revenue of $2.21 billion.
Overall sales fell 3.3% due to the closure of dozens of outlets across the U.S., but same-store sales grew 6.5%. The company said its guidance remains suspended.
Wedbush analysts downgraded the stock to ""underperform"" from ""neutral"" after the quarterly results, saying the short squeeze has boosted the share price to levels that are completely disconnected from the fundamentals of business.
The stock up is up 900% this year, following the management’s announcement of attempts to generate more of its sales through online channels. This includes appointing Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) founder CEO Ryan Cohen to the board along with top-level reshuffle.  On Tuesday, it also announced the appointment of Amazon and Google veteran Jenna Owens as chief operating officer, while Neda Pacifico, formerly of Chewy, will take responsibility for e-commerce.

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares were up over 1% in Wednesday’s premarket trading on Elon Musk’s tweet that the company’s vehicles can now be purchased against payment in Bitcoin.
Musk’s tweet backs up his much-publicized faith in the cryptocurrency. His company, Tesla, had invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin in January, a move that many didn’t like and one which contributed to Tesla’s share price sliding 40% from its peak. The stock still is still down more than 25% from its all-time high of $900.13, struck late last year.
Musk said that Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as it is and not converted to a fiat currency.
It is not clear how the pricing of the vehicles would be done in Bitcoin, given its volatility.
Musk’s fascination with Bitcoin has confounded all given how Tesla and Bitcoin stand at two extremes of the energy ecosystem – one that is taking the oil-dependent automobile industry to a greener era and the other an energy guzzler.

The Czech Republic's largest exporter is hoping for a rebound in 2021 from a global car sales drop but faces uncertainty over the coronavirus pandemic and a semiconductor shortage rattling the industry.
""This year is likely to be another big challenge,"" finance director Klaus-Dieter Schuermann said. ""We expect Skoda Auto's group performance to improve, with sales revenue significantly above the level of last year.""
Skoda reported on Wednesday a 54.5% drop in 2020 operating to 756 million euros ($894 million). Sales revenue dropped 13.8% to 17.1 billion euros. 
Global deliveries remained above 1 million cars for a seventh straight year despite a 19% drop after production outages at the outset of the pandemic and a fall in China, its biggest single market. 
Chief Executive Thomas Shaefer said the car company was managing the semiconductor shortage ""but it will follow us for awhile"" and the impact was not visible yet.
Skoda's core market in Europe would be electric in the future, Shaefer said, although it was still not time to completely switch away from traditional models, which include the launch last year of a new generation of its flagship Octavia model. It has also started production of the all-electric Enyaq iV model.
Skoda plans investments of 1.4 billion euros into electromobility development as part of its five-year investment plan. Investments will also go into digitalisation activities and plant modernisation.

Investing.com – Shares in Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) were marginally in the green in Wednesday’s premarket while those of AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) were 4% down on news that the former has delayed the release of its latest Marvel superhero movie, Black Widow, to July.
Adding to AMC’s woes was the entertainment giant’s decision to simultaneously stream the movie on its Disney+ platform for a fee. A joint release of the movie may weigh on audience numbers, given the inertia of watching content at home in the pandemic. The decision reflects the studio's concerns that customers may not yet be willing to trust themselves in large public gatherings while the pandemic drags on.
Operators like AMC had just begun to open their theaters and were waiting for the movie. Theater owners have been amongst the most badly hit by the pandemic as lockdowns and the fear of the virus kept audience away.
Black Widow showcases Scarlett Johansson as the Russian-born spy-turned-superhero.
Disney also said it would offer live-action movie Cruella for a fee to Disney+ customers on the same day it hits cinemas, scheduled for May 28, and that Pixar animated movie Luca would skip most theaters and debut to all Disney+ subscribers on June 18.
The company delayed a handful of other films, including Marvel film Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, to September 3 from July 9 earlier.

The business ministry said disclosures should be in line with recommendations from the global Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), set up by the G20 rich countries to coordinate rules.
""To support our transition to net zero, the Government considers it important to ensure that companies with a material economic or environmental impact or exposure assess, disclose and ultimately take actions against climate-related risks and opportunities,"" the business ministry said.
The TCFD has produced recommendations for companies to disclose actual and potential impacts of climate change, as well as how they identify and manage such risks and opportunities.
Such disclosures are now voluntary, and a move to make them mandatory in Britain is seen as a step towards a new set of global standards.
The ministry said it was backing a move by the IFRS Foundation, which writes global accounting rules, to develop international sustainability-related reporting standards.
The Investment Association, which represents asset managers, welcomed the proposal to make climate risk reporting mandatory.

The move would ""support investment managers to better communicate climate risk to their pension fund clients, enabling them to meet their disclosure requirements and better understand the impact of their investment portfolios,"" said Sarah Woodfield, stewardship manager at the Investment Association.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Wednesday, with the tech sector leading the way ahead of more testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to Congress.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 100 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 14 points, or 0.4%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 100 points, or 0.8%.
Powell and Yellen will continue their testimony to the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services later Wednesday, after starting their two days of congressional hearings on Tuesday.
Powell repeated on Tuesday the Federal Reserve's view that any inflation rise this year will likely be a ""one-off,"" stressing the central bank has the tools to ensure inflation is kept well anchored to its 2% target. He, along with Yellen, also acknowledged that some areas of the markets are richly valued, but they were not concerned about financial stability. 
This was enough to cause U.S. bond yields to fall Tuesday, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield seen around 1.63%, significantly below the 1.75% level seen last week.
Higher yields have pressured the tech sector in particular, as these stocks have seen significant gains over the last year or so on the back of hefty borrowing in order to try and generate long-term growth.
Despite these gains, doubts remain about the strength of the global economic recovery, and are unlikely to be dispelled by stronger-than-expected purchasing managers indices out of Europe overnight.
Investors will thus look at the release of durable goods orders, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), for guidance, with economists expecting capital spending for February to slow from the prior month's 3.4% increase.
In the corporate sector, GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock is lower premarket after the video games retailer disappointed with its first-quarter earnings and plans to raise fresh capital, while Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock is higher after the chipmaker announced plans to invest $20 billion in building two new plants in Arizona.
Oil prices surged Wednesday, helped by a large container ship blocking the Suez Canal after running aground, likely limiting supply through one of the world’s most important trade routes. 
This helped to overturn the recent bearish sentiment based on worries about a slow recovery to demand given the fresh lockdowns in Europe and a build in U.S. crude inventories of 2.9 million barrels last week, according to the American Petroleum Institute, an industry body.
Official data from the Energy Information Administration are due later in the session.
U.S. crude futures traded 2.5% higher at $59.19 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 2.3% to $62.20. Both benchmarks have still fallen over 8% over the last week.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's top ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing is leaning toward picking New York over Hong Kong for its initial public offering (IPO), eyeing a valuation of at least $100 billion via the float, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Didi has also discussed the option of listing via a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), multiple sources told Reuters, which would involve merging with a blank-check firm that raises capital through a U.S. IPO.
But they said the SPAC option was seen by Didi as less viable given its valuation target.
At that valuation target, Didi could raise about $10 billion if it sells 10% of its shares, in what would be the biggest Chinese IPO in the United States since  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s $25 billion float in 2014.
A fifth person close to Didi said the company is also considering a second listing in Hong Kong if its U.S. IPO takes place. 
Beijing-based Didi said it doesn't have a definite plan regarding its listing destination or timeline.
The sources declined to be identified as the information is confidential. 
Two of them said the preference for New York as a listing venue partly reflects concerns that a Hong Kong IPO application could run into tighter regulatory scrutiny over Didi's business practices, including the use of unlicensed vehicles and part-time drivers.
Shanghai authorities fined Didi for using unlicensed vehicles multiple times in 2019. Back then, Didi responded by launching a campaign to improve safety for passengers.
Another advantage Didi sees in a New York IPO is a more predictable listing pace and a deeper pool of capital, a sixth source said, adding that the IPO could happen as soon as the second quarter. 
Hong Kong stock exchange operator HKEX declined to comment on the possibility of a Didi listing on its platform.
In a sign of challenges for ride-hailing firms to list in Hong Kong, Didi's smaller domestic rival Dida Inc filed for an IPO in the city last October and has been fielding several queries from the exchange, said a seventh source.
The queries were mainly linked to matters including business compliance and the company has yet to clear a hearing with the bourse, said the person with knowledge of the matter. 
Dida and HKEX declined to comment.
Didi's planned listing in the United States will add to the strong momentum of Chinese companies tapping investors in that market in the last couple of years despite heightened tensions between the world's two-largest economies.
Last year, Chinese companies raised $12 billion in U.S. listings, more than triple the fundraising amount in 2019, according to Refinitiv data. 
Nine-year-old Didi was valued at $56 billion https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-didi-idUSKBN1KR0IG in a 2017 fundraising and its valuation exceeded $60 billion https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tech-downrounds-analysis-idUSKCN1PO1AR a year later, sources have said.
However, some of its shares had been sold at a valuation below $50 billion before the Chinese New Year last month in private trades, one of the first two people and an eighth source said. 
One of the sources said Didi is also considering buying back some shares from existing shareholders and company executives at a valuation of $80 billion prior to the IPO.

But Didi said it had no such plans, when contacted by Reuters.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares in Japanese restaurant chain Global-Dining Inc slid on Wednesday following a Gamestop-style rally sparked by its lawsuit against a government order to cut opening hours in response to COVID-19.
Much like Gamestop, whose shares soared earlier this year as Reddit investors teamed up to squeeze short sellers, Global-Dining's shares had been heavily shorted, which added fuel to the rally.
The restaurant group surged 32.3% on Tuesday, hitting its daily limit, after it filed a lawsuit against the Tokyo Metropolitan government claiming its order to close 26 of its restaurants at 8 p.m. was illegal and not based on scientific evidence.
Its shares continued their rally earlier on Wednesday to hit a three-year high, rising as much as 13.7%, before they reversed course to slide 12.8%.
""Some retail investors liked the company's stance of fighting the authorities and bought the shares,"" said Tomoichiro Kubota, senior market analyst at Matsui Securities.
The lawsuit won sympathy among those who have seen the social restrictions to curb the pandemic as an excessive intervention in private activities.
""I bought shares today for the first time as I wanted to support Global-Dining. The government's finger-pointing at the company sucks,"" one investor commented in a popular Yahoo Finance message board.
Japanese media said all but one of the 27 restaurants to which the Tokyo government had issued the order were Global Dining's.
The firm came to fame in 2002 when then-Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and then-U.S. President George W. Bush dined in one of its flagship restaurants, Gonpachi.
In the lawsuit, the firm, whose chains of eateries include La Bohe'me, Zest, and Monsoon Cafe, called for damage compensation of just 104 yen ($0.96), saying the case is not about money.
Global-Dining also raised 13 million yen through crowd-funding to finance the lawsuit, above a target of 10 million yen.
But others were more cynical, saying the company had been struggling financially even before the pandemic.
The firm made net losses in four of the past five years, with an accumulative loss of 2.14 billion yen.
On Twitter, while some praised the firm for standing up against the government, others criticised it as being irresponsible for keeping its restaurants open when most others were compliant.

Shares of the video-game retailer fell 11% to $161.60 as of 4:22 a.m. in New York on Wednesday after it reported profit in the period ended Jan. 30 of $1.34 a share, excluding some items. That compared with an average projection of $1.43 from analysts.
Though a new generation of game consoles helped spur purchases, the company didn’t get as big a bump as expected. Net sales fell 3.3% to $2.12 billion in the quarter, short of the $2.24 billion estimate. Still, the console surge helped lift same-store sales by 6.5%, with online revenue up 175%.
GameStop named technology veteran Jenna Owens as chief operating officer, bringing on board an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) alum to steer its push into e-commerce. It also appointed two other executives with tech experience as part of a push by activist investor and board member Ryan Cohen to make the brick-and-mortar chain a digital powerhouse.
While investors were expecting more guidance from GameStop on its new strategic direction, the company declined to take questions on a call with investors late Tuesday. Cohen wasn’t on the call. And no forecasts were provided in its earnings statement.
“I don’t think the results matter much at this point -- people will be looking to how they transform themselves from here to reduce the reliance on brick and mortar and expand e-commerce,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matthew Kanterman. “But this is no easy task, despite who they bring in to help drive the turnaround.”
Chief Executive Officer George Sherman said the company will focus this year on customer service and experience -- both key components to a successful turnaround for GameStop.
“They’ve identified the key factors, but it’s still a matter of hearing more about the actual strategy to deliver unique value to customers. Hopefully they add more to that discussion soon,” said Doug Clinton, managing partner at Loup Ventures.
Despite falling for the last four trading sessions in New York, GameStop shares are still up more than ninefold this year through Tuesday. The stock is pricing in an “optimistic bright blue scenario (or better),” Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co., wrote in a note, keeping the stock at neutral.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded lower Wednesday as doubts about the speed of recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic weighed on sentiment even after healthy business activity data.
At 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.4% and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.2%.
Europe is currently suffering from a third wave of the Covid-19 virus, with the Netherlands announcing late Tuesday that a nationwide curfew will be extended by three weeks until late April - joining the likes of Germany, France and Italy which have already tightened restrictive measures.
Part of the problem has been the relatively slow rollout of vaccines within the region, something that has prompted a spat between Britain and the European Union over the distribution of the drugs.
The European Union is set to extend Covid-19 vaccine export curbs to Britain and other areas with much higher vaccination rates, and to cover instances of companies backloading contracted supplies, EU officials said Wednesday.
Adding to the worries, confidence in the safety of AstraZeneca's (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine took another hit Tuesday after a U.S. health agency said its trial may have included outdated information.
On a brighter note, German factory activity rose to a record high in March and the services sector expanded after five successive months of contractions, with the country’s preliminary composite PMI rising to a 37-month high of 56.8 from 51.1 the previous month.
This suggests Europe's largest economy was shrugging off pandemic lockdowns, although the surveys were conducted before the latest restrictions.
French data also showed strong growth, although its composite PMI release climbed to 49.5 from 47.0, still in contraction territory.
Inflation data from the U.K. had earlier undershot, with February's CPI release climbing by just 0.4% on the year, versus the expected 0.8%, and by 0.1% on the month, versus 0.5% expected.  
In the corporate sector,  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) stock rose 0.4% after the French retail giant announced plans to buy Brazilian food retailer Grupo BIG for around 1.1 billion euros ($1.3 billion).  
 Bellway  (LON:BWY) stock fell 1.9% after the U.K.-based house builder put aside another 20 million pounds ($27 million) to cover recladding and other remediation works on its buildings, in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster.
Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday, steadying after the sharp losses of the previous session, but worries about a slow recovery to demand remain given the fresh lockdowns in Europe and a build in U.S. inventories limited gains.

523,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2021 03:45AM ET</span>",Activist-backed proposal for Toshiba probe received 58% of shareholder votes,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO(Reuters) - About 58% of Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp shareholders last week voted in favour of an independent probe into allegations that investors were pressured ahead of last year's annual general meeting, a breakdown of the results showed on Tuesday.
The win for Effissimo Capital Management, Toshiba's biggest investor with a 9.9% stake, marked only the fourth time an activist shareholder motion has won approval in Japan and the first at a major household name.
The motion at last Thursday's extraordinary general meeting was passed on the day but Toshiba is disclosing the voting tally for the first time.
The results suggest that a substantial number of passive Toshiba investors sided with activist investors. Singapore-based Effissimo and other activist investors are estimated to account for about 25% of Toshiba's shareholder base.
The vote is also notable for the gravity of allegations that emerged after last year's AGM. Some Toshiba shareholders had felt pressure to vote in line with management's wishes on director nominations after contact from a government adviser or the trade ministry, sources have previously told Reuters.
Pressure on Toshiba Chief Executive Nobuaki Kurumatani, who resisted calls for an independent probe, is expected to grow and some investors have said any finding that shareholders were pressured could cost him his job.
Reuters has reported that the Harvard University endowment fund had been told by a Japanese government adviser it could be subject to a regulatory probe if the fund did not follow management's recommendations at last July's AGM.
As a result, the fund abstained from voting and later learnt there was no basis for any probe, sources have said.

A second proposal from U.S. hedge fund Farallon Capital Management, Toshiba's second largest shareholder, received 39% of shareholder votes. The fund wanted the board to present a five-year capital policy plan or make certain returns to shareholders.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Wednesday, continuing the global weakness, as doubts about the speed of recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic weigh on sentiment.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.4% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.5%.
The recent increases in Covid-19 cases and deaths represent “truly worrying trends,” said World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Tuesday.
The United Nations agency had pointed out earlier this week that most regions of the globe are seeing an increase in new Covid-19 cases as highly contagious variants continue to spread.
In Europe, the Netherlands announced late Tuesday that a nationwide curfew and other curbs aimed at containing the coronavirus will be extended by three weeks until late April - joining the likes of Germany, France and Italy which have already tightened restrictive measures.
On Wall Street overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9%, the S&P 500 lost 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.1%.
The picture didn’t look any better in Asia earlier Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei stumbled 2%, South Korea's KOSPI slipped 0.3%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng skidded 2%. 
Adding to the worries, confidence in the safety of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s vaccine took another hit Tuesday after a U.S. health agency said its trial may have included outdated information.
On a brighter note, the expansion of Japan's factory activity gathered pace in March, with the country’s flash PMI rising to a seasonally adjusted 52.0 in March from a final 51.4 in February.
The equivalent data from the likes of Germany and France are due later Wednesday, and will offer more clues about the state of the region’s manufacturing and services industries.
Inflation data from the U.K. had earlier undershot, with February's CPI release climbing by just 0.4% on the year, versus the expected 0.8%, and by 0.1% on the month, versus 0.5% expected.  
In the corporate sector, earnings come from E.ON (DE:EONGn) and  Bellway  (LON:BWY), while Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) releases its annual report.
Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday, steadying after the sharp losses of the previous session, but worries about a slow recovery to demand remain given the fresh lockdowns in Europe and a build in U.S. inventories.
U.S. crude stocks jumped by 2.9 million barrels last week, according to data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute. Official data from the Energy Information Administration are due later in the session.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Asian shares skidded to a two-week trough on Wednesday and the dollar neared four-month highs as coronavirus lockdowns in Europe and potential U.S. tax hikes hit risk appetite, leading to a flight to safety.
U.S. and European stock futures were weaker in late Asian trading. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were down 0.1%, London's FTSE futures were 0.65% lower while eurostoxx 50 futures lost 0.6%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan fell 1.3% after losing 0.9% on Tuesday. It went as low as 674.18 points, a level last seen on March 9. 
The index has had a disappointing run in March after five straight months of gains, as risk assets were earlier spooked by fears inflation will pick up at a faster-than-expected pace led by successful coronavirus vaccine rollouts and massive U.S. fiscal stimulus. 
Japan's Nikkei stumbled 2% while South Korea's KOSPI slipped 0.4%. Chinese shares were in the red for a second day with the blue-chip CSI300 index down 1.65%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng skidded 2.2%.
On Wall Street overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.94%, the S&P 500 lost 0.76% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.12%.
""We continue to stress that the economic outlook remains tied to the path of the virus,"" said Kim Mundy, senior economist & currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank.
""The risk is that the more contagious and deadly strain of the virus elicits a stronger response from European governments which sees Europe remaining locked down for longer."" 
Germany extended its lockdown to April 18. A U.S. health agency said the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc vaccine developed with Oxford University may have included outdated information in its data, further fueling investor concerns over the recovery.
Adding to investor woes, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Congress on Tuesday the U.S. economy remained at risk.
In currencies, the dollar index approached a four-month top of 92.506 against a basket of most major currencies. [FRX/]
The euro edged toward a four-month trough below $1.18355 - trading as low as $1.18360 - after Germany extended its lockdown. The safe-haven yen was broadly stronger, and Australia's dollar - considered a liquid proxy for risk - slipped as low as $0.7583, a level not seen since Feb.5.
U.S. manufacturing data was due later on Wednesday and Powell was expected to give the same prepared testimony to a Senate banking panel.
The flight to safety hit commodity prices, though oil prices edged higher on Wednesday as investors looked for bargains. Gains were capped, however, as lockdowns in Europe and a build in U.S. crude stocks curbed risk appetite and raised oversupply fears. [O/R]

Brent crude futures rose 22 cents to $61.01 a barrel, after tumbling 5.9% and hitting a low of $60.50 on Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures added 17 cents to $57.93, having lost 6.2% the previous day.

530,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 24, 2021 12:18AM ET</span>",Hang Seng Nears Correction as Vaccination Halt Worsens Selloff,"(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong’s benchmark stock gauge extended its losses from a recent peak to 10%, set to enter a technical correction, as the city’s temporary suspension of BioNtech vaccinations fueled worries over the pace of its recovery from the pandemic.
The Hang Seng Index lost as much as 2.1% amid a broad selloff in Asia on Wednesday. Stocks in the commerce and industry sector as well as financials were the biggest losers on the gauge, with AIA Group (OTC:AAGIY) Ltd. -- with the second-highest weighting -- contributing the most to losses.
The Hang Seng’s slide from its Feb. 17 peak comes as traders rush to sell pricey stocks due to worries over rising bond yields. As one of Asia’s largest and most open equity markets, Hong Kong is particularly sensitive to shifts in global liquidity. China’s CSI 300 Index entered a technical correction earlier this month on concerns about lofty valuations and potential liquidity tightening.
“The vaccination process will be slower than expected, resulting in a slower-than-expected recovery of the local economy,” said Steven Leung, executive director at at UOB Kay Hian (Hong Kong) Ltd. “Also, traders are still worrying about liquidity. Rising bond yield in the U.S. and limited measures by China’s central bank to boost liquidity remain as big overhangs to the market.”
Hong Kong and Macau temporarily suspended Covid vaccines manufactured by BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) because of a packaging defect. That marks the latest setback for Hong Kong’s vaccine rollout, which has been slowed by public distrust in the Beijing-backed government.

Earnings Focus
Rising volatility and concerns about tighter liquidity are also starting to impact investor appetite for the Hong Kong’s IPOs and new listings that were in hot demand last year, with the days of the massive first-day pops likely nearing an end.
The HSI’s move on Wednesday formed a worrying signal to technical chart watchers as the index breached the neckline of a so-called bearish head-and-shoulders pattern, implying further downside.
Wednesday’s selloff comes as investors await earnings from Internet giant Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd., which has the highest weighting on the HSI gauge.
“Hong Kong stocks are more swung by U.S. Treasuries and A-shares for now,” said Tracy Chan, an analyst at KGI Asia. “Investors are cautious ahead of Tencent earnings. Any in-line or missed earnings would trigger selling pressures.”
Geely Automobile Holdings (OTC:GELYF) Ltd. was the biggest loser on the HSI index, losing as much as 14% in a second day of declines. China’s biggest maker of local, branded cars on Tuesday posted a worse-than-expected drop in earnings for 2020. Shares of Macau casino operators were also among the worst performers following the vaccination halt.

531,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2021 12:15AM ET</span>",Bank lending to fossil fuel industry down 9% in COVID-hit year,"By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - The world's biggest banks cut lending to fossil fuel firms by 9% in 2020 as a result of the pandemic, although funding has still risen over the past five years, a report showed on Wednesday.
The 60 largest banks lent more than $750 billion to 2,300 fossil fuel companies in 2020, down from $824 billion in 2019, according to a report by Rainforest Action Network, Reclaim Finance, Oil Change International and other non-governmental organisations (NGOs).
But the report said the fall, driven by record low levels of industry investment in the second half of 2020 as the pandemic hammered fuel demand, followed annual rises of 4.4%-5.5% since 2016, the year after the Paris climate accord was signed.
It also followed a surge in demand from fossil fuel companies raising cheap financing in the first half of 2020, the report said after assessing the roles of banks in lending and underwriting debt and equity issues.
""Despite this significant drop from 2019 to 2020, the overall trend of the last five years is one heading definitively in the wrong direction,"" the report said.
""We must go forward to a world where even without a pandemic, fossil fuel production declines almost as quickly every year for the next decade - as it did in 2020 — but this time in a managed way.""
The pace of bank lending to companies with heavy greenhouse gas emissions is increasingly under the spotlight as investors push for more detail about their plans to manage climate-related risks and opportunities in their financing portfolios.

This month, HSBC became the latest lender to bow to the pressure when it agreed to phase out support for the coal industry and commit to short- and medium-term targets to align with the Paris Agreement.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down Wednesday morning after investors turned to safe-haven Treasuries and the dollar, at the expense of shares, thanks to COVID-19 worries.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.88% by 11:08 PM ET (3:08 AM GMT), as the Bank of Japan released the minutes from its March monetary policy meeting earlier in the day. Other data released earlier in the day said that the manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) stood at 52 in March, above the 50-mark indicating growth and slightly higher than February’s 51.4 figure.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.64% while in Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.38%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 1.95%, nearing a correction. The city hit a small snag in its COVID-19 vaccination drive, suspending vaccines from a single batch of the BioNTech SE/Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) candidate due to defective packaging. Macau has also suspended the use of the vaccine.
There is also suspicion that the data submitted by AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) for its COVID-19 vaccine developed with the University of Oxford is outdated, adding to worries about the vaccine rollout and economic recovery globally.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 1.14% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.99%.
U.S. bond yields fell for a third consecutive day, with the ten-year Treasury around 1.6%. Tuesday's solid two-year Treasury auction raised hopes, as five and seven-year notes go under the hammer later in the week.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell also played down inflation risks as he and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen testified before Congress on Tuesday. Yellen added that the U.S. economy remains at risk as she answered questions about potential infrastructure and tax increase plans under consideration.
Back in the Asia-Pacific region, New Zealand's ten-year note rates also fell, as a government move to restrain housing-market speculation caused investors to withdraw bets for early rate hikes from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.
Meanwhile, Europe is facing a third wave of cases, prompting countries including Germany, which extended its current lockdown to Apr. 18, France, and Italy to tighten restrictive measures. World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also called the recent increases in COVID-19 deaths and cases “truly worrying trends.”
Some investors warned of potential risks, even as the U.S. prepares more measures to drive economic recovery.
“We have a lot of innovation happening, incredible advancement in health-care technology, rapid vaccine development... but at the same time, there’s risk around inflation and rising rates and the impact that will have on equities,” Brown Advisory LLC partner Dune Thorne told Bloomberg."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Casino company Crown Resorts Ltd disputed some findings of an inquiry that accused it of enabling money laundering, said the head of a probe into Crown in a second Australian state, an apparent split from the company's public apology for wrongdoing.
Last month, a probity inquiry in the state of New South Wales declared Crown unfit to run a A$2.2 billion ($1.7 billion) Sydney casino after finding the company dealt with tour operators linked to organised crime, allowed money laundering and disregarded the safety of a dozen and a half staff jailed in China in 2016 for breaking that country's anti-gambling laws.
That sparked Royal Commission inquiries in two other states, Victoria and Western Australia, where Crown also has operational casinos, and where the wrongdoing was found to have occurred. If those inquiries suspend Crown's gambling licence, as the Sydney regulator did, the company's main revenue would stop.
In opening remarks at the Victoria inquiry on Wednesday, the retired federal court judge presiding over hearings, Ray Finkelstein, said he had written to Crown to ask if it accepted the Sydney findings in the hope of avoiding repetition.
The company's letter of reply had not been made public, but ""for now it's sufficient for me to point out Crown's response is a little equivocal"", Finkelstein said on the first day of hearing.
""The Crown companies do not accept, in terms, the findings made,"" Finkelstein added. He noted the ""disagreement ... may not be material"" since the company's ""objection ... goes to the deliberateness or wilfulness of the concerned conduct"".
Crown did accept, in its unpublished response, the overall finding that it was unsuitable for a licence in Sydney, but maintained it was fit for its licence in Victoria because of measures it had already taken to improve governance, Finkelstein said.
A Crown spokeswoman declined to comment. On Feb. 11, Crown Chair Helen Coonan said in a statement in relation to the Sydney inquiry that ""I accept criticism is warranted and reiterate our unreserved apologies for these shortcomings"".
The New South Wales Independent Liquor & Gaming Authority, which commissioned the Sydney inquiry and has suspended Crown's licence, was not immediately available for comment.
Hearings for the Victorian Royal Commission resume at a date to be fixed. The Western Australian Royal Commission is yet to begin.
This week, Crown said it received a $6.2 billion buyout proposal from private equity giant Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc. Crown, which lost about half its board in the past month following the Sydney inquiry, is yet to say if it supports a takeover.

534,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 09:45PM ET</span>",Canada judge rejects Huawei CFO's request to add evidence in extradition case,"By Moira Warburton and Sarah Berman
VANCOUVER (Reuters) - A Canadian judge rejected Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's request to add evidence in her extradition case, as a federal prosecutor argued on Tuesday that Meng's legal team had presented a story of her arrest that did not fit the facts.
Meng's lawyers wanted to include an affidavit from a Huawei accountant as evidence, which they said would shed light on the company's financial practices and help prove Meng's innocence as she fights extradition from Canada on charges of bank fraud in the United States.
Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes of the British Columbia Supreme Court rejected the affidavit, the third such request made by Meng's legal team, stating the evidence ""is not relevant"" to the extradition hearing. Much of the team's other requests were similarly rejected.
Meng, 49, was arrested at Vancouver International Airport in December 2018 on a U.S. warrant that alleges she misled HSBC about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's business dealings in Iran, causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions.
Meng says she is innocent. She is being held under house arrest in Vancouver, where she has been fighting extradition for two years.
Prosecutor Robert Frater, representing the Canadian government, said the witnesses who testified at Meng’s extradition hearings acknowledged errors candidly and were ""anything but liars,"" as charged by Meng’s legal team in court.
Frater said the defense laid out an ""exciting"" narrative, involving a covert criminal investigation, lying and a cross-border cover-up. He called it a stark contrast from the more ""prosaic"" one from the prosecution, which described public officials doing their jobs without a playbook on how to handle such a rare case.
Meng’s legal team argued last week that misconduct by police and border officials during Meng’s arrest and interrogation, including an alleged delay of her detainment by police, violated her rights and that her devices were seized without proper authority and her device passcodes improperly obtained.
Frater said the arrest was carried out in a reasonable amount of time that took into consideration the responsibilities of the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA). He said the agency had the authority to obtain her passcodes and that they were passed on to Canadian police by mistake. 
The mistake did not violate Meng’s rights because evidence showed police did not use them or pass them on to the FBI, he added.
Meng's arrest frayed diplomatic ties between Ottawa and Beijing. Shortly after she was detained, China arrested two Canadians on espionage charges. They both faced trial in the past week, although it is not known when their verdicts will be announced. 

The prosecution is expected to resume arguments on Wednesday. Meng's case is set to wrap up in May.

536,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 07:15PM ET</span>","EU to extend vaccine export curbs to cover Britain, backloading: source","By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission on Wednesday will extend EU powers to potentially block COVID-19 vaccine exports to Britain and other areas with much higher vaccination rates, and to cover instances of companies backloading contracted supplies, EU officials said.
The regulation is aimed at making vaccine trade reciprocal and proportional so that other vaccine-making countries sell to Europe and the EU does not export much more than it imports, one EU official said.
With no numerical targets, the change is unlikely to trigger mass export bans of EU-made vaccines, the official with insight into the announcement said on Wednesday.
""I just really, really don't see that happening because we have our international obligations and we want to keep supply chains going and the global system moving and flowing,"" the official said.
The regulation will be the basis for the EU's 27 governments to decide whether to block vaccine exports or not. 
""In practice, all this is, is a piece of paper that says please take this stuff into consideration when you're looking at approving export authorisations,"" the official said.
The move, which EU officials said could hit AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), are designed to avoid even limited delivery shortfalls to a region whose inoculation programme has been beset by delays and supply issues.
Shipments abroad could also be withheld if vaccine-producing countries, such as Britain and the United States, disallow exports to the EU, officials said, confirming comments by commission head Ursula von der Leyen last week. 
As London-Brussels tensions rose on Monday over a possible export ban, Britain demanded that EU authorities allow the delivery of vaccines it has ordered.
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain did not believe in imposing vaccine blockades. ""I'm encouraged by some of the things I've heard from the continent in the same sense,"" he told a news briefing.
Johnson & Johnson has announced delays in its second-quarter supplies to the EU, which a second EU official said could lead to consequences under the Commission amendment covering companies backloading contracted quarterly deliveries.
All vaccine makers could be affected, added the second official, with direct knowledge of the Commission decision. Some on the EU's list of countries exempt from any vaccine export monitoring, like Israel, are likely to be removed, because of their very high inoculation rates, the first official said.
""It doesn't mean they won't get vaccines. It just means they're not automatically exempted anymore,"" the first EU official said.
'WE DON'T WANT THE SAME DELAYS IN Q2'
The EU this month used an export control mechanism, set up at the end of January, to block an AstraZeneca vaccine shipment to Australia.
That mechanism can be activated only if companies do not meet contracted quarterly delivery targets. The block followed AstraZeneca's announcement of steep cuts in first-quarter deliveries to the EU. 
With the amendments to be adopted on Wednesday, the EU will be able to block exports to cover companies that respect their quarterly contracts but backload supplies to the end of the period, said the official, who asked to remain anonymous.
Johnson & Johnson, which has committed to delivering 55 million doses to the EU between April and June, plans to start deliveries in the second half of April.
The company told EU officials production issues might make it difficult to meet its second quarter target, but it was striving to do so.

 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Pfizer/BioNTech also had delays in vaccine deliveries to the EU, though they are set to meet their overall first-quarter targets. ""We don't want the same delays to happen in the second quarter,"" said the second official.

537,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 07:00PM ET</span>","Robinhood, at the heart of retail trading frenzy, files for own IPO","By Anirban Sen
(Reuters) -Robinhood Markets Inc, the online brokerage at the center of the historic retail trading frenzy that gripped Wall Street this year, has confidentially submitted plans to regulators for a U.S. initial public offering, the company disclosed on Tuesday.
The move to push ahead with a stock market flotation comes in the middle of a historic boom in U.S. capital markets, fueled largely by dealmaking through so-called special purpose acquisition companies. 
Companies have raised well over $100 billion through initial public offerings (IPOs) in the first three months of the year and are poised to overtake 2020's record haul of $167 billion, data from Refinitiv and Dealogic showed. The amount raised includes blank-check IPOs.
Reuters reported in December that Robinhood had picked  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) to lead preparations for a stock market flotation. 
The company is yet to determine the number of shares to be offered and the price range, it said https:// in a blog post. 
Robinhood had considered going public through a direct listing in the weeks leading up to the filing, people familiar with the matter said. 
In a direct listing, a company does not sell any shares in advance of its market debut, as is the case with IPOs. 
Menlo Park, California-based Robinhood was founded in 2013 by Stanford University roommates Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt. The company's platform allows users to make unlimited commission-free trades in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options and cryptocurrencies.
The platform's easy-to-use interface has made it a go-to for young investors trading from home during coronavirus-induced restrictions and its popularity soared during the retail trading frenzy.
The company, however, faced criticism after it was forced to curb trading in certain stocks during the social-media fueled trading frenzy due to a 10-fold rise in deposit requirements at its clearinghouse.
It was forced to raise a whopping $3.4 billion in emergency funds after its finances were strained due to the massive jump in retail trading.

The funding rounds were led by Ribbit Capital and included existing investors ICONIQ, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Index Ventures and New Enterprise Associates. The latest financing valued Robinhood at around $30 billion, according to people familiar with matter.
Robinhood is currently being probed by U.S. regulators over its temporary trading curbs on the so-called ""meme stocks"". The company has set aside $26.6 million for a potential settlement around trading outages in March 2020, as well as its options trading policies.

538,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 06:35PM ET</span>",Honda to extend production suspension at some North American plants,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co said on Tuesday it will extend production suspensions at some North American plants into the week of March 29 due to various supply chain issues.
Last week, the Japanese automaker said a variety of issues would force it to halt production at a majority of North American plants for the entire week of March 22 and impact production at the remainder of its North American plants.
Honda cited ""impact from COVID-19, congestion at various ports, the microchip shortage and severe winter weather"" for the production cuts.
The global shortage of semiconductor chips is hitting production around the world.
Last week,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp said it was cutting production at four plants in Kentucky, West Virginia and Mexico, citing “a shortage of petrochemicals” and “recent severe weather conditions” affecting production.
Stellantis warned Saturday its highly profitable pickup trucks were hit by the issue, while Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said it would cut more U.S. production.
Stellantis, the world's fourth-largest automaker, said it will build and hold for final assembly its Ram 1500 Classic trucks at its Warren, Michigan, and Saltillo, Mexico, assembly plants. When chips become available, the vehicles will be completed and shipped to dealers.

The chip shortage, which has hit automakers globally, stems from a confluence of factors. Carmakers shut North American plants for two months last year during the COVID-19 pandemic and canceled chip orders. Meanwhile, demand for chips surged from the consumer electronics industry as people worked from home and played video games. Now carmakers must compete for chips.

539,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 06:05PM ET</span>",Intel to spend $20 billion on U.S. chip plants as CEO challenges Asia dominance,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) will greatly expand its advanced chip manufacturing capacity as the new chief executive announced plans to spend as much as $20 billion to build two factories in Arizona and to open up its factories to outside customers.
The move by CEO Pat Gelsinger on Tuesday aims to restore Intel's reputation after manufacturing delays sent shares plunging last year. The strategy will directly challenge the two other companies in the world that can make the most advanced chips, Taiwan's Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) and Korea's Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd.
And it will also aim to tilt a technological balance of power back to the United States and Europe as government leaders on both continents have become concerned about the risks of a concentration of chipmaking in Taiwan given tensions with China. 
Intel shares rose 6.3% after the company disclosed its new strategy and full-year financial guidance for 2021. Some investors such as Third Point (NYSE:SPNT) LLC had previously urged Intel to consider spinning off its costly chip manufacturing operations.
Intel said it expects $72 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $4.55, compared with analyst estimates of $72.9 billion and $4.77 per share, according to Refinitiv data. The company said it expects to spend $19 billion to $20 billion on capital expenditures.
Gelsinger said that 2021 forecast ""reflects the industry-wide shortage"" of some components such as substrates. 
Intel is one of the few remaining semiconductor companies that both designs and manufactures its own chips. Rival chip designers such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) rely on contract manufacturers. 
In an interview with Reuters, Gelsinger said Intel has ""fully resolved"" its problems with its most recent manufacturing technology and is ""all systems go"" on chips for 2023. It now plans a massive manufacturing expansion. 
That will include spending $20 billion on two new factories at an existing campus in Chandler, Arizona, that will create 3,000 permanent jobs. Intel will then work on future sites in the United States and in Europe, Gelsinger said. 
Intel will use those factories to make its own chips but also open them to outside customers in what is called a ""foundry"" business model in the chip industry. Gelsinger said the new factories will focused on cutting-edge computing chip manufacturing, rather than the older or specialty technologies that some manufacturers such as GlobalFoundries specialize in.
""We are absolutely committed to leading process technology capabilities at scale for the industry, and for our customers,"" Gelsigner said, adding that Intel has lined up customers for the new factories but could not disclose their names.
He did say on a webcast Tuesday that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO),  Qualcomm Inc  and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) support its efforts to offer chip manufacturing services.
The move is a direct challenge to TSMC and Samsung (KS:005930). The two have come to dominate semiconductor manufacturing business, moving its center of gravity from the United States, where much of the technology was once invented, to Asia, where more than two-thirds of advanced chips are now manufactured.
Gelsinger said Intel will aim to change that global balance by embracing the foundry business where it historically has been a minor player. Intel will offer chip customers the ability license out its own technological crown jewels - known as the x86 instruction set architecture - as well as offer to build chips based on technology from Arm Ltd or the emerging open source technology RISC-V, he said.
""We will be picking our next sites within the next year for U.S. and Europe,"" he said. 
Intel also announced plans for new research collaboration with  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) focused on computing chip and packaging technology.
But even as Intel jumps into competition with TSMC and Samsung, it also plans to become a larger customer of theirs by turning to them to make subcomponents of its chips called ""tiles"" to make some chips more cost-effectively. 

""I'll pick the best process technologies wherever they exist,"" Gelsinger said. ""I leverage internal and external supply chains. I'll have the best cost structure. That combination of supply, products and costs, we think is a killer combination.""

Investing.com -- GameStop (NYSE:GME) said it would focus on accelerating its digital transformation after reporting fourth-quarter results that fell short of Wall Street expectations.   
The company reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $1.34 on revenue of $2.12 billion compared with consensus estimates for EPS of $1.35 on revenue of $2.21 billion.
Comparable store sales grew 6.5%, compared with consensus for a 4.7% rise and a 24% decline in the prior quarter.
Gross margin declined 610 points from the prior-year period, driven by an expected mix shift toward consoles that carry a lower gross margin, the company said
E-Commerce sales increased 175% and represented 34% of net sales in the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter versus 12% of net sales in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter.
Shares of GameStop initially rose, then fell 5% in after-hours trading.
GameStop captivated the world's attention earlier after tussle between the short-sellers and retail traders on Reddit intensified.  
Since the start of the year, the stock up is up 900%, following several positive updates including the appointment of  Chewy Inc  (NYSE:CHWY) founder CEO Ryan Cohen to the board and a slew of senior management changes amid a move to speed up the company's transition into technology and e-commerce.
Looking ahead, GameStop said it has made a strong start in 2021 as February comparable store sales increased 23%, led by continued strength in global hardware sales.
""As we look ahead, we are excited by the opportunities that are in front of us as we begin prioritizing long-term digital and E-Commerce initiatives while continuing to execute on our core business during this emerging console cycle. Our emphasis in 2021 will be on improving our E-Commerce and customer experience, increasing our speed of delivery, providing superior customer service and expanding our catalogue,” George Sherman, GameStop’s chief executive officer."

By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) on Tuesday outlined a proposed 10-year strategic plan that would slow current first-class delivery standards and raise some prices to stem $160 billion in forecasted red ink over the next decade.
The plan would revise existing service standards for first-class mail letters from the current one to three days to one to five days. USPS said 61% of current first-class mail volume would stay at its current standard. It would shift more deliveries to trucks rather than airplanes, consolidate mail processing and cut hours at some retail locations.
USPS Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a supporter of former President Donald Trump who was named last year to head USPS, said without changes the Postal Service would need a ""government bailout"" -- something it does not want to seek.
USPS needs significant financial relief from Congress and the Biden administration from pre-funding obligations and other changes that could address $58 billion in anticipated losses.
USPS has reported net losses totaling $86.7 billion from 2007 through 2020. One reason for the red ink is that Congress in 2006 passed legislation requiring USPS to pre-fund more than $120 billion in retiree health care and pension liabilities. Labor unions have called this requirement an unfair burden that other businesses do not share.
Representative Carolyn Maloney, who chairs the committee that oversees USPS, has circulated draft legislation to address pre-funding obligations and other USPS financial issues.
USPS says the current standards are ""not achievable."" For the last budget year, average first-class mail service
performance was 89.7 percent, more than 6 percentage points below target.
The plan would invest $4 billion to refurbish retail outlets, and consolidate some city postal locations.
It seeks to move more first-class mail by trucks rather than air but does not eliminate use of airplanes.
USPS said the cost to mail a first-class letter is significantly less than other countries like Australia, Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom.

USPS also said it could commit to an all-electric delivery fleet by 2035 with assistance from Congress -- and vows to spend $11 billion on vehicles over the next decade. Earlier this month, USPS said it could electrify its fleet to the ""maximum extent"" operationally feasible if it received about $8 billion in government assistance. 
In February, USPS picked Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) Defense for a multibillion-dollar contract to make up to 165,000 delivery vehicles, rejecting an all-electric bid by Workhorse Group.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 slumped Tuesday, unable to mark its one-year bull run in style as fresh lockdowns in Europe muddied the outlook for global economic growth, souring investor appetite for cyclical stocks.
The S&P 500 was down 0.74%, and has rebounded about 70% higher since March 23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.94%, or 268 points, the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.12%.
Europe is facing a third wave of Covid-19 that has forced major countries in the bloc including Germany, France and the Netherlands to batten down the hatches with fresh lockdown into easter that will likely set global growth back.
The risk of slower global growth led to a 6% rout in oil prices on bets the recovery in travel-related demand may not return as fast as many expect.
Nov (NYSE:NOV), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) were among the biggest decliners with the latter down 6%.
The reopening trade – bullish bets on stocks tied to the progress of the economic reopening – was also scaled back with airlines and cruise lines closing in the red.
United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL),  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL), Carnival (NYSE:CCL) and Norwegian Cruise (NYSE:NCLH) were sharply lower.
Supportive remarks from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen provided little reprieve for the broader market.
Powell shrugged off inflationary pressure and continued to back the Fed's accommodate monetary policy stance, saying the rise in price pressures this year will likely be a ""one-off.""
The U.S. 10-year yield remained at one-week lows near 1.65%, though it had dipped to the 1.30%-to-1.40% level of support.
Powell's doubling down on lower for longer monetary policy comes just a day after more hawkish members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the fed's rate setting arm, signaled that the first rate could hike could come sooner than 2024.
Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan, a non-voting FOMC member, told CNBC Tuesday that he was one of four Fed officials who backed first benchmark rate hike next year at the Fed’s policy meeting last week.
The move lower in rates kept the bulk of megacap tech stocks above the flatline.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were lower, while Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) ended in the green.

Investing.com -- Markets slid Tuesday as European lockdowns scared investors and sent oil lower. 
Fears over a continued dearth in demand kept airlines, cruise lines and other reopening stocks trading lower despite Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell promising to keep monetary policy loose.
The head of the central bank also continues ot be unfazed about the possibility of out-of-control inflation, telling the House Financial Services Committee that he expects a bump, but only temporarily. He'll be back to testify some more tomorrow, alongside U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.
Oil fell 6%, after a 7% fall last week, a major downturn from the strength seen since October. 
We'll get a look at durable goods orders from February and how much we've been breakfasting.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Durable goods
Economists expect capital spending for February to have ticked down from the prior month's 3.4% increase, but to stay positive as pandemic-related demand for certain goods stays strong. Consensus calls for a 0.9% increase when durable goods orders come out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
2. The Jay & Janet show
It's day two of testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. They're still talking to lawmakers about the CARES Act, but this time it's the Senate Banking Committee that will be asking the questions. 
3. The most important meal of the day 
Not too much excitement on the earnings front, unless you're into breakfast and baked goods.  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) is due to report, and analysts are calling for adjusted profit of 84 cents a share on sales of $4.46 billion. Chinese heavyweight Tencent Holdings Ltd ADR (OTC:TCEHY)is also set to release results, so watch those ADRs.

(Reuters) - U.S. energy companies are organizing employee vaccinations as more COVID-19 doses become available, officials and employees told Reuters, setting up on-site clinics or offering time off to workers to get the shot.
The drive comes as the United States ramps up shipments, with 164.3 million doses sent since rollouts began, and as more companies are encouraging staff to return to offices.
More than a quarter of the U.S. population has received at least one dose, and 45.5 million, of 331 million residents, were fully inoculated as of Tuesday, according to government data.
Energy companies are able to get doses with employees classified as essential workers. Shots are not required but are being made available to staff. Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) have already begun inoculations, representatives said, and other large energy firms aim to begin shots soon. 
 Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), which received approval to set up clinics, expects supplies in coming weeks from health officials in California and Texas. 
""We want our teams together, collaborating, building relationships,"" Chevron finance chief Pierre Breber said this month. Decisions on returning employees to offices, however, remain to be made, he said. 
Exxon has provided on-site vaccinations at U.S. plants, including its second-largest U.S. refinery in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. 
The facilities ""are classified as essential services and any vaccine distribution will be prioritized to those that have critical roles in maintaining energy delivery and business continuity,"" said spokesman Jeremy Eikenberry.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc's U.S. pipeline and refinery facilities, including at Deer Park, Texas, have offered the shots, said people familiar with the matter.
Shell did not reply to a request for comment.
 Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO) has offered plant workers one hour of paid time off per dose, people familiar with the company's policy said.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 fell Tuesday, on the anniversary of its post-pandemic bounce, as supportive remarks from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen were overshadowed by global growth worries amid fresh lockdowns in Europe.
The S&P 500 was down 0.66%, and has rebounded about 80% higher since March 23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.82%, or 268 points, the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.96%.
Powell shrugged off inflationary pressure and continued to back the Fed's accommodate monetary policy stance, saying the rise in price pressures this year will likely be a ""one-off.""
The U.S. 10-year yield remained at one-week lows near 1.65%, though it had dipped to the 1.30%-to-1.40% level for support.
Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan, a non-voting FOMC member, told CNBC Tuesday that he was one of four Fed officials who backed first benchmark rate hike next year at the Fed’s policy meeting last week.
The move lower in rates kept the bulk of megacap tech stocks above the flatline.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was flat, but Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were in the green.
The broader market was held back, however, by a plunge in oil prices as bullish bets on energy were reined in following fresh lockdowns in Europe that threaten global growth and energy demand.
Nov (NYSE:NOV), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) were among the biggest decliners with the latter down 5%.
The lockdown in Europe hurt the reopening trade – bullish bets on stocks tied to the progress of the economic reopening – with airlines and cruise lines sharply lower.
United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL),  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL), Carnival (NYSE:CCL) and Norwegian Cruise  (NYSE:NCLH) were sharply lower.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The S&P 500 edged lower on Tuesday in seesaw trade on sliding financial and energy stocks that have benefitted recently from a sharp rise in market interest rates, while beaten-down tech stocks rebounded in a reversal of trends the past few days.
Rates edged lower as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told U.S. lawmakers that a coming round of post-pandemic price hikes will not fuel a destructive breakout of persistent inflation - fears that had driven a recent spike in yields.
Oil prices that slumped more than 3% on worries that new pandemic curbs and slow vaccine rollouts in Europe will slow a recovery in demand also pushed the energy sector lower. [O/R]
Falling yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes from a 14-month high set last week have deflated this year's outperformance in the financial and energy sectors.
Conversely, technology-related shares that had recently declined sharply on the rising rate environment have recuperated a bit as yields eased, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.
""A lot of these (tech) stocks have seen 10% to 20% corrections and interest rates have backed off a bit,"" Tuz said. ""The money seems to be going back into them and out of the groups that did extremely well the last three months, specifically financials and energy."" 
The benchmark S&P 500 and the blue-chip Dow have rallied about 79% from their pandemic lows hit exactly a year ago, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has doubled in value.
The CBOE volatility index eased to its lowest level in 13 months.
""We've seen a very quick movement in (yields) on mostly fears around inflation and the market is taking a pause here over the last week,"" said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago.
By 2:36 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 126.85 points, or 0.39%, to 32,604.35, the S&P 500 lost 5.46 points, or 0.14%, to 3,935.13 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 30.45 points, or 0.23%, to 13,347.09.
Growth stocks, which include technology shares, rose 0.4% while underpriced value stocks fell 0.9%. 
Shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) dropped 4.1% ahead of the company's fourth-quarter results due after markets close. The videogame retailer announced the exit of its chief customer officer in the latest sign of a broader overhaul into an e-commerce firm.
ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc tumbled about 5% after the media firm launched $3 billion stock deals to raise capital for investments in streaming.
U.S.-listed shares of Chinese internet search provider Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) slid 1.5% following a flat Hong Kong debut as investors were wary of a fundraising flurry in the city and questioned the company's growth plans.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.70-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.33-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 43 new highs and 71 new lows.

The stock has outperformed the market significantly last four months, driven by benefits from the reopening of the economy. While Berenberg continues to have a favorable view on management and the company’s prospects, it believes the stock price captures future growth opportunities appropriately.
Berenberg’s downgrade is in contrast to Morgan Stanley’s recent price target hike to $317 from $290, reiterating an overweight rating on the retailer.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada on Tuesday said the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) COVID-19 vaccine is safe and will continue to be recommended for use despite criticism from U.S. health officials of the drugmaker's analysis of the shot's efficacy, health officials said.
""The message is that the efficacy and the safety of the vaccine have been shown,"" senior Health Canada official Marc Berthiaume told reporters. ""It continues to be beneficial for Canadians to prevent COVID-19."" 
Deliveries of coronavirus vaccines are ramping up in Canada, with some 2 million doses of the  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc vaccines coming in this week. The United States has said it is sharing 1.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine with Canada as early as this week.
The U.S. National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases said on Monday that the board charged with ensuring the accuracy of AstraZeneca's latest trial said the company may have given an incomplete view of the shot's effectiveness. The company has since said it will publish up-to-date results https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2BF1RE from its latest trial within 48 hours.
""We will look at the complete data package (from the U.S.) sometime in April, and will assess and communicate the results,"" said Supriya Sharma, chief medical adviser at Health Canada, the federal health ministry. ""The bottom line is: that doesn't change recommendations on the AstraZeneca vaccine at this time.""
There will be a delay of a day or two of the delivery of the Moderna vaccines this week, Alberta's Chief Medical Officer of Health said on Twitter on Tuesday, adding that bookings for shots will not be affected.
Also on Tuesday, Canada said it would give C$23.7 million ($18.9 million) to the province of Ontario to open more voluntary isolation sites for those who catch the virus and need a place to quarantine as cases surge during a third wave. 
Canada has recorded about 940,000 virus infections and more than 22,700 deaths from COVID-19.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union and Britain expect to agree a cooperation framework for financial services by the end of March, but there will be ""no rush"" in granting the City of London access to the EU, the bloc's financial services chief said on Tuesday.
Britain fully left the EU's orbit on Dec. 31, setting its huge financial sector largely adrift from what had been its biggest export customer.
""We will not be recreating access to the single market for the UK as they have chosen to move out,"" Mairead McGuinness told an event held by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).
The shift in euro stock and derivatives trading from London to the bloc without disruption at the start of the year meant the EU has time to reflect on how much access it should grant Britain's financial sector, McGuinness said.
Once the new cooperation framework is agreed, the next step would be to move on to the detail of future access.
""There is no rush,"" McGuinness said.
""There won't be a moment, as there was with the trade agreement, where we are sitting down and announcing a big package. I see it more on a case-by-case basis,"" she added.
""While there may be one or two issues there might be pressure points, there isn't that great urgency, which allows us time to do the right thing and I think that is understood on the UK side.""
Robert Ophele, chair of France's markets regulator AMF and an ESMA board member, said the international competitiveness of the EU financial sector was not sufficiently taken into account by regulators.
It would be ""totally wrong"" to rely on countries outside the bloc for financial services. ""It's also a key point, this competitiveness, if we intend to assess EU financial independence and sovereignty,"" Ophele said.
But John Berrigan, who heads the European Commission's financial services unit, cautioned that a competitiveness objective could conflict with ESMA's core mandate, though more EU-level supervision will be needed.

""We are not looking at ESMA becoming an EU SEC any time soon,"" Berrigan said, referring to the more powerful U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Investing.com –  Takung Art  (NYSE:TKAT) shares rocketed by 32% in Tuesday’s trade, benefiting from the NFT mania now raging in the material world.
NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital properties that are stored in a blockchain. An NFT symbolizes digital ownership of a certain physical item which could be a tweet, a painting, a photo, calligraphies, jewelry and precious gems.  
Since it’s stored in blockchain, it is transparent and cannot be copied or stolen.
""We think of NFTs as purely upside, but do not incorporate any revenue or assign any value to this opportunity,"" Seeking Alpha quoted BTIG analyst Marvin Fong as writing in a note. 
Takung Art provides an online trading platform for art collectors and investors to acquire shared ownership in Asian and other fine art – including paintings and calligraphies - and participate in the booming Asian art market without fear of price manipulation and forgery.
Investors believe Takung Art will adopt NFT technology to enhance its art trading platform, which could lead to more revenues for the Hong Kong-based company. From its 52-week lows, the stock has risen by more than 9000%.
Recently, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey sold his first tweet ever as an NFT for about $2.9 million.
""Many artists have been selling NFTs for several years (NFTs have been around since about 2012) and may have already established their loyalties elsewhere,"" BTIG’s Fond said in the note."

The fitness tech company bought Aiqudo, which makes an artificial intelligence voice assistant, last month. Late last year, it purchased Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Wearables, which builds fitness trackers, and Otari, which makes interactive workout mats.
Demand for Peloton equipment and classes surged amid the pandemic, pushing shares up more than 500% from March 2020 to a high in January. They have fallen some 32% since then as vaccinations increased and hopes of a broad reopening keep us going, and maybe eventually get us back to germ-filled gyms.
The surge in demand has created a long waiting list for equipment that has piled up at ports, and given berth for competitors to take a slice of the pie. 
As a result, Peloton has been on a buying spree, snapping up intellectual property from Peerfit, a digital health company, in November, and Precor, a fitness equipment provider, in December, which makes equipment in the U.S.
Recently, Peloton Chief Executive Officer John Foley told Bloomberg that a rowing machine and a strength training device might be in the works.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway will block Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) from selling a Norwegian maritime engine maker to a Russian company on national security grounds, its justice minister told parliament on Tuesday.
The blocking of the deal is a blow for Rolls-Royce, which is aiming to raise 2 billion pounds ($2.76 billion) from disposals by 2022 as part of plans to recover from the pandemic. 
Based on Norway's west coast, and owned by Britain's Rolls-Royce for more than 20 years, Bergen Engines supplies NATO member Norway's navy as well as the global shipping industry.
Norway on March 9 said it had temporarily suspended the 150 million euros ($178 million) sale to TMH Group while it assessed security implications.
""We now have sufficient information to conclude that it is necessary to prevent the company from being sold to a group controlled from a country with which we do not have security cooperation,"" Justice Minister Monica Maeland of the centre-right minority government told parliament.
Relations between Norway and Russia, which share a border in the Arctic, gradually improved in the post-Cold War era before suffering a setback when Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014.
That triggered more tension in the north with a military build-up on both sides and more frequent military manoeuvres.
""The technology possessed by Bergen Engines, and the engines they produce, would have been of significant military strategic interest to Russia, and would have boosted Russian military capabilities,"" the Norwegian government said in a statement.
JOBS AT STAKE
Rolls-Royce said it plans to ask Norway for help to find another option for Bergen, noting that Bergen's more than 900 jobs could be at risk.
""We do not intend to retain the business,"" Rolls-Royce said in a statement.
""We will be seeking the assistance of the Norwegian Government to swiftly find another option, which can provide Bergen Engines and its people with the investment required for the future and Rolls-Royce with an appropriate outcome.""
Rolls said it remained committed to its disposal target.
TMH Group said it was disappointed by Norway's decision.
""Throughout the transaction process TMH has remained as transparent as possible regarding the ownership structure and development plans for Bergen Engines,"" TMH Group said in a statement to Reuters. 
""In the course of TMH's preparation for the transaction, nothing has been found that would indicate that the Norwegian Security Act applies to the transaction.""
The Russian embassy in Oslo said on March 10 that Norway's decision to suspend the sale showed anti-Russian sentiment and was of serious concern. The Russian embassy was not immediately available for comment on Tuesday.
The Russian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Norwegian opposition parties criticised the government for being slow to respond to what they said was a national security threat, after it emerged that Rolls-Royce had informed authorities of a potential Russian deal late last year.
""The government failed to comprehend the severity,"" Christian Tybring-Gjedde, a lawmaker from the right wing opposition Progress Party, said.
The case will be the subject of a special hearing in parliament, said Jette Christensen, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party.
Bergen Engines makes medium-speed gas and diesel engines for marine and power generation customers. It had revenue of 239 million pounds in 2019.
Norway introduced a new security law that year which strengthens the government's ability to impose conditions or block foreign acquisitions when national interests are at stake.
While corporate takeovers have been assessed from time to time, Norway had abstained from blocking any business transactions since the law came in, the government's NSM security agency said this month.

UBS said while Discovery+ appears off to a strong start, it remained concerned regarding the ultimate scalability of the service in relation to the decline of the linear business and longer term impact on financials.
“We expect relatively stable EBITDA/FCF through 2024 as DTC growth is balanced against linear declines.

MILAN (Reuters) - Carmaker Stellantis' campaign to reduce costs has led to cuts in cleaning services and the number of toilets available in Italian factories, where production is under scrutiny for costing more than elsewhere, unions said on Tuesday.
The company had no comment on Tuesday.
Carlos Tavares, the CEO of Stellantis, has committed not to cut jobs or close plants following the creation of the company from France's PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler.
But the carmaker has promised more than 5 billion euros ($5.94 billion) per year in savings following the merger.
Tavares has flagged higher average production costs for cars in Italy than in other countries where the automaker operates, such as France and Spain.
Davide Provenzano of the FIM union said Stellantis was taking action at its Mirafiori plant in Turin, where it assembles the electric 500 car, by reducing the amount of toilets available to workers, cutting cleaning shifts, temperatures and reorganising transport facilities.
""This is happening during COVID-19, when you should be increasing toilets available and cleaning services, rather than cutting them,"" Provenzano said.
Stellantis will present its business plan in late 2021 or early 2022.
Edi Lazzi of the left-leaning FIOM union said he believed the cost-saving actions in Italy were the personal initiatives of local management rather than a broad strategy launched by the group.

Most of the group's Italian plants have seen further reductions in capacity as the COVID-19 crisis reduced demand.

Investing.com – GameStop (NYSE:GME) shares, a favorite of Robinhood traders, fell more than 4% in Tuesday’s trade on news that another senior executive was ready to leave the company.
March 31 will be the last day for the brick-and-mortar retailer’s chief customer officer Frank Hamlin. The company’s chief financial officer Jim Bell earlier announced plans to step down.
The exits come as a result of the shakeup its top shareholder and  Chewy Inc  (NYSE:CHWY) co-founder Ryan Cohen is driving at the video game retailer.
Cohen hopes to transform the long-forgotten GameStop into an e-commerce player that can take on big-box retailers. He brought in his Chewy colleague Kelli Durkin as senior vice president of customer care at GameStop. Durkin spearheaded customer-centric initiatives at Chewy that included personal written notes for them.
Investors are closely watching GameStop's fourth quarter results expected today.
GameStop is amongst the most popular meme stocks that has caught the fancy of young retail investors and the millennials. It attracted worldwide attention in January when followers of the Reddit forum, WallStreetBets, plotted against hedge funds who were heavily short on the stock.
The Reddit-driven short-squeeze sent the stock skyrocketing by more than 5000% to as high as $481.99 last month, far above most analysts’ price targets. Since then, it has been a battle of egos between the small-time retail traders and the bigwigs, with fears it could end very badly for the former.

While Wall Street is known for its tough work culture, the remote working during the pandemic has been particularly gruelling for most employees, taking enormous toll on their health and mental wellbeing.

MADRID (Reuters) - France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) said on Tuesday it would start producing three new hybrid SUV models in its ""second home"" Spain in 2022-2024, strengthening its position in the country following an agreement with unions.
The carmaker will make Spain, Europe's second-largest car manufacturer after Germany, a major hub for its E-TECH hybrids as it seeks to improve profit margins and cut costs after reporting an 8 billion euro ($9.5 billion) loss in 2020.
Renault currently manufactures three vehicles at its Palencia and Valladolid plants, in northwestern Spain.
""This plan reinforces Spain's position as Renault's second home,"" Chief Executive Luca de Meo told an event at the Palencia plant, which will produce the new compact and larger-size models.
Spain's King Felipe and Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also attended the event.
De Meo did not give investment details, but said Renault's plans would generate an estimated 12 billion euros for the Spanish economy in the next three or four years. 
The plans also include developing new engines and other vehicle parts at Renault's plants in Valladolid and Seville. 
The announcement comes ten months after Renault's alliance partner Nissan (OTC:NSANY) said it would shut its three Spanish plants by December as part of a wider overhaul.
Spain has lower production costs than France, giving it a potential edge. 
Amid tougher EU emissions regulations, carmakers have been switching to battery-powered vehicles, a market dominated by U.S. group Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p). The latter is considering whether to start producing electric vehicles in Spain in 2025 at its SEAT division.
Spain will use European Union funds to create a public-private consortium with SEAT and power firm Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY) to build its first factory for electric-car batteries.
De Meo said Renault would take part in government-promoted projects to seek EU funds for the automobile sector, but did not elaborate.

Investing.com – Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares rose 2.7% in Tuesday’s trade as Argus upgraded the stock to buy with a price target of $650.
Argus’s target for Netflix is 20% higher than the stock’s current price.
The streaming giant has gone from strength to strength not just in its home market, the U.S., but also globally. While competition has grown, too, Netflix has continued to add original content to its vast portfolio, attracting millions of viewers to its streaming platform.
Netflix benefited immensely during the pandemic as people worked from home and used the time to binge watch. That habit is unlikely to wane soon.  
The company has recently taken steps to curb password sharing, a habit Citi says costs streaming companies billions of dollars. The brokerage expects that move to bear fruit.
According to StreetInsider, Citi analyst Jason Bazinet says the widespread habit of sharing online passwords to subscription video-on-demand services cuts about $25 billion a year for U.S. companies, estimating Netflix accounts for about 25% of that lost revenue.
And that's a healthy chunk in relative revenue, as Netflix made about $25 billion in its last fiscal year.
“As streaming services move to center stage, thwarting this theft will be of growing importance for shareholders,” Bazinet wrote in his note, as reported by StreetInsider.
BofA, too, has noted that cracking down on sharing passwords could stimulate Netflix’s subscriber additions.

U.S. airlines are beginning to emerge from the pandemic-induced crisis that has opened doors for carriers catering to domestic leisure travel, which is rebounding quicker than business and international travel, particularly as more people receive COVID-19 vaccines.
Budget carriers are also expected to bounce back quicker than larger rivals, thanks to their lower-cost structures and focus on domestic leisure travel.
Frontier, which withdrew listing plans in July, filed again this month, while Apollo Global Management-backed Sun Country Airlines made its successful stock market debut.
Frontier plans to sell 30 million shares priced between $19 and $21 per share, aiming to raise about $630 million. 
Denver, Colorado-based Frontier, which is owned by private equity firm Indigo Partners, flies to more than 100 destinations in the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean and operates 100-plus Airbus A320 family aircrafts.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Securities,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Evercore ISI are the lead underwriters for Frontier's offering.

576,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 08:09AM ET</span>",Surprising Business-Spending Growth Delivering for U.S. Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- The velocity of the U.S. economy’s post-pandemic rebound hinges on more than just an increasingly capable consumer, and business spending appears poised to deliver its own boost.
Economic growth balances on a combination of factors, notably consumer spending, housing demand, government outlays and investment. And while household spending is poised to surge in the next two quarters, capital investment is already flexing its muscle.
Like the rest of the economy, nonresidential fixed investment -- including capacity-enhancing projects such as warehouses, distribution facilities, machinery, computers and software -- plummeted in the first half of 2020. But in the last half of the year, business spending surged, driven in large part by investment in equipment.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc. and retailer Urban Outfitters Inc (NASDAQ:URBN). are among companies investing in operations as businesses seek more efficiency or adapt to changing consumption habits in a post-Covid world.
In the fourth quarter, when consumers pulled back after a record pace in the previous three months, nonresidential outlays raced ahead and outpaced personal spending by the most since 2011 in percentage terms. More recent monthly data show business investment growth continues to roll on.
From August through January, orders for capital goods excluding military hardware and commercial aircraft -- a proxy for business investment -- posted the strongest six-month annualized pace of growth in data back to 1992.
And that trend is seen continuing as Covid-19 vaccinations increase, government officials loosen business restrictions and household spending quickens.
“As consumption rebounds, we think that business investment will also grow just as quickly, if not more quickly than consumer spending,” said Brian Rose, senior economist Americas at UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG).
Part of that may reflect pent-up investment. A recent Census Bureau survey of small businesses found that nearly a fourth of the respondents had postponed their planned 2020 capital expenditures. As economic growth strengthens, smaller firms could join larger companies in plowing more capital into their businesses.
A Deloitte LLP survey of 128 chief financial officers across North America showed first-quarter capital spending in the U.S. rising 9.8% from a year ago.
Investment in equipment will rise another 15.5% on an annualized basis in the first quarter after growing 25.7% in the final three months of 2020, according to the latest Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta GDPNow estimate. Intellectual property and outlays for nonresidential structures are also seen advancing further.
“The pandemic itself and the aftermath will require business investment,” Rose said.
For instance, when a restaurant reopens under new management, some of the idle equipment can be re-used but still, a sizable amount of investment is required to retool the space. An estimated 91,000 restaurants and bars closed in 2020, the bulk of which were small, according to data compiled by Technomic, a Chicago-based research company. Some of these spaces are being converted into chains and ghost kitchens.
“Companies that couldn’t keep their head above water had to pull the plug, but there are opportunities out there to change business models,” said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. “Changing things around to keep your customers and yet keep the lights on -- that spurs spending.”
Other investments may be more structural, such as adding more warehouses and distribution centers or perhaps re-designing or converting office space. Google said Thursday that it’s planning a $7 billion investment in offices and data centers that could create 10,000 new jobs this year.
Frank Conforti, chief operating officer of Urban Outfitters said on a March 2 earnings call that capital expenditures are planned at about $250 million for the clothing retailer’s fiscal year, in large part because of the construction of a new distribution facility just outside of Kansas City.
New technologies, such as 5G, may also come into play. As will broader initiatives like shifting to more environmentally friendly products and business practices.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. received 82 orders in February -- its second-best month in two years -- as some airlines shift toward more fuel-efficient planes.
The rise of automation will also play a role. Research has shown the pandemic accelerated the automation of jobs, and by 2025 the World Economic Forum estimates the time spent on current tasks by humans and machines will be equal. Half of the employers surveyed for the report said they planned to accelerate automation as a result of Covid-19.
More Automation
Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer of PepsiCo, said in February that he expects capital spending to remain “elevated for the next couple of years” as the company looks to increase plant automation and capabilities.
Low borrowing costs have the potential of supporting capital investment, though research shows mixed evidence on the impact of interest rates and business spending.
For the businesses that can invest, the recently-signed $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill -- the second-largest stimulus package in U.S. history -- offers an additional incentive.
“You’ve got unprecedented amounts of fiscal stimulus coming,” BMO’s Lee said. “It’s a pretty powerful tailwind for economic growth and for businesses as well.

The French state is also seeking 1 billion euros in damages, the court said in a statement - bringing potential penalties to at least 3 billion euros ($3.6 billion), below the 4.5 billion euros record imposed on UBS in the original trial. 
A French court in 2019 found UBS guilty of soliciting clients illegally and laundering the proceeds of tax evasion, setting a 3.7 billion euro ($4.4 billion) fine and 800 million euros in civil damages. 
UBS has denied any wrongdoing and is fighting for acquittal in court. 
It has set aside only 450 million euros to cover charges, and has argued that any fine should be based on the amount of unpaid taxes and not the total funds parked by clients in Switzerland, citing a 2019 ruling by France's top court in a different case. 

The trial is set to end on March 24 and a verdict could yet take several months.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) may have released outdated information on its latest COVID-19 vaccine trial, giving an ""incomplete"" picture of its efficacy, a leading U.S. health agency said on Tuesday, casting doubt on the shot's potential U.S. rollout and plunging its developers, once again, into controversy.
The surprise public rebuke from federal health officials comes just one day after interim data from the drugmaker showed better-than-expected results from the U.S. trial. That had been seen as a scientific counter to concerns that have dogged the shot over its effectiveness and possible side effects.
The vaccine, developed with Oxford University, was 79% effective in preventing symptomatic illness in the large trial that also took place in Chile and Peru, according to the data. It was also 100% effective against severe or critical forms of the disease and hospitalisation, and posed no increased risk of blood clots.
The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), an independent committee overseeing the trial, has ""expressed concern that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information from that trial, which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data,"" the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said in a statement https:// released after midnight in the United States.
""We urge the company to work with the DSMB to review the efficacy data and ensure the most accurate, up-to-date efficacy data be made public as quickly as possible,"" it said, adding that the DSMB had informed AstraZeneca of its concerns.
AstraZeneca did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Its shares were down 1.2% in midmorning trade.
The statement raises fresh questions about the vaccine's efficacy as it is being administered in dozens of countries worldwide and clouds the timeline for its emergency use authorization in the United States.
""This is indeed an extraordinary act. The negative reports about this vaccine do not stop, although my assessment is that it is well tolerated and safe, but clearly less effective than the two mRNA vaccines,"" Peter Kremsner, from the University Hospital in Tuebingen, Germany.
Rival vaccines from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) that use so-called mRNA technology produced efficacy rates of around 95% each, far above the 50% benchmark set by global regulators.
The DSMB is organised by NIAID, and its role is to provide study oversight and evaluate clinical data to ensure safe and ethical conduct of the study. NIAID is headed by U.S. infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci and is part of the National Institutes of Health. 
""DSMB externalisations of concerns are deeply unusual for multinational pharma companies and suggest an extraordinary high level of friction between the DSMB and the sponsor,"" Citi analysts said in a note.
DOUBTS RAISED
Hailed as a milestone in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic when it first emerged as a vaccine contender, the AstraZeneca shot has faced questions since late last year when the drugmaker and Oxford University published data with different efficacy readings due to a measurement error.
Later analysis suggested the dosing interval rather than the amount of dose administered was responsible for the difference.
Confidence in the vaccine took a further hit this month when more than a dozen countries, mostly in Europe, temporarily suspended the shot after reports linked it to a rare blood clotting disorder in a very small number of people.
The European Union's drug regulator said last week it was safe but an opinion poll on Monday showed Europeans remained sceptical about its safety.
Fauci, who also serves as chief medical advisor to U.S. President Joe Biden, said on Monday the U.S. trial found no indication at all of the rare blood clots and the statement from the NIAID didn't raise questions about the trial's findings regarding blood clotting.
The latest data, which has yet to be reviewed by independent researchers, was based on 141 infections among 32,449 participants.
Analysts had noted AstraZeneca's achievement of producing strong trial data against a backdrop of more infectious variants spreading in the United States and other countries.
Stephen Evans, a pharmacoepidemiology professor at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the up-to-date data request may have to do with efficacy readings from recent infections which may include new variants and thus lower protection rates. 
""The other vaccines may also show such reduced efficacy and we don’t know by how much. It does not leave me concerned particularly unless they had found a safety issue that was being hidden, which does not appear to be the case.""
The AstraZeneca vaccine is seen as crucial in tackling the spread of COVID-19 across the globe because it is easier and cheaper to transport than rival shots.

It has been granted conditional marketing or emergency use authorization in more than 70 countries. Many countries are relying heavily on it to end the pandemic, and several state leaders have taken the shot to boost confidence in the vaccine including South Korea's President Moon Jae-in who received it on Tuesday.

(Reuters) - Turkey's stock market has logged its worst two days since the global financial crisis of 2008 this week, with bank shares plunging and stop-loss halts activated after President Tayyip Erdogan shocked investors by sacking the central bank governor. 
The fall in the main BIST-100 index on Monday was the largest since mid-2013, when a ""taper tantrum"" in response to the U.S. Federal Reserve's announcement it would ease asset purchases in future rattled emerging markets including Turkey. 
In the two sessions after Erdogan's firing on Saturday of Naci Agbal, a policy hawk, in favour of Sahap Kavcioglu, who like Erdogan is a critic of high rates, three circuit breakers briefly halted all trading on the Istanbul exchange.
Although the index briefly turned positive on Tuesday in high volatility following an initial dive, analysts said foreign investors were abandoning positions.
""Foreigners are vacating their positions at their losses regardless of the price, and the reaction in the market seems difficult until these orders are finished,"" said Enver Erkan of Tera Yatirim. 
Graphic: Turkish stocks - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovarddgpa/stockgraphic.png
Agbal, appointed less than five months ago as the fourth governor in five years, had drawn market plaudits by lifting the policy interest rate by 875 basis points, to 19%, to curb double-digit inflation. The latest hike was on Thursday, two days before he was removed. 
One of Erdogan's economic advisors, Yigit Bulut, called the stock selloff a temporary speculative attack. Speaking on broadcaster Haberturk, he said Turks had sold $5.1 billion on Monday to profit from high exchange rates as the lira fell to near record lows following Agbal's departure.
Before the partial recovery, Turkey's banking index was down 8%, with Garanti Bank and Akbank leading the losses.
Many local retail investors selling shares ""recently entered the market and have no experience with sell-offs,"" said Tuncay Tursucu, director of research at Integral Securities. ""On the other hand we see companies and stakeholders keep on buying and taking gradual long term positions."" 

Tursucu added the selling may continue through the week.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Demand for domestic air travel is rising in Russia but not nearly as strongly as fuel prices, squeezing airlines' still-brittle finances, as competition between carriers helps to rein in fares.
Airport fuel prices have returned almost to pre-crisis levels after having fallen close to 2016 levels early last year as airlines grounded their fleets in April during Russia's first and only lockdown, which ran until June. 
Passenger flows have gradually recovered since autumn, primarily on domestic flights, though demand remains far from pre-crisis levels and ticket prices are unchanged because of competition between carriers and low customer spending power.
""The rise in prices for jet fuel is bad for airlines given the equal prices and reduced demand,"" a spokesman for flagship state carrier Aeroflot told Reuters.
Aeroflot said fuel costs tripled from the second quarter to the fourth quarter to 15 billion roubles ($201 million). Prices have risen more than 40% since June, the spokesman said. 
The average fuel price at Moscow airports is almost 70% higher than last May, not far from a peak in 2018-19, according to Refinitiv data. 
At that high, fuel accounted for 26% to 31% of airline Red Wings' total expenditure before falling to 19% in 2020, a company spokesman said. Now it is rising rapidly, he added.
""This will definitely worsen the financial condition of airlines, because it is impossible to transfer this increase onto the ticket price - competition is strong, but effective demand is low,"" he said.
Airlines expect a further seasonal increase in May and June, said a spokeswoman for Ural Airlines. 
""This will add to the losses of airlines that are already in a very difficult financial situation ... sooner or later it will lead to the need for state support for the whole industry,"" said Mikhail Ganelin, a senior analyst at Aton, a brokerage.
The lockdown and shutdown of many international flight routes halved passenger flows last year.
The government provided airlines with support of almost 21 billion roubles and helped Aeroflot by buying shares in a new share offering.
Airline losses may have totalled 200 billion roubles last year, the Association of Air Transport Operators (AEVT) said.
AEVT, which groups most large airlines except Aeroflot, has made proposals to the government to help carriers with concessions such as subsidies and tax breaks, an industry source told Reuters.

Powell and Yellen will appear before the House Financial Services Committee later Tuesday, starting two days of congressional hearings aimed at assessing the economic policy response to the Covid-19 crisis.
The Fed chief will reiterate the central bank's plan to support the recovery ""for as long as it takes"", according to the release of his prepared testimony, even while acknowledging that the recovery has progressed more quickly than expected.
Financial markets have started to position for the Fed’s first interest rate hike coming before 2024, as the central bank guided towards at its last meeting, on the belief that the recently approved massive stimulus package combined with the very accommodative easy money policy will lead to an overheated economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.3% higher Monday, the S&P 500 ended up 0.7%, just around 1% off its record closing high, while the Nasdaq Composite closed up 1.2%.
Tuesday marks the one-year anniversary of the market’s bottom caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, both the S&P 500 and DJIA have advanced 80% and the Nasdaq Composite has gained just over 90%.
In the corporate sector, AstraZeneca ADR (NASDAQ:AZN) dropped premarket after a U.S. health agency casted doubts about the positive results of the drugmaker’s recent Covid-19 vaccine trial, saying it may have used ""outdated information."" This will raise concerns about the likelihood of its emergency usage approval in the important U.S. market.
Also of interest will be the release of GameStop's (NYSE:GME) first-quarter earnings after the closing bell, the first report from the video game retailer since it the much followed meme stock benefited from a substantial short squeeze.
Economic data will center around the housing market, with February’s new home sales due at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT). These are expected to show a 6.5% decline from the prior month.
Oil prices traded sharply lower Tuesday, the day after Germany, the largest consumer of crude in Europe, confirmed that it would be extending its mobility restrictions to combat the third wave of the virus currently hitting the continent.
U.S. crude futures traded 4.6% lower at $58.75 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 4.6% to $61.67.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,740.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% lower at 1.1884.

585,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 06:26AM ET</span>","In Southeast Asian internet battle, Sea's rise sends rivals scrambling","By Fanny Potkin and Anshuman Daga
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - In front of an open-air Jakarta restaurant, delivery drivers clad in the orange colours of Southeast Asia tech group Sea Ltd wait for orders next to the green-jacketed riders of market leaders Gojek and Grab, in what has become the latest battleground for tech supremacy in Southeast Asia.
The humble noodles eatery signed up for Sea's nascent ShopeeFood service a month ago, but ""immediately, there were orders everyday,"" said manager M.A Rasyid.
Riding on the success of a cash-generating gaming business, U.S.-listed Sea has invested heavily in its Shopee e-commerce brand and successfully taken on  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s Lazada and other rivals in recent years. Its share price has risen five-fold over the past year, giving Singapore-based Sea a market value of $111 billion.
Now it is muscling into food delivery and financial services in Indonesia, the world's fourth-most-populous country, posing a new threat to regional rivals including ride-hailing and delivery unicorns Grab and GoJek.
At stake is a slice of the more than 400 million internet users in Southeast Asia's digital economy, which is estimated to triple to $309 billion by 2025, according to a study by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Temasek and Bain & Company. 
Tech behemoths, including Tencent, a major investor in Sea, Alibaba, Google and Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group Corp, are big backers of regional champions.
Sources say Sea's aggressive expansion is one driver of merger discussions between Gojek and e-commerce platform Tokopedia. The Indonesian firms aim to create an $18 billion powerhouse to fight off Sea and regional giant Grab.
Meanwhile, Grab and others, including travel app Traveloka and Indonesian e-commerce unicorn Bukalapak, are rushing for public listings, hoping to ride the coattails of Sea's stock rally while defending their turf, according to Reuters interviews with over a dozen people.
""Sea is like Thanos, massive and powerful, and able to take down half of the world, or in this case half the startups,"" Willson Cuaca, co-founder of East Ventures and an early backer of Tokopedia, joked as he compared Sea to the powerful villain in the Marvel film series.
""Like the Avengers, companies need to band together if they want to ensure their survival and to win the war.""
CASH IS KING
Sea's stock rally reflects a scarcity of options for investors seeking exposure to the booming Southeast Asia internet sector. It went public in 2017 and has raised some $7 billion in share and debt sales, with early investor Tencent now holding a stake of about 20%.
That investor appetite, combined with a need to raise cash to match Sea's muscle, is forcing rivals to seek listings as quickly as they can, bankers and executives familiar with the matter say.
Sources say the Gojek-Tokopedia merger, which is likely to be finalised within weeks, will be followed by a Jakarta listing in the second half of 2021, then a mega IPO in the United States targeted for 2022.
Grab and Traveloka, for their part, aim to accelerate the process by merging with special purpose acquisition companies, sources said. Bukalapak is planning the same, after a 2021 Jakarta IPO.
""The market is pretty welcoming for tech stocks. It's an opportunity for Grab if they are ready for it,"" said Jixun Foo, a managing partner at GGV Capital, which has invested in Grab.
COLLISION COURSE
Sea's success owes much to its online gaming business Garena, whose 2017 title Free Fire became the most downloaded game globally over the past two years.
It's using the cash from Garena to repeat its success in e-commerce, food delivery and financial services.
Sea's Shopee division started off in 2015 as a platform for local sellers and soon gained traction with merchants regionally. It has now overtaken both Lazada as the top e-commerce player regionally and Tokopedia as the leader in Indonesia, thanks in part to innovations such as adding social features to its service.
Both Gojek and Grab, which have pursued on-again, off-again merger talks with each other for years, believe they can ward off Sea's move into food delivery thanks to well-honed logistics networks and early-mover advantages.
But they could be hard-pressed to match Sea's subsidies in Indonesia. In Vietnam, Sea-owned food delivery service Now is the market leader, while Grab is No. 2, according to a January report by advisory firm Momentum Works, whose COO Yorlin Ng, said Southeast Asia's food delivery sector grew 183% in 2020.
""Now had the advantage of being local and being early,"" Ng said. ""Sea's backing definitely helps.""
In Indonesia, ShopeeFood is wooing vendors by touting its 80 million-strong user base and promising to subsidise steep discounting.
The next showdown will be in financial services.
Sea has bought Indonesia's Bank BKE and has hired a veteran of China's peer-to-peer platforms to head its ""SeaMoney"" banking efforts.
""SeaMoney can become the Ant Financial of Southeast Asia,"" said Daniel Jacobs, managing partner at emerging markets hedge fund Kora, a Sea shareholder.
""After payments, they have the vision and will to grow into adjacent areas, from 'buy now, pay later' on the customer side to merchant credit and all sorts of financial services.""
But Tokopedia and Grab, both of which own part of Indonesian payment app OVO, have similar ambitions. And Sea and Grab are set to square off in Singapore, where both won coveted digital bank licences in December.
Grab is backed by investors including SoftBank Group and Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group.

""This is going to be a battle of the titans,"" said Patrick Walujo, the co-founder of Indonesia-focused private-equity firm Northstar Group and a Gojek investor.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The COVAX vaccine-sharing scheme will set aside 5% of the vaccine doses it procures for a ""buffer"" to be used in humanitarian settings or released in the case of severe outbreaks, the GAVI vaccine alliance said on Tuesday.
That amounts to up to 100 million vaccine doses by the end of 2021, it said.
COVAX is the programme backed by the World Health Organization and GAVI vaccine alliance to provide vaccines for poor and middle-income countries. So far, 31 million doses have been delivered to 57 economies, although the rates trail behind wealthier countries, revealing inequity that WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described this week as ""grotesque"".
GAVI said that the reserve doses would be used in areas where there were ""unavoidable gaps in coverage"", such as conflict zones and areas controlled by armed groups inaccessible to governments.
""As we have started the rollout of millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines to COVAX economies, it is essential to also protect high-risk groups caught in crisis settings,"" said Seth Berkley, CEO of GAVI.

The contingency doses could also be used as part of an ""emergency release"" to quell severe outbreaks of COVID-19 where regular vaccine allocation timelines are insufficient, it said. Those doses will only, however, be available once all COVAX participants have received their early doses.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions in Canada's oil and gas sector had a record start to the year in 2021 as companies took advantage of improved oil price expectations amid the pandemic recovery, and many industry participants expect the trend to continue. 
The flurry of deals underscores the Canadian energy sector's desire to grow to benefit from the rebound in oil prices as global fuel demand picks up. It also reflects smaller companies betting on economies of scale.
""As the funding markets have opened back up off the rebound in commodity prices, you're going to see more of those asset deals, and you'll see a lot more of similar-sized companies coming together,"" said Luke Gordon, head of Canadian mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). 
Oilfield services provider Secure Energy Services' proposed C$478 million merger with Tervita Corp this month took year-to-date Canadian energy sector deals to a record $18 billion, according to data from Dealogic.
Canadian energy sector deals made up 16.2% of global volumes of $111.4 billion between the start of the year and March 18, the highest amount since 2002, the data showed.
While U.S. year-to-date activity totaled $26.1 billion, it was below the record $83.6 billion in 2017.

Graphic: Canada energy deal values, 1995-2021 (Q1) - https://graphics.reuters.com/CANADA-ENERGY/GRAPHIC/xlbpgxzrmvq/chart.png
Investors are cheering the deals, with acquirers' stock generally climbing in the aftermath of announcements. Shares in Secure are up 10% since the merger was proposed, outperforming the Canadian energy index, which has fallen 3% over the same period.
'ORGANIC MODEL DEAD'
Stephen Duench, vice-president and portfolio manager at AGF Investments Inc, said a lot of the debt-laden small-cap companies also have good assets and M&A helps them to unlock the value of these assets. 
""We've had quite a remarkable bounce-back in the markets and within the energy sector, so that probably accelerated a lot of these guys"" to go ahead with the deals, he added.
Grant Fagerheim, chief executive officer of Whitecap Resources (OTC:SPGYF), a Calgary-based oil and gas company, expects the consolidation to continue.
""What we're expecting is a tighter credit environment, with fewer lenders and higher-cost debt,"" he said. ""I feel we are in the third or fourth inning of a nine-inning game.""
Credit spreads are widening as banks re-evaluate their risk appetite for smaller producers, Fagerheim said. As a result, some producers are looking to grow. 
Whitecap executed two deals in the second half of 2020 using stock to buy rivals Nal Resources and TORC Oil & Gas, which allowed it to reduce debt, Fagerheim said, in a type of deal likely to be replicated.
The recovery in oil prices from last year's lows means more companies are incentivized to move ahead with deals.
""The organic growth model is dead,"" said Adam Waterous, chief executive of Canadian private equity firm Waterous Energy Fund, which this month completed its takeover of Osum Oil Sands Corp for C$171 million ($137 million).
""Puff Daddy said it all: 'It's all about the Benjamins,'"" he said, referring to the American rapper's song about the U.S. $100 bill. ""If Canadian companies want access to U.S. investors' cash, they have to gain scale,"" he added.

(Reuters) - Private equity firm Thoma Bravo LP said on Tuesday it has agreed to acquire workplace software firm Calabrio Inc from KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed but people familiar with the matter said the deal values Calabrio at more than $1 billion, including debt. KKR paid $200 million to acquire Calabrio in 2016. 
Minneapolis, Minnesota-based Calabrio provides a cloud-based software that allows companies like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Inc track and analyze customer service data generated from their contact centers. 
Calabrio grew its recurring revenue to nearly 80% of total revenue, up from just 30% about four years ago when it was acquired by KKR, Thomas Goodmanson, its chief executive officer said in an interview.
The increase has in part been driven by the shift to remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""The pandemic has really shifted a focus to the cloud, in our industry where we help companies take care of their customers, they had to send their contact center agents home and our software was in a perfect place to help them,"" Goodmanson said.

Thoma Bravo is one the largest software-focused private equity firms with $77 billion in assets under management. Its portfolio companies include information technology services provider SolarWinds Corp and cybersecurity firm McAfee Corp.

Its stock weighed on Europe's industrial goods and services sector , while automakers slid 1.8% to give back some of their recent gains.

""But as long as the vaccine efficacy is not being put into question, we think investors will look through short-term volatility."" 
The STOXX 600 last week climbed to their highest level since February, recouping most of the pandemic-driven losses on hopes that vaccination drives and stimulus measures will spur a strong economic rebound.
The gains have slowed this week amid worries about a surge in COVID-19 cases. The tally of new cases in France accelerated despite the start of a third lockdown, while Austria postponed the reopening of cafe and restaurants.

MIXED MOOD
A mixed bag of new Western sanctions on China, coronavirus concerns and Turkish tumult after President Tayyip Erdogan's shock sacking of the central bank chief at the weekend left investors awaiting a firmer signal.
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.66%, hurt by a 0.95% fall in Chinese blue chips as a fresh wave of U.S. and European sanctions related to human rights abuses in Xinjiang hit.
The fresh sanctions on China prompted an immediate riposte from Beijing against the EU that appeared broader, including European lawmakers, diplomats, institutes and families.
Adding to market jitters were further worries over the efficacy of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc vaccine developed with Oxford University after a U.S. health agency said the drugmaker may have included outdated information in its data.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.62% and there was a tepid market debut for Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), which saw the Chinese tech giant's shares barely trade above their secondary listing price. 
Japan's Nikkei fell 0.61%, but emerging markets in the region performed better.
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last yielded 1.6505%, down from 1.732% late on Friday. 
The dollar gained slightly against a basket of six major currencies last trading at 92.019, having slipped 0.32% on Monday, while making advances against the kiwi, Aussie and sterling.
The New Zealand dollar hit a three-month low after the government introduced taxes to curb housing speculation, a move investors reckoned could allow the central bank to hold interest rates lower for longer with less risk of a property bubble. 
Oil also dropped amid ample supply and concerns that new pandemic curbs and slow vaccine rollouts in Europe will slow a recovery in fuel demand.
""Global travel is still looking like it could be a while away,"" said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker at Star Fuels in Dubai, adding that a second-half recovery in oil demand looked doubtful as lockdowns remain the order of the day.

The company, which has 18 production facilities globally, was forced by the shortage to cut production at its factories in Belgium and Brazil.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts estimated that Volvo would make 16,000 fewer trucks in the second quarter and consensus earnings could come down by 4-7% this year.
The Swedish company, a rival of Germany's Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and Traton, said late on Monday visibility into the supply chain of semiconductors was very low and that the disturbances would also impact other group business areas.
Assuming four weeks of lost sales in Europe and Brazil and a greater than 30% drop through, the impact would be 3.6 billion Swedish crowns ($421.7 million) on second-quarter earnings before interest and tax, Citi analysts estimated.
Semiconductor shortages have hit global automakers, forcing them to cut or halt production as the available supply of chips were booked by makers of consumer electronics such as smartphones - the chip industry's preferred customers because they buy more advanced, higher-margin chips.
U.S. automakers such as General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford, Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Japan's Honda Motor have all suffered a hit to production.
Volvo Cars, owned by China's Geely Holdings, had also said it would temporarily stop or adjust production in China and the United States for parts of March.

Investing.com – China’s  Baidu  (NASDAQ:BIDU) Inc.(HK:9888) made an underwhelming Hong Kong debut on Tuesday, with shares trading at less than 1% premium and underperforming the city’s other recent technology listings.
Shares of the internet search engine company were at HK$252.60 ($32.53) by 13:09 AM ET (5:09 AM GMT), after opening at HK$254 and climbing as high as HK$256.60.
Baidu’s secondary listing raised $23.7 billion, or $3.05 billion, and its market value stood at HK$707.4 billion It sold 95 million shares priced at HK$252, which was lower than the high-end market target of HK$295.
The listing follows that of short-video app operator  Kuaishou Technology  (HK:1024) in February 2021, which raised $5.3 billion and enriched investors by 161%. The Kuaishou offering also saw 1,204 times in demand against the number of shares on offer to become the most sought-after retail offering in Hong Kong stock market history. Comparatively, the Baudi listing attracted 112 times subscription.
“Investors are not as compulsive as during the Kuaishou IPO to go into the market and make a killing... I don’t think we have that atmosphere or sentiment anymore, Wealthy Securities managing director Louis Tse Ming-Kwong said before the shares began trading.
Internet-platform operators such as Baidu have been subject to tighter onshore regulatory oversight. The bond market fluctuations arising from concerns about the tighter policy have also driven investors to the safety of old-economy stocks.
Timing also played a part in Baidu’s luck, with investor sentiment on technology companies souring due to valuation concerns and the Hang Seng Index also declined 22% from its February 2021 high.
Geopolitical tensions also caused market caution, after the U.S., U.K., European Union, and Canada imposed sanctions on China over alleged human rights abuses on Xinjiang’s Uyghurs.
According to its prospectus, Baidu controlled about 73% of the knowledge and information-centric internet platforms business in China by revenue in 2020. The market is expected to grow rapidly, projected to reach CNY342 billion ($52.52 billion) in 2025 from CNY89.6 billion in 2015."
596,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 01:10AM ET</span>","Soy, sugar traders fight for space in Latam's largest port; costs jump","By Ana Mano and Marcelo Teixeira
SAO PAULO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Soy and sugar traders are fighting for room in Latin America's largest port, rushing to secure loading slots as the slowest Brazilian soy harvest in 10 years pushes the grains export window into the sugar season.
Congestion was hitting Brazil's Santos port just as consumers worldwide have been turning to top exporter Brazil for sugar and soybean supplies. The glut of shipments waiting to leave is boosting transport costs and will likely delay arrivals at destinations. 
Sugar prices hit a four-year high late last month, boosted by supply tightness. Soybean prices, already near seven-year highs, could rise further at a time when Brazil is effectively the world's main supplier.
""It is a perfect storm, a combination of factors that are leading to soy and sugar to compete for logistics,"" said Tiago Medeiros, Brazil head and executive director for Czarnikow Group, a food trader and supply chain services provider.
Brazil usually starts soybean exports in January, with volumes increasing in later months. This season, planting was delayed, as was the harvest, pushing that window further out.
Shipments from the new sugar crop usually start around April, but companies are still shipping stocks from a bumper crop in 2020. Brazil's Agriculture Ministry saw sugar stocks at 7.3 million tonnes in mid-February, the highest for the last three years.
Market players expect growing delays in coming months, with ships likely waiting several weeks before being able to dock in Santos.
Medeiros noted that spot prices for both sugar and soybean futures are higher than deferred ones. This inverted chart position signals near-term supply tightness, he said, which could mean financial losses for sellers if they fail to deliver on time.
""So everyone wants to get products out as soon as possible,"" he said. 
Most crops in Brazil are moved by truck, so truck freight costs spiked due to the rush of goods.
Traders said shipowners sharply raised demurrage, the daily fee charged for port delays, from around $18,000 per day to $30,000 per day on trips to Brazil.
Because of long vessel waiting times, French trader Sucden said India might be an alternate sugar supplier, but traders said its supply is constrained for several reasons.
""Brazil mainly exports raws, while India has surplus of whites. So direct substitution is limited,"" said a source at a large sugar trader in India. 
SOY OPTIONS
Chinese soy buyers would normally turn to the United States to avoid Brazilian congestion, but U.S. farmers have little to offer. Due to strong demand, the United States will only have about 10 days worth of soybean supplies before the U.S. harvest starts in September. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast soybean stocks at the Aug. 31 end of the 2020/21 marketing year at 120 million bushels, down sharply from 525 million a year earlier. It would be the smallest ending stocks since 2013/14.
By mid-March vessels were expected to load nearly 8.82 million tonnes of soybeans in Santos and Paranagua, the two largest Brazilian ports, 27% more than at this time last year, according to data from SA Commodities/Unimar shipping agency. Sugar loading at both ports was seen 71% up at 1.27 million tonnes.
Traders controlling terminals in Santos such as  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) and COFCO and logistics operators usually turn berths from grains to sugar as the year progresses. That job will be harder this year, the sources said. Last year, some vessels in Brazil waited as long as 45 days to load sugar at the key sugar terminal operated by Rumo SA. 

""It will likely be worse,"" said a U.S.-based sugar broker.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's Geely Automobile Holdings (OTC:GELYF) Ltd said on Tuesday it and its parent Zhejiang Geely Holding Group will form a joint venture for electric vehicles (EV) and launch a new brand called Zeekr, after its profit fell 32% last year.
In a stock exchange filing, Geely Automobile said the venture will work on research and development, purchase and sale of smart electric vehicles under Zeekr brand.
Geely Automobile and parent Zhejiang Geely Holding Group will jointly invest 2 billion yuan in the new venture. Geely Automobile will own 51% of the new company, it said.
In two earlier reports, people familiar with the matter exclusively told Reuters about Geely's plans for the new company and brand.
Hangzhou-based Geely Automobile, highest-profile Chinese automaker in the world due to parent group's investments in Volvo Cars and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), posted 2020 profit of 5.53 billion yuan ($850 million), versus 8.19 billion yuan in 2019, as auto sales in the world's biggest market was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
One analyst expected Geely to post a profit of 4.02 billion yuan, according to Refinitiv data. 
Revenue fell 5% from the previous year to 92.11 billion yuan. 
Geely Automobile sold 1.32 million cars last year, down from 1.36 million units in 2019. It expects to sell 1.53 million cars this year. 
Geely Automobile's parent group announced a flurry of tie-ups by Geely earlier this year as the automaker pursues its goal of becoming a leading EV contract manufacturer and engineering service provider.

Geely Automobile and Volvo Cars last month abandoned their merger plans but launched a new entity to combine their powertrain operations and expand cooperation on electric vehicles.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down Tuesday morning, as investors awaited a slew of U.S. Treasury auctions and bond yields continued Monday’s decline.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.85% by 11:01 PM ET (3:01 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component fell 1.05%. Chinese relations with the U.S., U.K., the European Union, and Canada soured as they imposed sanctions  over alleged human rights abuses on Xinjiang’s Uyghurs.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 1.57%.  Baidu  (NASDAQ:BIDU) Inc (HK:9888) made its Hong Kong debut earlier in the day, with shares rising more than 1% from their issue price in early Asian trading.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched up 0.07% and South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.50%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.19%.
The ten-year U.S. Treasury yield eased from its highest level in over a year, raising hopes of improved demand in the U.S. Treasury’s auctions of two-, five- and seven-year debt throughout the week. Friday’s seven-year note auction is of particular interest as the maturity fared poorly in February's auction, sending benchmark yields sharply higher.
Investors, who had been worried that a strong economic recovery from COVID-19 would trigger inflation and a pullback in central bank stimulus, breathed a sigh of relief as bond yields stabilized.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the U.S. economy had progressed “more quickly than generally expected and looks to be strengthening”. However, he also added that it still far from fully recovering from the COVID-19-inflicted damage.
Powell’s comments were prepared for his first joint appearance with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee later in the day, where they will testify on Fed and Treasury COVID-19 policies.
“The rotation we see day-to-day at the moment is driven by that volatility in Treasury yields -- when yields go up, we see tech sell off and a rotation into value... that is fairly normal in early cycle, in the uncertainty around monetary policy,” Oreana Portfolio Advisory Services global chief investment officer Isaac Poole told Bloomberg.
Poole also said that he sees long-dated yields breaching 2% in 2021, to value stocks' benefit.
Across the Atlantic, investors are also keeping an eye on Turkey. They continue to digest President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s replacement of hawkish central bank governor Naci Agbal with Sahap Kavcioglu over the weekend.
The uneven global economic recovery from COVID-19 also capped stocks’ gains. Some European countries, including Germany, extended or re-imposed restrictive measures, while New York City mayor Bill de Blasio pressed pause on the city’s reopening due to insufficient information about COVID-19 variants."

BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) said on Monday it is hiring a prominent law firm to conduct an internal review after a report in a trade publication detailed new employee complaints about the conduct of executives, including senior leader Mark Wiedman.
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a staffwide memo on Monday that the company is retaining the law firm Paul, Weiss to conduct a review, following the complaints and other incidents that have come to light in recent weeks.
A copy of the memo was provided to Reuters by a company spokesman and is the latest in a series of penitent statements by the world's largest asset manager.
This time, Fink was responding to an article published by Institutional Investor that described a ""bro culture"" within BlackRock and detailed inappropriate remarks made by Wiedman, for which he apologized.
Such incidents ""should not happen at BlackRock,"" Fink wrote. A Paul, Weiss spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
With some $8.7 trillion under management, BlackRock has become one of the most influential voices pushing for more boardroom diversity and minority representation at other companies whose shares it owns.
Yet BlackRock itself has faced a rising number of complaints from women and minority employees about their treatment.
Last month, BlackRock described plans to beef up its process to investigate workers' concerns and expand training after former employees shared accounts on social media of racial and sexual harassment.
On Monday, the trade publication Institutional Investor said it had spoken with a number of current and former BlackRock employees who described how their experiences clashed with BlackRock's rhetoric. The report described how Wiedman, the company's head of international and of corporate strategy, made inappropriate remarks like publicly asking a woman about a choice of underwear at an employee dinner, held about a decade ago.
In a statement sent by the spokesman to Reuters and to Institutional Investor, Wiedman said that ""Those comments were a clumsy and misguided attempt at building camaraderie that failed terribly, and I am sorry.""

In response to the Institutional Investor article, a company spokesman said: ""BlackRock is committed to building a diverse firm and an inclusive culture. There are episodes recounted in this story that are appalling and behavior of that kind should never take place at BlackRock.""

(Reuters) - McKinsey & Co will pay $45 million to settle an investigation by Nevada of the big consulting firm's role in fueling the U.S. opioid epidemic.
Nevada had been the lone holdout among U.S. states investigating McKinsey's conduct, and Monday's settlement boosts the firm's payout for opioid settlements to about $641 million.
McKinsey had in early February reached a $573 million settlement with 47 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories, plus $23 million of settlements with Washington state and West Virginia. 
A McKinsey spokesman said the firm did not admit wrongdoing or liability, believes its past work was lawful and has denied contrary allegations.
The settlements came after lawsuits showed how McKinsey advised drug manufacturers, including Purdue Pharma, which makes OxyContin, on how to market opioids, including by targeting high-volume prescribers.
Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford said his state settled separately because Nevada has been particularly hard hit by the opioid epidemic and has seen a resurgence of opioid-related deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""McKinsey's willingness to settle with Nevada, along with sister states, will help focus our energy on addressing the problem,"" Ford said in a statement.
The U.S. government has said opioids contributed to the deaths of more than 450,000 people from 1999 to 2018.
On March 10, McKinsey replaced Kevin Sneader as global managing partner, elevating Bob Sternfels to that role.
In announcing the earlier opioid settlements, Sneader had said: ""We deeply regret that we did not adequately acknowledge the tragic consequences of the epidemic... We hope to be part of the solution to the opioid crisis in the U.S.""
Purdue, which is in bankruptcy, agreed last October to plead guilty to criminal charges over its marketing of OxyContin.

Members of the Sackler family who own Purdue have offered $4.275 billion to help settle about 3,000 lawsuits over the company's conduct.

(Reuters) -WeWork lost $3.2 billion last year, the office-sharing startup disclosed in a presentation shown to prospective investors as part of a pitch for $1 billion in investment and a stock market listing, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The company's losses narrowed from $3.5 billion in 2019 and it plans to go public at a valuation of $9 billion including debt through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), according to a person directly briefed on the presentation that was sent out to existing and potential new investors.
A SPAC is a shell company that raises funds in an IPO with the aim of acquiring a private company, which then becomes public as result of the merger.
Reuters reported in January that WeWork was in talks to go public through a merger with a SPAC and was exploring raising funds from private investors.
The company's plans for a high-profile initial public offering imploded in October 2019 due to widespread criticism over its business model and its founder Adam Neumann's management style. SoftBank Group Corp later bailed out the startup.
WeWork is now in talks with BowX Acquisition Corp, a blank-check company that raised $420 million in August, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the news.
WeWork declined to comment on the report.

The report said that WeWork forecast occupancy to rebound to 90% by the end of 2022, from 47% at the end of last year when the COVID-19 pandemic shut its co-working spaces around the world.
The company expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $485 million next year, the report added.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Starboard Value LP said on Monday that it nominated four directors to the board at eHealth Inc only days after the insurer reached a settlement for two seats with another firm.
Starboard, which owns 7% of eHealth, said in a regulatory filing that it feels the company's stock is undervalued, sending the stock price up nearly 5% in after-hours trading.
Starboard nominated Peter Feld, a partner and the firm's research director, plus three others.
EHealth said it has held discussions with Starboard and is ""open minded.""
""The Board is reviewing Starboard’s nominees and will present its formal recommendation in due course,"" the company said in a statement.
The move comes less than two weeks after eHealth agreed with hedge fund Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Executive Capital to add two independent directors to the board, a move that already pushed the share price higher. 
The two sides agreed to add John Hass, the former CEO of  Rosetta Stone  (NYSE:RST), immediately, bringing their board membership to eight, and pledged to find another director in the coming weeks.
Hudson Executive, which owns roughly 5.8% of eHealth, had also expressed concerns about the company's stock price. 
The stock closed at $68.09 on Monday.
Starboard did not say what it would like to see at eHealth but at other companies the firm has often pushed for sales of the company or changes in top management.
As the pace of activism picks up this year after a more subdued 2020, companies can sometimes find themselves targeted by more than one activist investor, bankers have said.
Starboard in particular is known to swoop in on a company that has already battled with a different activist, suggesting it considers itself better able to deliver on proposed changes than other activists can.
It nominated directors at  Elanco Animal Health  (NYSE:ELAN) in early March after the company settled for three board seats with Sachem Head Capital last year. Last year Starboard nominated directors at eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Commvault, which had each settled with another activist earlier.

(Reuters) - Major U.S. airline and travel groups on Monday urged the government to develop a plan to reopen international borders this summer, assuming COVID-19 vaccine and case counts continue to move towards positive trends.
In a letter sent to the White House COVID-19 recovery coordinator Jeffrey Zients, more than two dozen industry groups, including Airlines for America, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the U.S. Travel Association said: ""The time to plan for and chart a defined roadmap to reopen international travel is now.""
The United States has banned most travel from Britain, Europe, Brazil, China and South Africa since the coronavirus pandemic started taking hold last year, devastating the airline and travel industry globally.
The U.S. groups called for a risk-based, data-driven roadmap to safely lift those restrictions to be finalized before May 1 so that a plan is in place for international travel by the summer of 2021.
Travel within the U.S. has picked up considerably over the past week as more Americans become vaccinated, though the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still recommends against nonessential travel.
The United States has administered nearly 125 million doses of the vaccine but CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Monday she is ""very concerned"" that a leveling off of COVID-19 cases after a period of decline could signal a risk of renewed outbreaks as the United States works to get more people vaccinated.
The aviation groups said the resumption of international travel should be at the top of the agenda of the next G-7 Meeting in June and called for quick bilateral negotiations to ease travel restrictions through corridors between countries.
The roadmap should maintain testing for international traveling to the United States, except for those who have been vaccinated, they said, adding the government should not require vaccines as a prerequisite to travel.

A sharp decline in international travel in 2020 caused a loss of $146 billion to the U.S. economy and the U.S. Travel Association estimates that a total of a 1.1 million American jobs and $262 billion in export spending will be lost by the end of this year if international travel and demand are not restored.

Earlier this month, Reuters reported that the company had approached a group of banks for a new $4 billion revolving credit facility and had the option to raise the size to as much as $6 billion. (https://reut.rs/3rbbe5p)
""We have no current plans to draw on our credit revolvers, as we continue to be confident that we have sufficient liquidity and are not planning to increase our debt levels,"" said Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street rallied on Monday as technology stocks rebounded from a recent selloff sparked by surging bond yields and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped after a fund run by an influential investor in the electric-car maker said its shares could approach $3,000 by 2025.
Tesla Inc's 2.31% gain to $670 was the fourth-largest boost to the S&P 500 after Ark Invest, founded by star stockpicker Cathie Wood, raised the company's price target on Friday using 34 inputs in a Monte Carlo model.

Growth stocks rose more than 1.43% while value shares slid 0.07% in a reversal of this year's big rotation in investment portfolios.
A sharp run-up in Treasury yields since mid-February has weighed on high-flying technology stocks that benefit from low yields as investors swarmed into underpriced value stocks from the mega-cap growth stocks that have fueled the past year's rally.
An easing off of 14-month highs in the 10-year U.S. Treasury note's yield after it hit 1.754% last week has allowed tech shares to bounce back, said Tom Hayes, chairman of hedge fund Great Hill Capital LLC in New York.
""It's going to look like tech and growth is back but I think it will be much more moderate than people think,"" Hayes said. ""There's a plethora of growth, growth across many sectors, and we've seen managers bidding those (shares) up in cyclicals and value. I think that persists over the next 18 months,"" he said. 
The tech-heavy Nasdaq outpaced the S&P 500 and the Dow, both of which posted all-time highs last week on bets that stimulus and vaccine rollouts will likely lead to the strongest U.S. economic growth since 1983.
""The technology stocks are pretty beaten down and it's not shocking to see those rebounding a little bit from their lows,"" said Jake Wujastyk, chief market analyst and founding member of TrendSpider.

613,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2021 04:20PM ET</span>",Leon Black leaves Apollo executive roles after Epstein investigation,"By Chibuike Oguh and Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) - Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc co-founder Leon Black has left his executive positions at the private equity firm, a surprise move that caps a series of corporate governance changes triggered by a review of his ties to late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Black, who co-founded Apollo 31 years ago, stepped down as the company's chairman, with Jay Clayton, former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chief, taking over as non-executive chairman, according to a statement on Monday.
Black, 69, had planned to retain his role as chairman after relinquishing his post as chief executive officer in January following an independent review by law firm Dechert, which revealed that he had paid Epstein $158 million for advice on tax and estate planning and related services between 2012 and 2017. The review had cleared Black of any wrongdoing.
Apollo's stock price rose 4.5% to close at $49.42 per share after Black's departure was announced.
""The relentless public attention and media scrutiny concerning my relationship with Jeffrey Epstein - even though the exhaustive Dechert report concluded there was no evidence of wrongdoing on my part — have taken a toll on my health and have caused me to wish to take some time away from the public spotlight that comes with my daily involvement with this great public company,"" Black said in a letter to Apollo's board of directors.
Epstein was found dead at age 66 in August 2019 in a Manhattan jail, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges for allegedly abusing dozens of underage girls in Manhattan and Florida from 2002 to 2005. New York City's chief medical examiner ruled the cause of death was suicide by hanging.
Apollo said on Monday that co-founder Marc Rowan will formally take over as CEO after being named as Black's successor in January. Two new independent directors, Richard Emerson (NYSE:EMR) and Kerry Murphy Healey, were also added to Apollo's board.
New York-based Apollo had appointed Clayton, 54, who was SEC chairman from May 2017 to December 2020, as lead independent director in February to improve corporate governance after the review.
""I think it was appropriate that once Black left as CEO he also leave as chairman,"" said Charles Elson, a corporate governance expert and finance professor at the University of Delaware. ""If they wanted to remove affiliation, it wouldn't have made any sense if he remained as executive chairman overseeing the board.""
On Monday,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts upgraded Apollo's rating to ""Buy"" from ""Neutral,"" citing a sharp reduction in risks associated with investigations into Black's personal relationship with Epstein.
Black was subpoenaed last year by U.S. Virgin Islands Attorney General Denise George as part of a lawsuit against Epstein's estate seeking civil penalties and the forfeiture of assets including two private islands on which he allegedly raped and trafficked girls and young women.
Black has said he intends to cooperate with the inquiry as well as any other investigation.
Earlier this month, Apollo announced it would merge with Athene Holding (NYSE:ATH) Ltd in an $11 billion all-stock deal, bringing in-house an annuities provider that helped turn it into one of the world's largest corporate credit investors.
""In the last few months, not only did we announce a transformative merger with Athene, but also expect to report that our first-quarter earnings will exceed analyst consensus in all relevant measures,"" Black said in a statement on Monday.
""I thus view this as the ideal moment to step back and focus on my family, my wife Debra's and my health issues, and my many other interests,"" he added. 

Black said he will remain Apollo's single largest shareholder and hopes to return to the company at some point.

The United States 10-Year yield closed below 1.7% following a surge to 14-month highs last week, driven by technical factors that analysts say pushed rates too high too fast and will likely continue to subside.
The recent price action has been driven by overnight selling and U.S. banks holding back demand - all of which are ""likely to temper or reverse,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were in the green.

iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:chip stocks) inched higher despite ongoing supply-issues in the industry.
The decline in rates, however, triggered selling of rate-sensitive bank stocks, pushing financials and the broader value sector lower.
Sentiment on value stocks – which tend to rise in an improving economy – was also dented somewhat by a third wave of Covid-19 in Europe that threatens global demand.
United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) fell into the red, with the latter down about 4%, shrugging off data showing U.S. air travel hit one-year high.
The Transportation Security Administration said that it screened 1.5 million people on Sunday, the highest number of passengers it has seen on a single day since March 13 of last year. 
The news of the fresh lockdown in Europe, however, comes amid positive vaccine news that will bolster efforts in the fight against the pandemic. AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Covid-19 vaccine was found to be safe and 79% effective in the late-stage U.S. trials, paving the way for the drug maker to file an emergency use authorization from the Federal Food and Drug Administration in the coming weeks.  
Energy stocks were paced by sluggish oil prices and investor jitters that lockdowns across Europe will stifle air travel, hurting demand for jet fuel.
In other news, U.S.-China trade tensions appear to be on the rise again after the U.S. imposed sanctions against two Chinese officials over alleged human rights abuses. The move came as the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada took similar action against China."
615,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2021 04:00PM ET</span>","U.S. drillers, miners would be out billions if paid climate, health costs: study","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. coal, natural gas and motor fuel producers get implicit benefits worth tens of billion of dollars a year by not having to pay for the damage their products do to the climate and human health, a study said on Monday. 
As the world begins to transition to technologies that emit less pollution to generate electricity and fuel vehicles, economists are attempting to estimate the cost to society of burning fossil fuels.
In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, Yale University economist Matthew Kotchen calculated that U.S. fossil fuel companies get direct benefits of $62 billion a year in implicit subsidies due to what he calls ""inefficient pricing"".
The overall health, climate and transportation costs to society are about $568 billion, the study, titled ""The producer benefits of implicit fossil fuel subsidies in the United States"", said. 
Peabody Energy Corp got about $1.56 billion in implicit subsidies in 2018, while Arch Resources got a little over $1 billion in the same year, the study said.
Natural gas producer EQT Corp (NYSE:EQT) got about $696 million while  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) got about $688 million, it added.
None of the companies immediately commented when asked about the estimates.
The study, the first to estimate the benefits on a company specific basis, estimated coal companies would pay the most if policies were changed to account for the costs.
Kotchen launched the research as policymakers were considering new subsidies for fossil fuel companies to help them recover from anemic demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
President Joe Biden wants to end fossil fuel subsidies, but that could be difficult given the Democrats have the slimmest majority possible in the Senate, and some Democrats come from states that produce fossil fuels.

Still, the study could help spur policy to address the issues, said Gilbert Metcalf, an economist at Tufts University. ""A better understanding of the transfers involved ... should be extremely helpful for policy makers hoping to eliminate these wasteful subsidies.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy is set to release a 10-year strategic plan as early as Tuesday expected to propose slowing delivery standards for some first-class mail as he seeks to put the money-losing U.S. Postal Service (USPS) on firmer financial footing, two people briefed on the matter said.
""I would suggest that we are on a death spiral,"" DeJoy a U.S. House committee in February. At a separate March 11 congressional hearing, DeJoy signaled some changes, including acknowledging his plan would revise existing service standards.
The current delivery standards are ""not achievable,"" DeJoy said. ""We cannot go to California from New York in three days without going on planes and we don't own planes.""
A USPS spokesman declined to comment on the timing of the plan's release.
DeJoy has apologized for ""extreme delays"" in some mail deliveries.
The ""break-even"" reorganization plan would keep existing six-day delivery and would not close rural or small post offices, DeJoy said, adding: ""Our plan will have some big numbers investing into the organization and workforce -- approaching $40 billion. It's spurring innovation for growth.""
USPS faces shrinking volumes of first-class mail, increased costs of employee compensation and benefits, and higher unfunded liabilities along with $160 billion in projected losses over the next decade. Congress gave USPS a $10 billion loan last year to address COVID-19 expenses that it opted to forgive.
USPS reported net losses of $86.7 billion from 2007 through 2020. One reason is 2006 legislation mandating that it pre-fund more than $120 billion in retiree health care and pension liabilities, a requirement labor unions have called an unfair burden not shared by other businesses.

President Joe Biden has nominated three people to fill open seats on the USPS board, while 53 U.S. House lawmakers last week urged Biden to immediate remove the six current board members.

Investing.com -- The rotation from growth to value took a pause on Monday as interest rates let out some steam and put the attention back on the big tech companies.
As evidence the U.S. economy continues to reopen, the Transportation Security Administration screened 1.5 million travelers on Sunday, the most since March last year. Partiers are flocking to warmer weather climates, such as South Florida, where local officials had to impose a curfew to control crowds.
But evidence of a new wave of infections both in the U.S. and overseas could derail progress. German authorities agreed to extend another national lockdown through mid-April. France, Poland, and Italy also have lockdowns. This is putting a damper on oil prices as investors worry about demand for fuel.
Meanwhile, U.S.-China trade tensions appear to be on the rise again after the U.S. imposed sanctions against two Chinese officials over alleged human rights abuses.  
It’s a light day for data and earnings. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. GameStop earnings compare to the market’s valuation
The much-followed meme stock is scheduled to report first quarter earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday. It’ll be its first report since the Reddit stock trading crowd anointed the video game retailer the granddaddy of short squeezes. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect EPS of $1.35 on revenue of $2.2 billion.
 GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) shares trade nearly 10 times more than they did at the start of the year (based on Friday’s close), with a market value of more than $13 billion. It has a new strategy to focus on ecommerce thanks to investor and board member Ryan Cohen, the founder of  Chewy Inc  (NYSE:CHWY). But that work has just begun.
2. More home sales data
New home sales data will be released Tuesday at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT) and analysts expect the February numbers to show a 6.5% decline from the prior month.
Investors will be looking at the numbers to compare them to Monday’s existing home sales, which showed a drop in the number of homebuyers who were listing their homes at this time. With limited supply, prices jumped 15.8% in February and the median price of a home sold was $313,000, the highest February price ever. 
3. Pharma stocks get a look
AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) is getting its chance to shine after a rough few weeks facing questions about its two-dose Covid vaccine. On Monday, the company said its late stage trial proved 79% effective overall and 100% effective preventing serious illness and hospitalization.

619,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2021 03:10PM ET</span>",Big fashion companies lag behind on green targets,"By Victoria Waldersee and Silvia Aloisi
(Reuters) - The 15 largest listed fashion companies are lagging behind when it comes to meeting the social and environmental targets of the Paris climate agreement and UN Sustainable Development Goals, a new report by the Business of Fashion said on Monday.
The Business of Fashion, an online publication about the fashion industry, analysed in its report publicly disclosed information from the five biggest companies by revenue in three categories - luxury, sportswear, and high street fashion, including  Kering  (PA:PRTP), Adidas (OTC:ADDYY), H&M and others.
The fashion industry is under increasing pressure from consumers and governments to clean up its act. Statistics cited by the World Economic Forum show that the industry is responsible for at least 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions. 
The Business of Fashion's report scored companies out of 100 in their progress towards meeting sixteen targets which would align their performance with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Agreement on emissions, waste, workers' rights, water, and materials.
It also ranked the companies on transparency, or how much information about a company's practices was currently available.
Kering ranked top with 49 points and Under Armour (NYSE:UA) ranked lowest at 9 points. The average score for the companies was 36 points. 
The report found the companies were more likely to disclose information on targets than concrete actions towards fulfilling them. 
""Opaque working practices and fuzzy definitions of what constitutes 'good' progress complicate matters further, creating a woolly picture of where the industry is at and what steps are required for it to clean up its act,"" the report said.
Kering and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) performed best on transparency, while PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH), Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI), and VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) ranked highest on their efforts to reduce emissions. 
Under Armour scored lowest on all rankings except workers' rights, where LVMH ranked one point lower.
Scores for Hermes, LVMH and Richemont averaged lower than high street fashion companies H&M,  Inditex  (MC:ITX), Gap and Levi Strauss across the six categories - emissions, waste, workers' rights, materials and transparency.
On average overall, the companies performed worst on waste and workers' rights. Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing, Under Armour and Richemont reported the lowest average score across the six targets.
Kering sustainability chief Marie-Claire Daveu said the company was proud of the recognition given by Business of Fashion. Asked about the fact that the report highlighted all companies were falling short of targets, she recognised that sustainability was a ""long, never-ending journey.""
Adidas said it was working closely with its partners to achieve climate neutrality in its operations by 2025 and throughout its supply chains by 2050.
Other companies cited did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A panel of twelve sustainability experts advised on the methodology for the Business of Fashion's report.

LONDON (Reuters) - BP (NYSE:BP) Chief Executive Bernard Looney's remuneration was 1.735 million pounds ($2.4 million) in 2020 after it scrapped all bonuses during his first year in office due to the pandemic, the energy group said in its annual report.
Looney's pay included 1.18 million pounds in salary and 351,000 pounds in shares, while he and BP Chairman Helge Lund gave 20% of their salaries to mental health charities in recognition of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
By comparison, BP's competitor the overall pay package of Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) CEO Ben van Beurden's dropped by 42% to $7 million in 2020.
Looney's total remuneration for 2020 could have been up to 11 million pounds ($15.24 million) based on BP's remuneration plan, more than the $13.23 million his predecessor Bob Dudley, who stepped down in February 2020, earned in 2019.
But the 50-year-old Irishman's first year was dominated by BP's response to the coronavirus crisis, with BP plunging to a $5.7 billion loss, its first in a decade, as energy demand tanked and it slashed the value of its oil and gas assets by nearly $20 billion. It also halved its dividend.
Looney took office with an ambitious plan to rapidly grow BP's renewables energy business, while cutting oil output by 40% by 2030. 
This ""reinvention"" plan included a major overhaul and laying off 10,000 employees, roughly 15% of BP's workforce.
This year BP is launching its first share award scheme to rally its more than 60,000 employees and also expects to resume bonuses.
BP's shares hit their lowest since the mid-1990s late last year, a bigger fall than any of its rivals, as a result of the drop in oil prices and investor concerns over the strategy. 
BP's shares have gained nearly 20% so far this year, lifted by stronger oil prices.
The total remuneration of Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss, who took office in June 2020, reached 408,000 pounds ($565,610) last year. (Graphic: BP's annual profits, https://graphics.reuters.com/BP-RESULTS/ygdpzalwrvw/chart.png)

624,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2021 01:25PM ET</span>",Ex-Blackrock exec starts row over value of sustainable investing,"By Ross Kerber
(Reuters) - A high-profile newspaper op-ed by a former BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) executive questioned the value of sustainable investing in solving problems, prompting other industry analysts to defend the role of funds that push for change in environmental, social and governance (ESG) corporate policies.
Many ESG funds have almost no impact and create ""a placebo effect to delay the overdue regulatory reforms in government we need"" to address issues like climate change, said Tariq Fancy, BlackRock's onetime chief investment officer for sustainable investing, in a telephone interview on Friday.
But ESG specialists fired back in defense of the sector. 
""Fancy provides only the sketchiest of evidence to support a rather outlandish position,"" Morningstar Inc analyst Jon Hale wrote on Medium.com on Friday.
For instance in his article Fancy wrote that often funds are rebranded as ""green"" with few important changes. Hale said he counted 64 repurposed U.S. funds that all made discernable changes to their investment approaches, though he acknowledged ""there could be easily be some greenwashers"" elsewhere.
The debate comes as U.S. regulators look to crack down on firms overselling their ESG benefits while cash pours into sector.
Fancy's remarks reiterated points he made in an opinion article for newspaper USA Today on March 16 charging the financial industry is ""greenwashing the public."" 
A BlackRock spokesman said the company disputes Fancy's view and said sustainable investing ""can deliver strong investment returns while also helping to address urgent social and environmental concerns."" 
BlackRock ""strongly supports"" standard-setting efforts needed to counter the risk of greenwashing, he said.
FINK PREFERS SELF-REGULATION
Fancy, 42 years old, joined BlackRock at the start of 2018 and stayed until September of 2019, when he said he left because of a death in his family. He returned to Toronto to run a technology non-profit he founded, The Rumie Initiative.
Although he had already decided ESG investing had little influence, Fancy said he grew more concerned as the COVID-19 pandemic spread and showed the power of governments was needed to force worldwide action. He was prompted to write, Fancy said, after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink was asked by a Bloomberg interviewer in January whether stronger government regulation is needed. ""I prefer capitalists self-regulate,"" Fink said.
That position and the marketing of BlackRock and other firms convinces people that a strong government response is not necessary, Fancy said. But portfolio managers are focused and judged on financial returns, not social improvements.
Fancy said in a followup e-mail that his time working to bring ESG investing ideas into the mainstream ""gave me a unique vantage point and was a blessing and a curse.""

""The truth is the investing industry is filled with good, decent people who, in many cases, want to do the right thing, but their hands are tied to the bottom line. They are legally bound and financially incentivized to consider profits above almost everything else,"" Fancy said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union imposed sanctions on Monday on four Chinese officials, including a top security director, for human rights abuses in Xinjiang, to which Beijing responded with its own sanctions on Europeans.
Unlike the United States, the EU has sought to avoid confrontation with Beijing, but a decision to impose the first significant sanctions since an EU arms embargo in 1989 following the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy crackdown indicates a change in posture.
The Netherlands summoned China's ambassador to The Hague after Beijing announced its measures on 10 Europeans, while the European Parliament, along with German and Belgian and other foreign ministers, rejected the Chinese retaliation. 
Accused of mass detentions of Muslim Uighurs in northwestern China, those targeted by the EU included Chen Mingguo, the director of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau. The EU said Chen was responsible for ""serious human rights violations.""
In its Official Journal, the EU accused Chen of ""arbitrary detentions and degrading treatment inflicted upon Uighurs and people from other Muslim ethnic minorities, as well as systematic violations of their freedom of religion or belief"".
Others hit with travel bans and asset freezes were: senior Chinese officials Wang Mingshan and Wang Junzheng, the former deputy party secretary in Xinjiang, Zhu Hailun, and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Public Security Bureau.
However, the EU did not designate the top official in Xinjiang, Chen Quanguo, who is targeted by U.S. sanctions.
Activists and U.N. rights experts say at least 1 million Muslims are being detained in camps in the remote western region of Xinjiang. The activists and some Western politicians accuse China of using torture, forced labour and sterilisations. China denies rights abuses in Xinjiang and says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism. 
Beijing's retaliation included sanctions on European lawmakers, the EU's main foreign policy decision-making body known as the Political and Security Committee and two institutes.
German politician Reinhard Butikofer, who chairs the European Parliament's delegation to China, was among the most high profile figures to be hit. The non-profit Alliance of Democracies Foundation, founded by former NATO secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, was on the list, according to a statement by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
""As long as human rights are being violated, I cannot stay silent. These sanctions prove that China is sensitive to pressure. Let this be an encouragement to all my European colleagues: Speak out!"" Dutch lawmaker Sjoerd Sjoerdsma, who was put on China's sanctions list, said on Twitter.
Restricted from entering China or doing business with it, Beijing accused them of seriously harming the country's sovereignty and interests over Xinjiang. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged the EU to ""correct its mistake"" and not to interfere in China's internal affairs. 
While mainly symbolic, the EU sanctions mark a significant hardening in the bloc's policy towards China, which Brussels long regarded as a benign trading partner but now views as a systematic abuser of basic rights and freedoms.
The EU had not sanctioned China significantly since 1989 although it targeted two computer hackers and a technology firm in 2020 as part of broader cyber sanctions. The arms embargo is still in place. 
All 27 EU governments agreed to the punitive measures, but Hungary's foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, called them ""harmful"" and ""pointless.""

China is the EU's second-largest trading partner after the United States and Beijing is both a big market and a major investor which has courted poorer and central European states.

In less than three months, $252.5 billion has flowed into ETFs, according to financial data and analytics company FactSet. At the current pace, ETFs are on track to collect over $1 trillion this year, which would put the current record of $507.4 billion in 2020 to shame.
U.S. equity ETFs have garnered most of the money with inflows -- totaling $138.1 billion -- in the January 1 to March 18 period, ETF.com said, quoting data from FactSet. That's as a result of skyrocketing U.S. companies, particularly tech stocks that have been fueled by the legions of people sent to work from home.

(Reuters) - Supreme Court justices on Monday appeared ready to further curb the power of organized labor in the United States by rolling back a decades-old California regulation that lets union organizers enter agricultural properties without an employer's consent. 
The justices appeared sympathetic during more than an hour of oral arguments toward an appeal by two fruit companies in the most populous U.S. state seeking to halt enforcement of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Board regulation, which has been in place since 1975. The justices wrestled over how far they should go in bolstering the property rights of owners. 
A lower court rejected the companies' argument that the regulation violated the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment prohibition on the government taking private property for public use without just compensation.
Conservative justices, who hold a 6-3 majority on the court, seemed to agree that the regulation went too far. Chief Justice John Roberts asked questions that indicated the rule placed few limits on unions. Justice Clarence Thomas wondered how it would be different if the state commandeered a farm to train its police, even if only intermittently. 
Liberal justices raised doubts that any regulation like California's should always be considered unconstitutional, as the companies have asserted. They also expressed concern over how the case might affect other government authority over health and safety.
California, defending the regulation, said that beyond affecting the ability of unions to organize, the case has the potential to reverberate more widely, casting doubt on food, factory and social work inspections, or even Border Patrol entries onto private property to enforce immigration laws. 
The Supreme Court in 2018 dealt a big blow to organized labor by ruling that non-members cannot be forced, as they are in certain states, to pay fees to unions representing public employees such as teachers and police that negotiate contracts covering non-unionized workers as well as union members.
The California regulation allows union organizers, with notice to regulators and the employer, to enter agricultural premises to talk with employees for three non-working hours per day during four 30-day periods each year. The organizers do not require an employer's consent.
Dorris, California strawberry producer Cedar Point Nursery and Fresno-based Fowler Packing Company, which ships grapes and mandarin oranges, said that the regulation is a relic of the past and that farm workers are easier to reach than ever, including through smartphones and radio stations. 
Unions have said the rule in practice affords them little time to reach workers during the narrow window of seasonal farm work either before or after work. They have said farm workers often are migrants who change job sites frequently and may not understand English or Spanish, making work site access one of the only ways to inform them of their labor rights. 
The businesses said almost all of their 3,000 workers can communicate in English and Spanish.
The companies challenged the regulation after disputes with the United Farm Workers union in 2015. Organizers disrupted work on Cedar's property with bullhorns, while Fowler was accused of denying organizers access, drawing a complaint with regulators, according to the lawsuit. 
The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the case in 2019. 
Former President Donald Trump's administration had backed the companies in the case, but Democratic President Joe Biden last month informed the justices that the government had switched sides, asserting that the regulation is lawful.

The companies are represented in the case by the Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)'s CEO responded to complaints from junior bankers by saying management is going to work harder to give them Saturdays off and to shift bankers from other divisions to the busiest teams in the investment bank, according to a transcript of a call seen by Reuters on Monday.
Last week, media reported that a group of junior bankers in Goldman's investment bank told senior management in February they were working nearly 100 hours a week and sleeping 5 hours a night to keep up with an over-the-top workload and ""unrealistic deadlines."" Half of the group, which consisted of 13 first-year employees, said they were likely to quit by summer unless conditions improved. 
In response, Goldman Chief Executive David Solomon told employees in a voice note the bank sent on Sunday night that it will strengthen enforcement of its Saturday rule, which holds that employees cannot work from 9 p.m. Friday night to 9 a.m. on Sunday except in certain circumstances, in order to ensure they have at least one day off each week.
The bank will also accelerate an effort launched in January to hire more junior bankers and will reassign others from less busy divisions to busier ones to alleviate the work.
Solomon said he takes the first-year analysts' complaints seriously and understands staff are facing pressure from the pandemic, which has resulted in most employees working from home for a year, and from the surge in demand for blank-check IPOs.
Funds raised through initial public offerings of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, have this year already surpassed the $83.4 billion the sector raised in all of 2020, and banks play a key role in those deals.
""In this world of remote work, it feels like we have to be connected 24/7,"" Solomon said. ""This is not easy, and we're working hard to make it better.""
Solomon also expressed support for the bank's Asian colleagues in light of what he said were the ""horrific attacks"" last week in the U.S. city of Atlanta, where eight people, including six women of Asian descent, were killed.

Asian staff at Goldman have faced verbal and physical abuse in the United States and elsewhere, Solomon said, and he will meet with Asian partners and others to discuss what the bank can do to protect them and promote inclusivity at work.

Such a network is likely to offer shippers access to improved service at a lower cost, while potentially undercutting other railroads including  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP), analysts say.
""This is by default negative for the other railroads, including Canadian National which faces a longer haul competitor into the Gulf Coast and Midwest,"" J.P.Morgan analyst Brian Ossenbeck said in a research note.
Kansas City shares jumped 16% but were still $15 short of the offer price of $275, a move that analysts attributed to the extended lead-time for the deal, which is not expected to close until the middle of 2022.
Shares of Canadian Pacific fell about 3%, while those of rivals Canadian National and Union Pacific dropped 2% and 3%, respectively.
While it is the biggest M&A deal announced thus far in 2021 and is the largest ever involving two rail companies, it ranks behind the 2010 takeover of BNSF by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) for $26.4 billion.
""Canadian Pacific and Kansas City don't compete head to head in specific markets, thus a merger shouldn't result in fewer rail-service options for shippers in most corridors,"" Morningstar analyst Matthew Young said in a research note.
The cash-and-stock offer has an enterprise value (EV) of about $29 billion, implying an 18 times multiple to Kansas City's 2021 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) estimate, according to analysts.
That is higher than Kansas City's current multiple of 14 times, making any competing bids unlikely, Ossenbeck said.

Some of Kansas City's peers, including CSX Corp (NASDAQ:CSX), Union Pacific and  Norfolk Southern  (NYSE:NSC), have forward 12-month EV-to-EBITDA multiple of between 13 and 15 times.

Reckitt Benckiser and Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the strategic review.
The group announced the strategic review in February, saying multiple options were being explored.
Its Greater China infant formula business represents 6% of group sales, which were almost 14 billion pounds ($19.8 billion) in 2020, up 11.8% year-on-year, Reckitt Benckiser said at the time.
U.S.-headquartered Mead Johnson, which Reckitt Benckiser bought for $16.6 billion in 2017, runs a range of infant formula brands including Enfamil, Enfapro and Lactum.
Laxman Narasimhan, Reckitt Benckiser's chief executive, said in February that challenges to the China business included Hong Kong's longer-than-expected border closure during COVID-19, local competition, a changing regulatory environment and lower birth rates in the country. 
Chinese consumers have been favouring imported infant formula since the country's 2008 baby milk contamination scandal. The top four best-selling infant formula brands on e-commerce platform JD (NASDAQ:JD).com for example are all foreign.
However, local brands are catching up fast with brands such as Morgan Stanley-backed Feihe gaining significant market share.

China imported 335,600 tonnes of infant formula in 2020, down 2.8% year-on-year, according to the Dairy Association of China.

Investing.com –  Fortinet  (NASDAQ:FTNT) shares rose 2.5% Monday after the company made strategic moves to capture opportunities thrown up by the new normal of work-from-home.
Fortinet has made a strategic investment of $75M in  Foxconn Interconnect  (HK:6088) Interconnect’s arm Linksys, which provides router connectivity solutions to consumers and businesses worldwide.
The companies will work together to provide enterprise-grade performance and security for work-from-home networks.
At its March 9 investor and analyst day, Fortinet laid out its 2023 targets for $5 billion in billings and $4 billion in revenue, both representing three-year average returns of about 17%, Seeking Alpha said.
Following its earnings, several analysts upgraded the stock.
According to Seeking Alpha, Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz maintained a neutral rating on Fortinet while raising the price target to $180 from $167, citing the healthy long-term outlook and noting that the company remains well-positioned to gain network security market share.
BMO lifted its target to $195 from $180 with analyst Keith Bachman writing that the ""impressive"" CY23 outlook ""will be supported by meaningfully above-market firewall and SD-WAN growth over the next few years.""
For the fiscal year 2021, Fortinet expects revenue in the range of $3.025 billion to $3.075 billion with billings seen between $3.56 billion and $3.64 billion."

Needham called the acquisition a ""clever move"" and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) sees new revenue streams, as it allows Roku to sell ads against specific content across platforms. Shares are up 3.6%.
Roku said Friday it acquired the ""This Old House"" business, including global distribution rights and all of its subsidiary brands, digital assets and the television production studio. No value was disclosed, but JPMorgan believes Roku paid between $50 million and $75 million. Roku has already had a strong run amid the pandemic, reporting fourth quarter revenue of $650 million -- a record for the period, and an increase of almost 60% from a year earlier. Shares hit an all time high late last month and have since dipped about 25%.
“This Old House” and “Ask This Old House” were the two top-rated home improvement programs in the U.S. in 2020, according to Nielsen data, Roku said in a statement last week.  
“As the top-rated home improvement programs in America, ‘This Old House’ has the broad appeal that is perfectly suited to support The Roku Channel’s ad-supported growth strategy,” said Rob Holmes, vice president of programming at Roku.   
The biggest brand advertisers buy specific content, usually in July, when 70%-80% of their ad budgets are committed each year. By owning Quibi content plus 1,500 hours of ""This Old House"" content, Roku may have better luck getting commitments from brands during the upfront market, instead of fighting for the 20% of their ad budgets the rest of the year, Needham's Laura Martin said in a note, according to StreetInsider. 
Owning content that runs on their services provides the company with a new source of off-platform ad inventory, said JP Morgan's Cory Carpenter, StreetInsider reported. 
“We think it makes sense for Roku to experiment with different content monetization strategies early on, offering some content exclusively on TRC (i.e. Quibi) while monetizing other content across platforms (i.e. This Old House),"" Carpenter said.

637,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2021 11:25AM ET</span>",India to launch supercharged push for global electric vehicle players,"By Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India plans to offer fresh incentives to companies making electric vehicles (EVs) as part of a broad auto sector scheme it expects to attract $14 billion of investment over five years, according to industry sources and a document seen by Reuters.
The country's efforts to promote EVs to reduce its oil dependence and cut pollution have been stymied so far by a lack of investment and weak demand, as well as the patchwork nature of existing incentives that vary from state to state. 
The new automotive sector scheme, however, has been under discussion since mid-2020 to provide a more focused approach, industry sources close to the matter told Reuters. The plans envisage $8 billion of incentives for carmakers and suppliers over a five-year period to drive large investment in the sector.
Final details of the scheme are expected within a month, but companies will be able to apply for incentives from April 1, the sources said.
Companies will receive 4-7% government cashbacks on the eligible sale and export value of vehicles and components, but for EVs and their components there is an additional 2% as a ""growth incentive"" to promote electric mobility, according to the draft policy document seen by Reuters.
Elon Musk's Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is already gearing up to enter India while rivals including Ford, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and India's  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM) and Mahindra & Mahindra also have plans to invest billions of dollars in EVs to meet stricter global emissions regulations.
Automotive component manufacturers in India must be ready to pivot their product offerings to cater for the shift towards EVs, the document said.
MADE IN INDIA
The automotive incentive scheme is part of India's broader $27 billion programme to attract manufacturers from the likes of China and Vietnam to capture a bigger share of the global supply chain and exports. 
But for new companies entering India, as well as existing automakers, challenges abound. 
Steep interest rates and power tariffs, as well as poor infrastructure and high logistics costs, make it costlier for companies to operate in India compared with rivals such as Thailand or Vietnam.
""The (new) scheme proposes financial incentives to help overcome these disabilities and make India more competitive,"" the draft policy document said, referring to inefficiencies that it said can lead to 5-8% higher costs for manufacturers in India.
The government expects the scheme to bring additional investment of $14 billion, create 5.8 million new jobs and rake in more than $4 billion in total tax revenue over five years.
To benefit from the scheme automakers must meet conditions including minimum global revenue of $1.4 billion. For auto parts makers it is $69 million. The companies must grow by at least 8% each year to qualify for the incentives, which are also linked to the distance between the factory and point of sale.
The document added that existing programmes focus on a large number of companies that lack scale and ""are constrained in their ability to invest and undertake the risk required for rapid growth"". 

""A change in strategy is needed to focus on promoting firms that have the scale, competitive ability and management capabilities to be automotive champions,"" it said.

Snapchat and Pinterest were both big pandemic winners, rising over 185% and more than 200%, respectively, in 2020.

“We continue to see Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Pinterest as strong secular growers, expect strong 1Q channel checks to aid stocks ahead of 1Q results, and anticipate acceleration in growth in 2Q, but we think investors may becoming increasingly concerned on tougher 2H comps, especially in context of a broader economy that should be accelerating,” Post said in a note, according to StreetInsider.
Snap is down 4% and Pinterest 1.9%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of U.S. air passengers screened topped 1.5 million Sunday for the first time since March 2020, as air travel continues to rebound from a pandemic-related drop, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said Monday. 
COVID-19 devastated air travel demand, with U.S. airline passengers down 60% in 2020. But with a growing number of Americans getting vaccinated, demand and advanced bookings have started to rise in recent weeks.
TSA said it screened 1.54 million people Sunday, the highest single day since March 13, 2020 and the 11th consecutive day screening volume exceeding 1 million per day.
Screening refers to security checks on passengers entering airports.
Still, U.S. air travel demand was down Sunday about 30% versus pre-COVID 19 levels. International and business travel demand both still remain weak. 
For the last week, trade group Airlines for America said passenger demand was down 47% over pre-pandemic levels, while international travel demand was down 68%. The United States bars most non-U.S. citizens from travel who have been in Brazil, South Africa, China and most of Europe and many countries still restrict entry by Americans. 
Last week, U.S. airline executives cited concrete signs of a domestic leisure travel recovery in expressing optimism for demand this summer and said losses were declining.
United Airlines expects to halt its cash burn in March, CEO Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said last week, the first major carrier to say it could hit the industry’s milestone.

In January, United said an average daily core cash burn of $19 million in the fourth quarter would likely continue in the beginning of 2021.

By Simon Jessop and Elizabeth Howcroft
LONDON (Reuters) - The world's biggest carbon-emitting companies are far from aligning with the Paris Climate Agreement, a report by the leading climate-focused investor group showed on Monday.
Climate Action 100+, whose 575 members manage $54 trillion in assets, was set up in 2017 to engage with the companies responsible for the bulk of planet-heating emissions to encourage them to cut them and strengthen climate disclosures.
If added together and treated as a country, the companies - including oil majors like Exxon (NYSE:XOM),  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) and BP (NYSE:BP) as well as Unilever (NYSE:UL) - would be the third biggest emitter behind the United States and China, the group said.
Releasing its first 'Climate Action 100+ Net-Zero Company Benchmark', the group uses a traffic-light system to show how each of the 159 companies is currently performing on a variety of indicators and metrics.
None of the companies have fully disclosed how they will achieve their goals to become a net zero business by 2050 or sooner, the assessment shows, including setting short- and medium-term targets.
Irked by the slow pace of change at some companies, leading investors have thrown their weight behind shareholder resolutions in the current season for annual general meetings demanding better information on company plans.
""The Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Company Benchmark shows there is an urgent need for greater corporate action and higher ambition in accelerating the net zero economy and ensuring a safe and viable future,"" said Mindy Lubber, CEO and President at sustainability organisation Ceres, and a member of the Climate Action 100+ Steering Committee.
REDUCTION TARGETS 
Although 83 of the companies assessed have announced an aim of achieving net-zero by 2050, around half of these commitments do not encompass the full scope of their emissions.
While 107 companies had set medium-term targets, only 20 met all the assessment criteria; of the 75 to set short-term targets, only eight did so.
Only six companies had committed to aligning their capital expenditure with their long-term reduction targets, and none have so far pledged to align them with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
When scenario planning for the risks and opportunities posed by climate change, just 10% of the companies include the 1.5 degrees scenario across the whole of their operations. 
Although 139 companies consider climate change at board level, only a third of those assessed explicitly link executive pay to their targets for reducing emissions.
The assessment, based on companies' public disclosures and any additional information they provided before Jan. 22, will form the base line for future engagement with them, CA100+ said.
""This is a vitally important piece of work. We will be using it not only to inform our engagement but also our proxy voting, because for us, ultimately, we have to be able to hold boards accountable,"" said Anne Simpson, managing investment director of board governance and sustainability at the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS).

Lazard Healthcare Acquisition Corp I and Lazard Fintech Acquisition Corp I are looking to raise $250 million each, saying they aim to merge with companies in the healthcare and fintech sectors, respectively. 
In January, another SPAC backed by the investment bank said it aimed to raise $500 million in a U.S. IPO, with an eye on the healthcare, technology, energy transition, financial and consumer sectors.
SPACs are shell firms that have no business operations but are still listed. Their sole purpose is to use capital from an IPO to merge with a private firm, allowing them to go public with lesser regulatory scrutiny.
However, a surge in the number of such blank-check firms over the last year has prompted concerns of a bubble. The Defiance Next Gen SPAC Derived ETF, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks SPACs, fell 16% from a year high in mid-February as of its last close.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly higher on Monday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite leading the way as last week's fears of inflation receded, bringing down long-term bond yields moderately.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Nasdaq Composite was up 98 points, or 0.8%, while the S&P 500 was up 0.1%. However, renewed jitters about the pandemic weighed on cyclical stocks and reopening plays in general, leaving the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 91 points, or 0.3%, at 32,536 points. 
Rising numbers of Covid-19 infections from Europe to India and South America have cast doubt over whether the world economy will be able to recover at quite the speed currently expected. The world's two biggest economies, the U.S. and China, both appear to be firmly en route to recovery - the U.S. notched 1.5 million air travelers this weekend for the first time in over a year - but they account for less than half of world output. 
Early movers on Monday included Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock. which rose 4.6% after fund manager Cathie Wood, who has placed one of the biggest institutional bets on the electric vehicles, said the stock should hit $3,000 by 2025, based on her expectations for its autonomous driving software and, to a lesser extent, the rollout of its insurance operations. 
Railroad operator Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) also rose 14.3% after it agreed to be bought for $25 billion by  Canadian Pacific  Railway (NYSE:CP), in a deal that will create the first integrated rail operator spanning all three North American markets. The deal had a knock-on effect on larger rival CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), whose stock rose 4.3%.
AstraZeneca  (NASDAQ:AZN) ADRs rose 2.4% after the Anglo-Swedish company published the results of a large, late stage trial of its Covid-19 vaccine in the U.S. and the Americas. The company said its drug was 79% effective in stopping symptomatic Covid-19 and 100% effective in preventing death and hospitalization. The test also failed to produce any evidence to support fears that the vaccine caused blood clotting disorders, which had been cited by various European politicians as they briefly suspended distribution of the drug earlier this month.
Elsewhere, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) stock fell 1.4% and the ADRs of  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) fell 2.8% and 2.7% respectively after disappointing news over the global chip shortage for cars at the weekend. The two Japanese OEMs are the biggest customers of Renesas Technologies, whose CEO said at the weekend that the fire at one of its chipmaking plants in Japan could have lasting impacts on chip availability this year. Ford, meanwhile, had said it will idle more of its U.S. production facilities, including its truck factory in Louisville, Ky., due to a shortage of components."

Renesas has said it will take at least a month to resume production at a 300mm wafer line at its Naka plant in northeast Japan after an electrical fault caused machinery to catch fire on Friday and poured smoke into the sensitive clean room.
The fallout on carmakers could spread beyond Japan to auto companies in Europe and the United States because Renesas has about a 30% share of the global market for microcontroller unit chips used in cars.
""We are gathering information and trying to see if this will affect us or not,"" a Honda spokesman said. Other automakers including Toyota and Nissan said they too were assessing the situation.
Two-thirds of production at the affected line is automotive chips. Renesas also has a 200mm wafer line at its Naka plant which has not been affected.
Concerns about the impact of the fire hit auto shares, with the big three, Toyota, Honda and Nissan, all closing down by at least 3.3%. Renesas shares tumbled as much as 5.5% and ended 4.9% lower. The benchmark Topix index shed nearly 1%.
""It will probably take more than a month to return to normal supply. Given that, even Toyota will face very unstable production in April and May,"" said Seiji Sugiura, senior analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute. ""I think Honda, Nissan and other makers will also be facing a difficult situation.""
Semiconductors such as those made by Renesas are used extensively in cars, including to monitor engine performance, manage steering or automatic windows, and in sensors used in parking and entertainment systems.
GOVERNMENT PROMISES HELP
Nissan and Honda have already been forced to scale back production plans because of the global chip shortage resulting from burgeoning demand from electronic goods makers and an unexpected rebound in car sales after a slump during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic.
Toyota, which has agreements with some parts suppliers to stockpile chips, has fared better so far.
""It could take three months or even half a year for a full recovery,"" said Akira Minamikawa, analyst at technology research company Omdia. ""This has happened when chip stockpiles are low, so the impact is going to be significant.""
European carmakers said on Monday they could not yet assess whether the fire would have any impact on global chip supplies. Germany's BMW said its plants were running even though semiconductor supply in general remained tight.
A spokesman for France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) said it was currently difficult to asses the volume impact ""given the complexity of the supply chain of semi-conductors"".
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), the world's second-largest carmaker, confirmed it does not have direct supply agreements with semiconductor makers. ""Of course every additional shortage in the sector further tightens global supply,"" it said.
Renesas said its customers, which are mostly automotive parts makers rather than the car companies, will begin to see chip shipments fall in about a month. 
The company declined to say which machine caught fire because of the electrical fault or which company made it.
The Japanese government promised help for the auto industry.
""We will firmly try to help the Naka factory achieve swift restoration by helping it quickly acquire alternative manufacturing equipment,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told a regular news conference on Monday.
The latest incident at the Naka facility comes after an earthquake last month shut down production for three days and forced Renesas to further deplete chip stocks to meet orders.

The plant was closed for three months in 2011 following the deadly earthquake that devastated Japan's northeast coast.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) has been hit with additional EU antitrust charges, three years after EU enforcers charged the Swiss bank with rigging foreign exchange rates in an almost decade-long case.
The financial sector has been in the EU antitrust crosshairs for nearly a decade for rigging key interest benchmarks, government bonds and foreign exchange rates, resulting in billions of euros in fines imposed on various banks.
The European Commission had in July 2019 sent a charge sheet known as a statement of objections to Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second-biggest bank. 
Such documents typically set out anti-competitive activities uncovered by regulators which could lead to fines as much as 10% of a company's global turnover.
Credit Suisse on Monday confirmed receipt of a supplemental statement of objections.
""Credit Suisse continues to believe that it did not engage in any systemic conduct in the FX markets which violated the European Union's competition rules, and is contesting the EC's case,"" the bank said in a statement.

The Commission, which fined  Barclays  (LON:BARC), Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS_old_old) (RBS (LON:NWG)),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and MUFG Bank in May 2019 for rigging foreign exchange spot trading, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

649,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2021 09:20AM ET</span>",Saudi Aramco's debt-to-equity ratio more than doubles in 2020,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi oil giant Aramco (SE:2222)'s debt-to-equity ratio more than doubled to 55% in 2020 from a year before, it said in a report, after the group kept a pledge to deliver a $75 billion dividend to support state coffers despite a slide in profits. 
Net debt rose to 605.9 billion riyals ($161.6 billion) last year from 270.2 billion riyals in 2019, the results showed.
The world's largest oil exporter said on Sunday net profit fell 44.4% to 183.8 billion riyals for the year ended Dec. 31 as the COVID-19 pandemic depressed global crude demand.
However it maintained its pledge to declare a $75 billion dividend for 2020, most of which goes to the Saudi government.
Aramco made its international bond market debut in 2019 ahead of its listing that year in a record $29.4 billion share sale. Last year, as low oil prices hurt its balance sheet, it raised a $10 billion loan and $8 billion in bonds.
HSBC said last month that Aramco's prospects look more positive and promising for 2021, hinting at declining net debt and a possible dividend hike.
But a recent request sent to banks to extend by a year the $10 billion debt facility raised in May last year suggests rebounding crude prices are not pushing the oil giant to reduce debt for the time being.
Aramco is likely to ""do the heavy lifting"" to boost state coffers and support mega-projects spearheaded by the kingdom's state investor Public Investment Fund, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said in a note earlier this year.
The government still owns a 98.2% stake in the firm and while it is diversifying its revenues away from crude, oil revenues still accounted for more than half the kingdom's income last year.
In its financial results report Aramco said payments to the government last year, including dividends, royalties and income taxes, totalled around 412 billion riyals, about 30% less than in 2019. That was in line with Saudi estimates in December.

650,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 22, 2021 09:10AM ET</span>",BlackRock Cuts Fees on $7.6 Billion Style ETFs to Near Zero,"(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock's (NYSE:BLK) revamped $7.6 billion lineup of so-called style ETFs will feature new benchmarks, different tickers and a perk: rock-bottom fees.
The world’s biggest exchange-traded fund issuer is cutting the expense ratios on nine iShares Morningstar U.S. Equity Style Box ETFs to a range of 0.03% to 0.06%. That’s down from previous charges that varied between 0.25% and 0.30%. Those products -- which focus on specific approaches such as company size and growth or value investing -- are now tracking the Morningstar Broad Style Indexes that were launched in January.
Fees have emerged as a battleground in the quickly growing $6 trillion ETF industry, where competition has prompted some of the biggest funds to slash costs to industry lows. BlackRock has been locked in a contest with runner-up Vanguard Group for flows, with the latter winning last year for the first time since 2013. Meanwhile, once-niche issuers such as Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management have jumped up the leaderboard as investors swarm to theme-friendly funds.
The decision on cutting fees reflects BlackRock’s commitment to being the leading ETF provider in all segments of the industry, including the burgeoning thematics arena, according to the head of iShares Americas Armando Senra. Back in June, BlackRock lowered the expense ratio of its largest fund -- the $258 billion iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV) -- to 0.03% in order to match a rival product from Vanguard.
“We wanted to be incredibly competitive in the market for that cost-conscious buyer,” Senra said in a phone interview.
Prior to the fee cuts, BlackRock’s style ETFs were expensive relative to peers. The biggest of the collection, the $2.3 billion iShares Morningstar Large-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE:JKE) -- formerly known as the iShares Morningstar Large-Cap Growth ETF -- has an expense ratio of 0.04%, versus 0.25% previously. That brings the fund in line with the fee on the $68 billion Vanguard Growth ETF.
In addition to the sweeping changes, the style funds have also undergone share splits of varying ratios. Senra said that model portfolios -- both BlackRock’s own and those created by outside firms -- are a key area of focus for the company. Many of these are built with small-account sizes, often under $10,000, said Chad Slawner, BlackRock’s head of iShares U.S. product.
“Many of the firms that give us feedback want lower share prices to be able to build the models appropriately,” Slawner said.

Investing.com – AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) shares were up 2% in Monday’s premarket trading after data from a large trial in the U.S. and elsewhere showed its Covid-19 vaccine to be safe and effective.
The trial was also conducted in Chile and Peru. The trials showed the vaccine was 79% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19, and produced no evidence that the drug led to blood-clotting disorders, an idea that led to its suspension in the European Union briefly earlier this month. The results could bolster confidence in the product after initial confusion over its efficacy data, dosing regimen and possible side-effects.
The EU has fallen way behind the U.K. and the U.S. in vaccine rollout, resulting in faster spread of the virus again.
While the bloc grapples with the fresh surge, it is also considering a ban on export of the vaccines, having failed to secure priority delivery in contract negotiations with the company last year. The EU has so far blocked one shipment of vaccines to Australia and EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen threatened - indirectly - to suspend exports to the U.K. last week. 
AstraZeneca has struggled to deliver contractually agreed volumes to its customers in recent weeks, due in part to problems ramping up its Halix plant in the Netherlands. The company said on Monday it's 'well on track' to get approval from the European Medicines Agency to launch the plant by late March or early April."

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was up 3% in premarket trading Wednesday, fueled by Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment saying that the stock could reach $3,000 by 2025.
Wood’s views on Tesla carry weight on the street given the close alignment between her investment strategy and the exuberant retail investing crowd that drove the rally in the stock over the last two years.  Ark had earlier set a $2,400 target on the electric vehicle maker’s share price with a 2024-time horizon.
In a bear and bull case scenario, Ark sees Tesla at $1,400 and $4,000 per share extremes, respectively. 
Tesla remains the largest holding for Ark Invest across all of its ETFs, representing over 10% of total assets.
The price target factors in expectations that Tesla will launch an autonomous robotaxi service, which Ark believes could bring in revenues of as much as $327 billion. It also incorporates Tesla's relatively new insurance business, but doesn't include its energy storage and solar business, nor its $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin made in January.

Investing.com -- Hopes of an early end to the global shortage of semiconductors just went up in smoke, literally.
A fire at a factory owned by Japan’s Renesas Technologies, one of the world’s biggest suppliers of chips to the auto industry, is threatening to make matters much, much worse for its core customer base in the near future.
Chief executive Hidetoshi Shibata told a press conference on Sunday that he’s afraid of “a massive impact on chip supplies” and said the company would “pursue every means possible” to keep disruptions to a minimum.
Shibata told the conference that the fire had damaged some 2% of the factory’s chipmaking equipment as well as halting the production of 300 millimeter wafers.
Shares of rival chip suppliers were clear beneficiaries in morning trading Europe.  Infineon (DE:IFXGn) stock rose 2.8%, while STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) stock rose 1.4% and NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI) stock rose 2.0%.
ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML), the Dutch company that makes chipmaking equipment, also added 2.3% as traders upped their bets on a permanent expansion of capacity by the industry in response to the shortage.
The sector’s gains stood out on a morning when pandemic fears had set the tone. Germany is set to discuss tightening and extending lockdown restrictions through mid-April later Monday in response to a surge in Covid-19 cases since the winter lockdown was eased at the start of the month.
At the weekend, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) had said it would idle more of its U.S. factories due to the shortage, which has been aggravated by the cold snap that took chip production facilities in Texas offline.  The shortage is now so acute that auto groups are having to cut back on production even of their highest-margin products.
Ford – which has already said the shortage could take anything up to $2.5 billion of this year’s profits   - said its Ohio assembly plant will close temporarily next week, while its truck plant in Louisville, Kentucky will only work two of three shifts. Both plants will return to full output in the week of March 29.
Last week, Ford said it would assemble its chief money-spinner in North America, the F-150 pickup truck, without certain parts and then hold them “for a number of weeks” until they can be completed and shipped.
Meanwhile, RAM owner Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) said at the weekend that will do the same for its 1500 Classic trucks at the assembly plants at Warren, Mi., and Saltillo in Mexico.  
The chip shortage isn’t only affecting carmakers, although it is hitting them harder than many industry segments as chipmakers prioritize higher-value market segments. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has already postponed the launch of its iPhone 12 due to the issue, while Samsung (KS:005930) warned last week that it may have to push launch of its latest Galaxy Note smartphone to 2022.

Typical signs of systemic risk, such as increased leverage in the private sector and a collapse in savings, aren’t present, the strategists led by Peter Oppenheimer wrote in a report to clients on Monday. Moreover, the rally is unfolding against the backdrop of market concentration in companies that are fast-growing, generate cash and transform their industry, such as major technology businesses, they added.
“There are signs of complacency and heightened optimism in the market,” the Goldman strategists wrote in the 46-page report titled “Bubble Puzzle.” “Nevertheless, the fundamental factors that drive the market and the early stage of the economic cycle would suggest that we are far away from a bubble or bear market.”
European stocks rose last week to their highest in a year, despite prolonged lockdowns and delays in the continent’s vaccination rollout, which could delay a nascent recovery from the steepest recession in memory. In the U.S., the S&P 500 rose to another record high last week.
Still, not everything is fine. The analysts see “pockets of exuberance,” while “high valuations imply lower longer-term returns.”

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening in a mixed fashion Monday, looking to bounce back from a losing week with comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen later this week in focus.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 50 points, or 0.2%, while S&P 500 Futures traded 4 points, or 0.1%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 93 points, or 0.7%.
Powell and Yellen will appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday and the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday where they will discuss the health of the U.S. economy and the importance of fiscal and monetary stimulus in the recovery from the pandemic.
Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Thomas Barkin started the ball rolling Monday, saying he’s hopeful that the U.S. economy is “on the brink of completing this recovery” and downplaying the significance of a likely rise in consumer prices this year.
Financial markets have started to position for the first interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve coming sooner than 2024, which remains the central estimate of the central bank after its last meeting.
Market participants are more inclined than the Fed to believe that the economy could easily overheat due to the massive stimulus package and the Fed’s easy money policy. U.S. Treasury yields climbed to their highest levels in more than a year last week as a result.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has slipped slightly Monday, falling below 1.70%, having climbed above 1.75% last week, and this is expected to help the tech-heavy Nasdaq outperform Monday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 dropped on Friday to finish the week down 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively, breaking two-week winning streaks. The Nasdaq Composite also lost 0.8% last week, despite some gains Friday.
In the corporate sector, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) ADRs are likely to gain after data from a large U.S. trial showed the drugmaker’s vaccine was 79% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19. This will be a boost after many European countries temporarily halted its use earlier this month after some reports that it was linked to blood clots.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will also be in the spotlight after Cathie Wood's Ark Invest said it expects the company’s stock to reach $3,000 by 2025, up substantially from Friday’s $654.87 close, while Reddit message board favorite GameStop (NYSE:GME) is due to report earnings for the three months through January.
Oil prices edged lower Monday, continuing the recent selloff as the fresh lockdowns in Europe increased worries about the speed of recovery of global demand for the commodity.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $61.29 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $64.36. Both contracts fell by more than 6% last week.

658,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2021 06:56AM ET</span>",Blackstone rolls the dice with $6.2 billion move on Australia's Crown Resorts,"By Byron Kaye and Rashmi Ashok
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc proposed a buyout of Australia's Crown Resorts Ltd in a deal valuing the casino operator at $6.2 billion, a markdown from the troubled company's value a year ago but a possible reprieve from regulatory pressure.
Crown shares leapt more than 20% after it disclosed the informal offer on Monday, passing Blackstone's indicative price of A$11.85 as investors wagered a bigger payment could be in the offing from the world's No. 1 private equity firm or another suitor.
""It's nice to get a bid, and now it's about price discovery,"" said John Ayoub, a portfolio manager at Wilson Asset Management, which has Crown shares.
""These stocks are trading at trough earnings and I wouldn't be surprised to see further activity in the sector.""
If Blackstone's takeover were to succeed, it would round out a portfolio of gambling-related assets from Las Vegas to Spain with resorts in three Australian cities.
But it would get a company in crisis after Crown lost its licence to operate a flagship new casino on Sydney's waterfront last month amid allegations of money laundering and links to organised crime.
It also faces inquiries in the other two Australian states where Crown is licensed to operate. 
Australia's financial crimes agency meanwhile is investigating Crown over money-laundering allegations, and the company faces two civil lawsuits accusing it of failing to disclose risks which led to share price declines.
Blackstone's indicative offer was short of the stock's trading levels before concerns about the coronavirus caused market gyrations in early 2020. 
Crown shares closed up 21% at A$11.97. Investors often trade below an indicative offer price to allow for the possibility of a deal failing to eventuate.
""Blackstone couldn't get away with a price like this if the casinos weren't being affected by COVID and the management issues at the same time,"" said Nathan Bell, portfolio manager of Intelligent Investor, which has Crown shares.
""It's only an opening bid. It's a messy situation and offering to acquire a casino is a complex affair at the best of times due to all the regulation.""
Crown said its board had not yet formed a view on the proposal but would talk to ""relevant stakeholders including regulatory authorities"".
Company founder James Packer, the top shareholder with a 36% stake, would receive about A$2.9 billion from the deal.
Packer declined to comment. Blackstone, Crown's second-largest shareholder with 9.99%, confirmed the approach but declined to comment further.
BAD TO WORSE
Packer sold out of casinos in Macau and the United States and began a series of attempts to take Crown private after 18 staff were jailed in China in 2016 for violating anti-gambling laws.
Three years later media reports accused Crown of knowingly doing business with junket - or gambling tour - operators linked to organised crime, leading to findings at a subsequent regulatory inquiry of ""dysfunctional"" management where Packer dominated the board from afar despite holding no official role.
The inquiry called by the gaming regulator in New South Wales said Packer's ""remote manouevring"" would have to be resolved before Crown could hold a casino licence in the state, putting the company's billionaire founder under immense pressure to sell down his stake.
Crown's new tourist-targeted Sydney casino opened in December without tourists due to pandemic-related border closures, and without gambling because of restrictions put on it during the probe. 
It has lost about half its board including its CEO since the inquiry declared Crown unfit for a Sydney licence in February. 
Among the conditions of the Blackstone proposal, the private equity firm itself would need to be found suitable to run a casino by Crown's regulators. 
The New South Wales state Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority said it was aware of the approach but declined to comment further.

LONDON (Reuters) - The market for bonds that are linked to companies meeting certain environmental goals could grow 20-fold this year to between $120 billion and $150 billion, a senior JP Morgan banker said, as businesses look to tap into booming demand.
COVID-19 has boosted interest in companies that perform well on environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets as it led to an assessment of how economies should look in future, lifting the volume of green and social bonds sold to raise new funds.
Most ESG-linked bonds issued in recent years require the issuer to spend proceeds on specific projects. 
But sustainability-linked bonds (SLB) allow firms to raise money for general corporate purposes while promising investors that if they do not meet the sustainability targets set -- such as cutting carbon emissions -- they will pay investors extra.
Marilyn Ceci, global head of ESG developed capital markets (DCM) at JP Morgan and an influential voice in the fast-growing market, said SLBs are an effective way for companies to show a commitment to an ESG goal without raising funds for particular projects. 
""I'm calling for the SLB market to grow to around $120 to $150 billion since market inception, and I expect we'll get that this year,"" said Ceci, noting that SLB issuance since inception was about $20 billion. Year-to-date volumes stand around $6.9 billion. 
""I get calls from investors more and more saying that they want more SLBs, they like the holistic approach, and they like the skin in the game.""
SLBs are relatively new and investors are less familiar with them than with green bonds. The process of companies paying penalties for failing to meet sustainability targets they have set themselves is also largely untested.
CLEARER RULES
Global green bond issuance could reach $400-$450 billion this year from almost $270 billion last year, the Climate Bonds Initiative estimates.
Ceci, who co-authored the Green Bond Principles on voluntary process guidelines of best practice in the sector, expects the overall market for green, social and sustainable bonds to grow 49% this year to around $690 billion.
Italy's  Enel  (MI:ENEI) issued the first sustainability-linked bond in 2019 worth $1.5 billion. In September, Brazilian pulp and paper producer Suzano's sold a $750 million carbon emissions-linked bond.
Drugmaker Novartis, luxury brand Chanel, supermarket operator Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) and retailer H&M have also issued SLBs recently.
The growth in sustainable bonds is also being fuelled by clearer rules around what they are. The European Central Bank said in September it would accept as collateral green bonds with payouts linked to sustainability targets from 2021.
""One unknown is whether a sovereign will embrace a sustainability-linked bond, that will be very interesting to see,"" said Ceci.
Neha Coulon, global head of ESG solutions at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), noted that demand for sustainability products was reflected in leveraged loans. 
She said that the first two months of 2021 had seen eight sustainability linked loans in the European leveraged loan market versus about seven throughout 2019 and 2020. 
Speaking to Reuters before this week's JPMorgan global ESG conference, Ceci and Coulon said COVID-19 had proved a stress test for ESG.
Graphic: Asset flows into ESG funds in total - https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-BONDS/azgpodaegvd/chart.png
""This was the first stress test for ESG investing and one of the criticisms historically had been that ESG investing hadn't been through a full business cycle for us to understand if it was nice to have, or it was really meaningfully decreasing risk and adding alpha,"" Coulon said.

Increased engagement in the United States due to more mainstream investors incorporating ESG goals into broader investment policies was also helping growth, Ceci said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Food delivery company Deliveroo could make Britain’s biggest stock market debut since commodities giant Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) went public nearly a decade ago, after setting a price range on Monday that values it at up to $12 billion.
The Amazon-backed food delivery firm has been held up by the British government as a sign the City of London can still attract major Initial Public Offerings (IPO) following the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union.
It is set to be London's biggest IPO since Glencore in May 2011, according to data provided by the London Stock Exchange. 
A London stock market listing by Allied Irish Banks in 2017 is excluded from the data as it had a small listing in Ireland at the time. 
Deliveroo will also be the biggest tech IPO on the LSE, dwarfing The Hut Group from last year -- which had a 5.4 billion pound market capitalisation at time of listing -- and the since-delisted Worldpay Group from 2015. 
The company has benefited from the closure of restaurants for anything other than takeaways during the COVID-19 crisis and revenues have soared accordingly, with so-called gross transaction value - which measures the total value of orders received - rising 64.3% in 2020 to 4.1 billion pounds.
But it faces questions on whether that momentum will continue after COVID-19 restrictions are eased and be enough to turn the business towards profit after it posted an underlying loss of 223.7 million pounds ($308.93 million) last year.
""Deliveroo has clearly had a Covid boost,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV). 
""Although this insatiable demand for takeout food isn't likely to fully unravel, there is inevitably going to be a drop in demand as diners seize the opportunity to book tables at their favourite eateries when restrictions do ease."" 
PRICE RANGE
Deliveroo said it had set a price range for its listing of between 3.90 and 4.60 pounds per share which will give it a market value of between 7.6 billion pounds and 8.8 billion pounds ($10-5 billion and $12 billion), excluding any shares offered as part of an over-allotment issue. 
An announcement to investors seen by Reuters said that the deal size would be 1.5-1.6 billion pounds, rising to 1.7 billion pounds after the over-allotment of shares. 
Of this, new shares will raise 1 billion pounds for the company and the rest will be made up by existing shareholders selling part of their stake. 
Deliveroo has opted not to pursue a premium listing -- ruling it out of inclusion in the FTSE indices -- which allows founder and chief executive Will Shu to retain enhanced shareholder rights. 
In a short trading update, Deliveroo added that the total gross transaction value on its platform was up 121% in January and February this year compared to the same period in 2020. 
""We have seen a strong start to 2021 and we are only at the start of an exciting journey in a large, fast-growing online food delivery market, with a huge opportunity ahead,"" Shu said in a statement.

662,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2021 06:21AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. senators press Biden to set end date for gas-powered car sales,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - California's two U.S. senators are urging President Joe Biden to set a firm date to phase-out gas-powered passenger vehicles as the White House grapples with how to rewrite vehicle emissions rules slashed under President Donald Trump.
In an unreported letter going to Biden Monday, Democratic Senators Alex Padilla and Dianne Feinstein called on Biden ""to follow California’s lead and set a date by which all new cars and passenger trucks sold be zero-emission vehicles."" They also urged Biden to restore California's authority to set clean car standards.
In September, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order directing the state's air resources agency to require all new cars and passenger trucks sold in California to be zero-emission by 2035.
Biden's campaign in 2020 declined to endorse a specific date to end gas-powered vehicle sales, but he has vowed to dramatically boost electric vehicles and charging stations.
In January, Biden said the administration would replace the federal government's fleet of 650,000 vehicles ""with clean electric vehicles made right here in America made by American workers.""
The senators also say Biden should use a compromise deal that California struck with automakers including Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Honda Motor, BMW AG and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) that falls between the Trump administration and Obama-era requirements.
""We believe the national baseline should, at an absolute minimum, be built around the technical lead set by companies that voluntarily advanced their agreements with California,"" Padilla, who replaced Vice President Kamala Harris in the Senate, and Feinstein wrote in the letter seen by Reuters. ""California and other states need a strong federal partner.""
Shortly after taking office, Biden ordered U.S. agencies to revisit fuel efficiency standards by July.
The Trump administration in March 2020 finalized a rollback of fuel economy standards to require 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026, well below the 5% yearly boosts in Obama-administration rules it discarded.
Then President Donald Trump repeatedly targeted California, a Democratic bastion that tangled with Trump on multiple fronts during his tenure.
The Center for Biological Diversity estimates the California deal improves fuel economy 3.7% year over year between 2022-2026.
Biden also directed the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration by April to reconsider Trump’s 2019 decision to revoke California’s authority to set its own auto tailpipe emissions standards and require rising numbers of zero-emission vehicles.
A White House spokesman declined to comment Sunday on the timing of any announcement on California's vehicle authority.
California's vehicle emissions standards are followed by 13 other states and the District of Columbia accounting for more than 40% of the U.S. population.
In January, General Motors (NYSE:GM) said it aspires to end all gasoline passenger car and truck sales by 2035. Volvo, a unit of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, said its entire car line-up will be fully electric by 2030 and Ford's European lineup will also be fully electric by 2030.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing major automakers, declined comment Sunday but last month backed nationwide rules to achieve vehicle emissions reductions roughly midway between the Trump and Obama standards.

SYDNEY/LONDON (Reuters) - Stocks slid and the Turkish lira tumbled towards a record low against the dollar on Monday after President Tayyip Erdogan shocked investors by replacing Turkey's hawkish central bank governor with a critic of high interest rates.
Erdogan's move shunted the lira down as much as 15% against the dollar, the sharpest change since August 2018 when Turkish markets were in another of their periodic crises.
""The authorities will be left with two choices, either it pledges to use interest rates to stabilise markets, or it imposes capital controls,"" said Per Hammarlund, senior EM strategist at SEB Research.
""Given the increasingly authoritarian approach that President Erdogan has taken, capital controls are looking like the most likely choice.""
By 0800 GMT, the currency had recovered some of its losses to trade around 7.9904 as Finance Minister Lutfi Elvan said Turkey would stick to free market rules.
The uncertainty saw the index of Europe's 600 largest stocks fall 0.5%, a milder reaction than an earlier 1.5% fall in Japan's Nikkei as retail investors faced potential losses on large long positions in the high-yielding lira.
Euro zone banks exposed to the country such as Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA), Italy's UniCredit, France's BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), and Dutch bank ING fell between 1.6% and 5.2%.
The ripples were more modest elsewhere, with U.S. stock futures close to flat.
Yields on 10-year Treasury notes edged down five basis points to 1.68%, suggesting some investors favoured safe havens. 
Investors are still struggling to deal with the recent surge in U.S. bond yields, which has left equity valuations for some sectors, particularly tech, looking stretched.
Bonds had another wobble on Friday when the Federal Reserve decided not to extend a capital concession for banks, which could lessen their demand for Treasuries.
The damage was limited, however, by the Fed's promise to work on the rules to prevent strains in the financial system.
A host of Fed officials speak this week, including three appearances by Chair Jerome Powell, providing plenty of opportunity for more volatility in markets.
WATCHING EMERGING MARKETS
Monday's tumble in the lira saw the yen firm modestly, with notable gains on the euro and Australian dollar. That in turn dragged the euro down slightly on the dollar to $1.1890.
After an initial slip, the dollar soon steadied at 108.80 yen, while the dollar index was down slightly at 91.942.
Also supporting the yen were concerns Japanese retail investors that have built long lira positions, a popular trade for the yield-hungry sector, might be squeezed out and trigger another round of lira selling.
Still, analysts at Citi doubted that the episode would lead to widespread pressure on emerging markets, noting the last time the lira slid in 2020, there was little spillover.
""In terms of impact on other parts of the high-yielding EM, we believe that will be quite limited,"" Citi said in a note.
There was scant sign of safe-haven demand for gold, which eased 0.7% to $1,731 an ounce.
Oil prices fell anew, having shed almost 7% last week as concerns about global demand prompted speculators to take profits on long positions after a long bull run. [O/R]

Brent crude was down 60 cents, or 1%, at $63.94 a barrel by 0836 GMT. U.S. oil was off by 56 cents, or 0.9%, at $60.86 a barrel. Both contracts fell by more than 6% last week.

664,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2021 05:00AM ET</span>",Analysis: Electric shock - German auto stocks get a new lease of life,"By Danilo Masoni and Thyagaraju Adinarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW's plans to grab market share in the fast-growing electric car market and challenge Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) could shift the dial for their cheaply priced shares.
A deadline set by many countries to go carbon-free by 2050 has led to rising adoption of zero-emission vehicles and Tesla has been at the forefront of this transformation, selling long-range battery electric vehicles (BEVs).
Despite a recent pullback, its stock has soared 650% in the last year, helped also by a cult following for CEO Elon Musk.
But it is no longer the only electrification play in town.
Volkswagen, the German company competing with Toyota to be the world's biggest vehicle seller by volume, laid out its ambitious plan to turn 70% of European sales at its core VW brand electric during its ""power day"" last Monday.
The plan, months in the making, has helped to fuel a Tesla-esque rally in the 83-year old company's shares, with CEO Herbert Diess even taking to Twitter, Elon Musk-style to crow as the company's market value crossed 100 billion euros ($119 billion) earlier this month. 
The stock is now up 52% year-to-date, taking its market value to 143 billion euros.
""With VW's CEO really pushing the message on BEVs across all channels (conventional media, investors as well as Twitter and LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD)) we believe the private investors are picking up on this story and could be quite a powerful force by themselves,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Kai Alexander Mueller.
German rival BMW, meanwhile, said on Wednesday it was aiming for half of its sales to be non-fossil fuel vehicles by 2030, and that around 90% of its market categories would have fully-electric models available by 2023.
REBIRTH
""No one can know today who will win in the global electric car market, but while there is greater balance among the players, in stock market valuations there is unprecedented imbalance between early adopters and those who are becoming so,"" said Alessandro Fugnoli, a strategist at Kairos in Milan, calling it ""the rebirth of the German auto"".
UBS recently forecast Volkswagen would match Tesla's output by 2025 and raised the price target on the company's shares by 50% to 300 euros - the most bullish target among the 28 analysts covering the stock. The stock is currently at about 223 euros.
Valuation comparisons are also supportive.
At 160 times forward earnings, Tesla is by far the most expensive stock in the autos sector, whereas Volkswagen and BMW still trade at only around 9-10 times forward earnings.
""European carmakers, from a size and balance sheet perspective are well positioned to re-orient themselves towards electrification and they have strong distribution platforms,"" said Sunil Krishnan, head of multi-asset funds at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors.
What's more, Volkswagen is also considering listing luxury car arm Porsche AG to help raise funds for investments in software and electric vehicles, according to a source.
STILL A VALUE PLAY
Despite its recent gains, Volkswagen's market value is still only about a quarter of Tesla's, and several analysts see further room for gains at both the German group and across the European autos industry.
""Abandoned by all, and in particular by investors, the German auto industry, after eating a lot of dust and falling in a state of disrepair, understands that adherence to electrics must be total,"" Fugnoli said. 
As well as lifting German autos stocks, the electrification drive is helping to boost broader European equity markets, which have long underperformed those in the United States.
Germany's DAX has been setting new record highs in March. 
With positioning and flows into European equities still relatively weak, some investors think that could soon change. BofA's weekly flow data for March 10-17 showed fund managers withdrew $1 billion from Europe, while pumping a record $53 billion into U.S. equities.
Still, few think European indexes will attract the frenzied buying seen by tech stocks on the U.S. Nasdaq in recent years.
""In Europe, it will remain a stock specific issue for a while, we won't be looking at the Euro50 this year as a tech index,"" Aviva's Kirshnan said.
""But these things can change quickly - look how quickly VW moved up in the market cap pecking order.""

665,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 22, 2021 04:48AM ET</span>",European Stocks Largely Lower; Lockdown Fears and Turkish Turmoil Weigh,"By Peter Nurse
Investing.com -- European stock markets were broadly lower Monday, weighed by plans for further lockdowns to combat a third wave of Covid-19 cases, while Turkish stocks and the lira were hit hard after an abrupt change of central bank governor.
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, while the CAC 40 in France fell 0.6% and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.4%.
Germany is the latest European country to consider extending restrictive measures, with a draft proposal calling for the current lockdown to be extended into a fifth month. The number of new Covid-19 cases has surged since restrictions were eased three weeks ago. 
France, Europe's second-largest economy, announced new restrictive measures late last week, resulting in a month-long lockdown in 16 areas of the country, including Paris. 
Adding to the worries, confidence in the safety of AstraZeneca's (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine has taken a big hit in Spain, Germany, France and Italy, according to a YouGov survey published Monday, after these countries briefly stopped using it on reports of rare blood clots. 
The European Medicines Agency regulator said in a preliminary safety review on Thursday that the vaccine was safe and effective, while AstraZeneca has also released data from its U.S. trial, showing that its vaccine was 79% effective in preventing the disease, and 100% successful in preventing hospitalization and death across a sample of 30,000 volunteers. Its stock rose 0.9% Monday.
Turkey is also in focus following President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s surprise decision over the weekend to replace the hawkish central bank governor Naci Agbal with Sahap Kavcioglu. 
The move came two days after a sharp rate hike aimed at controlling inflation near 16% and supporting the lira, and has since seen the Turkish currency weaken almost 12% against the dollar, the sharpest move since August 2018.
Turkey’s benchmark stock index, the BIST 100, fell more than 5% in early trading Monday, while European banks exposed to the country weakened, in particular Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA), which dropped over 6%.
Travel stocks also suffered on the potential of another German lockdown, with Tui (DE:TUIGn), Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), Ryanair (LON:RYA), easyJet (LON:EZJ) and IAG (LON:ICAG), the owner of British Airways, all down between 4.5% and 6.5%.
Mining stocks also slipped after new anti-pollution measures in China sent iron ore futures tumbling, with Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) hardest hit, down 1.4%.
Elsewhere, Suez (PA:SEVI) stock climbed 1.1% after investment funds Ardian and Global Infrastructure Partners offered 11.9 billion euros ($14.2 billion) for parts of its business.
 Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) stock climbed 3.3% after the home improvement retailer reported a sharp rise in profits, as customers improved their houses during the lockdowns.
Oil prices edged lower Monday, continuing the recent selloff as the fresh lockdowns in Europe increased worries about the speed of recovery of global demand for the commodity.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% lower at $61.11 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $64.28. Both contracts fell by more than 6% last week.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,729.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1900.

The legal fight over Future's assets has embroiled two of the world's richest men, Jeff Bezos of U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Mukesh Ambani of Indian congolomerate Reliance Industries.
In various Indian courts, including the Supreme Court, Amazon has accused Future of violating certain contracts by agreeing to sell its retail assets to Reliance. Future has denied any wrongdoing.
Last week, a Delhi High Court judge ordered Biyani and others not to dispose of their assets and asked why they did not obey an arbitrator's directive last year that blocked the transaction.
But on Monday, the court's Chief Justice D. N. Patel, heading a two-judge panel, put the order on hold after hearing Future's appeal against it, saying the dispute was already being argued before the Supreme Court.
""We hereby stay"" the order, Patel added. 
In February, in a hearing on Amazon's challenge to the deal, the Supreme Court said final approval should be withheld until it heard objections from the U.S. e-commerce giant.
Amazon and a spokesman for Future and Biyani did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The final outcome of the tussle over Future's assets is seen shaping India's shopping sector, now reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, and will decide if Amazon is able to dent the dominance of Reliance.

670,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2021 02:35AM ET</span>",Wall Street's year of bust and boom,"By Chuck Mikolajczak and Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street giddyness in recent weeks stands in stark contrast to the pandemic panic of one year ago. 
U.S. stocks on Tuesday will mark the one-year anniversary of the market low as the spread of the COVID-19 and government lockdowns began to crush economic activity, before massive government and central bank stimulus plus the development of vaccines fueled a stunning, if uneven, rebound.
As investor optimism grew, stocks began to recover from the selloff that ended an 11-year bull market, history's longest. 
The S&P 500 bottomed by closing at 2237.40 on March 23, and topped the Feb. 19, 2020 bull-market high on Aug. 18, when the index ended the session at 3389.78. That high marked the end of the shortest bear market ever and confirmed that on March 23 a new bull had been unleashed.
GRAPHIC: One year off the low - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdvxeqxepx/Pasted%20image%201616085068348.png 
Initial lockdowns hit customer-facing services sectors the hardest as social distancing mandates to curb COVID's spread shuttered restaurants and slammed the travel and leisure industry.
Jobs in these sectors - typically on the lower end of the wage scale - evaporated overnight, and as new coronavirus infections spiked and abated, those jobs have been slow to return.
Conversely, the shutdown caused consumer demand to shift from services to goods, boosting resilience of U.S. factories and prompting a restoration of manufacturing jobs that outpaced the whole.
GRAPHIC: Payrolls during COVID - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/jbyvraxoype/payrollscovid.png 
Along with the stimulus supplied by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the government, stocks worked their way off the low thanks in part to the start of vaccine rollouts and optimism that economic reopenings were on the horizon. 
But companies that commanded attention during the beginning of the pandemic, so called ""stay-at-home"" plays such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Zoom Media and Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) saw their fortunes begin to turn in the latter stages of 2020, with cyclical sectors such as energy, materials and small cap stocks garnering more favor.
GRAPHIC: Equity performance breakdown from March low - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdpzgkkgvw/Pasted%20image%201616091020558.png 
As optimism about reopenings began to rise, so did investor appetite for stocks that traditionally do well as an economy recovers from a recession. Many of those stocks fall into a ""value"" profile as they were largely ignored for bigger ""growth"" names in sectors such as technology and communication services. 
That change in tenor helped value stocks close what had been a widening gap versus the outperformance of growth stocks over the past several years.
GRAPHIC: Growth vs value performance since March low - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyprammzve/Pasted%20image%201616093607809.png 
Uncertainty about the medium- or long-term recovery prognosis saw several pivots between stay-at-home and reopening plays.
For instance, the equities market looked beyond grim current conditions and toward an expected recovery in commercial air travel, which can be seen by comparing air traffic data with airline stocks. Investors clearly see the battered sector taking off despite persistently low passenger numbers courtesy of the Transportation Safety Administration (TSA).
GRAPHIC: TSA throughput - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/azgpodjwdvd/tsa.png 
The housing market has been the star of the U.S. economic recovery, rebounding beyond pre-pandemic levels as the hunt for lower population density and home office space, along with historically low mortgage rates, sent demand soaring, home prices surging and supply of homes on the market to all-time lows. 
Housing stocks have also handily outperformed the broader market since its nadir. A year later, the Philadelphia SE Housing index is up nearly 150%, almost double the S&P 500's advance over the same time period.
The sector's strength is also a reminder of who suffered the worst of the largest economic downturn since the Great Depression, as lower income Americans typically rent and are less likely to be prospective home buyers.
GRAPHIC: Housing market - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xlbvgxwrkpq/housing.png 
Stocks also benefitted from what was referred to as ""TINA,"" or ""there is no alternative"" as the Fed's easy monetary policy kept Treasury bond yields historically low, which also pushed home mortgate rates to their lowest level ever. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was less than the dividend yield for the S&P 500 for some time.
But that has changed in recent weeks as expectations for a rapidly improving economy have also raised inflation concerns, possibly denting the attractiveness of equities should yields continue to rise.

The quick rise in rates over the past month has also weighed on richly valued growth names, as interest rates could crimp future earnings. That has weighed on the Nasdaq, which includes mega-cap growth names such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).

671,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2021 12:26AM ET</span>","In India, Reliance Retail's private labels revolution spooks global consumer goods makers","By Abhirup Roy and Aditya Kalra
MUMBAI (Reuters) - Inside supermarkets of Reliance Retail, run by India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, little-known food and home cleaning brands take pride of place on shelves alongside global labels owned by giants Nestle, Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).
Products like Snac tac noodles and Yeah! colas are Reliance's private label brands - and billionaire Ambani's not-so-secret weapons as he sets his sights on dominating a grocery market that's already worth a cool $608 billion and set to grow more than 20% by 2024, according to  Forrester Research  (NASDAQ:FORR).
These are not just a cheap and cheerful option for urban shoppers in Reliance's own expanding store network. This is Ambani's bet on pitching brands that are basic, yet still aspirational at 'kiranas' - traditional mom-and-pop stores which serve roughly 80% of the retail market in world's second-most populous nation.
Already India's biggest retailer, even as a $3.4 billion deal to buy no. 2 player Future Retail awaits clearance, Reliance has ""immense focus"" on private labels, said an industry executive familiar with its strategy. That focus has already made some consumer goods firms in India uneasy, sources say.
Reliance plans to keep expanding and promoting its private labels - even in non-food segments - via its own supermarkets and kiranas, the executive said, declining to be identified, like most of the people Reuters interviewed for this story, because of a lack of authorisation to speak with media.
""It's a worthwhile and high-margin (play),"" the person said. ""The company's trying to offer brands of an equivalent quality at a lower rate ... from a consumer standpoint, that works. It's a fact, five years down the line, private labels will be a different landscape.""
MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS
Reliance Retail, part of Ambani's Reliance Industries juggernaut, last year raised $6.4 billion by selling a 10% stake to investors including Silver Lake Partners and KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc. The company is now bulking up its e-commerce operations and is increasingly partnering with kiranas to replenish their shelves via its own outlets and warehouses.
Consumer brands seeing their products already jostling for space with Reliance's private label brands will have to deal with a company whose grocery supermarket muscle will nearly triple to 2,100 outlets if the Future Retail deal, which is facing a legal challenge at India's Supreme Court, goes through.
Browsing shelves in Reliance stores, it's hard to miss their private-label products, made in India mostly by small third-party manufacturers. ""It is Reliance's own brand. So we have to place these prominently,"" a store employee at a Mumbai supermarket said.
Inside Reliance's supermarkets, Nestle's Maggi ""2-Minute noodles"" sit next to Snac tac ""Ready in 2 mins"" noodles, both in yellow-coloured packaging with an image of a red bowl full of noodles, with Snac tac costing roughly 18% less. Bottles of Yeah! colas stood beside Coca-Cola and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP)'s offerings, at around half the price. 
Reliance declined to comment on its business strategies. Nestle India didn't answer questions on Snac tac, but said it continues to ""prioritise innovation"" and was confident its consumers will choose brands that serve their needs. 
India's top consumer goods maker Hindustan Unilever (HUL) declined to comment, while Coca-Cola didn't respond. PepsiCo India said it doesn't comment on strategies of other companies. 
LIFESTYLE CHOICE
India is seen as offering huge potential. China's per capita consumption of consumer goods is still four times higher than India's, according to HUL, majority-owned by London-listed Unilever. This is despite India's rising disposable incomes.
Analysts say Ambani's plans echo private-labels pushes mastered by the world's biggest retailer, Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and German supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl.
A key difference is that Western retailers have pitched own-label goods as a value proposition. In India, they act as both an affordable alternative and a lifestyle choice for those previously unused to buying packaged or branded products.
Industry executives and analysts say the push is worrying foreign and Indian consumer giants. Pressure has already risen, with online grocers like BigBasket and e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) expanding their private brands portfolio.
The person familiar with Reliance's strategy said the profit margin it offers to kiranas on products like its noodles could be as high as 20%, compared with the 10-12% offered on similar products by multinationals.
To be sure, it's not easy to displace popular, decades-old brands. HUL says nine out of 10 households in India use its brands, and Nestle India says Maggi noodles strengthened its leadership position in 2019.
A Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) research note said last week Reliance can leverage private labels to onboard more kiranas, but cautioned that ""a success here would require a 360 degree approach"" to compete against ""entrenched"" players.
STRATEGIC RESPONSE
Still, one big Indian consumer firm has been conducting on-ground surveys to study Reliance's model, while a multinational has been forced to ""craft a strategy"" to find ways to safeguard its distribution model, said two executives who declined to be identified citing business sensitivity for their companies.
HUL is ""keeping an eye"" on Reliance's private label push, said a person familiar with its thinking.
""Any game that Reliance gets into, you have to be careful,"" said the source, referring to Reliance's success in disrupting the telecoms industry with cut-price data plans for smartphones.
Alok Shah, a consumer analyst at India's Ambit Capital who has visited stores to assess private labels, said rival consumer companies ought to be alert.
""The only option consumer companies have is to market more or to match the pricing of private labels ... Reliance's brands are going to be a much bigger threat,"" he said.
Sales representatives of HUL, Nestle and Indian consumer giant ITC interviewed by Reuters at various Reliance supermarkets expressed concerns that similar packaging and lower prices on Reliance brands were luring some customers away. A spokesperson for ITC said, ""All large retailers have their own brands that compete with established brands.""
On a recent weekend in Mumbai, shoppers like 16-year-old student Soni Gupta took advantage of a buy-one-get-one-free offer on Reliance noodles.

""It's cheaper than Maggi ... I quite like it,"" Gupta said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed Monday morning, with bond yields and inflation worries continuing to mount. Investors also digested Turkey’s surprise central bank governor replacement.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.92% by 11:16 PM ET (3:16 AM GMT) while South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.16%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.64%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was down 0.21%.
China’s Shanghai Composite gained 0.84% while the Shenzhen Component inched down 0.10%. The People’s Bank of China released its loan prime rate earlier in the day.
The Turkish lira slid as much as 15% in early Asian trading after President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan replaced hawkish central bank governor Naci Agbal with Sahap Kavcioglu over the weekend. The move came two days after a sharp rate hike aimed at controlling inflation near 16% and supporting the lira.
Investors are also focusing on the outcome of a slew of U.S. Treasury auctions of two-, five- and seven-year debt later in the week. Ten-year yields dropped below 1.70%, hovering near the highest levels in about 14 months.
Worries about potential higher interest rates continue to dominate equity and bond markets, driving yields ever higher and fuelling a rotation out of growth into value shares. An improving growth outlook could cause the U.S. Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than suggested by its current guidance. However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated in a Wall Street Journal editorial that the Fed will provide aid to the economy “for as long as it takes.”
Investors will also look to Powell’s comments at the BIS Innovation Summit, taking place virtually later in the day. Other speakers at the summit include the European Central Bank’s Christine Lagarde and the Bank of England’s Andrew Bailey.
Powell will also make his first joint appearance with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday, where they will testify on Fed and Treasury pandemic policies respectively.
“Clearly, the market is skeptical that the Fed will be able to keep interest rates at current levels for the next three years... we think that nominal bond yields can still shoot higher in the short-term towards 2% and above on inflation concerns. Markets are likely to worry that this move is permanent, rather than temporary,” Diana Mousina, senior economist in the multi-asset group at AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital Investors Ltd., said in a note.
The Mar. 31 deadline for a central-bank exemption allowing lenders to load up on Treasuries and deposits without setting aside extra capital to cushion losses is also approaching, with the regulator planning further changes to this supplementary leverage ratio."

Investors will turn their attention to a heavy slate of bond auctions focused in maturities that have gotten pummeled amid a brightening outlook for growth and inflation. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated in a Wall Street Journal editorial that the central bank will continue to provide aid to the economy “for as long as it takes” as the recovery is far from complete. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said in a Bloomberg TV interview Sunday that there is no sign yet of unwanted inflation pressures.
Bullion has dropped about 8% this year with investors rotating out of havens into riskier assets, although its role as a hedge against inflation has helped give some support to prices. On Friday, the Fed said it’ll let a significant capital break for big banks expire at month’s end, which saw bond yields and the dollar tick higher.

The deal with Thoma Bravo Advantage, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), is expected to provide ironSource up to $2.3 billion in cash proceeds, including an oversubscribed PIPE (private investment in public equity) of $1.3 billion and $1 billion of cash held in the trust account of Thoma Bravo Advantage.
ironSource provides developers a platform to acquire users and display ads within mobile-phone games. The merger values ironSource at considerably more than the $1.56 billion the company was worth in its most recent private funding round in 2019.
Co-founder and Chief Executive Tomer Bar Zeev said ironSource had decided to pursue a traditional initial public offering (IPO) but changed course when a mutual friend asked him to take a call with Thoma Bravo Advantage Chairman Orlando Bravo.
""I immediately understood we shared the same views about how to build a company, how to run a company,"" Bar Zeev said in an interview.
This is the first SPAC deal for Thoma Bravo, which has around $73 billion in assets under management and focuses on investing in software and technology.
A SPAC is a shell company that raises funds in an IPO with the aim of acquiring a private company, which then becomes public as result of the merger.
Thoma Bravo Advantage, which completed its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in January, was attracted to ironSource given the market it operates in, its management team and its business model, Bravo said in an interview.
""What these public equity vehicles provided us, is the ability to target companies that our private equity business is not targeting,"" said Bravo, who will join ironSource's board on the closing of the deal.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is rebuffing British government calls to ship AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) COVID-19 vaccines produced in a factory in the Netherlands, an EU official said on Sunday.
Former EU member Britain has so far administered many more vaccines than EU countries in proportion to the population.
""The Brits are insisting that the Halix plant in the Netherlands must deliver the drug substance produced there to them. That doesn't work,"" the official told Reuters.
The Leiden-based plant which is run by sub-contractor Halix is listed as a supplier of vaccines in both the contracts that AstraZeneca has signed with Britain and with the European Union.
""What is produced in Halix has to go to the EU,"" the official added.
Britain has insisted that contracts must be respected.
""The European Commission will know that the rest of the world is looking at the Commission, about how it conducts itself on this, and if contracts get broken, and undertakings, that is a very damaging thing to happen for a trading bloc that prides itself on the rules of law,"" Defence Minister Ben Wallace said on Sky News earlier in answer to a question about Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen's threat to block exports to Britain. 
The EU official said the EU was not breaking any contract.
The European Union threatened on Wednesday to block exports of COVID-19 vaccines to Britain to safeguard scarce doses for its own citizens, with Von der Leyen saying the epidemiological situation was worsening.
AstraZeneca has not yet sought approval in the EU for Halix, but the official and a second EU source said the request was on its way.
Without regulatory approval, vaccines produced at Halix cannot be used in the EU. 
An internal AstraZeneca document seen by Reuters shows that the company expects EU approval on March 25.
AstraZeneca has declined to comment on the amount of vaccines that are currently stockpiled at Halix. 
The EU official said the factory had already produced shots, but was not able to quantify the output. Under the EU contract with AstraZeneca, vaccines must be produced before approval and be delivered immediately afterwards.
Two factories in Britain run by Oxford Biomedica and Cobra Biologics are also listed as suppliers to the EU in the contract with AstraZeneca, but no vaccine has so far been shipped from Britain to the EU, despite Brussels' earlier requests.

Officials have said that Cobra is not fully operational. AstraZeneca told EU officials that the UK is using a clause in its supply contract that prevents export of its vaccines until the British market is fully served, EU officials said.

(Reuters) -  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway Ltd on Sunday said it has agreed to buy Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) for $25 billion in a cash-and-shares deal to create the first rail network connecting the United States, Mexico, and Canada, betting on a pick-up in North American trade.
Shareholders of Kansas City Southern will receive 0.489 of a Canadian Pacific share and $90 in cash for each KCS common share held, the companies said in a joint statement. The deal, which has an enterprise value of $29 billion including debt, values Kansas City Southern at $275 per share, representing a 23% premium to Friday's closing price of $224.16.
The transaction is the biggest M&A launched in 2021.
""The new competition we will inject into the North American transportation market cannot happen soon enough, as the new USMCA Trade Agreement among these three countries makes the efficient integration of the continent's supply chains more important than ever before,"" Canadian Pacific Chief Executive Keith Creel said in the statement. 
""This will create the first U.S.-Mexico-Canada railroad.""
The new and modernized U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact took effect in July last year, replacing the earlier deal that lasted 26 years, and is expected to further foster manufacturing and agriculture trade activities among the three countries.
Kansas City Southern's board has approved the bid and the two companies have notified the U.S. Surface Transportation Board to seek the agency's required approval. Canadian railroad operators' attempts to buy U.S. rail companies have met limited success because of antitrust concerns.
Creel will continue to serve as CEO of the combined company, which will be headquartered in Calgary, the statement said.
The deal comes amid expectations of a pick-up in U.S.-Mexico trade after Joe Biden replaced Donald Trump as U.S. president.
GREEN DEAL
The companies also highlighted the environmental benefits of the deal, saying the new single-line routes that would be created by the combination are expected to shift trucks off crowded U.S. highways, and cut emissions.
Rail is four times more fuel efficient than trucking, and one train can keep more than 300 trucks off public roads and produce 75% less greenhouse gas emissions, the companies said in a joint statement.
Shareholders in Kansas City Southern are expected to own 25% of Canadian Pacific's outstanding common shares after the deal, the companies said.
Canadian Pacific said it will issue 44.5 million new shares and raise about $8.6 billion in debt to fund the transaction.
The Financial Times first reported on the deal.
Calgary-based Canadian Pacific is Canada's No. 2 railroad operator, behind Canadian National Railway Co Ltd, with a market value of $50.6 billion.
It owns and operates a transcontinental freight railway in Canada and the United States. Grain haulage is the company's biggest revenue driver, accounting for about 58% of bulk revenue and about 24% of total freight revenue in 2020. 
Kansas City Southern has domestic and international rail operations in North America, focused on the north-south freight corridor connecting commercial and industrial markets in the central United States with industrial cities in Mexico.
Canadian Pacific's latest attempt to expand its U.S. business comes after it dropped a hostile $28.4 billion bid for  Norfolk Southern  Corp (NYSE:NSC) in April 2016. Canadian Pacific's merger talks with CSX Corp (NASDAQ:CSX), which owns a large network across the eastern United States, failed in 2014.
A bid by Canadian National Railway Co, the country's biggest railroad, to buy Warren Buffett-owned Burlington Northern Santa Fe was blocked by U.S. antitrust authorities in 1999-2000. 

BMO Capital Markets and Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS). LLC are serving as financial advisors to Canadian Pacific, while BofA Securities and  Morgan Stanley  & Co (NYSE:MS). LLC are serving as financial advisors to Kansas City Southern.

About two-thirds of production on the advanced 300mm wafer line affected by Friday's fire is automotive chips, CEO Hidetoshi Shibata told an online briefing. 
""It comes at a time when there isn't excess production capacity,"" he said.
Carmakers are already struggling with a global chip shortage caused by a COVID-19-driven boom in consumer electronics and an unexpected strong rebound in auto sales. Makers such as Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co , Honda Motor Co and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co have had to trim production plans as a result.
Carmakers will start to feel a supply pinch in about a month, according to Renesas.
The chipmaker said it along with automakers and their key suppliers are looking for ways to minimize the impact of the stoppage, Shibata said.
A  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp spokeswoman said the world's largest carmaker is currently assessing the situation.
The fire at the Naka chip plant in northeast Japan destroyed 11 machines, or 2% of the manufacturing equipment, and sent smoke billowing through the clean room where even small particles of dust can damage wafers during the sensitive fabrication process.
Renesas may not be able to replace all the destroyed equipment within a month, Shibata said, meaning that a return to full production could take longer.
The company, he added, may be able to rely on other plants to replace around two-thirds of the lost production, which is worth around 17 billion yen ($156 million) a month. 
The latest disruption at the Naka plants comes after production stopped for a few days last month after an earthquake cut power and back up generators failed to start.
In 2011, Renesas had to close the facility for three months following the deadly earthquake that devastated Japan's northeast coast.

DETROIT (Reuters) - The impact of the global semiconductor shortage on the auto industry spread on Saturday, as Stellantis warned its highly profitable pickup trucks were hit, while Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said it would cut more U.S. production.
Stellantis, the world's fourth largest automaker, said it will build and hold for final assembly its Ram 1500 Classic trucks at its Warren, Michigan, and Saltillo, Mexico, assembly plants. When chips become available, the vehicles will be completed and shipped to dealers.
The action will last ""a number of weeks,"" a Stellantis spokeswoman said, declining to reveal how many trucks would be affected. 
The chip shortage, which has hit automakers globally, stems from a confluence of factors. Carmakers shut North American plants for two months during the COVID-19 pandemic last year and canceled chip orders. Meanwhile, demand for chips surged from the consumer electronics industry as people worked from home and played video games. Now carmakers must compete for chips.
Carmakers have repeatedly said they will prioritize chips for their most profitable vehicles, but the impact on the Ram, as well as previous reports by Ford and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) of lost or impacted production of their full-size trucks, shows the shortage is hitting companies where it hurts.
Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said earlier this month the problems might not be fully resolved by the second half of 2021, as some auto rivals have flagged, describing supplies as the ""big unknown"" for revenues in 2021. 
Ford said Saturday it will idle its Ohio assembly plant next week, while its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville will only work two of three shifts. Both plants will return to full production the week of March 29.
The U.S. automaker said the latest action is part of a prior forecast it made that the shortage could hit 2021 profits by $1 bln to $2.5 bln.

On Thursday, Ford said it would assemble its flagship, highly profitable F-150 pickup truck as well as Edge SUVs in North America without certain parts and then hold them ""for a number of weeks"" until they can be completed and shipped, affecting ""thousands"" of vehicles. It also said it would idle production at plants in Louisville, Kentucky, and Cologne, Germany.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in January signed a decree imposing sanctions on Skyrizon and his party told parliament this month it would submit a bill on nationalising Motor Sich.

The jurors late on Friday directed Apple to pay a running royalty to PMC, which is generally based on the amount of sales of a product or service.
Apple said it was disappointed with the verdict and planned to appeal. 
""Cases like this, brought by companies that don't make or sell any products, stifle innovation and ultimately harm consumers,"" it said in an emailed statement. 
PMC, a licensing firm, had originally sued Apple in 2015 alleging the tech giant's iTunes service infringed seven of its patents.
Apple successfully challenged PMC's case at the U.S. patent office, but an appeals court in March last year reversed that decision, paving the way for the trial.

Sugarland, Texas-based PMC has infringement cases pending against companies including Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).

690,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2021 02:10AM ET</span>","Musk says Tesla would be shut down if its cars spied in China, elsewhere","BEIJING (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc chief executive Elon Musk said on Saturday his company would be shut down if its cars were used to spy, his first comments on news that China's military has banned Teslas from its facilities.
""There's a very strong incentive for us to be very confidential with any information,"" Musk told a prominent Chinese forum during a virtual discussion. ""If Tesla used cars to spy in China or anywhere, we will get shut down.""
Sources told Reuters on Friday that the Chinese military has banned Tesla cars from entering its complexes, citing security concerns over cameras installed on the vehicles.
Those restrictions surfaced as the top Chinese and U.S. diplomats were holding a contentious meeting in Alaska, the first such in-person interaction since U.S. President Joe Biden took office in January.
Musk urged greater mutual trust between the world's two biggest economies, in his remarks to the China Development Forum, a high-level business gathering is hosted by a foundation under the State Council.
He was holding a discussion panel with Xue Qikun, a Chinese quantum physicist who heads the Southern University of Science and Technology.
In China, the world's biggest car market and a key battleground for electric vehicles (EVs), Tesla sold 147,445 vehicles last year, 30% of its global total. However, it is facing more competition this year from domestic rivals from Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc to Geely.
Musk has made several high-profile appearances in China, where Tesla makes as well as sells EVs. In 2019, he discussed Mars and artificial intelligence with  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s outspoken founder Jack Ma.

At a delivery event last year for China-made Model 3 sedans, Musk danced enthusiastically on stage, stripping off his jacket in what became a social media storm.

691,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 08:30PM ET</span>",Insurer Chubb needs to pay up to bulk up with Hartford,"By Alwyn Scott and David French
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chubb (NYSE:CB) Ltd's $23.4 billion bid for Hartford Financial Services Group (NYSE:HIG) Inc would catapult it well up the rankings of U.S. property and casualty insurers, if it is willing to sweeten its offer enough to clinch the deal, equity analysts said. 
Chubb on Thursday offered to buy Hartford for $65 per share in cash and stock, a premium of about 13% to its stock price the previous day.
In combining forces, Chubb would significantly boost its footprint among small commercial businesses, where Hartford is a leader. Building scale in that sector is critical, because small businesses tend to pay small premiums, said analyst Paul Newsome at Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) in Chicago.
Hartford Financial or ""The Hartford"" as it is known, dates back to 1810 when it was founded as the Hartford Fire Insurance Co.
Some analysts said the offer undervalued Hartford and suggested the price could rise to more than $29 billion. Other acquisitions in the sector have fetched prices that were 151% to 176% of book value, compared with Chubb's bid at 144% of Hartford's book value.
""We view the $65 per share as too low,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Elyse Greenspan said in a note, arguing Hartford could command more than $80 a share.
The combined company could book about $51 billion in net premiums earned in 2022, a key revenue metric for insurers, Greenspan estimated. 
That would make Chubb bigger than Progressive Corp (NYSE:PGR), which analysts expect will report about $48 billion in net premiums earned in 2022, according to Refinitiv.
The P&C insurance market has been hit by claims associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including payouts to some business for losses caused by lockdown measures.
This comes on top of terrible wildfires in western states, the most active Atlantic hurricane season on record, and civil unrest, which have all raised claims by policyholders, and pushed losses onto insurers.
While a potential deal would be the largest in the P&C space since Chubb was created by ACE Ltd's $28.5 billion purchase of Chubb in January 2016, this part of insurance has seen a steady flow of smaller acquisitions.
Transactions such as MetLife Inc (NYSE:MET) selling its car and home insurance business to Farmers Group, part of Zurich Insurance Group AG (OTC:ZURVY), reflect how those with smaller operations are exiting the sector in the face of fierce competition.
The deal is unlikely to encounter regulatory challenges given how fragmented the P&C industry is, Newsome said. Chubb has a narrow advantage as the largest writer of commercial lines policies ahead of Travelers Companies (NYSE:TRV), according to S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Market Intelligence. Adding eighth-ranked Hartford would give the combined entity an 8.4% market share overall.
In personal lines insurance, a joint Chubb-Hartford would be the 11th-largest writer, S&P Global figures show. Ranking by net premiums written would put Chubb-Hartford just below fifth-ranked Liberty Mutual Insurance Co, based on 2020 results, according to AM Best.
If Chubb does not pay up for Hartford, others might be more willing. William  Hawkins  (NASDAQ:HWKN) at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods wrote in a note that Allianz (DE:ALVG) SE and Zurich could offer $87 and $84 a share, respectively, while still accruing benefits to earnings.
Allianz and Zurich declined to comment. 
The deal also appeared likely to spur more activity. 

""Every significant-size insurance company is going to ask themselves, 'If Chubb thinks they need scale, what about me?'"" Newsome said. (This story corrects name of company to S&P Global Market Intelligence instead of S&P Global Intelligence, paragraph 13)

693,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 06:25PM ET</span>",Analysis: Europe's COVID-19 setbacks risk another summer travel washout,"By Sarah Young and Laurence Frost
LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Europe's airlines and travel sector are bracing for a second lost summer, with rebound hopes increasingly challenged by a hobbled COVID-19 vaccine rollout, resurgent infections and new lockdowns. Airline and travel stocks fell on Friday after Paris and much of northern France shut down for a month, days after Italy introduced stiff business and movement curbs for most of the country including Rome and Milan. The setbacks hit recovery prospects for the crucial peak season, whose profits typically tide airlines through winter, when most carriers lose money even in good times.
""If there's no confidence there, demand just doesn't come back,"" said Dublin-based Alton Aviation consultant Leah Ryan, who expects the bad news on vaccines and lockdowns to hurt already weak bookings.
The summer outlook also has been dented by rising infections in Greece and elsewhere, and a suspension of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s vaccine by a number of European countries over health fears. Several countries announced resumption of use of the AstraZeneca shot this week after the European Medicines Agency said the benefits clearly outweigh its risks.
Airlines that have already racked up billions in debt face further strain that some may not survive without fresh funds. British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) raised 1.2 billion euros ($1.43 billion) in a bond issue on Thursday, saying the cushion would protect it from a drawn-out slump.
A patchy stop-start summer may pose fewer difficulties for low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Wizz Air, which can redeploy planes quickly between routes. But Ryanair's home market expects to keep strict travel curbs in place at least throughout June, Irish health official Ronan Glynn said on Thursday, citing the ""deteriorating situation internationally"" and emerging more contagious virus variants.
Ryanair shares traded 4.2% lower on Friday, with IAG down 4% and easyJet (LON:EZJ) and Wizz both down 3.5%. Rebound hopes had driven travel stocks higher over the past month, led by IAG's 25% gain. 
While ultra-low cost carriers can take the pain of another summer washout, analysts say, rivals such as easyJet and Virgin Atlantic could face renewed balance-sheet pressures. Air France-KLM is also seeking to raise capital and reduce debt from last year's 10.4 billion-euro bailout. The Franco-Dutch airline group aims to fly more than 50% of pre-crisis capacity this year, compared with 40%-50% for Lufthansa - targets that could still prove ambitious.
""MAJOR HIT"" ""There's a risk of an increased number of bankruptcies particularly between now and the end of the year,"" Alexandre de Juniac, head of global airline body IATA, told Reuters.
The latest whiplash in recovery sentiment extends from airlines into hospitality industries and the broader economy, penalizing tourism-dependent Mediterranean countries. ""Virus numbers are going up, the vaccine rollout is falling behind and there is a risk that Europe could lose a second summer,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economist Jacob Nell said, predicting a ""major hit to the southern economies"".
The weak European outlook contrasts with optimistic messages from U.S. airline CEOs, who this week reported rising spring and summer leisure bookings across the country, as the U.S. vaccination campaign gained momentum and coronavirus restrictions are eased.
United Airlines said it could halt its cash burn this month, excluding debt and severance payments. 
Thanks to its faster progress on vaccinations, the UK outbound market has been seen as key to the coming European peak season. But rising European infection rates could threaten those plans too. Greece became Britain's biggest source of imported cases when the countries opened a travel corridor last summer, according to an official UK study published this week. Instead, the faster pace of vaccinations in Britain and the United States could bring a transatlantic rebound – potentially flipping the conventional wisdom that short-haul will recover first. ""These two countries are leading the G20,"" with shots administered to 40% of the population in Britain and one-third in the United States, UBS aviation analyst Jarrod Castle said.""The North Atlantic could open up between (them) before other European markets, which would be greatly beneficial for British Airways.""

694,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 05:55PM ET</span>","U.S. Fed to let bank-leverage exemption expire this month, will review rule","By David Henry and Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Big U.S. banks will have to resume holding an extra layer of loss-absorbing capital against U.S. Treasuries and central bank deposits from next month after the Federal Reserve said on Friday it would not extend a temporary pandemic regulatory break due to expire this month. 
The Fed said it would, however, launch a formal review of the capital rule, known as the ""supplementary leverage ratio,"" due to concerns it is no longer functioning as intended as a result of the central bank's emergency COVID-19 monetary policy measures.
While the Fed's decision to review the rule is a win for Wall Street banks, which have long argued the leverage ratio is fundamentally flawed, its refusal to extend the exemption, as many analysts had expected, came as a disappointment. 
Shares of the largest U.S. banks fell after the news, with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) losing as much as 4% before closing down 1.6% on the day. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)'s and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) lost 1% and 1.1%, respectively.
""Wall Street bank stocks will get punished because now they will have to put more money aside,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange brokerage Oanda, said in an email.
He added, however, that the planned review of the leverage ratio ""should alleviate concerns that this is a final decision.""
To ease Treasury market stress and encourage banks to lend to Americans struggling amid lockdowns, the Fed last April excluded Treasuries and central bank deposits from the leverage ratio until March 31. 
Uncertainty over whether it would stick to that expiration date has compounded anxiety in fixed income markets. Banks have warned that allowing the rule to expire could push them to pull back from buying government debt and from lending, potentially sparking another bout of market turmoil. 
The issue has become a political hot potato, with powerful Democrats pressuring Fed Chair Jerome Powell to deny Wall Street what they say is an unwarranted break that could increase systemic risks. They point out that big banks have plenty of cash to buy back shares and issue dividends. 
""This is a victory for lending in communities hit hard by the pandemic, and for the stability of our financial system,"" said Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, who had previously warned the Fed that extending the exemption would be a ""grave error."" 
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields jumped around five basis points on the announcement to 1.750%, nearing Thursday's the one-year high of 1.754%.
But Fed officials said they were confident that allowing the exemption to expire would not impair Treasury market liquidity or cause disruption because the market had stabilized and big banks are flush with capital.
BALLOONING BALANCE SHEET
The leverage ratio was adopted after the 2007-2009 financial crisis as a safeguard to prevent big banks from manipulating other capital rules. It requires them to hold additional capital against assets regardless of their risk.
But the ratio is rapidly becoming the primary limit on banks' balance sheets which have swelled as a result of the Fed pumping cash into the economy amid the pandemic. 
In the last year, the Fed has nearly doubled its balance sheet to more than $7.7 trillion through around $3.4 trillion in bond purchases. That extraordinary intervention, along with near-zero interest rates, aims to keep money flowing through the banking system. 
As a result, bank deposits at the Fed, known as reserves, have sky-rocketed to $3.9 trillion since the pandemic began, according to Fed data from Thursday, and are expected to increase by another $2 trillion before the Fed pares back stimulus efforts.
“That pressure is pretty significant,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rate strategist at TD Securities, adding it may cause banks to step away from ""market supporting roles.""
Some banks might have to issue preferred shares to add enough capital in the near term to handle the increasing deposits, which would dilute common stock by 1% to 2%, Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI wrote in a note. 
Banks say reserves and U.S. Treasuries are effectively risk-free and it makes little sense to penalize them. (Graphic: Bank reserves held at the Fed have skyrocketed, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdpxeqlkvx/Pasted%20image%201616161155027.png) 
The Fed indicated on Friday that it had heeded those complaints. Due to the continued growth in reserves and Treasury issuance, it said it may recalibrate the ratio ""to prevent strains...that could both constrain economic growth and undermine financial stability."" 
However, it added that any changes to the rule would not erode the overall strength of bank capital requirements. 
While the Fed's decision appears to be a neat compromise to appease both Wall Street and progressive Democrats, the rule review, which will be subject to public consultation, is likely to be a fraught and lengthy process, said analysts. 
Progressives, who say Powell is inclined to be too friendly to Wall Street on regulatory issues, are generally skeptical of any attempt to crack open post-crisis rules and may fight changes. That could leave the market in an uncomfortable limbo, said analysts.

""Unless there is a fix relatively quickly, I think there’s going to be a lot of caution in the market and a lot of concerns about volatility,"" said Goldberg.

695,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 05:50PM ET</span>","Canadian border agent covertly gathered evidence on Huawei for FBI, defence argues","By Sarah Berman and Moira Warburton
VANCOUVER (Reuters) - The Canadian border agent who questioned Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou before her arrest at Vancouver airport in 2018 went beyond the scope of his jurisdiction, in an effort to gather evidence for the FBI, Meng's legal team said on Friday.
Among the questions the agent asked was whether Huawei had an office in Iran, defence lawyer Mona Duckett told the judge, a line of questioning that she argued had nothing to do with immigration and her admissibility into Canada. 
""It was an attempt to gather evidence for one audience,"" the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Duckett said as the hearing for Meng's extradition entered the last phase of arguments.
Meng, 49, is accused by the United States of misleading HSBC about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s business dealings in Iran, causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions.
The Canadian government has called the defence team's argument an unfounded ""conspiracy,"" and stated that officials on both sides of the border followed due processes. 
If extradited, Meng will face trial for bank fraud in the United States. Meng, who says she is innocent, is fighting her extradition from house arrest in Vancouver. Her legal team wants the case to be dismissed, arguing abuses of process took place during her arrest and her rights were violated.
Canadian border officials questioned Meng for three hours before the Canadian police arrested her on a U.S. warrant. 
Meng's legal team allege Canadian and U.S. authorities coordinated to use the additional investigative powers of the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) to question her without a lawyer present.
CBSA Superintendent Sanjit Dhillon, one of the officers who interrogated Meng, testified in November 2020 that the Canadian police did not give him any instructions about what to ask Meng, however.
Another CBSA officer who was involved testified last year that border officials were concerned about keeping their investigation separate from the police's extradition arrest. 
On Friday, Duckett was skeptical about what she called Dhillon's ""excuse"" for bringing up Iran, which was that he read a Wikipedia article about Huawei which mentioned that country.
Meng's defence has accused several police and border witnesses of ""untruthful” testimony in their submissions about alleged abuses of process.
Meng's arrest has caused a breakdown in diplomatic relations between Ottawa and Beijing. Shortly after she was detained, China arrested Canadians Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig on espionage charges. Spavor faced trial on Friday; Kovrig's trial is set for Monday.

Meng's case is expected to wrap up in May, although a decision could be appealed, which would delay the final outcome.

The move is the latest sign of China's growing scrutiny of the U.S. electric carmaker amid tensions with Washington. Analysts said it resembled Washington's measures against Chinese telecoms firm Huawei citing national security.
Chinese military restrictions on Tesla surfaced as senior Chinese and U.S. officials held a contentious meeting in Alaska, the first such interaction since U.S. President Joe Biden took office.
""I presume the timing of the announcement surely linked to the fireworks planned for Anchorage,"" said Ian Bremmer, president at Eurasia Group consulting firm.
Tesla shares ended up 0.3% after falling as much as 4.4% during trade. 
The U.S. electric car maker won strong backing from Shanghai when it built its first overseas factory there in 2019. Tesla's sleek Model 3 sedans were the best-selling electric vehicle in the country before being overtaken by a much cheaper micro EV.
The directive advises owners to park Teslas outside military property, and residents were notified this week, the two sources said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.
Bloomberg News earlier reported the move.
Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates, said the latest restrictions on Tesla were a close parallel to the U.S. government's hostility toward Huawei on concerns Beijing could have access to U.S. telecoms infrastructure.
""Even if such concern is exaggerated, it can create dislocation for the companies directly affected,"" he said. 
Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported that China's government was restricting use of Tesla cars by personnel at military, state-owned enterprises in sensitive industries and key agencies. (https://on.wsj.com/3r2NnVe)
It was not immediately clear whether the measure applied to all such facilities. The move came after a government security review of Tesla's vehicles, the report said, citing people familiar with the effort. 
Tesla sold 147,445 cars in China last year, or 30% of its total deliveries, though competition is growing from domestic rivals such as Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc and Geely.
China's State Council Information Office and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. China's defence ministry could not immediately be reached for comment.
CARS AND CAMERAS
Automakers have been equipping more vehicles with cameras and sensors that capture images of a car's surroundings. Control of how those images are used and where they are sent and stored is a fast-emerging challenge for the industry and regulators around the world. 
Tesla cars have several external cameras to assist drivers with parking, changing lanes and other features. Chief Executive Elon Musk has often spoken about the value of the data Tesla vehicles capture that can be used to develop autonomous driving.
Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y also have cameras in the rear view mirror for driver safety that are disabled by default.
""China has an array of tools - some direct, some indirect - for putting the heavy on foreign companies like Tesla. The pressure can come from any direction, for any reason at any time,"" said Michael Dunne, chief executive of consultancy ZoZo Go.
A Chinese state regulator said in February that government officials had met representatives from Tesla over consumer reports of battery fires, unexpected acceleration and failures in over-the-air software updates. 

Musk is scheduled to speak online on Saturday at a state-hosted annual global economic gathering in Beijing called the China Development Forum. The event includes Chinese officials.

 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) rallied 4.1% and provided the biggest boost to the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 after Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s imminent privacy policy changes on ad sales would leave the social network in a ""stronger position.""
The S&P 500 banks index dropped 1.6% after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would not extend a temporary capital buffer relief put in place to ease a pandemic-driven stress in the funding market.
""Banks have had such a significant up move this year and this news has only acted as a catalyst for profit taking,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.
Optimism about a $1.9 trillion fiscal package and the Fed's promise to maintain its ultra-loose policy stance for years has accelerated a shift into economy-linked stocks, powering the S&P 500 and the Dow to record levels this week.
However, the Nasdaq is still about 6% below its Feb. 12 all-time closing high as technology and high-growth stocks have lost favor in recent months, with their valuations looking less attractive as Treasury yields rise.

The S&P 500 growth index rose 0.35%, outperforming the value index's 0.48% dip. 
Several bond managers believe the recent pace of the rise in yields has been unsettling and also worry the market could be viewed as disorderly if the momentum continues.

The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.76% to 13,215.24.
For the week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 0.8%, while the Dow lost 0.5%.
Trading was orderly despite Friday being quadruple witching, the once-in-a-quarter simultaneous expiration of various derivatives, which often spurs heavy trading volume and some volatility. 
""I think you saw a lot of the movement yesterday with that big selloff at the end of the day. A lot of that was to do with people closing out positions,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) in Chicago.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 16.5 billion shares, compared with the 14.4 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
 Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) fell more than 6%, erasing almost $30 billion of market capitalization after reports that the company is being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice. 
FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) rallied 6.1% after the U.S. delivery firm said quarterly profit jumped more than expected on higher prices and surging volume from pandemic-fueled e-commerce deliveries during the holiday shipping season.
 Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) fell 4% after the sports apparel maker missed quarterly sales estimates due to shipping issues and a pandemic-related slump at brick-and-mortar stores.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.25-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.70-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The United States 10-Year yields, which trade inversely to prices, retreated Friday after hitting 1.75% as the Federal Reserve said it would not extend the supplementary leverage ratio exemptions– a measure that had allowed banks to hold lower capital reserves – beyond the March 31 deadline. 
Under the exemption, banks weren't required to hold capital against the Treasuries held on their balance sheets. But with the exemption set to end, banks likely sold Treasuries – contributing to the recent rate spike -- into month-end ahead of the deadline to ensure they would comply with the ratio.

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), down 2%, and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), down 3%, led the declines.

Canadian manufacturers have warned that a slower vaccine rollout in Canada could put them at a competitive disadvantage with companies south of the border, with employees in the United States working in industries such as auto plants now being inoculated.
Montreal-based CAE is partnering with the province of Quebec to transform offices at its own cost into a vaccination center to inoculate workers of all ages, their family members and the surrounding community to support a provincial ramp-up in May and June, Health Minister Christian Dubé told reporters.
CAE Chief Executive Marc Parent said the company would follow government directives on vaccination priority and would not favor company workers over the public. 
Quebec has set a goal of offering a first dose to all its residents by June 24. 
Air Canada, Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Inc and Aéroports de Montréal are in joint talks with Quebec to run a vaccination site, although details are not finalized, representatives for the Montreal-based airline and corporate planemaker said.
Canada has wrestled with a slower rollout of vaccines than other countries due to a lack of domestic production, with just 8% of its population receiving at least one dose compared with 23% in the U.S.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has set a September target for having all Canadian adults vaccinated, while President Joe Biden has told U.S. states to make all adults eligible for a coronavirus vaccine by May 1.

Canada is currently vaccinating older residents, but some provinces like British Columbia have said they would begin inoculating agricultural workers, including temporary foreign workers.

704,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 03:15PM ET</span>","U.S. backs distance of 3 feet between students, which may help schools open","By Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Friday updated its COVID-19 mitigation guidance to narrow the acceptable distance between students who are wearing masks to at least three feet from at least six feet, potentially easing the path for schools that have struggled to reopen under previous recommendations. 
The new recommendation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is a boost to the Biden administration's goal of reopening in-person learning for millions of public school students without sparking outbreaks of the virus.
""The revised CDC guidance is a great step,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. It ""reflects the fact that schools... are not drivers of infections,"" he added. 
Many schools continue to teach students remotely more than a year after the novel coronavirus prompted widespread closures across the United States. 
The CDC said the new guidance was based on data from schools in Utah, Missouri and Florida that suggests transmission of COVID-19 in schools is relatively low when precautions such as mask-wearing are employed, including in cases where students do not maintain six feet of distance. 
The guidance applies to students from kindergarten through high school and in areas with low, moderate, and substantial community transmission of COVID-19. Middle and high school students in communities with high levels of COVID-19 should stay six feet apart unless their schoolday contact can be limited to a single small group of students and staff.
""I want to emphasize that these recommendations are specific to students in classrooms with universal mask-wearing,"" said CDC Director Rochelle Walensky in a Friday press conference. 
Students should continue to maintain six feet of distance when interacting with teachers and other school staff and when eating, the CDC said. 
The CDC has been under pressure to relax its guidance to schools and Walensky said this week that the agency was looking at data in part from a recent study in Massachusetts which suggested tighter spacing had not impacted COVID-19 transmission.
One of the CDC studies released on Friday looked at 20 elementary schools in Utah during a period of high COVID-19 transmission rates in the broader community. It showed that in-school transmission rates among masked students were low even though they maintained an average distance between seats of only three feet.
Many schools do not have the space in classrooms to maintain six feet between students, and outside of the United States public health agency recommendations for social distancing start at about three feet and range to more than six. 
The guidance urged schools to conduct widespread COVID-19 testing of students and said such regular use of screening tests offers added protection for schools that require fewer than six feet of separation. 
School districts should expand screenings for students participating in sports or other extracurricular activities, and consider universal screening prior to athletic events. 
The agency continues to recommend quarantines for anyone who has been within six feet of someone sick with COVID-19 for more than 15 minutes within a 24-hour period. 
The White House on Wednesday said it would allocate $10 billion to states to support COVID-19 screening testing for teachers, staff and students to assist schools resume in-person instruction. 
The CDC said students are required to wear masks on school buses and any other forms of public transit they use to get to school. The agency issued an order in February requiring travelers to wear masks when using public transit. 

The Biden administration has urged states to vaccinate teachers and childcare workers, with the goal of getting all of them inoculated by the end of March.

In a joint filing late Thursday, the Justice Department said that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google had balked at some search terms that the government wanted it to use to locate relevant documents. The Justice Department estimated the request to Google would produce 4.85 million documents.
It also said that Google had refused to agree to dozens of additional ""custodians,"" essentially people whose emails and other documents would be searched as part of pre-trial document production.
Google, for its part, said that they had reviewed more than 12 million documents for the government's case, and expressed concern at the growing number of custodians whose documents were sought.
""The DOJ Plaintiffs' proposal is unreasonable and not proportional to the needs of this case,"" Google said in the filing.

The cases under discussion are the federal government and one of the state lawsuits against Google. Those actions are two of the five antitrust lawsuits filed against Big Tech last year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Criminal money laundering charges against British state-backed bank NatWest are linked to a separate case against 13 individuals based in cities across the country, prosecutors have told Reuters.
Britain's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), started a criminal action against NatWest on Tuesday, making it the first bank to be charged under a 2007 money laundering law.
The FCA accused NatWest of failing to monitor suspect activity by a client that deposited about 365 million pounds($500 million) in its accounts over five years, of which 264 million was in cash.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said in a statement to Reuters on Thursday that the FCA's proceedings against NatWest involved the same accounts linked to the 13 individuals it has charged separately with money laundering offences.
Reuters and other media reported on Tuesday that Fowler Oldfield, a gold dealership in Bradford that has since been liquidated, was the NatWest customer linked to the FCA action.
Among the individuals the CPS has charged are former gold dealer James Stunt, who gained notoriety in the British press for his lavish lifestyle before going bankrupt, and two former Fowler Oldfield directors, Gregory Frankel and Daniel Rawson.
NatWest declined to comment on the CPS statement.
Law firm Janes Solicitors, which is representing Stunt, declined to comment. Ian Lewis, a partner at JMW Solicitors which is representing Frankel and Rawson, said: ""We are defending these criminal proceedings vigorously."" 
NatWest said on Tuesday it took preventing money laundering ""extremely seriously"" and was cooperating with the FCA investigation. If convicted, it could face an unlimited fine. 
Fowler Oldfield was shut down following a police raid in 2016 and its assets are being held by police, a liquidators' report in December 2020 said. 
Stunt's Mayfair-based gold bullion business Stunt & Co - which once supplied gold and silver souvenir coins to Formula One - has also been liquidated, according to Companies House.
It was raided by police at the same time as Fowler Oldfield, according to media reports.

NatWest representatives are due to appear in court in the FCA case next month. The CPS case is listed for trial in April next year.

707,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 02:20PM ET</span>",Explainer: What rising bond yields mean for markets,"By Kate Duguid and Karen Brettell
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yields on U.S. Treasuries have surged to their highest level in more than a year from record lows hit in 2020, as Federal Reserve commitments to hold rates near zero for years to come encouraged investors to bet economic growth and inflation will heat up.
Though yields remain low by historical standards, a rapid rise can ripple through to affect assets ranging from equities and commodities to housing prices.
Here’s what’s happening:
Why are yields rising?
In recent months, breakthroughs in developing COVID-19 vaccines and fiscal stimulus have raised expectations the economy will bounce back. Improving risk appetite has encouraged investors to buy riskier assets such as stocks rather than bonds. Expectations of inflation have also jumped, driving bond prices lower and yields higher. Weaker demand for debt was evident in last month's disappointing auction of seven-year U.S. Treasury notes that helped push up yields. 
Where do investors think yields will go next?
Investors generally believe yields will climb more in 2021, though some think the Fed could move to cap a rise in yields that it views as extreme enough to threaten the economic recovery. Some analysts think this could happen if 10-year Treasury yields rise much above 2% without substantial economic improvement.
What does the rise in yields mean for other assets?
Higher Treasury yields have made the U.S. dollar more attractive to income-seeking investors, boosting it from three-year lows reached in January.
On the other hand, the spot price for non-yielding gold is down this year after outperforming nearly all other assets last year.
For stocks, rising yields are a mixed bag, slowing a rally in technology and other growth stocks as investors worry about erosion of long-cash flows for these companies. But higher yields have also lifted financial stocks and accelerated a rotation into other beaten-down sectors.
How could higher Treasury yields affect individuals?
Effects on individual pocketbooks can be seen most directly in the housing market. The interest rates charged on fixed-rate mortgages tend to shadow moves in Treasury yields and have already begun moving higher.

Savers could start to see rates increase in high yield savings accounts again.

(Reuters) - An adviser to the top U.S. securities regulator said on Friday his subcommittee will likely recommend new disclosures about diversity from registered investment advisers and other steps to improve minority representation in finance.
The ideas, which would need further approval, mark the latest effort to shed more light on the small role held by women and ethnic minorities in the money management industry, although they could also show the obstacles regulators face in taking on social issues.
Friday's potential recommendations came from Gilbert Garcia, head of a Texas money management firm and chair of a subcommittee studying diversity issues for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's asset management advisory committee. The Washington regulator's acting chair had said on Feb. 25 it should revisit diversity disclosure requirements.
During a webcast public hearing Garcia said the subcommittee will likely suggest the SEC require investment advisors to report additional details on their Form ADVs such as the race and gender of directors and officers.
The subcommittee also may suggest the SEC discourage the use of manager-selection parameters that exclude minority-owned firms, which tend to manage fewer assets and have shorter track records. ""Many of the same participants who foster a closed financial system often do so under the shield"" of fiduciary obligations, Garcia said.
Committee member Susan McGee, a director of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) affiliates, said after Garcia spoke that a central question is how much regulation should be used to change public behavior.
""I do struggle with using the regulatory framework to push initiatives like this,"" McGee said.

Only 59 Russell 1000 companies make public their annual federal filing showing details of their employees by race and gender across various job categories, or key information from the form, according to activist researcher Just Capital. Just found 68% of the Russell 1000 release no racial or ethnic workforce data.

Shares opened at $18.60 each on Thursday, up from the initial public offering price of $15, on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is up almost 9% in Friday's session.
Duckhorn sells wine ranging from $20 to $200 a bottle in more than 50 countries. It was the eleventh-largest wine supplier by sales value in the U.S. in the 12 months through Oct. 4, the company said in a prospectus, citing IRI.
The company anticipates growing organically and through acquisitions, after more than doubling sales from 2015 to last year. Over the past three years, Duckhorn bought two winery brands, continuing to focus on the high-end market, including entering into the seltzer market with premium Decoy-branded wine-based seltzers in February. Other such extensions are expected in the future.

711,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 12:54PM ET</span>",Fed to Weigh Bank Dividends After Ending Covid Break on Capital,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve may have little reason to continue restricting bank dividends now that it’s ended a pandemic-driven capital break for Wall Street.
In the face of Covid-19, the regulator had banned stock buybacks and limited the dividends at the biggest banks, saying the industry needed to build a cushion against the losses expected during the economic crisis of the last year. The central bank already let the banks re-start buybacks, but it continued to constrain dividends. Now, the Fed is saying the industry has plenty of capital, which raises questions about what’s next with that dividend limit.
Chairman Jerome Powell said this week that his agency hasn’t yet made a decision on what to do, and that an announcement is “a couple of weeks away.” But the current dividend limit is set to expire at the end of the month, so the Fed is under some pressure to make up its mind.
With the Fed’s Friday announcement that the temporary capital boon it gave banks is over on March 31, officials said the biggest lenders have about $200 billion more in capital than they need to stay below their maximum leverage caps. Because of that, the officials said they didn’t expect banks would have to do anything drastic in returning to their usual capital requirements.
“This takes out of play the biggest political impediment to the Fed removing all Covid-19-related restrictions on big bank capital distributions,” Jaret Seiberg, an analyst for Cowen & Co., wrote in a note. The Fed could revert to letting banks get back to regular capital-distribution practices this year, he predicted.
Still, the dividend question has drawn heat from Democratic lawmakers, including Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown and Senator Elizabeth Warren, who have called for the Fed to keep demanding the industry keep building up its safety cushion until the Covid crisis is firmly in the past.

While Gomes Neto did not specify which new products are involved in the discussions, he has said in the past that the company hopes to develop a new turboprop plane but that it cannot do it alone. 
Reuters first reported last year that China, India and Russia were considering partnering with Embraer.
Until last year, Embraer was set to sell the majority of its commercial aviation operation to Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co for $4.2 billion. But that deal fell apart in April, weighed down by the pandemic's crippling effect on travel and planemakers. 
On Friday, Embraer reported its best quarter so far during the COVID-19 pandemic, narrowing losses to just $3 million while delivering more jets in the period than in the first nine months of the year combined. 
But it remains unclear if the worst has passed for Embraer or if more challenges lie ahead, because so much of the company's 2021 sales happened in the last three months of the year. The fourth quarter already tended to be Embraer's strongest before the pandemic. 
The world's No. 3 planemaker will not issue forward-looking guidance because it says its outlook remains uncertain, but noted that it had had no commercial jet orders canceled and that it had finished downsizing its workforce. 
Overall in 2020, Embraer lost $732 million, more than double its loss for 2019, weighed down by its commercial aviation unit, which is also its main business line. 
Deliveries fell by half from 2019. While the planemaker delivered 28 commercial jets in the fourth quarter, it only delivered 16 in the previous 9 months. 

The result was that Embraer's fourth-quarter revenue came in at $1.8 billion, just 12% lower than a year earlier, even though full-year revenue was down 31%.

Investing.com – FedEx (NYSE:FDX) shares traded 7% higher Friday as its better-than-expected February quarter performance had analysts raising their price targets for the logistics giant.
On Thursday, the company reported earnings of $939 million, or $3.47 per share, in the February quarter, while surveyed analysts were expecting the company to report EPS of $3.23, StreetInsider said. This compares to last year’s net income of $371 million, or $1.41 per share.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst Jordan Alliger hiked the price target to $365 from the prior $356, according to StreetInsider. BofA (NYSE:BAC) analyst Ken Hoexter also raised the target to $351 from $346 earlier on expectations of continued strength.
The shares are trading some 8% off their 52-week high of $305.59, the peak being almost three times their low of $103.41 for the period.
Goldman’s new price is 29% higher than the prevailing prices while BofA’s is 24% higher.
FedEx has set aside a capex of $5.7 billion for 2021 financial year, higher than previously forecast. The higher capex allocation assumes continued recovery in U.S. industrial production and global trade, no additional Covid-19-related business restrictions and current fuel price expectations."

Investing.com – Shares of Petco Health (NASDAQ:WOOF) rose 7% on Friday after BofA Securities upgraded the stock to buy from neutral.
The brokerage’s $28 price target is 17% higher than the stock’s current level. BofA cited the trend of higher pet adoption in the U.S. for its optimistic outlook.
The health and wellness company for pets is seen benefiting from tailwinds in the industry, including a recovery in services as markets reopen and longer-term growth across the chain’s services online, according to the brokerage.
On Thursday, Petco gave an optimistic forecast for the year. It sees 2021 revenue between $5.25 billion and $5.35 billion. The projections represent an increase in a range of 7.1% and 9.2% compared to last year.
The company used its January IPO proceeds to halve its net debt to $1.5 billion.
Petco said the fruits of its efforts at transformation into an omnichannel health and wellness provider were proving to be successful, something BofA also pinned its hopes on while giving its forecast."

U.S. equity mutual funds pocketed a net inflow of $20.1 billion in the week, which marked a sixth straight week of net buying, data from Refinitiv Lipper showed.
The inflows were led by U.S. small cap funds and mid-cap funds, seeing net purchases of $3.6 billion and $2.1 billion respectively. On the other hand, large-cap funds had an inflow of just $251 million.
Among sector funds, investors turned net buyers of tech funds this week, purchasing $832 million, as tech stocks appeared attractive at lower valuations after witnessing sharp selling in the prior weeks.

Investors were sanguine ahead of a two-day Fed policy meeting at which the central bank signalled its intent to keep rates near zero until at least 2024, also predicting a fast economic recovery from the pandemic.
However, U.S. stocks tumbled on Friday, with banks leading the way after the Fed let expire a temporary capital buffer relief put in place to ease a pandemic-driven stress in the funding mark.

Investing.com -- Visa (NYSE:V) dropped after The Wall Street Journal said it was being investigated for anticompetitive practices by the Justice Department, citing people familiar.
The investigation is focused on whether Visa is engaging in anticompetitive practices in the debit-card market, specifically looking at whether Visa has limited merchants’ ability to route debit-card transactions over card networks that are often less expensive, the Journal reported, citing the people familiar.
The department is considering whether Visa’s practices are allowing it to maintain a dominant market share unlawfully, the people said.
The investigation comes at a time when competitors are lining up, with Stripe becoming this week the most valuable fintech company at $95 billion. Visa dominates the debit card market, with a 73% market share in 2018, according to the Motley Fool."

Investing.com – Ford (NYSE:F) shares rose 3% in Friday’s trade after Barclays's (NYSE:BCS) Brian Johnson called it a buy.
Johnson upgraded his rating on the carmaker to overweight from equal weight with a price target of $16.
Barclay’s target implies the stock could gain about 23% from the current level.
According to StreetInsider, Barclays believes Ford will announce a broader dedicated battery-powered electric vehicle strategy at its spring investor day. That date hasn’t been set yet.
Barclays views investor day as a ""major catalyst"" where Ford will ""likely reaffirm it is abandoning its 'flexible powertrain' approach and highlight its BEV strategy centered around two dedicated BEV platforms: VW MEB and a new dedicated Ford platform, which it has discussed recently.""
StreetInsider, quoting the analyst, said they are more comfortable with the margin improvement outlook and a likely more aggressive shift towards battery-operated electric vehicles leveraging the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s (OTC:VWAPY) modular electric drive platform.
They now believe that Ford can get close to its 6% EBIT margin goal for Europe, versus the consensus of about 1% to 2%.

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares fell 2.5% in Friday’s trade after China banned its vehicles from entering its military complexes on concerns about the cameras they carry.
As per a Bloomberg report, the order issued by the military advises Tesla owners to park their cars outside of military property.
In a report on the same lines, The Wall Street Journal reported that China's government was restricting the use of the company's cars by personnel at military, state-owned enterprises in sensitive industries and key agencies, as they could be a source of national security leaks.
Tesla cars have several small cameras externally to assist with parking and self-driving. The company’s Model 3 and Model Y have cameras embedded in the rear view mirror for driver safety.
While the Elon Musk tackles the new headache in China, the cup of challenges for the electric vehicle maker keeps filling up. Reuters on Friday reported that China's Geely Automobile Holdings (OTC:GELYF) Ltd ADR (OTC:GELYY) plans to roll out electric vehicles under a new marquee with different branding and sales strategies.
The brand, positioned in the premium segment and named ‘Zeekr’, will be housed under Geely's to-be-launched EV entity Lingling Technologies, Reuters said.
The Times Thursday reported that Model 3, Tesla’s most popular model in the U.K., will no longer be covered by the country’s subsidy program.
The upper limit of cars eligible for the scheme will be reduced from 50,000 pounds ($70,000) to £35,000 ($49,000), leaving out Model 3 whose prices start at 40,500 pounds.
Before Geely, there have been other signs too of the emerging competition. Volkswagen (OTC:VWAPY) Tuesday said it expects to make 1 million electric vehicles this year, which would put it comfortably ahead of Tesla in volume sales. BMW (OTC:BMWYY) wants half of its group sales to be electric by 2030.

Investing.com -- Bank stocks tumbled, dragging broader markets lower, after the Federal Reserve said it would close a loophole in regulation. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) were among the worst performers, down 3.4% and 2.6%, respectively.
The Fed said it won't extend a pandemic-era rule set in April that allowed banks to relax some capital level rules to protect against losses. As of March 31, banks will again have to count their Treasury bond and cash holdings toward their Supplementary Leverage Ratio. They had exempted such holdings in the first wave of the pandemic to allow the financial system to absorb a massive injection of liquidity as it slashed interest rates and started buying bonds in huge volume.
Some analysts have argued that the ending of this exemption will reduce banks'  willingness to hold Treasuries in a year when federal government borrowing is set to skyrocket. If that thesis is proved, it would put significant upward pressure on bond yields, which are already rising amid fears of a return of inflation.The Dow Jones Banks was down 2.6%, with all components in the red.

(Reuters) - The supply chain hiccups that dented  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE)'s third quarter sales are mostly behind them, analysts said on Friday, after executives said the sporting goods giant had adjusted inventories and other areas to avoid a recurrence.
Nike missed analysts expectations for quarterly sales on Thursday, squeezed by global container shortages and congestion at West Coast ports as well as closures of brick-and-mortar stores due to lockdowns in Europe.
Nike forecast ""low-to-mid-teens"" full-year revenue growth, falling just short of heightened expectations of a 15.9% increase. Shares of the Oregon-based company were down nearly 3% in early trading. 
Yet Nike executives said the supply issue, which has widely impacted makers of cars, clothing and fitness equipments, is mostly behind them, adding that they now expect a ""more consistent flow of inventory,"" an explanation most analysts viewed as plausible. 
""While it's reasonable to leave some flexibility amid COVID disruptions and U.S. port delays, we think guidance will prove ultra-conservative in several areas,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Michael Binetti said in a research note. 
At least four brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, with Credit Suisse increasing it to $176 versus a median of $165.
""We've now effectively absorbed the longer lead times through our third quarter,"" Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe said on a post earnings call, adding that the company expected ""a more consistent flow of inventory in the fourth quarter, recognizing that transit times are elevated versus the prior year.""
Nike executives added that inventory levels in North America now were being better managed to meet heightened demand and allow for more full-price sales.
""With bottlenecks being managed, brand health strong, higher-margin digital resonating, and China outperforming, momentum is healthy,"" RBC Capital Markets' Kate Fitzsimons said.
The company's revenue from online sales increased 59% in the third quarter, while Greater China revenue grew 42%.

Nike shares have more than doubled in the past 12 months, helped by a surge in demand for athletic wear from people confined to their homes.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets headed lower for a second straight day on Friday, reversing overnight gains after the Federal Reserve said it would close a potentially significant loophole in banking regulation. 
The Fed said that from March 31, banks will again have to count their Treasury bond and cash holdings towards their Supplementary Leverage Ratio. It had exempted such holdings in the first wave of the pandemic to allow the financial system to absorb a massive injection of liquidity as it slashed interest rates and started buying bonds in huge volume.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 267 points, or 0.8%, at 32,595 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.6% while the Nasdaq Composite was outperforming with a drop of only 0.2%. 
Some – but not all – analysts have argued that the ending of this exemption will reduce banks'  willingness to hold Treasuries in a year when federal government borrowing is set to skyrocket. If that thesis is proved, it would put significant upward pressure on bond yields, which are already rising amid fears of a return of inflation. 
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to an intraday high of 1.74% in response to the news. 
However, the Fed indicated that it would take action to mitigate any mechanistic pass-through into yields that could choke off an economic recovery.
""Because of recent growth in the supply of central bank reserves and the issuance of Treasury securities, the Board may need to address the current design and calibration of the SLR over time to prevent strains from developing that could both constrain economic growth and undermine financial stability,"" the central bank said in its statement.
Bank stocks were among those hardest hit by the news. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock fell 3.0%, while Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock fell 3.1%. Higher effective capital requirements would mean, at least on paper, that banks won't have as much money for share buybacks and dividends.  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) stock lost 2.6% and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock lost 1.8%.
Elsewhere,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) stock fell 5.0% after the company warned that supply chain bottlenecks, including port congestion and a lack of available shipping containers had weighed on sales in the quarter through February and would continue to do so for the time being.  FedEx (NYSE:FDX) stock rose 5.6%, after its quarterly results suggested it would be able to pass on the costs of such bottlenecks to its customers. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 4.0% after reports that China will stop state and military personnel from using them owing to fears that the data they collect could leak information related to state security.  The news came after a day of bruising exchanges between Chinese and U.S. diplomats at their first face-to-face meeting since President Joe Biden took office. The talks continue on Friday in Alaska."

""The decision has to be made by the Volkswagen management and supervisory board. We have largely discussed the advantages of such an initial public offering or listing already,"" Meschke said at Porsche AG's annual media conference.
Faced with tens of billions of costs for a radical shift towards electric mobility and software, Volkswagen is mulling a listing of Porsche, sources said last month, also with a view to lifting the value of the world's No.2 carmaker.
Meschke, who has previously noted how Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) benefited from being listed by Fiat Chrysler, already argued in favour of listing Porsche AG in 2018, saying the unit could be worth up to 70 billion euros ($83 billion) in such a scenario.
However, Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess earlier this week said that Porsche, which contributed 42% to Volkswagen's operating profit in 2020, was vital to funding the group's turnaround.
Meschke said in the case of a listing, shareholders in Porsche AG would naturally expect a dividend. That would allow Volkswagen to still share in the carmaker's success.
Boosted by details on its electric mobility strategy and positive broker comments, Volkswagen shares are up nearly a fifth so far this week, hitting their highest level since April 2015 on Thursday.
Commenting on the future of Volkswagen unit Bugatti, Meschke said there was a good fit with Croatian electric hypercar maker Rimac Automobili, in which Porsche has a 24% stake.
""There is a certain probability that Rimac and Bugatti will come together. There is no decision yet, but chances are good,"" Meschke said.
Volkswagen's Diess earlier this week said it was the group's aim to transfer responsibility for Bugatti to Porsche, adding Porsche would most likely form a joint venture with Rimac involving Bugatti and end up owning a minority stake.

724,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 09:10AM ET</span>",Room with a view: Investors check out Italy's top hotels,"By Elisa Anzolin, Valentina Za and Silvia Aloisi
MILAN (Reuters) - International investors are casting an eye over some of Italy's grandest hotels whose family owners may be persuaded to part with properties that can be refurbished in time for tourists to return.
The number of guests in Italian hotels more than halved in 2020 and the chances of a rebound this year have dimmed as the country fights a third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Italian tourism agency ENIT sees visitor numbers bouncing back to surpass pre-pandemic levels by 2023, but investors hope the wait will prove too long for many struggling owners. 
""M&A activity is concentrated on trophy assets for which the pandemic has been a game-changer: family owners that would never have considered selling in the past are now willing to hold discussions,"" said Marco Zalamena, head of hospitality at consultants EY.
At least four luxury hotels are currently up for sale, according to two sources with knowledge of the market.
Among them are the family-owned five-star Majestic Hotel as well as the Grand Hotel Via Veneto, a few minutes walk from each other on Rome's famed Via Veneto. 
In the north, Hotel Britannia is for sale on the shores of Lake Como, while real estate equity firm Aina Hospitality has put Milan's Four Points Hotel on the block, the sources said, on condition of anonymity as the information is not public. 
Hotel Britannia owner Ross Whieldon confirmed he and his wife were sounding out the market for a possible sale, but added they would be happy to keep it. ""It depends on how good the offers are, we have not made a decision yet,"" he told Reuters. 
The other hotel owners did not respond to requests for comment. 
In Venice, which in 2020 took the lion's share of investments in Italy's hotel sector, the private owners of Hotel Palace Bonvecchiati next to St. Mark's Square held preliminary talks with an investor last year, the sources said. 
Eligio Paties, one of the hotel's two owners, told Reuters the talks ended quickly, and they were not interested in a sale for now. ""People are calling us every day,"" he said. 
ITALY IN DEMAND
Fewer hotels changed hands in Italy last year as the pandemic raged and rooms stood empty. Deals more than halved to 31 in 2020 for a total of 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion), down from a peak of more than 3 billion euros from 67 transactions in 2019, according to EY. 
That trend was reflected across Europe, with real estate consultancy CBRE pointing to a 75% decline in France and a 60% drop in both Spain and Germany.
But there are signs that is changing, with Italy high on investors' wish-list. 
""Italy is the country most in demand when it comes to hospitality assets,"" said Raimondo Gaetani, business development director at real estate private equity firm Patrimonia.
""That's because it has more high-end destinations than other European countries, meaning investors can build hotel portfolios and benefit from higher margins.""
Patrimonia advised British private equity firm Reuben Brothers on its 100 million euro purchase of Venice's historic Luna Baglioni hotel earlier this year.
A fragmented market and fewer brands are also features boosting the appeal of Italy's large hotel sector, according to Francesco Calia, Italy's head of hotels at CBRE.
WAITING GAME
With 90% of Italian hotels currently shut, according to industry association Federalberghi, there are expectations that more family-owned hotels could have to be put on the market, driving down prices which have so far proven resilient.
Marco Michielli, chairman for the northeastern Veneto region of Federalberghi, said he gets three or four calls a week from European investment funds interested in Italian properties, compared with two or three a year before the pandemic.
""They are sitting on the fence waiting to find hotel owners who cave in,"" he said.
In February, Italy's Billi family sold Rome's Grand Hotel de la Minerve to domestic investment fund Arsenale.
Chief Executive Paolo Barletta, who launched Arsenale with jewellery billionaire Nicola Bulgari, told Reuters he expected competition for Italian assets to heat up.
Barletta predicts big hotel chains, which currently account for just 7% of the Italian hotel sector, will own 25-30% of the market within a decade.
MOMENT OF RECKONING
With over 32,700 hotels and 1.1 million rooms, according to Eurostat, Italy has the biggest hotel portfolio in Europe, ahead of Germany (32,200 hotels) and Spain (19,700 hotels).
The broader moment of reckoning for an industry burdened by high levels of borrowing could come with the unwinding of government support measures that have saved hotels most of their staff costs, and the end of debt holiday schemes. 
To support smaller and family-run hotels, Italian state investor CDP has launched a 2 billion euro fund to invest in the sector, advised by EY.
That could help hotel owners who are trying to hold out in anticipation of a strong rebound.
""The sector has been hit hard but it is not on its knees. Once we start travelling again, the recovery will be dramatic,"" Federalberghi Chairman Bernabo Bocca said.

725,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 09:09AM ET</span>",Purdue’s $40 Trillion of Opioid Claims Top Size of U.S. Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- By one measure, OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP is staring down a mountain of legal claims totaling more than $40 trillion, or about double the U.S. GDP in 2020.
The $40 trillion figure outlined in court papers excludes an even more improbable claim of $100 trillion filed by an undisclosed party. But it does reflect a more-than $2 trillion ask by a group of states and cities to help them cope with the deadly epidemic that they blame in part on Purdue. The vast majority of claims are related to unresolved opioid litigation.
The staggering sum highlights the complexity of lawsuit-driven bankruptcies like Purdue’s. Thousands of parties are seeking money from the company for allegedly fanning the flames of the U.S. opioid crisis. The drugmaker said it received more than 614,000 claims, 90% of which didn’t ask for a specific sum.
Total claim amounts typically shrink in large bankruptcies as duplicates are removed and the company challenges individual sums. Purdue can also ask its bankruptcy judge to estimate its total liabilities, though the process is “fairly uncertain,” said Bruce Markell, a former judge and current bankruptcy professor at Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) Pritzker School of Law.
Purdue’s proposed settlement of the claims is a plan potentially worth more than $10 billion, including more than $4.2 billion of cash from its owners. It’s common for creditors to receive just pennies on the dollar for their claims in bankruptcy.
To put the case in perspective, Markell points out that the $40 trillion sought by claimants is 3,000 times the settlement in the PG&E (NYSE:PCG) Corp. bankruptcy, where the company’s equipment was blamed for wildfires that killed more than 100 people and destroyed nearly 19,000 homes, businesses and other structures, including the entire town of Paradise.
“In light of the sum of claims filed, the only fair and equitable outcome is to confirm Purdue’s Plan because it maximizes the available funds and allows for a coherent allocation among the various creditors,” the company said in an emailed statement.
The bankruptcy case is Purdue Pharma LP, 19-23649, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (White Plains).

Investing.com – LYFT (NASDAQ:LYFT) shares were up 1% in Friday’s premarket trade after the ride-hailing company said on Thursday that last week was its best since March 2020.
It also said it expects positive weekly growth in its ride-share segment through the end of the year.
For the following week,  Lyft  expects volumes to more than double compared to a year earlier. The company's positive outlook comes as vaccination rollout gathers pace and more people return to work and begin to lead regular, normal lives. 
Wedbush Tuesday raised the price target on Lyft to $85 from $72 on better profitability and more revenue per rider in the future, according to StreetInsider. That’s a 29% appreciation from the stock’s prevailing levels.

Investing.com – A revenue miss in the February quarter, caused due to supply chain challenges, sent  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) shares down 2.5% down in Friday’s premarket trading.
The shoe and apparel maker’s revenues for the third quarter rose 3% to $10.4 billion, a miss of more than 5% from the consensus estimate of $11.02 billion, as per TipRanks. The company blamed this on supply chain challenges, including global container shortages and U.S. port congestion, affecting the flow of inventory and timing of wholesale shipments. 
The shortage of containers and port congestion was particularly felt on North American operations, where revenues declined 11%.  
In markets across Europe, Middle East and Africa, more than a third of the company’s stores are still shut, Nike said. That may stay the case in Europe in particular, where France and Germany are both experiencing a fresh and increasingly sharp rise in Covid-19 cases.
It wasn’t all bad as the company said it is now more confident in its full-year outlook for revenue and expects “low to mid-teens growth versus the prior year”. The company also expects gross margin expansion up to 75 basis points for the full year. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.
Nike Direct, its direct-to-consumer initiative, also showed healthy growth. It rose 15% on a currency-neutral basis, led by Nike Digital growth of more than 50%. For the first time, online revenues from North American operations topped $1 billion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - In January, just weeks after  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) permanently banned former President Donald Trump following the storming of the U.S. Capitol, the social media company started asking U.S. users to help identify and fact-check misleading tweets in a new pilot program.
But Birdwatch, which has about 2,000 participants and is currently cordoned off in its own section of the site, is already facing many of the same challenges as Twitter itself -discerning facts from partisan opinion and dealing with the potential for harassment or people trying to manipulate the system.
""There's a lot to do to get there, to the point where we're comfortable putting these things on tweets,"" Keith Coleman, Twitter's vice president of product, told Reuters.
""Birdwatchers"" can flag misleading tweets and annotate them with ""notes"" to give more information, which other participants can rate as helpful.
Under pressure to clean up its site, Twitter started labeling misleading tweets for the first time last year, a move that intensified debates about the role major social media platforms play in public discourse. It also fueled allegations from Republican lawmakers that tech companies are censoring conservatives.
In asking users to contribute their own checks, Twitter will have to balance curating Birdwatch to make it useful without losing the legitimacy it wanted from relying on its community. 
Public Birdwatch data shows notes ranging from balanced fact-checks to partisan criticism. For example, some marked the baseless claim of widespread voter fraud in November's U.S. presidential election ""not misleading."" Many simply gave opinions - a tweet from SpaceX and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk should ""go to Mars. And stay there"" - while others added notes to opinions. 
People are ""fact-checking things that professional fact checkers never would,"" said Alex Mahadevan, a reporter with the Poynter Institute's MediaWise project, who analyzed Birdwatch's data.
Coleman said the Twitter team's next move would be updating the rating algorithm that determines which notes to highlight to make sure Birdwatchers with different views agree the information is helpful.
""It's totally fine that there's a mixture of quality on the input; what will matter is the quality of the output,"" he said. 
WISDOM OF CROWDS
Crowd-sourced knowledge and community moderation are not new models: they underpin platforms like social network Reddit Inc, and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) also runs a ""community review"" program in which users are paid to identify suspect content for vetting by professional fact-checkers.  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Corp-owned Reuters is one of Facebook's paid third-party fact-checkers.
One of the most prominent examples of a crowd-based approach is Wikipedia, where volunteers write and edit millions of articles.
Katherine Maher, CEO of the Wikimedia Foundation that runs Wikipedia, said in an interview that the community's mission to build an encyclopedia - making it what she called a ""purpose platform"" rather than ""an expression platform"" - defines how contributors behave and that Twitter, which has a more diffuse purpose, could be more difficult to wrangle. 
Borrowing methods from how Wikipedia promotes and rewards credible contributions could help, Maher said. Public editors on Wikipedia are granted greater controls by other users, based on their work. 
Twitter's Coleman said the company was working on how to build reputational scores for Birdwatchers, based on whether a range of people find their contributions helpful.
Maher also said Twitter would need to develop standards and their enforcement for Birdwatch and decide how people could appeal annotation. It needs to solve the issue, she said, of ""Who watches the watchers?""
BIRDWATCHERS 
Travis Whitfill, a healthcare researcher and biopharma venture capitalist in Dallas, Texas, said he joined the Birdwatch program as a way to correct medical and COVID-19 misinformation. 
Wesley Miller, a 47-year-old research analyst, joined the pilot after briefly quitting Twitter last year in protest at the company's lack of action against Trump. 
Jeffery Johnson, a 19-year-old conservative college freshman in Bentonville, Arkansas, said he joined partly as a joke but liked the idea of users rather than Twitter deciding on the truth.
Researchers said it was hard to tell if the program would attract mission-driven volunteers, zealots with agendas or bad actors in the future if it rolls out more broadly.
To help guide Birdwatch's development, Twitter said it is creating an advisory council of outside experts with backgrounds ranging from crowdsourcing to political science. 
The company has also acknowledged it will have to work out how to prevent its unpaid Birdwatchers from being harassed for their notes.
Coleman said it was considering options like removing people's Twitter handles from their annotations and working out whether there would be extra rules for Birdwatch content. Contributors also will be allowed to use pseudonym accounts to protect their identities.

""We don't know what will happen and whether people will feel safe,"" said Coleman. ""It's really critical they do.""

730,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 07:08AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Higher; Yields Back Off From Year Highs,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Friday, rebounding from Thursday’s selloff as bond yields retreat from their recent highs.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 60 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 12 points, or 0.3%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 67 points, or 0.5%.
There may be more volatility in the markets Friday, as stock options, stock futures, market index futures and market index options are all set to expire, something known as quadruple witching.
Friday’s gains come after Wall Street struggled Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing 0.5% lower and the S&P 500 dropping 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperformed, slumping 3% after a spike in U.S. bond yields stoked concerns about paying for higher-valued stocks.    
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields climbed as high as 1.75% on Thursday, their loftiest level since January 2020, but have slipped back below 1.7% Friday.
Bond markets have experienced sharp moves this week, prompting moves in equities, as the U.S. Federal Reserve said it expected higher economic growth and inflation in the United States this year, although it repeated its pledge to keep its target interest rate near zero.
Also of interest Friday will be the ongoing talks between the U.S. and China in Alaska, the first such get together since President Joe Biden took office. These started badly on Thursday, with heated exchanges between the two sides. 
In the corporate sector, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) stocks are higher premarket after the delivery company reported strong quarterly results, while  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) stocks fell are disappointing guidance from the world’s biggest shoe manufacturer.
Energy stocks are also likely to be in focus given volatile trading in the underlying crude prices. Oil prices pushed higher Friday, but they are still more than 7% lower over the course of the week, on course for the biggest weekly loss since October.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) sees this oil price pullback as a buying opportunity and forecasts Brent crude reaching $80 per barrel this summer even as the recent rally in prices “takes a big breather.”
U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $60.50 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.5% to $63.66.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,736.65/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1896."

Investors poured about $36.46 billion into equity funds in the week, the biggest inflow in five weeks, Refinitiv Lipper data showed.

MSCI's benchmark for global equity markets climbed 1% this week but reversed track on Friday, pressured by a surge in U.S. bond yields. 
Among equity funds, technology funds received inflows of $2.19 billion in the week to March 17 after an outflow of $524 million the previous week, with investors scooping up heavily battered tech stocks at cheaper valuations.
Global recovery hopes also lured inflows for cyclicals such as industrials, banks and miners. 
On the other hand, lower oil prices affected the energy sector, which showed an inflow of $184.9 million, down more than 60% from the previous week.

However, alternative energy funds that primarily invest in solar, wind and water companies registered inflows of $1.4 billion, the highest in seven weeks.
Global bond funds, meanwhile, achieved inflows of $8.7 billion, mainly owing to net purchases in shorter-term bonds and inflation-linked bonds. 
Global corporate bonds suffered an outflow of $960 million in the week, the fourth in as many weeks.

In commodities, precious metal funds registered net sales of $765 billion for a sixth consecutive weekly outflow. 
An analysis of 23,757 emerging market funds showed equity funds attracted $4.73 billion in inflows, the biggest in seven weeks, while bond funds achieved inflows of $312 million.

733,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 06:40AM ET</span>",FTSE Russell nudges China toward further market opening,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - FTSE Russell is in active talks with Chinese regulators about reform measures that could help increase the weighting of Chinese onshore shares in its global indexes, a senior executive told Reuters.
The index provider will add eligible companies listed on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market to its global equity benchmarks for the first time on Monday, having included over 1,000 China-listed stocks, or A shares, since June, 2019.
Only 25% of Chinese stocks' investable market cap is currently added to FTSE's global indexes, meaning Chinese companies are underrepresented in the benchmarks.
Du Wanming, FTSE Russell's director of Index Policy for the Asia-Pacific, said the index provider aims to increase that gradually to 100%, but that would require complicated reforms.
""We're actively seeking market feedback and also talking to the regulators"" on such policy changes, said Du at FTSE Russell, owned by the  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG). 
China has been taking bold steps to open its capital markets to foreign investors in recent years. But the latest push comes as Beijing is increasingly worried about contagion from financial risks in global markets.
Du said short- and medium-term goals include broadening the China-Hong Kong Stock Connect schemes -- a popular channel for foreigners to invest in Chinese stocks -- to include all A shares and aligning trading holidays. Eligibility for the scheme is a prerequisite for a stock to be included in the FTSE's global indexes.
""The regulators and the exchange are actively working on the trading holiday alignment,"" Du said, adding it would involve keeping northbound trading under Stock Connect open when the Chinese markets are operating but Hong Kong is shut for holidays.
She said the index provider also hopes to see China relax its 30% cap on foreign ownership of China A shares, which would naturally increase China's weighing in the FTSE indices.
Du brushed aside concerns that Beijing will backtrack from capital markets deregulation amid heightened market volatility.
Top banking regulator Guo Shuqing said in March the government was ""very worried"" about a potential bubble bursting in foreign markets and was studying ways to manage capital inflows.
""I think they are still very committed to opening the market and surely they (will) do it with caution,"" Du said.
The addition of STAR companies into FTSE's global indexes also comes amid a savage global tech share sell-off but Du said market sentiment had little bearing on inclusion decisions. 
Among the stocks to be added to the FTSE's global indexes on Monday, 10 STAR companies will be included in the FTSE Global Equity Index Series (GEIS). 

""The (STAR) market is of a significant size. You can't ignore it,"" Du said. ""It's what the investors want. They would like the index to represent the market.""

734,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 06:40AM ET</span>","Wall Street Week Ahead: Investors got the stimulus boost, but now face tax worries","By Lewis Krauskopf and Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are turning their attention to prospects that higher taxes could threaten the rally in U.S. stocks as President Joe Biden's administration moves forward with its agenda and seeks ways to pay for its spending plans.
In recent days, investors have focused on a rise in bond yields that has pressured share prices, though indexes remain close to their record highs.
Nevertheless, some worry that at least a partial rollback of the corporate tax cuts that fueled stock gains during the Trump era could eventually drag on equities, whose valuations have already grown rich by some measures. 
""It is an issue,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU). ""It's going to be talked about as it becomes a reality. But the market's focus right now is clearly on getting to the other side of this pandemic.""
The S&P 500 has gained more than 4% this year, with Biden's newly passed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan providing the latest fuel for the economy and the stock market. The pace of the economic recovery and COVID-19 vaccinations will remain in investors' focus next week, along with the rise in U.S. bond yields that has pressured tech and growth shares and further supported bank and other value stocks.
During his presidential campaign, Biden pledged to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, a proposal supported by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Investment strategists anticipate fierce opposition from Republican lawmakers to any such plan. 
While Biden's administration is working closely with members of Congress on how to fund an ambitious infrastructure package, plans have not been finalized, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday.
An increase in corporate taxes could bite into company profits, which are expected to soar this year as business rebounds from the pandemic. 
A corporate tax rate rising from 21% to 25% could shave overall S&P 500 company earnings by between 4% to 5%, while an increase to 28% could cut them by 6% to 7%, according to Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at Citi.
“In theory, if you bought the market in anticipation of better earnings as a result of stimulus, you might lose that benefit from higher tax rates,” he said.
The S&P 500 overall had a 17.54% tax rate as of the third quarter, with real estate having the lowest rate among S&P sectors at 8.06%. Technology, the biggest sector by market value, had a 14.76% rate, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
Graphic: S&P 500 and sector tax rates: 2017 vs 2020 - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/WEEKAHEAD/xegpbgjjavq/chart.png
A move to raise corporate taxes would follow former President Donald Trump's drive to cut the rate from 35% to 21%.
""We saw stocks move significantly higher, we saw earnings move significantly higher in the Trump Administration,"" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. ""Are we going to give some of those gains back if we get a new tax bill? Yeah that’s quite possible, even likely.""
The potential of higher taxes on wealthy Americans is also drawing investor attention. In a LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) post on Monday, Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, said a wealth tax proposed by Senator Elizabeth Warren ""will most likely lead to more capital outflows and other moves to evade these taxes."" 
Warren earlier this month announced a bill she said would include a 3% tax overall on the net worth of those above $1 billion. White House Press Secretary Psaki, however, said this week that Biden's tax plans differ from Warren's. 
Investors may be hesitant to price in risks before knowing the plan's details, as well of the chances of it passing.
Some doubted that Biden would try to push through higher taxes while the economy recovers, or that he will have the same ease in passing tax increases as he did with his stimulus bill, given the slim majority his Democratic party holds in Congress.
Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), said the chances of tax increases coming this year could rise if the economy shows particular strength.

""The market in 6-to-8 months from now is going to start getting more concerned about that,"" Golub said.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. bond yields on Friday edged off the 14-month highs reached the day before as markets looked to a U.S. economic recovery, while oil stabilised after a 7% slide.
Bond markets have experienced sharp moves this week as the U.S. Federal Reserve said it expected higher economic growth and inflation in the United States this year, although it repeated its pledge to keep its target interest rate near zero.
Yields on U.S. 10-year notes, which move inversely to price and have been rising for the past seven weeks on growth expectations, spiked to their highest since January 2020 at 1.754% on Thursday. They were last at 1.6838%.
German long-dated government bond yields slipped in tandem with U.S. yields.
""Every man and his dog is looking at bond yields,"" said Giles Coghlan, chief currency analyst at HYCM. ""Even though (Fed chair Jerome) Powell was dovish, bond yields marched higher, purely on anticipation that the Fed is behind the curve - the market is pricing rate hikes in.""
MSCI world stocks fell 0.21% from one-month highs in the previous session, though Nasdaq futures rose 0.8% and S&P 500 futures gained 0.4%. 
Oil and U.S. stocks were hit on Thursday by worries over faltering vaccine roll-outs and further slowdowns in Europe, after France imposed a one-month lockdown in Paris and parts of the north.
French stocks fell 0.5%. UK stocks fell 0.7% as energy stocks dropped.
After falling 7% on Thursday, Brent crude futures bounced 82 cents to $64.09 a barrel. U.S. crude rose 88 cents to $60.88. 
Oil's retreat wiped out four weeks of gains in a single session amid worries world demand would fall short of high expectations.
The jump in Treasury yields has provided some support to the U.S. dollar.
""The majority of market participants considers the Fed’s cautious approach to be justified and assumes that this supports the economic recovery,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analysts said in a note. 
""That improves the longer-term economic outlook and therefore justifies higher interest rates long-term as well as a stronger dollar.""
The dollar was little changed on Friday, however, easing 0.1% to 91.735 against a basket of currencies and holding steady against the euro at $1.1922. It dipped 0.2% on the low-yielding yen at 108.63.
Markets were also unsettled by the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) decision to slightly widen the target band for 10-year yields and tweak its buying of assets. 
The bank portrayed the changes as a ""nimble"" way to make easing more sustainable, though investors seemed to take it as a step back from all-out stimulus. A decision to confine purchases to only TOPIX-linked ETFs knocked the Nikkei down 1.6%.
South Korea lost 1%. Chinese blue chips shed 1.9%, perhaps unnerved by a fiery exchange between Chinese and U.S. diplomats at the first in-person talks of the Biden era.

The rise in bond yields has weighed on gold, which offers no fixed return, and left it down 0.4% at $1,743 an ounce.

""Nonetheless, in the summer we expect that many countries will be in a position to lift some of the restrictions and we expect that this is going to be the kick off of a sharp economic reacceleration in Europe.""
European stocks were on track for a 0.4% weekly gain as a rally in automakers and signs that the U.S. Federal Reserve will maintain low interest rates despite an expected surge in economic growth outweighed concerns about rising yields.

U.S. equity funds sucked in $53 billion as ultra-easy monetary policy continued to boost risk appetite. 
BofA warned of tightening global financial conditions, however, with eight interest rate hikes across the world so far this year versus five cuts.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve pledged to look past inflation and keep interest rates near 0% until at least 2024. Still, the yields on 10-year notes spiked on Thursday to 1.75%.
That move sparked a massive sell-off on Wall Street with the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 slumping 3.1%, wiping off more than $400 billion from company valuations in a single session.
BofA said the ""uber-dovish Fed backfired"" with bond vigilantes moving quickly to try to bully the central bank into yield curve control - pinning down yields on bonds of a particular maturity.
Global equity funds have attracted $347 billion so far this year, matching record inflows seen for 2017 as a whole. On an annualised basis, this year's inflows are a ""breathtaking"" $1.6 trillion, BofA said.
""We are in (the) midst of (the) strongest macro data of our lives,"" BofA investment strategist Michael Hartnett wrote in a note to clients.
But some cracks have started to appear. He said the Spring vaccine shortage in Europe and emerging markets means any disorderly bond yield rise could be negative for second quarter economic growth.

The potential sale of the building, first reported by the Financial Times, could boost the airline's finances which have been hammered by COVID-19. The building was completed in 1998 at a cost of 200 million pounds ($279 million).
The shift to homeworking over the last year has already prompted some of Britain's biggest companies to make changes to their office footprints. Banking giant Lloyds (LON:LLOY) said it would cut office space by 20% within three years, with HSBC aiming for a 40% reduction.
The BA complex, Waterside, is near Heathrow Airport, west of London, and is also the headquarters of British Airways parent company, IAG (LON:ICAG). 
British Airways said in a statement that many employees enjoyed working from home and its future policy would likely be a flexible mix of home and office working. 
""We've re-structured our business to emerge from the crisis and are considering whether we still have the need for such a large headquarters building,"" a spokesman said in a statement. 
To survive the pandemic, British Airways has spent the last year cutting costs, including shedding over 10,000 employees, leaving it with about 30,000, most of whom don't work in the office but are pilots, cabin crew, engineers or airport staff. 
The airline has also sought to raise cash by selling famous works of art that formerly hung in its executive lounges.

Waterside's long-term future was already hanging in the balance as it would need to be demolished if the proposed expansion of Heathrow goes ahead.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Friday, as a rise in Covid-19 cases and associated lockdowns weighed on recovery hopes.
At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% lower, the CAC 40 in France dropped 0.6% and the U.K.'s FTSE index fell 0.6%.
The growth outlook in Europe is weakening as a third wave of Covid-19 infections leads to further mobility restrictions, further delaying the economic recovery. 
Germany, the largest EU country in terms of population, recorded Thursday the biggest daily rise in confirmed coronavirus cases since Jan. 22. In addition, France said it would put eight regions, including the Ile de France region around Paris, back into a tighter form of lockdown for a month to stop the disease's spread, while much of Italy is already shut down.
The EU drugs regulator did confirm Thursday that the benefits of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine outweighed the risks, but the earlier suspension of the use of this drug by a number of European countries has been another factor slowing what is already a sluggish vaccination rollout across the EU.
Adding to Friday’s woes was a negative handover from Wall Street, after the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index closed 3% lower Thursday with a spike in U.S. bond yields prompting investors to sell these stocks with very high valuations. 
The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes stood at 1.69% Friday, after spiking late Thursday to 1.75%, the highest since early 2020, a day after the Federal Reserve raised its growth and inflation forecasts but stated it would maintain its very accommodative monetary policies through 2023.

742,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 03:40AM ET</span>","Greensill creditors, led by Softbank, make $1.4 billion in claims to Australia parent","By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Thirty-four creditors of Greensill Capital Pty, the Australian parent of the collapsed British supply chain financier, submitted over A$1.75 billion ($1.35 billion) in claims to the company, administrators said on Friday.
About $1.15 billion of that was made by Japan's Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters. The source declined to be identified as the person was not permitted to speak publicly. Softbank representatives didn't immediately return a request for comment. 
Grant Thornton, administrator to the Australian parent and its operating companies in the United Kingdom, also said the parent held claims of under $800 million against Greensill UK.
Greensill's Australian parent provided administration and head office support to the London-based group that collapsed earlier this month after losing insurance coverage for its debt repackaging business, but operates ""only in a limited capacity"", they said.
They had also been put on notice by the Association of German Banks about a contingent liability of close to 2 billion euros ($2.38 billion) to the Australian parent, Grant Thornton said in an emailed statement. 
""This claim does not appear in the company's accounts and has not been formally verified by the administrators,"" the statement said. 
A German court on Tuesday opened insolvency proceedings for Greensill Bank, owned by Greensill Capital, which was largely funded by depositors, whose deposits are protected by the bank's membership in the deposit protection fund of the Federal Association of German Banks.
German financial regulator BaFin had locked down the obscure Bremen-based lender over concerns its debt would become unmanageable and also questioned some of its accounts.
Back in Australia, Grant Thornton said the claims submitted so far had not yet been verified and excluded claims of employees of the Australian company, 35 of whom had been made redundant.
A creditors committee was appointed on Friday, including includes representatives of SoftBank,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), another unnamed creditor, and a representative of employees. SoftBank is a ""significant"" creditor of the parent, and Credit Suisse holds security over some of its assets, according to a March 11 regulatory document. 
Switzerland's second-biggest bank and its asset management arm are reeling from the implosion of around $10 billion of funds related to Greensill. It is also trying to recoup a $90 million outstanding bridge loan it made to the company last year.
Also present at the virtual Friday meeting were the Australian Taxation Office, Australia's corporate regulator, the Attorney General's department and the Association of German banks. Grant Thornton said it would provide a report to creditors in about three weeks and a second meeting of creditors would be held on April 22, where they would vote on whether to liquidate the company or accept a restructuring proposal. ""The administrators confirmed to creditors that, at this stage, they had not received a Deed of Company Arrangement proposal for consideration,"" the statement said.

744,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 19, 2021 03:27AM ET</span>",EU Seeks to Reset Vaccine Campaign After Reversing Astra Ban,"(Bloomberg) -- The European Union has a chance to put its Covid-19 inoculation push back on track after a chaotic week of vaccine suspensions, health scares and export-ban threats that sacrificed precious time.
Armed with an all-clear for AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc’s vaccine from EU regulators, European leaders must get a grip on a vaccine drive that’s lagging the U.S. and the U.K. and potentially delaying an economic recovery. The rising pace of cases and a renewed four-week lockdown in parts of France underscore the urgency of the threat.
EU governments including Germany, France and Italy said Thursday they’ll immediately resume administering the Astra shot, which several EU countries suspended after reports of blood clots in some patients.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Health Minister Jens Spahn will hold talks with regional leaders later on Friday as they try to speed the country’s sluggish vaccination drive. On Monday, they convene again to decide on the next steps in the country’s lockdown strategy, with rising Covid-19 cases suggesting there’s little room for further easing.
The announcement on Astra by the EU’s drug regulator capped a tumultuous few days that featured an agonizing back-and-forth over vaccine safety and a threat by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to withhold vaccine exports to the U.K., reopening a clash with the former EU member country.
“If it was me, I would be vaccinated tomorrow,” European Medicines Agency Executive Director Emer Cooke said Thursday, confirming the conclusion that the Astra shot is safe. While the agency said blood-clot cases are extremely rare and not deemed to be related to the vaccine, its experts couldn’t “definitively” rule out a link.
Europe can ill afford uncertainty about vaccine efficacy. The continent’s Covid-19 infection rate has increased for the past three weeks, to an average of 381 per 100,000 people, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
If inoculations don’t speed up, the EU will need an estimated 16 months to cover 75% of the population with a two-dose vaccine, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. That compares with five months for the U.S. and the U.K.
“I have great confidence that the goal to vaccinate 70% of the adult population before the end of the summer will be reached,” von Der Leyen told Spanish newspaper El Mundo in an interview published Friday.
After the EMA announcement, France said it will quickly resume vaccinations with the AstraZeneca shot. Prime Minister Jean Castex pledged to get the vaccine on Friday to help restore public confidence.
Germany’s Spahn said the decision “confirms the safety and reliability of the AstraZeneca vaccine.” Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said his government is committed to “the greatest number of vaccinations in the shortest time possible.”
Other EU countries, including Luxembourg and Slovenia, will resume dispensing the vaccine and more are expected to follow. However, in Scandinavia, the EMA’s assurances weren’t enough to persuade national health authorities to immediately resume vaccinations. Instead, Sweden, Norway and Denmark said they will await the conclusions of their own reviews. All three countries say they expect to reach a decision next week.
Elsewhere around the world, Indonesia lifted a suspension on the Astra shot Friday and plans to start distributing it next week. Thailand began its rollout this week after a panel of medical experts decided the shot is safe and didn’t lead to blood clots.
In Britain, where there have been few concerns about the vaccine’s safety, Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the Astra shot safe and said he would get one on Friday. “The thing that isn’t safe is catching Covid,” he said.
Johnson brushed off an increasingly fraught relationship with the EU at a news conference in London. Amid tension over the race to secure vaccine supplies, Johnson and von der Leyen spoke by phone on Wednesday, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Hours earlier, the EU Commission head had threatened to withhold vaccine exports to the U.K. and mooted pulling the EU’s emergency trigger, used only once in its history, to allow authorities to seize control of production and distribution.
Use Them
The EMA’s caveat on the clotting issue could prolong uncertainty that has surrounded the AstraZeneca since the trial phase, when a dosing mistake and different intervals between the two shots created confusion.
A lack of data on its effectiveness in the elderly, which prompted many European countries initially to limit its use to younger people, compounded the doubts.
Asked if governments should restart vaccinations with the two-dose Astra shot, the EMA’s Cooke sought to provide clear guidance.
“This pandemic is costing lives,” she said. “We have vaccines that are safe and effective, that can help prevent death and hospitalization. We need to use those vaccines.”

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening largely lower Friday, following a sharp selloff in the tech sector on Wall Street while investors also fret about the increase in Covid-19 cases throughout the region.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, but CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.8% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 1.6%.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index closed 3% lower on Wall Street Thursday after a spike in U.S. bond yields on the back of the Federal Reserve’s dovish message prompted worries about owning these extremely highly-valued stocks that are likely to take a long time to generate meaningful amounts of cash. 
The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes stood at 1.7% Friday, after spiking late Thursday to 1.75%, the highest since early 2020, a day after the Federal Reserve raised its growth and inflation forecasts but stated it would maintain its very accommodative monetary policies through 2023.
The growth outlook looks different in Europe, as a third wave of Covid-19 infections threatens further lockdowns, further delaying the economic recovery.
Germany, the largest EU country in terms of population, recorded Thursday the biggest daily rise in confirmed coronavirus cases since Jan. 22. In addition, France said it would put eight regions, including the Ile de France region around Paris, back into a tighter form of lockdown for a month to stop the disease's spread.
There was some good news on that front Thursday, with the EU drugs regulator confirming that the benefits of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine outweighed the risks. But the earlier suspension of the use of this drug by a number of European countries has been another factor slowing what is already a sluggish vaccination rollout across the EU
In the corporate sector, along with the tech sector, the heavily-weighted oil stocks are set to drag the overall market lower after crude prices weakened Friday, continuing the recent sharp selloff amid worries over the slow growth to global demand.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% lower at $59.69 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.5% to $62.97. Both contracts are falling for the sixth day in a row and have dropped more than 8% each this week, on course for the biggest weekly loss since October.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down Friday morning, ending the week in the red as investors remain concerned about the U.S. Federal Reserve’s dovish stance on inflation.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.97% by 11:01 PM ET (3:01 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component slid 1.70%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.69%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.99% and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 1.03%. In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.47%.
The Fed’s stance, as it handed down its policy decision on Wednesday, steadied U.S. Treasury yields after the ten-year benchmark climbed to 1.75% for the first time since January 2020. It has also driven bets on faster inflation and sent market expectations of price pressures to highs not seen in several years.
The Bank of Japan handed down its policy decision earlier in the day, amid speculation that the central bank could adjust the bond-yield target range and asset purchases. The Bank of England also kept its March interest rate unchanged at 0.10% on Thursday.
“Economic recovery is on its way and we have central banks around the world very committed to easy monetary policy,” Tribeca Investment Partners portfolio manager Jun Bei Liu told Bloomberg.
Liu also sees value stocks benefiting in the recovery, adding that “all of that together will indicate this is just short-term profit-taking and the underlying fundamentals of the equity market are looking very strong.”
Investors also braced for quadruple witching, with derivatives of stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single stock futures expiring simultaneously and potentially exacerbating swings in asset prices, on Friday.
Also on investors’ radars was Thursday’s face-to-face, high-level talks between the U.S. and China, the first to take place since President Joe Biden took office in January. The talks, taking place in Anchorage, descended into bickering and recriminations over human rights, trade, and international alliances, illustrating that tensions continue to persist in the U.S.-China relationship even after the change in U.S. leadership.
Meanwhile, Europe's COVID-19 vaccination program continues its struggle to gain traction. Adding to doubts about the speed of Europe’s economic recovery from COVID-19, some countries in the region are facing a third wave of COVID-19 cases. One of them is France, which announced a fresh lockdown in Paris and other parts of the country.
However, the European Medicines Agency (EMA)’s endorsement of the AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN)/University of Oxford COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday could see the program get back on track. Some of the countries that suspended usage of the vaccine over concerns about potential side effects, including Germany and France, planned to resume using the vaccine after the EMA’s endorsement."
747,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 10:15PM ET</span>",Analysis: New Boeing 787 inspections signal tougher FAA oversight,"By Eric M. Johnson and David Shepardson
SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Federal Aviation Administration decision to bring in-house final checks on four Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 787 jets is the latest signal of the agency's tougher scrutiny of the embattled U.S. airplane manufacturer.
The FAA said late Wednesday it was taking ""a number of corrective actions"" to address multiple production issues on the advanced carbon-composite twin-aisle aircraft. These include structural integrity flaws and potential safety hazards, it said in an email to Reuters.
""One of the actions is retaining the authority to issue (Airworthiness Certificates) for four specific aircraft,"" it said. ""We can extend the AC retention to other aircraft if we see the need.""
The FAA told Boeing of its decision in a January letter reviewed by Reuters.
The move comes as the planemaker has faced tougher scrutiny in the wake of two crashes involving its 737 MAX jet that killed 346 people, triggering a 20-month safety ban that U.S. regulators lifted last November. 
A September U.S. House report into the two crashes faulted ""grossly insufficient oversight by the FAA.""
""With all the accusations of an overly-close relationship between (the FAA) and Boeing, they're eager to emphasize that they're deploying more resources for inspections, exercising more authority, and scrutinizing work more closely,"" said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with Teal Group.
""We'll likely see more actions like this.""
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said last month the agency was holding Boeing accountable and added he ""reiterated to Boeing's leadership time and again that the company must prioritize safety and regulatory compliance, and that the FAA will always put safety first in all its decisions.""
For most aircraft deliveries, Boeing employees officially designated to act on behalf of the FAA conduct final airworthiness checks before a jet is handed over to an airline.
But over the past several years FAA inspectors themselves have taken over that work on a small number of aircraft as part of its oversight.
The FAA said its latest decision not to outsource the four new checks on the 787s was different from those more routine checks.
""If the FAA is increasing oversight, that says they have been exposed to things that should not have happened,"" said Peter Lemme, a former Boeing engineer and consultant.
""Boeing is at one strike for sure and maybe two strikes down. If they find something now, it would be infinitely worse.""
Boeing said Thursday it was ""encouraged by the progress our team is making on returning to delivery activities for the 787 program. We have engaged the FAA throughout this effort.""
Last month, the planemaker agreed to pay $6.6 million to the FAA as part of a settlement over quality and safety-oversight lapses going back years.
The fine stemmed from a 2015 FAA settlement from Boeing, including a $12 million fine, to resolve multiple pending and potential enforcement cases.
Boeing is also working through forensic inspections and painstaking repairs to fix defects embedded in more than 80 parked 787s that have halted deliveries for months.
The inspections and retrofits could take up to a month per plane and are likely to cost hundreds of millions - if not billions - of dollars, although the final bill depends on how many planes in service and undelivered have issues, an industry source said. 
Boeing remains on course to resume deliveries of a number of 787s this month, a second source said.

In January, Boeing took a $6.5 billion charge on its forthcoming 777X mini-jumbo, as the cost of tighter regulation and sagging long-haul demand hit its next flagship development. [PL4N2K232P]

748,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 09:46PM ET</span>","Ford partly assembling some vehicles, idling two plants due to chip shortage","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Thursday it will for now assemble its flagship, highly profitable F-150 pickup trucks and Edge SUVs in North America without certain parts and idle two assembly plants due to the global semiconductor chip shortage.
The U.S. automaker said the chip shortage, combined with the shortage of a part caused by the central U.S. winter storm, is prompting it to build the vehicles and then hold them ""for a number of weeks"" until they can be completed and shipped. The affected vehicles number in the ""thousands,"" a spokeswoman said.
Ford said it is also idling production at plants in Louisville, Kentucky, and Cologne, Germany.
The costs associated with these actions are covered in the Dearborn, Michigan-based company's previous forecast that profits this year could be hit by $1 billion to $2.5 billion due to the chip shortage. 
The shortage, which has hit automakers globally, stems from a confluence of factors. Car makers shut plants for two months during the COVID-19 pandemic last year and canceled chip orders. Meanwhile, demand for chips surged from the consumer electronics industry as people worked from home and played video games. Now car makers must compete for chips. 
Last month, Ford cut shifts at two plants that build the full-size F-150 trucks, a move that followed production cuts of other vehicles. Ford, like other automakers, has said it will prioritize and allocate chips to its highest-margin vehicles when it can. 
Also on Thursday, Japan's Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co said the chip shortage has led it to cut production at its plants in Smyrna, Tennessee, Canton, Mississippi, and Aguascalientes, Mexico. It did not disclose how much volume would be lost for the action. 
On Monday, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said it was building some light-duty full-size pickups without a fuel management module, shaving a mile per gallon from fuel economy. GM previously said the chip shortage could cut up to $2 billion from this year's profits.
The Ford trucks and SUVs being assembled without certain parts include some electronic modules, Ford said. It did not identify suppliers of the affected parts, but a spokeswoman said the parts needed for the F-150 and Edge vehicles are tied to basic functions, such as windshield wiper motors and infotainment systems.
Ford is canceling the late shift on Thursday and both shifts on Friday at its Louisville Assembly Plant, which builds the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair SUVs. Production is expected to resume on short shifts on Monday and full production the following day.

In Cologne, where the Fiesta (NASDAQ:FRGI) car is built, the plant is being idled March 1-16 and March 22. The company did not say what volume was being lost due to that action.

750,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 09:15PM ET</span>",U.S. corporate reformers face more fights to get proxy votes,"By Ross Kerber and Jody Godoy
BOSTON / NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. corporations are fighting harder this year to keep activist shareholder proposals off the ballot at their annual meetings, partly because of a proliferation of investor demands for racial justice reforms.
The trend shows the high stakes for the acting head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Allison Herren Lee, who in a pair of speeches this week outlined reviews of the shareholder proposal process and voting disclosures.
Last year, Trump administration appointees on the SEC raised the bar for shareholders to bring matters to a vote, even as investors poured money into the hands of fund managers using sustainability criteria to pick stocks and often backing resolutions on environmental, social or corporate governance issues.
At the same time 2020's Black Lives Matter protests catalyzed a new wave of investor proposals focused on issues like diverse workforces and better working conditions for employees whose jobs put them at risk during the pandemic. Companies have asked to skip many of those votes. ""While companies talk a good game on this, the proponents are pressing them for substance, and it's a really touchy subject,"" said Heidi Welsh, executive director of the Sustainable Investments Institute, which tracks the area.
This year companies have asked the SEC for permission to skip votes on 33% of the 437 shareholder resolutions at their annual meetings as of Monday, up from 27% last year and 26% in 2017, according to a review by Welsh for Reuters News.
Companies commonly seek SEC permission to skip votes and manage to do so about half the time, arguing for instance that proposals deal with ordinary business or have already been implemented. Even when reform proposals make the proxy ballot, management usually recommends investors vote ""no.""
This week, Lee said the SEC will review rules on proxy voting and perhaps change how companies ask to skip votes. The SEC could revise guidance on when resolutions on significant policy issues eclipse ordinary business concerns, attorneys said. Some companies have signaled receptivity to striking deals with proponents at least on climate-related subjects. But companies have also moved to block votes, especially on the new resolutions. 
This season  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and others sought to exclude shareholder proposals calling for ""racial equity” audits of the impact of their business on nonwhite stakeholders and communities of color. 
Citigroup argued it had already ""substantially implemented"" internal and external initiatives promoting racial equity in finance. The SEC rejected that argument, and the proposal is going before shareholders next month.
In its March 17 proxy statement, Citi urged shareholders to vote no, saying it has ""clearly demonstrated"" initiatives to address racial inequity. A spokeswoman said it has committed over $1 billion to efforts like expanding access to credit.
In another case, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) argued to the SEC it should be allowed to skip a resolution filed by New York City pension leaders calling for it to review its efforts “to reduce or mitigate health and safety risks from the coronavirus pandemic” that affect its workforce. 
Amazon told the SEC it already has published details of its response and that it has ""growing confidence that our employees are safe at work,” and awaits a decision from the agency. A spokesperson cited other details in the request including that it spent over $10 billion on Covid-related efforts last year to keep employees safe and to get products to customers. 
Activists hope Lee’s efforts will make it easier to file proposals, and that the SEC staff under Democratic leadership will allow more votes. 

But Lee also said she hopes to “bring greater clarity” and reduce the number of unnecessary submissions. Alston & Bird attorney Dave Brown, who represents corporations, said they would object less if the SEC could “incentivize shareholder proposal proponents to not waste everyone’s time.” (This story refiles to add full name of acting SEC commissioner, Allison Herren Lee in paragraph 2)

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - A lawyer for Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou told a Canadian court on Thursday that border agents who questioned her at the Vancouver airport were ""untruthful"" when they said they handed over Meng's phone passcodes to police by accident.
Border officers also gave ""vastly conflicting versions of key events,"" Meng’s legal team argued as her extradition hearing entered the last phase of arguments leading to a final hearing.
Meng, who was arrested at Vancouver International Airport in
2018 on a U.S. warrant for bank fraud, is accused of misleading
HSBC about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's
business dealings in Iran, causing the bank to break with U.S.
sanctions. 
Meng, 49, and Huawei maintain she is innocent. For more than
two years, she has been fighting extradition to the United States while under house arrest in Vancouver.
Diplomatic relations between China and Canada have soured
over the issue. China detained two Canadians on suspicion of espionage soon after Meng's arrest and they face trial this week and next, ramping up the tension between the two countries.
Defense lawyer Tony Paisana told a British Columbia Supreme Court judge the agents abused their statutory powers, and would not have acted as they did if they were conducting a ""bona fide"" border exam. He asked why the agents took Meng's electronic devices butdid not search them, and why they asked for passcodes when theyknew they would not use them.
Paisana said border officers who testified about accidentally giving passcodes over to police were ""untruthful"" under oath. ""These officers deliberately tried to deceive you,” he told the judge. The evidence suggested that the information was collected for the FBI, Paisana said.
Meng's legal team has demanded her extradition request be denied, arguing that abuses of process took place during her arrest and that her rights were violated.
Canadian prosecutors have said Meng's arrest followedestablished procedures.
Defense attorney Mona Duckett said border officers who testified at Meng's extradition hearings last year gave conflicting versions of important events. She quoted testimony from multiple border agents who were asked what authority allowed them to take phones and passcodes. Although each gave different answers, she said none of the agents could articulate what reasonable grounds they had.
""I say the answer is because there are none,"" she said.
The Canada Border Services Agency was not immediately available for comment.
On Wednesday, Paisana said Royal Canadian Mounted Policeofficers who appeared as witnesses last year provided""less than truthful"" testimony when confronted with allegedabuses of process. 

The RCMP declined to comment. Meng's extradition hearing is expected to wrap up in May, although a decision could be appealed, which would delay the final outcome.

(Reuters) - The popularity of non-fungible tokens (NFT), a type of digital asset that is authenticated by blockchain, is spreading to equities as investors turn their focus to shares of online art trading platforms and companies making NFT-related announcements, sparking outsize swings in their stocks.
Excitement around NFTs has exploded during the pandemic, as enthusiasts spend enormous sums of money on artworks and other items that exist only online, with some selling for tens of millions of dollars. That appears to have fired up interest in companies that may have a connection to the NFT world.
Shares of shipping and logistics company Sino-Global Shipping America (NASDAQ:SINO) Ltd have risen more than 300% this year. The company in recent weeks has said it would accept bitcoin as payment and made other announcements related to cryptocurrencies and blockchain. 
Sino-Global, which has a market capitalization of around $123.4 million, said on Thursday it will launch an exchange for NFTs with e-commerce public chain CyberMiles. Sino-Global shares rose by more than 33% before closing down 0.4% at $8.54.
Shares of pipe maker ZK International Group finished up 0.8% at $8.77 after rising as much as 20% on Thursday. ZK announced earlier in the week that its subsidiary xSigma Corp would develop an NFT marketplace where users could buy and sell NFTs and create custom assets in a few clicks. Its stock is up almost 240% this year.
Investors were also betting that art-related companies would profit from NFT, sending shares of art trading platforms  Takung Art  (K:TKAT) and Oriental Culture Holding gyrating.
Takung U.S. shares closed up 33% at $30.06 after notching big swings. The stock is now up 1,900% year-to-date. 
Oriental Culture's shares rose as much as 60% on Thursday before closing down 4.2%; they have gained 107% year-to-date. 
Outside of the stock market, the trend has brought big profits to some artists and collectors.
Last month, musician and artist Grimes, who is the romantic partner Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk, sold some animations she made on a website called Nifty Gateway for more than $6 million.
Earlier this month, a $70 million digital-only artwork was auctioned by Christie’s to a crypto asset investor who goes by the pseudonym “Metakovan.”
Some investors said the run on NFT-related shares echoes a 2017 rush https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-stocks-cryptocurrency-analysis/cryptocurrency-stocks-holding-gains-despite-bitcoin-pullback-idUSKBN1EG24P into the stocks of companies making blockchain or cryptocurrency announcements, including Long Island Iced Tea Corp, a beverage maker whose shares soared after it said it would rebrand itself Long Blockchain Corp.
Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh, said the interest in companies involved in digital assets is ""largely driven by the people that think they missed bitcoin.""
""Buying the companies offering NFT would be like buying companies that have some sort of dealings with bitcoin in the early days,"" Forrest said.

But the money manager was skeptical about how well NFT would fare in the long run: ""This is the electronic version of a Beanie Baby – remember that craze?""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Thursday charged the co-founders of uBiome Inc, a San Francisco biotechnology startup, with defrauding investors about its ability to expand clinical tests to monitor gut health and obtain reimbursements from insurers.
Zachary Apte and Jessica Richman were accused of raising more than $76 million in two fundraising rounds while misleading investors about uBiome's revenue growth and reimbursement rates, the medical community's lack of acceptance for its tests, and their reliance on a ""captive"" group of doctors for testing.
Apte, 36, and Richman, 46, each face more than 40 criminal counts including healthcare, securities and wire fraud, with maximum penalties totaling several hundred years in prison, the U.S. Department of Justice said. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges.
Lawyers for the defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Thursday's charges follow uBiome's Sept. 2019 bankruptcy filing and subsequent closure. The FBI had raided uBiome's headquarters the previous April.
Founded in 2012, uBiome's business focused on testing microbiomes, located in the gut and elsewhere in the body, through such tests as Gut Explorer, SmartGut and SmartJane.
Customers could buy mail-order kits, collect samples from home, complete surveys, and get results online in a few weeks.
According to prosecutors, many tests were not clinically validated or medically necessary, and the defendants' fraudulent practices included rewarding gift cards to patients who returned samples.
Prosecutors said the fraud ran from late 2015 through early 2019, with Richman trying to stoke press interest by pretending to be younger than she was.
The defendants ""turned a blind eye to compliance and pursued at all costs a path designed to bring the greatest investment in their company,"" Acting U.S. Attorney Stephanie Hinds in San Francisco said.

Hinds' office is also prosecuting Theranos Inc founder Elizabeth Holmes, who has pleaded not guilty to defrauding investors and patients by claiming her startup could conduct a large array of medical tests with a few drops of blood.

756,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 06:36PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. looks to Canada for minerals to build electric vehicles - documents,"By Ernest Scheyder and Jeff Lewis
(Reuters) - The U.S. government is working to help American miners and battery makers expand into Canada, part of a strategy to boost regional production of minerals used to make electric vehicles and counter Chinese competitors.
On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Commerce held a closed-door virtual meeting with miners and battery manufacturers to discuss ways to boost Canadian production of EV materials, according to documents seen by Reuters.
A source who attended the meeting said there was no indication that the Commerce Department would offer financial incentives for new mines or other supply chain components in Canada.
But department officials did stress the need to act now to build a U.S.-Canada EV supply chain, much like Europe has been doing and Asia has already done, according to a second source who attended the meeting. 
The move comes as demand for electrified transportation is set to surge over the next decade.
Conservationists have strongly opposed several large U.S. mining projects, leading officials to look north of the border to Canada and its supply of 13 of the 35 minerals deemed critical for national defense by Washington. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Talon Metals Corp and Livent (NYSE:LTHM) Corp were among the more-than 30 attendees at Thursday's meeting who discussed ways Washington can help U.S. companies expand in Canada and overcome logistical challenges, according to the documents.
The U.S. Department of Commerce did not respond to requests for comment.
The event comes after U.S. President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau committed last month to building an EV supply chain between the two countries.
Since Biden's election, three U.S. mining companies have invested in Canada, where mining accounts for 5% of the country's gross domestic product, versus roughly 0.9% in the United States.
Canada's Fortune Minerals Ltd, which is developing a cobalt mine in the Northwest Territories, has also held funding talks with the U.S. Export/Import Bank, its chief executive told Reuters. 
""The United States is really taking this seriously,"" CEO Robin Goad said. 
Lithium-ion batteries are dangerous to transport over long distances, so automakers prefer to have them built near assembly plants. That should aid efforts by Ontario and Quebec to develop their own battery cell plants with both provinces close to U.S. automakers in Michigan and Ohio, industry executives said. 
""The border between Canada and the U.S. is inconsequential with respect to EVs and EV minerals,"" said Arne Frandsen, CEO of mining investment group Pallinghurst, which is the largest shareholder in Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc, which is building a graphite mine and an anode plant in Quebec.
Pallinghurst joined Livent last November to buy the Nemaska lithium project in Quebec, in what will be North America's largest lithium mine. Both projects are slated to open by 2024 just as automakers launch dozens of new EV models.
""We do see Canada as a natural fit for expansion as the whole battery supply chain is going through a huge self-reckoning about sourcing,"" said Livent CEO Paul Graves. 
Livent has supply deals with BMW and Tesla. 
'51ST STATE'
To be sure, the United States is also trying to boost domestic production of EV metals, which the Biden administration has said is critical.
But Washington is increasingly viewing Canada as a kind of ""51st State"" for mineral supply purposes and plans to deepen financial and logistical partnerships with the country's mining sector over time, according to a U.S. government source.
Both countries are members of the Energy Resource Governance Initiative, a pact to share mining experience and resources.
Canadian firms are also able to apply for U.S. government grants under the U.S. Defense Production Act and other U.S. funding programs. There are no U.S. tariffs on Canadian EV battery metals or EV parts. 
""You're beginning to see Canada become an important part of the North American EV supply chain,"" said Keith Phillips, CEO of Piedmont Lithium Ltd, which in January bought 20% of Sayona Mining Ltd, a developer of a Quebec lithium project. 
Canada's First Cobalt Corp is building the continent's only cobalt refinery, part of an effort to wean the EV industry off supplies from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where child labor has been used. Cobalt is used to make battery cathodes.
Adding to the appeal of Canada, some of the country's mines bill themselves as environmentally friendly and promise to use hydroelectric power to reduce their carbon emissions. 
The United States knows ""that we are the most-secure and most-resilient source of metal imports for them,"" Canadian Natural (NYSE:CNQ) Resources Minister Seamus O'Regan told Reuters. 
Last week, privately-held USA Rare Earth invested in Search Minerals Inc's rare earths project in Newfoundland in eastern Canada.
While USA Rare Earth already controls a rare earths deposit in Texas, executives said they wanted access to more of the minerals used to make electronics and weapons.

""You can't just rely on projects in the U.S. for supply,"" said Pini Althaus, USA Rare Earth's CEO. ""You have to collaborate with Canada.""

The case was the first in which the SEC has brought an enforcement action alleging securities violations on the dark web, it said. 
James Roland Jones of Redondo Beach, California, faces a maximum penalty of five years in federal prison, the Department of Justice said. A sentencing date has not yet been set.
According to the agencies, from 2016 until at least 2017, Jones conspired with another unnamed person to access various dark web marketplaces, including a website claiming to be an insider trading forum, in search of material, non-public information to use for his own securities trading. 
The dark web allows users to access the internet anonymously and is often used to host websites that support illegal activity. Jones could not be reached for comment. 

Jones also devised a scheme to sell what he falsely claimed were insider tips on the dark web, the agencies said. Several users paying in bitcoin purchased these tips and ultimately traded based on the information Jones provided, they said.

While Wall Street is notorious for its tough culture, the survey provides a rare insight into just how grueling working conditions can be.
In it, the junior bankers said that they worked an average of 95 hours a week, slept five hours a night, frequently faced ""unrealistic deadlines,"" and that their relationships with friends and family were feeling the strain as a result.
The survey, which began circulating on social media on Wednesday, was conducted by a group of 13 first-year investment banking analysts among themselves.
They presented their findings to Goldman Sachs' management in February, and the bank has since taken steps to address employee burnout, the bank said.
""We recognize that our people are very busy, because business is strong and volumes are at historic levels,"" Goldman spokeswoman Nicole Sharpe said in a statement on Thursday.
""A year into COVID, people are understandably quite stretched, and that's why we are listening to their concerns and taking multiple steps to address them.""
The bank said it had as of January expedited hiring for new entry-level staff because it is conscious employee resources are stretched thin. But it takes time for new staff to be vetted, hired and to begin working, the bank added. 
Buoyed by strong equity and debt underwriting, Goldman's investment banking business generated a record high $9.42 billion in 2020.
Goldman and other Wall Street banks have played a central role in a recent frenzy of special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, deals. These shell companies raise funds through an initial public offering with a view to later buying assets. 
Such ""blank check"" IPOs have already surpassed this year the $83.4 billion the sector raised in all of 2020, according to Chicago-based SPAC Research, which compiles data on such deals.
Wall Street has been criticized in the past for a hothouse culture that can dangerously overwork ambitious young staff. 
In 2013, an intern at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s Merrill Lynch's investment bank died after he allegedly worked for 72 hours without sleep. https://reut.rs/30U2sy7
A majority of the Goldman analysts in the survey said they felt they have been victims ""of workplace abuse.""

""There was a point where I was not eating, showering or doing anything else other than working from morning until after midnight,"" wrote one respondent.

SYDNEY/HONG KONG (Reuters) - A pair of investment banking boutiques in Australia has waged a fierce talent war against global peers as the deals outlook in one of Asia Pacific's most lucrative markets brightens, intensifying competition for paychecks and mandates.
The new entrants have emerged as near-zero borrowing costs and rebounding investor confidence fan hopes of record deals in M&A and capital markets activity this year.
Barrenjoey Capital Partners, formed last year by former UBS bankers and funded by  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Magellan, and Jarden, another newcomer to Australia, have already poached dozens of bankers from global banks.
That is set to intensify efforts by western firms to retain staff and poach other talent amid a shake-up in the sector, bankers and headhunters said.
On Monday, about 10 bankers, some of whom had been with UBS for decades, resigned en masse from the Swiss investment bank - one of the most successful operations in Australia - to join Barrenjoey.
Jarden, on the other hand, started its raids in Australia earlier and has hired nearly 60 people over the past year from banks including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and UBS.
The two firms are promising to offer equities underwriting, trading and research, as well as M&A advisory, competing with firms including Goldman, UBS,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), and Macquarie.
Jarden, for example, is looking to add up to another 40 staff this year, Aidan Allen, who joined the New Zealand-headquartered firm from UBS to spearhead the expansion of its investment banking business in Australia, told Reuters.
Globally, boutiques are typically started by banking veterans seeking to move away from restrictive bureaucracy and shrinking bonuses at bigger banks, by tapping clients who value niche expertise.
""Global organisations with significant regulatory and compliance burdens have pulled operational control back to centre and the individual has been lost,"" Allen said. ""If you look overseas ... this is a trend that has been playing out for a while globally, its just late to our shores.""
Barrenjoey CEO Brian Benari this week said its headcount had already grown to over 200 since starting in September and would grow by 10% to 20% this year, the Australian Financial Review reported.
The company did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.
HUNT FOR MANDATES 
Fees paid on equity capital market (ECM) deals in Australia reached $809 million in 2020, about 10% of the region's total and the highest in a decade, according to Refinitiv data.
So far this year, ECM fees have hit $118 million, already 36% higher that the first full quarter of 2020. Corporates also paid investment banks in Australia $519.8 million in M&A fees last year, a figure bankers hope will pick up sharply in 2021.
Barrenjoey's and Jarden's foray into the business and the race for talent are set to push up costs while competition for mandates intensifies, in turn driving banks' fees lower, some bankers said.
A person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters some of Barrenjoey's recent recruits had their salaries from bulge bracket firms doubled and promised a slice of revenue and the fees generated from deals they originated.
Staff at Barrenjoey are also collectively allocated a 50.01% ""economic ownership"" of the partnership, as per its website.
""It's going to take a lot of mandates to pay their bills, those people don't come cheap,"" said a banker at a U.S. bank in Australia, who couldn't be named as he did not have permission to speak to media.
In the short-term, however, the hunt for talent is set to continue.
""You've got Jarden and Barrenjoey both looking to hire 100 people in banking, all almost overnight, so it's inevitable there will be an extraordinary amount of movement,"" said another banking boss.
""What we have seen in the last days is just the start of it.""

Patrick, who presides over the state senate, has become the biggest proponent of reducing about $47 billion in power costs from a mid-February cold snap. He publicly prodded the governor after the state's utilities regulator rejected price cuts and the house referred the matter to committee.
The deep freeze killed at least 56 people and left 4.3 million Texans without power or heat for days after half the state's power plants went offline. The demand for power and lack of generation boosted electricity prices by up 400 times the usual levels. Four companies have filed for bankruptcy and dozens more are in danger of going out of business.
""The governor can make this corrective action if he so chooses,"" said Patrick, citing an emergency decree that allows Abbott to order the Public Utility Commission and grid operator ERCOT to take action. 
Patrick said he took the unusual step of publicly pleading for the governor to act because of the short time allowed to make the price change. ERCOT has 30 days after an event to adjust pricing, which expires this week. 
Referring to PUC Chairman Arthur D'Andrea's leaked comments to Wall Street investors that he ""tipped the scale as hard as I could"" to prevent a rollback, Patrick said: ""We just can’t abide by that."" 

The governor can use emergency power to order a rollback of 32 hours of high pricing or request an investigation that will allow the changes to be considered further, Patrick told a news conference.

(Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply lower on Thursday, with the Nasdaq tumbling 3%, hit by rising Treasury yields and fresh worries about the coronavirus pandemic in Europe.
Losses in U.S. stocks accelerated after France's prime minister imposed a month-long lockdown on Paris and several other regions due to the health crisis.
It was the Nasdaq's steepest one-day drop since Feb. 25. 
The S&P 500 energy sector index tumbled 4.7% as oil prices fell, in part due to worries about rising COVID-19 cases in Europe.
""That last hit was from news of the Paris lockdown. It wasn't received that well,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. ""Here in the United States, we anticipate this big reopening and the virus is looking good, but we are not looking outside of the U.S., and it's not all good.""
The Russell 1000 value index, which is heavily comprised of cyclical stocks such as financials and energy, lost 0.6%, while the Russell 1000 growth index, which includes technology stocks, dropped more than 2%.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasuries crossed 1.75% to hit a 14-month high a day after the Fed projected the strongest growth in nearly 40 years as the COVID-19 crisis winds down. The Fed also repeated its pledge to keep its target interest rate near zero for years to come.. 
""The Fed just saying they are not going to raise rates until 2023 really means nothing,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""The Fed is on the sidelines, but if bond yields keep going up, that is what really hurts the economy.""
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) both dropped more than 3%. Tech and other growth stocks are particularly sensitive to rising yields because their value rests heavily on earnings far into the future, which are discounted more deeply when bond yields rise.
A recent $1.9 trillion spending stimulus sparked fears of rising inflation and contributed to the jump in longer-end Treasury yields. 
Underscoring the staggered recovery in the labor market, data showed the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last week.
A separate report indicated the Philly Fed business index jumped more than expected, to its highest level since 1973.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.46% to end at 32,862.3 points, while the S&P 500 lost 1.48% to 3,915.47. 
The Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.02% to 13,116.17.
The S&P 500 and the Dow both closed at record highs on Wednesday.
Accenture (NYSE:ACN) rose 1% after the IT consulting firm raised its full-year revenue forecast and reported second-quarter revenue above analysts' estimates, as more businesses used its digital services to shift operations to the cloud.
 Dollar General Corp  (NYSE:DG) dropped 4.65% after the retailer forecast annual same-store sales and profit below estimates, indicating that a pandemic-fueled rush for lower-priced goods may be waning faster than expected.
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) climbed more than 3% after the movie theater operator said it would have 98% of its U.S. locations open from Friday.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.42-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 85 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 213 new highs and 28 new lows.

Investing.com -  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) reported on Thursday mixed third-quarter results as earnings beat, but revenue fell short of expectations as the pandemic-led impacts in North and Europe hurt growth.
Nike shares lost 0.9% in after-hours trade following the report.
The company announced earnings per share of $0.9 on revenue of $10.36B. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.7588 on revenue of $11.03B.
""Our third quarter revenue performance was impacted by disruption related to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in North America and EMEA,"" the company said.
North America revenue declined 11%, largely driven by global container shortages and U.S. port congestion that led to delays in wholesale shipments. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, physical retail sales declined, as 45% of its stores were forced to shutter amid COVID-19 restrictions.
Nike brand digital sales increased 59%, with double-digit growth in its business worldwide.
Gross margin increased 130 basis points to 45.6%, driven by higher full-price product margins.
Looking ahead, Nike expects to resume its existing share repurchase program, which was suspended in the fourth quarter of last year, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. A total of 45.2 million shares had been repurchased under the program for approximately $4.0 billion.

763,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 04:34PM ET</span>","Quadruple Witching, China Talks, National Security: 3 Things to Watch","By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- Stocks got slammed after U.S. bond yields jumped, with the Nasdaq taking the most heat. 
The United States 10-Year topped 1.7% a day after the Federal Reserve raised its growth and inflation forecast but kept intact its lower-for-longer outlook on rates.  
Tech and chip stocks were lower while oil got hit with Covid-19 infections leading cities in Europe to lockdown again. In addition, the International Energy Agency said it will take another two years for global oil demand to reach pre-pandemic levels. U.S. government data showed a fourth straight weekly build in domestic crude stockpiles.
But, hey, spring is around the corner, people. Huzzah!
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Don't Get Spooked
It's a quadruple witching Friday. Expect an extra dose of volatility as stock options, stock futures, market index futures and market index options all expire. Buckle (NYSE:BKE) up.
2. Baked Alaska
The first high-level talks between the Biden administration and China are getting underway in Alaska today. But thanks to Anchorage's time zone, we're not likely to get any word on how things are going until later this evening or tomorrow. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan are due to meet with Foreign Minister Wang Yi and a member of the Politburo. The talks continue Friday.
3. Relationship Status
While that's going on, Congress will get its own look at the current state of relations between the two countries. Specifically, the national security implications of the economic relationship between the two when the U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission presents its annual report.

Investing.com -- The Nasdaq slumped Thursday, as a sea of red washed over tech stocks after a spike in U.S. bond yields stoked investor worry about paying for higher-valued stocks that have a longer road to growth.    
The Nasdaq Composite fell 3.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.46%, or 153 points, after hitting a intraday record of 33,227.78. The S&P 500 fell 1.45%.
The United States 10-Year topped 1.7% a day after the Federal Reserve ""tripled down"" on dovish monetary policy guidance, by raising its growth and inflation forecast but keeping intact its lower-for-longer outlook on rates.
""Our takeaway from the March FOMC meeting was that policymakers did not just 'double-down' on dovish guidance, they 'tripled-down,'""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.  The Fed shrugged off concern about the uptick in higher longer-term rates … and said ""it's still too early to talk about tapering, leaving the risks to the timing of tapering and to rate hikes skewed toward later rather than sooner relative to our expectations.""
The sharp rise in bond yields sent tech stocks deep in the red as their valuations remain unattractive when compared with other corners the market like cyclicals that were left behind during the pandemic but are now riding the reflation wave higher.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which together make up a quarter of the S&P 500, were lower.
Chip stocks (NASDAQ:SOXX) also added fuel to the fire, falling 4%, with Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) nursing losses.
Beyond tech, energy was a drag on the broader market, paced by slump in oil prices of fears fresh lockdown in Europe could hurt global growth at a time when major oil producers could soon turn on the pumps to take advantage of lofty oil prices.
""We expect economic growth and oil demand to provide resilient and OPEC+- to ease their production restraint in the coming months. These extra barrels will likely be an oil price headwind as the year progresses,"" Wells Fargo said in a note.
Financials were the only sector to end in the green, led by banks thanks to rising rates. 
""[C]urrent directional correlations are likely to remain intact on a near- to-intermediate-term basis- which implies that investors are likely to see positive relative performance trends out of areas like small-caps, value stocks, and the banks / financials sector as the TNX (10-year interest rate) rallies and the economy continues to reflate its way out of recession,"" Janney Montgomery Scott.

769,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 03:35PM ET</span>",More than beans: Nestle recycles cocoa fruit waste to replace sugar in chocolate,"By Silke Koltrowitz
ZURICH (Reuters) - As confectionery groups scramble to reduce added sugar, chocolate sweetened with cocoa fruit pulp is about to hit supermarket shelves with food giant Nestle ready to launch its ""Incoa"" bar.
Using cocoa fruit pulp, which is normally discarded, to flavour products reduces sugar and cuts food waste while boosting the income of cocoa farmers who can ""upcycle"" their cocoa by selling both the pulp and the beans.
That ticks several boxes with health- and environmentally-conscious consumers.
""This is a big launch, we give it to all the customers who want it and don't limit supplies,"" Alexander von Maillot, Nestle's global head of confectionery, told Reuters this week.
The company is launching Incoa, which has no added sugar, in supermarkets in France and the Netherlands with other European markets to follow.
Nestle is sourcing the raw material from cocoa farms in Brazil, but also working with partners in West Africa to see if pulp production could work there. Von Maillot said cocoa farmers could boost their income by 20-40% if they also sold the pulp. 
Lamine Keita, a cocoa farmer in Duekoue, Ivory Coast, said he hadn't yet been asked to sell cocoa fruit pulp. ""If we can sell more than the beans to increase our income, that's all we can ask for because beans alone are not enough to get us out of poverty,"" he said. 
Jerome Koffi, who cultivates cocoa on four hectares of land in Soubre, also said he'd gladly sell more, but at the moment there was only demand for beans. 
Fruit pulp doesn't come cheap - Incoa bars on Dutch retailer Albert Heijn's website cost about 50% more than other dark chocolates. But Von Maillot said although the cost meant pulp was not suitable for replacing sugar in mainstream products, there may be other uses for cocoa fruit chocolate, for example in baking.
UPCYCLING TREND 
Lindt & Spruengli and Germany's Ritter Sport have also launched limited editions of cocoa fruit chocolate which sold out quickly. Both said they planned to launch the products on a larger scale once enough cocoa fruit was available.
Swiss chocolate maker Felchlin's cocoa fruit preparation found its way into macarons and truffles that high-end chocolatier Spruengli - unrelated to Lindt - called a ""world novelty"".
Lindt and Felchlin source cocoa fruit pulp from Swiss-Ghanaian startup Koa https://koa-impact.com, which uses solar-powered mobile units to process fresh pulp from 1,600 small farmers. Koa is able to process 250 tonnes a year but wants increase its capacity 10 fold within the next two years.
Industry major Barry Callebaut, meanwhile, is getting ready to supply its WholeFruit Chocolate to chefs and artisans. It has also set up a dedicated brand, Cabosse Naturals, to sell cocoa fruit ingredients to customers like Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) International to use in fruity snacks.
The Upcycled Food Association said commercialising cocoa fruit worldwide could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 20 million tonnes per year. It defines ""upcycling"" as using food ingredients that humans wouldn't consume, with verifiable supply chains and a positive environmental impact. 
Brigette Wolf, head of Mondelez's SnackFutures, said upcycling appealed to those who want to ""make an impact"" with their food choices.
The company plans to have three varieties of CaPao Cacaofruit Fruit Bites on sale this year, in more than 2,000 stores by the end of 2021 or early 2022.
AFRICAN TASTES
Commodities specialist Tedd George said extracting additional value from the crop could boost West Africa's cocoa sector because current incentives were only focused on growing and selling more beans.
""There's an opportunity for new products made from cocoa fruits to also be health products and that changes the game for the value you can get out of them,"" he said, citing health benefits associated with dark chocolate.
Nestle has been repositioning itself as a health and wellbeing company, reducing sugar in its products, and has also set sustainability targets including for cocoa.
George said the launch of cocoa fruit products didn't address fundamental issues like child labour or deforestation, but could fuel investment and drive change in cocoa-producing communities.

He said companies should also develop cocoa products for African tastes. ""If there was also local demand for cocoa, that would boost farmers' pricing power.""

772,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 02:42PM ET</span>",Explainer: How worried should we be about reports of blood clots and AstraZeneca's vaccine?,"By Ludwig Burger and Matthias Blamont
FRANKFURT/PARIS (Reuters) - Europe's medicines watchdog concluded on Thursday that AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s coronavirus vaccine still far outweighed any risks after investigating reports of rare blood clotting disorders but said it would add a warning to the product leaflet.
""A causal link with the vaccine is not proven, but is possible and deserves further analysis,"" the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said.
The World Health Organization has previously also said there was no proven link and that the benefits far outweighed any risks. At least 13 EU member states including Germany, France and Italy have suspended use of the shot pending the outcome of EMA's probe.
Here's what we know so far:
WHAT HAS HAPPENED?
More than 45 million shots by various manufacturers have been administered across the EU and the European Economic Area since vaccinations started almost three months ago. The AstraZeneca vaccine was given to 5 million people in the EU.
EMA said it had reviewed seven cases of blood clots in multiple blood vessels, called disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and 18 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in people who had received the AstraZeneca shot, most of whom were women. 
In Germany, eight people have been diagnosed with CVST within about two weeks of vaccination among the 1.6 million recipients of the shot as of Wednesday, according to the health ministry. Normally 1 to 1.4 cases would have been expected during that time, the ministry added. 
Germany's vaccine authority Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI) has said the majority of the cases were young to middle-aged women and that there had been three deaths.
WHAT HAVE OTHER COUNTRIES AND ASTRAZENECA SAID?
In Britain, where more than 11 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine have been administered, the medicines regulator said on Thursday it was investigating five cases of CVST among recipients but it reiterated that the benefits of the shot far outweighed any possible risks.
Canada has said health experts are sure all COVID-19 vaccines being administered in the country are safe, including AstraZeneca's.
AstraZeneca said on Sunday a review of safety data of more than 17 million people vaccinated in the United Kingdom and European Union with its vaccine had shown no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots.
​
WHAT WAS THE EMA INVESTIGATING?
EMA investigators checked if the frequency of incidences was higher in the vaccinated population than normal background rates. 
The normal frequency is drawn from public health statistics or insurance records. This would be combined with a medical analysis of each case and insight from scientific literature.
EMA's head of safety monitoring, Peter Arlett, said on Tuesday the rarity of CVST meant the watchdog would have to rely more heavily on case-by-case analysis rather than on statistical data.
A spokeswomen for Germany's vaccine authority, which is part of the investigation, said prior to the safety review that EMA would not rule on causality.
Instead, EMA would assess the likelihood of an increased risk of the condition and weigh that against the benefits of fighting COVID-19.
For example, the vaccines developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) have been linked with increased risk of anaphylaxis, but they are still recommended because benefits outweigh the risks of the side effect, which can be treated.
WHAT DID THE CLINICAL TRIALS SHOW?
AstraZeneca and European regulators have said that concerns about blood coagulation disorders did not emerge during human trials.
Safety monitoring after approval is key because extremely rare side-effects, or those affecting only a small subset of the population, are near impossible to identify during clinical trials, according to Germany's PEI.
ARE THERE PRECEDENTS OF VACCINE SAFETY SCARES? 
In Japan, a governmental recommendation for use of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to prevent cervical cancer has been suspended since June 2013, due to media reports of an alleged pain syndrome. This has drawn criticism from the WHO.
A study published in The Lancet Public Health last year concluded a continued suspension would lead to thousands of cancer deaths over the next decades.

In Ukraine, deep mistrust of vaccines has allowed measles to grow into an epidemic. Vaccine hesitancy there is rooted in corruption and mistrust of authority but also in a temporary government suspension in 2008, when a 17-year-old boy died shortly after receiving a measles-rubella vaccine.

(Reuters) - An outsized rally in Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) shares has drawn the attention of Germany's top market watchdog as heavy-volume trading spurred by the carmaker' electric vehicle ambitions sent the stock rising as much as 32% this week.
Shares in Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) reversed course on Thursday, however, after hitting their highest level since April 2015 as regulator BaFin said it was monitoring the share price move and a buying frenzy from the United States appeared to cool down. 
A spokeswoman said BaFin was watching the move in a ""routine way,"" without elaborating. 
A raft of announcements on its electric vehicle expansion strategy to challenge market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has lifted Volkswagen shares more than 50% so far this year, luring institutional and retail investors globally.
Momentum in the share price grew on Monday after the 83-year-old group unveiled it would build 12 battery cell plants in Europe by 2030 and expand charging infrastructure for electric cars.
Interest from U.S. individual investors was particularly strong. Volumes in its American depositary receipts (ADRs), seen as a proxy for retail traders' interest, peaked at around 20 times the 90-day average on Tuesday.

""The shares are dragged down by the ADRs. Seems as if parts of the trade are unwinding,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Lordstown Motors Corp shares plunged nearly 12% on Thursday after the electric pickup truck firm disclosed a regulatory inquiry over a short seller's report claiming the company was using ""fake"" orders to raise capital.
The drop was the latest sign of a recent retreat in the once high flying electric vehicle sector, whose ranks have been swollen by the recent boom in special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACS.
Nikola, another electric pickup truck startup which has been attacked by the Hindenburg in the past, separately fell more than 7% hit by a key investor cutting its stake.
Lordstown and Nikola, which both went public via acquisitions by SPACS - shell companies that use their IPO proceeds to acquire private firms - are both down roughly 50% from their highs this year. Concern about technology, as well as rising yields, have weighed on the sector.
South Korea's Hanwha Corp will be selling up to half of its stake in Nikola, the EV maker said on Wednesday, amid concerns about the company's future prospects. 
""In this golden age of EVs there are clear growing pains and this just adds to the dynamic for the sector and Nikola,"" said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives.
Lordstown revealed on Wednesday that it received a request for information from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding accusations by Hindenburg pertaining to its order book.
Lordstown Chief Executive Steve Burns declined to state in a CNBC TV interview on Thursday whether he had been too aggressive in characterizing the firm's orders as 'serious' commitments from customers. 
""We never said we had orders. We don't have a product yet so by definition we can't have orders,"" Burns said, adding that any orders were 'non-binding' and were only meant to gauge customers' interest ahead of targetted production of its Endurance trucks in September.

BTIG analyst Gregory Lewis said Lordstown's ability get the Endurance through its beta testing phase and into production while winning orders will be the biggest driver of the stock over the next year.

The ride-hailing company reported that last week was its biggest since March 2020, with ride volume reaching a record for the year. On Wednesday, for the first time in 12 months,  Lyft saw positive year-over-year growth in daily rideshare ride volume. It expects volume to grow in excess of 100% next week, with growth expected to continue every week through the end of 2021, the company said in a blog post.
More than 110 million shots have been administered in the U.S., and cases, deaths and hospitalizations have been dropping, prompting people to start returning to the world, in person.
Lyft is trading at its highest in almost two years, closing in on its 2019 IPO price of $72. Revenue has plummeted through the pandemic after hitting $1 billion in the quarter ended in December 2019.
Rival Uber (NYSE:UBER) is up 1.42%. It had reported mobility bookings down 47% for the fourth quarter compared to a year earlier. On the upside, Uber saw delivery bookings jump 128% in that time, the company said in a statement last month.
Yesterday, Wedbush raised the price target on Lyft to $85 from $72 on better profitability and more revenue per rider in the future, according to StreetInsider. The analyst reiterated a buy-equivalent rating on the stock as ""Lyft is on the cusp of seeing a 'springboard of consumer demand.'""

Investing.com - AstraZeneca moved off session lows Thursday after the European Medical Agency's safety committee found the company's vac­cine to be “safe and ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing Covid-19,"" and encouraged countries to continue vaccinations. 
AstraZeneca PLC ADR (NASDAQ:AZN) dipped 0.57%, to $49.79.
The EU health watchdog said the ben­e­fits of us­ing As­tra­Zeneca's vaccine out­weigh the po­ten­tial risks, and recommended that countries proceed with vaccinations. The eagerly anticipated vaccine comes after many European countries including France and economic powerhouse Germany suspended the roll out of the vaccine after reports that people who received had developed blood clots some of which led to fatal outcomes.     
The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, meanwhile, also provided a positive update on the vaccine. Following a ""rigorous scientific review,"" the UK regulator said all the available data does not suggest that cerebral sinus vein thrombosis - blood clots in the vein - is caused by the vaccine.
Among the 11 million people who have received the vaccine in the UK, five people are reported to have experienced cerebral sinus vein thrombosis that led to one death. 
The positive news on the vaccine front comes just as the reopening gathers pace. The White House is looking to relax restrictions on travel across the borders with Mexico and Canada and on inbound international travel from the U.K., Europe and Brazil, toward the middle of May, CNBC reported, citing two sources familiar with the matter.

(Reuters) - Dollar General (NYSE:DG) indicated on Thursday the vaccine rollout and a reopening economy would lead to a bigger-than-expected slowdown in sales for discounted groceries, while a new round of stimulus may be tougher to take advantage of than before. 
The company's shares fell over 6% as it also forecast full-year profit below estimates. 
The promise of a return to relative normalcy later this year as more Americans get inoculated against COVID-19 has made the boom in pantry stocking, which made Dollar General one of the bigger retail beneficiaries of the health crisis, unlikely to be repeated.
A new round of $1,400 stimulus payments, on the way to mostly lower- and middle-income households, was expected to boost spending at discount stores, at least in the coming weeks, but Dollar General said there was too much uncertainty about how much the company could benefit to include it in its outlook.
""Compared to the previous stimulus rounds, which helped us, the economy is now opening up more. We are competing with other segments of the economy outside of retail for that share of wallet, so how much we get is uncertain,"" finance chief John Garratt said on a call with analysts. 
Dollar General said it expects full-year same-store sales to fall 4% to 6%, compared with estimates of a 1.2% decline, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company forecast overall net sales to be flat to 2% lower, compared with estimates of a 1.4% increase. 
The company forecast annual earnings per share of $8.80 to $9.50, below estimates of $10.08.
Same-store sales in the fourth quarter rose 12.7%, beating analysts' estimate of a 10.7% increase, helped by the $600 stimulus checks that boosted spending.

Net income rose about 20% to $642.7 million, or $2.62 per share, but missed estimates of $2.72 per share.

783,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 11:45AM ET</span>","UK reports five cases of rare blood clots in 11 million AstraZeneca shots, continues with vaccine","By Alistair Smout
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's medicines regulator said there had been five cases of a rare type of blood clot in the brain among 11 million given AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine but said that it found the benefits of the shot far outweighed any possible risks.
Concerns about reports of blood clots, along with low platelet levels, have led to some European countries including Germany to pause the rollout of the shot while the cases are investigated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which is set to announce its findings later in the day.
Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said that use of the vaccine should continue while five reports were investigated, and one official said that the rollout would likely continue even if a link was proved.
""There is no evidence that blood clots in veins is occurring more than would be expected in the absence of vaccination, for either vaccine,"" said June Raine, MHRA Chief Executive, referring to AstraZeneca and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) shots.
Raine said there had been a very small number of reports of an extremely rare form of blood clot in the cerebral veins (sinus vein thrombosis, or CSVT) occurring together with lowered platelets soon after vaccination.
""Given the extremely rare rate of occurrence of these CSVT events among the 11 million people vaccinated (with AstraZeneca), and as a link to the vaccine is unproven, the benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID-19, with its associated risk of hospitalisation and death, continue to outweigh the risks of potential side effects,"" she said. 
One of the reported cases was fatal, MHRA Vaccine Safety Lead Philip Bryan said, adding that the cases were all among men aged between 19 and 59. 
NO PAUSE NECESSARY
The MHRA said anyone with a headache that lasts for more than four days after vaccination, or bruising beyond the site of vaccination after a few days, should seek medical attention.
The regulator said there was an ongoing review into ""five UK reports of a very rare and specific type of blood clot in the cerebral veins (sinus vein thrombosis) occurring together with lowered platelets (thrombocytopenia)"".
Munir Pirmohamed, Chair of the Commission on Human Medicines, in a statement suggested that even if a link between the clots and the vaccine was established, it likely wouldn't halt Britain's rollout.
""If we feel that there's causal link then we may need to update the product information, but overall, I don't think that would necessitate pause to any kind of vaccination programme,"" he told reporters in a briefing.
The EMA is investigating reports of 30 cases of unusual blood disorders out of 5 million people who got the AstraZeneca vaccine in the EU, and is focusing on blood clots in the head. 
Stephen Evans, at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that COVID-19 itself was associated with similar symptoms, making causality hard to establish.
""A major problem is discerning whether there is a possibility that this was caused by COVID-19,"" Evans told Reuters. 

""Exactly these sort of conditions have been seen in patients with COVID-19 prior to the vaccines being available.""

Investing.com – Despite a blowout quarter, management's lack of full-year guidance sank Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) shares on Thursday.

Berenberg Bank analyst Brian McNamara maintained a hold rating on the stock and a price target of $143. This is a 24% downside from the prevailing price.  
In a note to investors, the analyst said, “As Five is currently operating from a position of strength, we were disappointed the company offered no full-year guidance, even if it was perhaps a wider range of outcomes than typical.

787,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 11:10AM ET</span>",Analysis: U.S. bond market feels like 'coiled spring' after Fed meeting,"By Karen Brettell and Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are closely watching how fast U.S. Treasury yields may rise after the Federal Reserve this week reiterated its commitment to loose policies that are likely to help further boost economic growth and inflation.
That's a key issue for both investors and Fed officials who would rather not have to ride out another bout of bond market volatility, as a growing body of indicators suggests U.S. growth is poised to take off this year. 
On Thursday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield spiked to a 14-month high, following a relatively muted reaction on Wednesday, and the yield curve steepened to a fresh 5-1/2-year high.
A surge higher in yields would raise borrowing costs for companies and consumers, and could ripple across other asset classes like equities.
""To me it feels like it is a coiled spring,"" said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). The Fed ""is signaling that it wants to see an overshoot, it wants to see inflation and employment run quite hot.""
The Fed's stance also ""does raise some risks that whenever we do begin to hear a shift in tone from the Fed that there may be a bit more of a rapid adjustment in the market,"" Cabana said.
Fears of sooner-than-expected interest rate hikes, or tapering of the Fed's asset purchases, helped in the weeks leading up to the March 16-17 policy meeting to send yields on longer-dated Treasury yields to their highest in a year.
Rick Rieder, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s chief investment officer of global fixed income, tweeted on Thursday that the Fed would likely be able to taper asset purchases ""sooner than most expect: perhaps before the end of the year, which suggests to us that communicating the plan could come as early as the June meeting."" 
The 10-year Treasury yield rose to a high of 1.689% prior to the Fed's statement on Wednesday, its highest since January 2020, before retreating modestly. The selloff picked up again early on Thursday, vaulting the yield above 1.74% for the first time since January 2020. 
Two-year note yields, which are the most sensitive to interest rate policy, dropped as low as 0.125% after the Fed meeting. Those notes had risen 3.6 basis points to 0.165% on Thursday.
That meant the spread between the two- and 10-year rates - the most common measure of the yield curve - widened as much as 160.2 basis points.
Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at NatAlliance Securities, wrote in a note on Thursday that the next big move for benchmark 10-year yields would be 2%. 
""So when should we hit 2%? ... At this rate maybe next week,"" Brenner wrote. 
TAPER TANTRUM
While long-term rates are likely to continue their upward march in line with better economic projections, higher inflation and rising Treasury supply, the question is how fast they move. 
The Fed ""has now calmed down potential market anxiety about a taper tantrum, and I think it buys time and paves the way for financial conditions to remain relatively loose and for the recovery to gather pace,"" said Daniel Ahn, chief U.S. economist and head of Markets 360 North America at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
Bond yields rose dramatically during the 2013 taper tantrum after then-Fed chief Ben Bernanke told lawmakers the central bank could slow its pace of asset purchases that had been propping up markets.
The Fed's message on Wednesday was that rates were not rising in a hurry even though it expects the U.S. economy to grow 6.5% in 2021, unemployment to fall to 4.5% by the end of the year and the pace of price increases to exceed the Fed's 2% target, at least temporarily. Powell noted the ""strong bulk"" of the Fed's policy-setting committee anticipates no interest rate increase until at least 2024.
""The chairman has been quite clear that he's happy about the pace of recovery increasing, but that doesn't change their framework and it certainly isn't going to force their hand to tighten policy sooner than they deem necessary,"" said Michael Lorizio, senior fixed income trader at Manulife Investment Management in Boston.
Indeed, Powell could be comfortable with a steeper yield curve that bolsters private banking, said Venk Reddy, chief investment officer, Zeo Capital Advisors. 

""I don't see how we don't end up with a very steep upward sloping yield curve over the course of time here,"" Reddy said.

Dollar General benefited from the lockdowns as the pandemic-fueled nervousness had more people taking to its discounted stores to stock up on groceries. That burst in sales is expected to taper as more people get vaccinated and get back to leading normal lives.
The company said it expects full-year same-store sales to fall 4% to 6%, compared with analysts' estimate of a 1.2% decline, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Overall net sales are expected to be flat to 2% lower, against estimates of a 1.4% increase.
""Significant uncertainty continues to exist regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the US economy, consumer behavior and the company's business,"" Dollar General said in a statement.
The company repurchased $2.5 billion of its common stock, or 12.3 million shares last year. The total remaining authorization for future repurchases was $679 million at the end of fiscal year 2020. On March 17, the company’s board increased the authorization by $2 billion.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower on Thursday under pressure from a fresh rise in bond yields, as market participants reacted skeptically to the Federal Reserve's assurances that inflation won't be a problem for the next two years. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond had risen to 1.75%, its highest in 14 months. while the 30-year bond was trading around the 2.50% level after breaching it in overnight trading for the first time since 2019.
Rises in long-term interest rates over the last few weeks have tended to put more pressure on technology stocks than others, as they raise the opportunity cost of holding assets that are in many cases only expected to generate significant cash flows some years in the future. That was the case again on Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite falling 1.3% in early trading, while the S&P 500 fell 0.5%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, by contrast, with its heavier weighting of cyclical stocks, eked out a 0.1% gain on top of Wednesday's record close to trade at 33,098 points.
Earlier, the Labor Department had posted data showing an unexpected rise in initial jobless claims to 770,000. However, the broader trend continued lower, with the broader number of those claiming unemployment-related benefits reversing its jump in the previous week’s report to stand at just over 18 million at the end of February.
The market preferred to focus on growing evidence of near-term price pressures, however. The Philadelphia Fed's business survey showed the region's manufacturing sector running hot, with its index hitting the highest reading since the 1970s as orders, backlogs and input prices all surged.
Among individual stocks, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 3.5%, as some continued to rotate out of the richly-valued electric carmaker into cheaper rivals. News flow around the stock was also negative, with a highly-publicized incident in Michigan that appeared to be caused by shortcomings in its Autopilot software, as well as reports that U.K. customers will no longer be subsidized to buy Tesla cars. The government is lowering the eligibility threshold for subsidies to a price point well below the current price of its Model 3.
Banking stocks were the standout performers in early trade, with PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) hitting an all-time high and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) stock all hitting their highest in over a year. That reflects a steadily-steepening yield curve, that pads the margins that banks make from taking short-term deposits and making long-term loans. The spread between two-year and 10-year rates has widened from only 65 basis points in November, before  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech announced their vaccine breakthrough, to 150 basis points as of Thursday. That's the highest level since 2015."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain expects to seal a financial services cooperation pact with the European Union shortly, a senior finance ministry official told a conference on challenges from market fragmentation.
The City of London's ties with the bloc were severed after Britain left the EU's single market on Dec. 31 and the prospect of a pact has raised hopes in some quarters of at least a partial resumption of direct access to the continent's financial markets. 
Katharine Braddick, the finance ministry's head of financial services, said both sides were committed to agreeing an MoU on regulatory cooperation by the end of March.
""I don't see any reason why we are not going to be able to deliver on that commitment,"" Braddick said, echoing comments this week from the EU.
Braddick said talk about the pact has been ""exuberant"" and in practice it would only be an ""administrative vehicle"" for dialogue.
She was speaking at the launch of a report on financial market fragmentation from the International Regulatory Strategy Group, a think tank backed by the City of London and TheCityUK.
It calls on the G7, G20 and the COP26 climate change summit in November to renew commitments to integrated financial markets made during the financial crisis in 2009, to avoid spiralling compliance costs as economies recover from COVID-19 and tackle climate change.
Antony Manchester, managing director at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), said it was a ""delicate time"" for finance as international trade is being questioned and Brexit fragments markets in Europe.
""A call for coherent regulation is not the same as a call for less or no regulation,"" Manchester said.
Global investors also face the prospect of different systems in China, the EU, United States and Britain for disclosing and labelling environment-friendly investments for tackling climate change, said Tamara Cizeika, a lawyer at Allen & Overy.

Countries are further fragmenting markets by restricting the flow of cross-border data between financial firms, added Toshiyuki Miyoshi, deputy commissioner for international affairs at Japan's FSA regulator.

796,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 09:15AM ET</span>",EU threat of tougher vaccine export controls backed by heavyweight governments,"By Francesco Guarascio and Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission's threat to block exports of COVID-19 vaccines to countries with higher vaccination rates that are not reciprocating, including Britain, won backing from Germany, France and Italy, EU officials and diplomats said. 
The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, threatened on Wednesday to ban exports of vaccines to safeguard scarce doses for its own citizens facing a third wave of the pandemic.
At a meeting of EU diplomats that took place shortly after von der Leyen's warning, Germany, Italy, France and Denmark supported the Commission's stance on a tougher application of export controls, three diplomats and officials who attended the meeting or were briefed about it, said.
The Netherlands, Belgium and Ireland were more cautious, two of the officials said, adding a discussion on the matter will be held at a summit of EU leaders next week. 
""It's all stemming from a growing frustration with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and being under increased pressure to do something about it. We don't have enough vaccines, we export like crazy without getting anything,"" said one of the diplomats who participated in the discussions.
A second diplomat, briefed on the talks, confirmed the main reason for the tougher stance was AstraZeneca's under-delivery to the EU.
The Anglo-Swedish company said last week it aimed to deliver to the EU 100 million doses of its vaccine by the end of June, instead of 300 million envisaged under the EU contract, citing production problems and export restrictions.
The EU, whose vaccination campaign has been slowed down by delays in deliveries and health scares, has said it exported more than 10 million vaccines to Britain since Jan 30, and more before, but got none back, despite the fact that two plants producing AstraZeneca shots in the UK are listed as suppliers in the company's contract with the EU.
EU officials have said that AstraZeneca told them it cannot export vaccines made in British factories because it has a supply contract with Britain that prioritises the UK market.
A first shipment to Australia of AstraZeneca vaccines was blocked earlier in March by Italy, in agreement with the EU Commission. All other requests have so far been approved for a total of over 40 million shots exported to dozens of countries since Jan. 30.
VACCINE TOURISM
One of the diplomats and a fourth EU official said the move was mainly a warning to Britain, but also concerned countries that were peddling vaccines to tourists.
While they did not name any of these countries, there have been reports of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) offering shots to foreigners willing to get residency and set up a company there.
""It's a matter of fairness,"" said the EU official.
The threat was also directed at the United States, which has so far banned the export of vaccines to the EU, the official said, but that was mitigated by the fact that the bloc depends on U.S. drug substances, the exports of which was not blocked.
The official said the EU was also worried about the supply of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) vaccines from the U.S. as Washington was prioritising Americans before allowing exports. The U.S. company produces some of its shots in the Netherlands, but vaccines need to be shipped to the U.S. to be bottled there under the supply contract J&J signed with the EU.

The EU's vaccination rollout has been slow compared to other wealthy nations, with the UK, U.S. and UAE being far ahead, thanks in part to vaccines imported from the EU.

797,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 08:30AM ET</span>",Vodafone's Vantage Towers climbs after Germany's biggest IPO since 2018,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Shares in Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD)'s Vantage Towers rose on Thursday in Germany's largest stock market debut since 2018, benefiting from strong investor appetite for infrastructure assets with stable returns.
Its shares climbed as much as 4.8% from the offer price of 24 euros, which was towards the lower end of the 22.5 to 29 euro marketing range, and were up 1.9% at 24.45 euros at 1119 GMT.
If a 300 million euro over-allotment option, or greenshoe, is exercised Vodafone will earn 2.3 billion euros ($2.8 billion) from the initial public offering (IPO) which valued Vantage Towers at 12.1 billion euros.
""This IPO unlocks value for our shareholders: it demonstrates the value of our towers assets in a 5G world,"" Vodafone Chief Executive Nick Read said.
Vodafone has said it will use the proceeds to cut its debt, which totals about 69 billion euros, according to Refinitiv data.
It was one of the biggest listings this year in Europe, which has seen a flurry of debuts including Polish e-commerce firm InPost, German used-car trading platform AUTO1 and British footwear brand Dr. Martens.
Vantage Towers was also the biggest listing in Germany since October 2018 when brake manufacturer Knorr Bremse raised $4.4 billion. 
Telecom towers have become the target of several big deals as Spain's Cellnex and U.S.-based American Tower Corp (NYSE:AMT) race to expand in Europe for the roll-out of next-generation 5G technology.
'LOT OF INTEREST'
While selling towers outright would bring in piles of cash, many telecoms firms are looking to spin off tower businesses, or launch joint ventures with independent companies, as a way to keep a chunk of potential future growth.
""There is a lot of interest from cell phone operators and other companies, e.g. from the Internet of Things sector, to talk to us in the next few months,"" Vantage Chief Executive Vivek Badrinath told Reuters.
Upgrading networks, including telecoms towers, for faster 5G technology will soak up some $890 billion between 2020 and 2025, the GSMA industry body says.
European operators are increasingly willing to exploit their assets to help finance those upgrades. Assuming the Vantage Towers greenshoe is fully exercised, Vodafone would still hold 81% of the towers company headquartered in Duesseldorf.
Vantage operates 82,000 towers across 10 countries, where it is usually the leading or second largest operator. Germany is its largest market and Vodafone is its main client.
Demand in the IPO outstripped the shares on offer multiple times, with strong demand from global investors and sector specialists. So-called cornerstone investors received 41%, the bookrunners said.
Infrastructure investor and operator Digital Colony and Singapore-based global equity fund RRJ had agreed to buy a total of 950 million euros in shares.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and UBS organised the IPO with the help from  Barclays  (LON:BARC), Berenberg, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).

ZURICH (Reuters) - New lockdowns in Europe recently and the absence of tourism might make it difficult for Swatch Group (SIX:UHR) to get back to 2019 sales levels this year but the world's biggest watchmaker maintains that target for now, its chief executive said on Thursday.
The owner of luxury brands including Omega, Tissot and Longines as well as its original Swatch watches made a net loss last year for the first time in decades, it reported in January, as sales fell 32% from 2019 due to shop closures during the pandemic and as smartwatches made inroads into the market.
Sales are picking up this year, and the group said in January that there was a good chance it would reach 2019 sales levels this year, but new lockdowns in Europe now pose risks.
""Our aim is (in 2021) to get as close as possible to 2019, but when I look at how in Germany or Italy they are closing and opening, I don't know,"" Nick Hayek told an online media briefing to discuss the group's full-year results, released in January.
""Europe and Switzerland are impacting us, Switzerland is a big business with tourists, and as long as there are closures and tourism is not happening it will be more difficult of course to approach the 2019 numbers,"" he said.
Europe accounted for 24% of the group's sales last year, down from 28% in 2019.
Hayek, however, said consumers seemed willing to splash out on watches in markets where shops are open, like mainland China, Macau, Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. Asia accounted for 66% of group sales last year.
Peter Steiger, head of the company's U.S. business, said he expected first-quarter sales in the United States to be 15% higher than in the same period in 2019, with the company pointing to catch-up demand in markets where shops had reopened. North and South America combined, however, generate just under 9% of group sales.
Swatch Group shares, up 16% so far this year, were down 0.5% at 1032 GMT.
The Swiss Watch Federation said on Thursday that the industry's exports stabilised in February after falling 22% last year, helped by a rebound in the United States and China, while Europe and the entry-price segment remained weak.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's Rafael López Aliaga, an ultra-conservative member of Opus Dei who practices celibacy and says he wears a sackcloth to keep his physical desires in check, has a serious shot at becoming the Andean country's next president.
The 60-year-old has jumped in recent opinion polls ahead of the April 11 first round vote, and is firmly within a cluster of contenders who could force a second round run-off with populist front-runner Yonhy Lescano.
López Aliaga, a financier and rail magnate, said his first action as president would be to expel Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht, at the center of graft probes around the region that have dragged in a number of Peruvian ex-leaders.
""Odebrecht leaves Peru on July 28,"" López Aliaga told Reuters at his party offices in Lima, referring to the day on which the next president is set to take office in the world's second largest copper producer. He added he would seek a fine from the company and look to seize all its remaining assets in Peru.
Odebrecht has admitted to bribing officials throughout Latin America in the past but said recently it has transformed itself and will be strictly guided by ethics.
López Aliaga also said he would cut government red-tape by reducing the number of ministries to nine from the current 19 and get rid of what he called ""parasites"" who were getting rich off the state.
His strident anti-elitist views have led to comparisons with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which López Aliaga rejected.
""Bolsonaro insults the gay community, I am inclusive, the community must be welcomed, as Pope Francis says,"" he said.
López Aliaga told Reuters he opposes gay marriage, though supports a ""solidarity pact"" to protect same-sex couples. ""Marriage though needs to have a mother and a father,"" he said.
A member of conservative Catholic organization Opus Dei, he is also against abortion and said even in cases where women became pregnant after being raped they should not be allowed to have abortions but should be taken into shelters and the baby found adoptive parents if needed.
In a recent radio interview, López Aliaga said he represses his sexual desire by thinking of the Virgin Mary and flails himself with a cilice, a sackcloth garment with points that stick into the body, a practice from early Christianity.
""Christ suffered so much that wearing a hair shirt is surely not painful. In my case I already have calluses, 40 years old, you can imagine,"" he told local station Exitosa.
""But it is a small mortification for God and for men... I do it alone, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, to unite myself to the cross of Christ."" 
UNTAPPED LITHIUM
If elected, López Aliaga said he hoped to use Peru's largely untapped lithium deposits to attract investment from big names like carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), including with a ""high-tech free zone"" in Puno, near the border with Bolivia.
In line with front-runner Lescano, he said he would also look to bring down domestic gas prices by renegotiating a contract with Argentina's Pluspetrol and would promote talks with Bolivia over a gas pipeline to import cheaper gas.
Almost half of Peru's energy consumption is from natural gas, including a major reserve in the Andean region of ​​Camisea, operated by Pluspetrol.

""It cannot be that Camisea sells us the LPG (liquefied gas) at international prices, if it is Peruvian raw material. With Camisea, yes we are going to review it,"" he said.

Investing.com –  Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG) stock was down 3.5% premarket in Thursday’s trade, as selling continued in the wake of its announcement that it will have to restate its financial accounts.
Market players were spooked when the fuel-cell company said late on Tuesday it would restate its fiscal 2018 and 2019 statements, as well as quarterly filings for 2019 and 2020. That sent the shares tumbling 23% Wednesday.
Plug Power's assertion its accounting firm KPMG had not detected any misconduct seems to have had little impact. 
The stock still has it friends, however. Canaccord Genuity reiterated its Buy rating on Thursday, analyst Jed Dorsheimer keeping a price target of $69, implying 75% upside potential from Wednesday’s $39.33 close.
The current consensus among 13 TipRanks analysts is for a ‘moderate buy’ on Plug Power, with an average price target of $58.54.
The analysts’ price targets range from a high of $78 to a low of $29.
The revised accounting will change how the company accounts for certain transactions and items, but is not expected to impact its cash position, business operations or economics of commercial arrangements, it said in a filing.
The company maintains it will achieve its previously stated gross billing targets of $475 million in 2021, $750 million in 2022 and $1.7 billion in 2024.

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares were down in premarket trading Thursday, after a report saying that its most popular model in the U.K., Model 3, will no longer be covered by the country’s subsidy program.
The Times reported that grants for electric cars will be cut by £500 and abolished altogether for more expensive models. At the same time, the upper limit of cars eligible for the scheme will be reduced from 50,000 pounds ($70,000) to £35,000 ($49,000). The tweak reflects a government desire to avoid subsidizing wealthier households as it looks to contain the cost of supporting the economy through the pandemic. 
The change means that Tesla’s popular Model 3, prices for which start at 40,500 pounds, will no longer be covered by the grant. It has consistently been the country’s best-selling electric car over the past year.
The news comes in a week when two of Europe's biggest legacy carmakers, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW, have ramped up their targets for electric vehicle sales, threatening to eat into Tesla's first-mover advantage. Volkswagen (OTC:VWAPY) said on Tuesday it expects to make 1 million electric vehicles this year, which would put it comfortably ahead of Tesla in volume sales. BMW meanwhile said it wants half of its group sales to be electric by 2030. 
It also coincides with reports of a fresh incident involving Tesla's Autopilot software, which apparently failed to prevent a Model Y from hitting a police car in Michigan on Wednesday. 
The announcement of Tesla’s $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD) brought the stock down from its January perch by a third in the first two months of the year but has since recovered about a quarter of those losses."

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe could be looking at another lost summer tourist season as COVID-19 cases are rising and the vaccine rollout has been so slow, threatening a major hit to the economies of Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said.
""Europe's high cases and slow vaccine drive could lead to a late reopening, putting a second summer at risk – which would exacerbate the north-south divide and could trigger further policy easing,"" Morgan Stanley said. 
Last year, Europe was able to save some of its summer season with the help of restrictions and seasonal weather dynamics that lowered transmission rates from spring, the bank said.
""But we are somewhat sceptical that this can happen again this year, given the emergence of new strains, which appear to be more transmissible and dangerous, and have driven an acceleration in cases recently in the euro area, e.g. in France and Italy.""
Morgan Stanley said the south of Europe would see the biggest impact from another lost summer as tourism accounts for over 6% of European GDP and nearly 8% of employment – but much more than that in tourism-dependent countries, such as Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece.
""Spain, which was already one of the worst performers in 2020, looks particularly vulnerable, based on our analysis,"" Morgan Stanley said. 
British Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said on Thursday that he was going on holiday in the United Kingdom and that it was too early to speculate on whether or not foreign holidays would be allowed this summer. 
Jenrick told LBC radio that he hoped there would be summer holidays but that Transport Secretary Grant Shapps was looking at the issue of summer holidays abroad.
""I will be going on holiday within the UK,"" he said. Asked if people would be able to have a proper summer holiday he replied: ""I hope so.""
Airlines and travel groups are desperate to resume some kind of normal summer holiday season this year after COVID-19 restrictions left many fighting for survival.
Portugal's tourism minister said on Thursday the country would gladly welcome British tourists from May 17 if they could show proof of having had the vaccine, or a negative test for younger travellers. 

Irene Hays, the boss of Britain's largest independent travel agent, Hays, also said on Thursday that there were encouraging signs that international travel would resume.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canada's tiny Flair Airlines, which made headlines by handing Boeing (NYSE:BA) a crucial order for 737 MAX jets last week, is forging growth plans inspired by the austerity that transformed Hungary's Wizz Air into one of Europe's largest carriers.
Former Wizz executive Stephen Jones, brought in from Europe to run Flair last year, said the Canadian company had grabbed planes at ""a great price"" to accelerate a relaunch based on the imported recipe of extreme cost discipline.
""In many ways, the future of Flair will be a cookie-cutter of the success of Wizz,"" the CEO told Reuters.
One difference? Flair is basing its growth on Boeing jets whereas Wizz shot up the rankings to become one of Airbus's biggest customers. 
In both cases, jet prices were key.
Shares in Boeing rose 6% on Friday when one of Flair's main backers said it would order 24 of the troubled MAX, before leasing 13 of them to Alberta-based Flair.
The MAX is back in the air after regulators declared it safe in December, following a 20-month grounding in the wake of two fatal crashes. 
But Boeing has dozens of cancelled jets in storage and is seen as aggressively chasing deals to restore confidence.
""(That) we are actually able to order them this month and have them delivered in two months' time is very unusual under normal circumstances. You may have anything up to a two or three year wait,"" Jones said. 
""And also to get them at a great price,"" he added, without giving details.
The MAX sells for $122 million at list prices, but market sources say 50% discounts were common across the industry before the crisis and may now be steeper.
That comes as Flair, originally a charter airline, is in the midst of re-inventing itself as an ""ultra-low-cost carrier"" (ULCC). Such airlines offer even lower prices than many budget rivals but charge multiple extras. 
They have made less headway in North America than in Europe, but analysts say that could change post-crisis.
TOUGH MARKET
With one plane now flying, Flair is moving forward this summer with domestic growth plans at a time when the Canadian aviation sector is reeling due to the pandemic. 
Air traffic was hit so hard that a British Columbia airport which largely serves corporate aircraft and flight schools eclipsed Toronto's Pearson as the country's busiest airport in 2020 by aircraft movements, according to Statistics Canada.
Such upheaval is synonymous with the rise of Wizz, one of the few airlines in the world to keep taking planes during the crisis at a time when many rivals are doing the opposite.
Founded in 2003, Wizz Air was originally focused on stimulating travel with its cheap ticket prices in central and eastern Europe. It increasingly competes with Europe’s two largest low cost carriers Ryanair and easyJet (LON:EZJ).
Like former bosses at Wizz, Jones and a commercial chief also recruited from the Hungarian budget giant are betting that travel will rebound quickly as COVID-19 vaccinations ramp up. 
Flair plans to bring in eight MAX jets over the summer and the remaining five before 2022. It will eventually add cross-border flights with a goal to get to 50 jets within five years.
But analysts warn the two Wizz veterans face one of the world's hardest markets for airlines. Canada has high taxes and fees, and tough travel rules, including a mandatory 14-day quarantine for arrivals during the pandemic.

""Challenger businesses are often dismissed by the incumbent,"" Jones said. ""But piece by piece you have to prove yourself.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Thursday, with tech stocks hit by rising yields after a dovish Federal Reserve message.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 40 points, or 0.1%, but S&P 500 Futures traded 15 points, or 0.4%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 150 points, or 1.1%.
The U.S. Federal Reserve concluded its second two-day policy meeting of the year Wednesday, keeping its zero-rate outlook out through 2023 even as it lifted its growth and inflation forecasts substantially.
“The Fed does seem to be getting its point across that it will be adjusting policy on actual data, not forecast data, which conveniently buys it some time – probably until the June meeting,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell again indicated that he wasn’t concerned over the recent surge in long-term yields, seeing any inflationary pressures as being transitory.
This helped the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 indices close Wednesday at record highs--the DJIA climbing above 33,000 for the first time--as cyclical stocks got a boost. 
However, the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond climbed as high as 1.75%, the highest since January 2020, and this is set to pressure the highly-leveraged tech sector Thursday. 
That emphasis on actual data will turn attention Thursday to the release of the weekly jobless report, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), which is expected to show another 700,000 people claimed unemployment support last week, a modest improvement from 712,000 the previous week. 
In the corporate sector, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) and Accenture (NYSE:ACN) are set to report earnings before the open, while  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX) report after the close. That said, a lot of focus is going to be on the tech sector, with the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) tracking the rise of long-term rates. Tesla's cars are set to lose their eligibility for subsidies in the U.K., which accounts for a quarter of its European sales, according to a report in the Daily Mail on Wednesday.
Oil prices edged lower after U.S. Energy Information Administration data, released late Wednesday, showed a rise of 2.4 million barrels in crude inventories last week, the fourth consecutive week of gains, prompting worries of a sustained hit to demand.
Data from the American Petroleum Institute, released on Tuesday, had shown a surprise draw of 1 million barrels, and had raised hopes the run of stockpile builds might have ended,
U.S. crude futures traded flat at $64.60 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $67.93. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,733.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1944.

(Reuters) - Automakers lifted the German DAX to a record high on Thursday, while broader European stocks inched towards all-time highs after the U.S. Federal Reserve vowed to keep interest rates low despite forecasting a surge in economic growth.
An index of euro zone's top 50 companies gained 0.4%, briefly surpassing its peak hit in February last year before the COVID-19 pandemic hammered financial markets. 
Germany's blue-chip DAX rose 0.9%, France's CAC 40 was up 0.2%, while UK's FTSE 100 slipped ahead of the Bank of England's monetary policy decision due at 1200 GMT. 
The central bank is not expected to change its huge, crisis-fighting stimulus programme despite optimism about an economic recovery.
The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.3%, but eased from early highs due to losses in utilities, chemical and food & beverage stocks.
With the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rising after the Fed decision, economically sensitive sectors such as automakers, banks and miners led the gains in Europe.
A recent rise in government bond yields have stoked worries about a pickup in inflation as trillions in dollars of stimulus help global economies emerge from the pandemic shock.
However, European stocks have benefited as a rise in yields sparked rotation into some of the cheaply valued sectors like bank and energy on hopes of a strong economic rebound.
""We expect further upside for bond yields in response to sharp acceleration in global growth, rising inflation and reduced monetary policy accommodation,"" said Milla Savova, European equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
""In combination with our expectations for a euro area PMI rebound and rising oil price, this would imply around further 15% outperformance of value versus growth by late Q3.""
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) jumped 3.4%, sealing its position as the most valuable company in Germany's DAX after it overtook software maker SAP on Wednesday.
Its shares have racked up a 28% gain so far this week and are on course to record the biggest weekly gain ever after it stepped up its switch to fully electric vehicles.
Swiss lender  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) gained 1.7% after it said it was overhauling its asset management business amid regulatory investigations into its dealings with collapsed Greensill Capital.
Telecoms equipment maker Nokia (NYSE:NOK) slipped 1.0% despite forecasting a pick up in profit margins to 10%-13% in 2023.

Swiss online pharmacy chain Zur Rose fell 7.5% to the bottom of STOXX 600 after disappointing full-year results and outlook.

811,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 05:45AM ET</span>",Treasury Yields Breach More Key Levels as Inflation Bets Surge,"(Bloomberg) -- Treasury yields breached more key levels as bond traders boosted bets that the Federal Reserve will allow inflation to overshoot as the U.S. economy recovers.
Yields on the benchmark 10-year bond climbed as much as 10 basis points to 1.74% -- the highest since January 2020 -- in London trading Thursday. They also breached 2.5% for the 30-year debt, a level that hasn’t been seen since August 2019.
Treasury yields had been surging this year as investors divide into two camps as to whether stimulus spending and vaccine rollouts will drive a sharper global economic recovery and higher inflation. While some see the 10-year yield hitting 2%, others including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). say expectations for sustained inflation gains are misplaced.
“The selloff is likely linked to a combination of rising inflation in the medium-term and the fact that the Fed will have to play catch-up if it stays so long on hold while the economy performs strongly,” said Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Investment Funds SA, adding that the 10-year yield could hit 1.8%.
The breach of 1.7% for the benchmark was followed by more selling as futures volumes surged. During the Tokyo trading session, Treasuries were already under modest pressure, weighed by other markets.
Australian bonds had tumbled after a strong employment report with benchmark yields rising as much as 11 basis points. Japan’s yields briefly climbed higher after Nikkei reported that the Bank of Japan may widen its 10-year yield’s target range at its policy decision on Friday.
The 2% Mark
Treasury 10-year yields are are likely to hit 2% in the short-term as traders continue “digesting the FOMC and coming to the view that stronger U.S. growth, and a Fed more tolerant of higher inflation, mean there is further upside for bond yields,” said Khoon Goh, strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY) Ltd. “The BOJ news also added to that overall sentiment.”
U.S. bonds are lagging German paper, as the spread between each nation’s benchmark hit the widest in a year with the latest selling.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell again indicated that he wasn’t concerned over the recent surge in long-term yields, with his focus still on whether financial conditions remained accommodative. The central bank also reiterated projections that they’ll hold rates near zero through 2023.

812,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 05:35AM ET</span>",Irish assets worth 100 billion euros leave London due to Brexit,"LONDON (Reuters) - Securities settlement for Irish assets worth more than 100 billion euros ($119 billion) has left London for the European Union in the latest adjustment in markets to Brexit.
Pan-European exchange Euronext, which runs the Irish stock exchange, said on Thursday it had completed the migration of securities settlement for 50 Irish companies from Crest in London to Euroclear Bank in Brussels from March 15.
Settlement of EU securities must take place in a central securities depository (CSD) inside the bloc.
While the transfer does not have immediate implications for jobs and tax revenues in Britain, it is a further sign of how its financial services industry is being cut off from the EU. 
The EU had given Crest temporary permission to continue settling Irish securities in London until the migration was completed. Crest is part of the Euroclear group.
The migration follows shifts in euro stock and derivatives trading from London to the bloc, with Brussels now targetting the clearing of derivatives.
""The wholesale migration of settlement of securities from one CSD to another is unprecedented,"" said Daryl Byrne, CEO of Euronext Dublin.
""We now have long-term certainty about the trading and post-trade infrastructure for the Irish market in a post-Brexit world, which ensures that Ireland remains an attractive jurisdiction for listed companies and market participants in the years ahead,"" Byrne said.

(Reuters) -  National Grid  (LON:NG) will buy England's largest electricity distribution business WPD from U.S.-based PPL (NYSE:PPL) for 7.8 billion pounds ($10.9 billion) as it positions itself for a climate-driven transition from gas to electric power.
London-listed National Grid, which took over the English and Welsh power networks in 1990, also said on Thursday it would sell Rhode Island utility the Narragansett Electric Company (NECO) to PPL for $3.8 billion. 
The two companies said the deal for WPD, which runs the power distribution networks for England's midlands and southwest, as well as Wales, had an enterprise value of 14.4 billion pounds, which includes 6.6 billion pounds of debt. 
Shares in National Grid were down 3% to 8.10 pounds, among the biggest losers on the UK blue-chip index, at 0814 GMT.
National Grid, which supplies gas and electricity to millions of customers, said the two deals would increase the proportion of its assets in electricity to 70% from 60%. 
""When we look at the long term, we believe that the pivot that we are making today will enable us to take a much bigger role in the current energy transition,"" National Grid Chief Executive John Pettigrew told a news briefing.
WPD's four distribution network operators (DNOs) deliver electricity to about 7.9 million customers and employ more than 6,500 staff. National Grid said it would maintain the WPD headquarters in the western English city of Bristol.
Western Power Distribution (WPD) is Britain's biggest single power network operator but under the country's partially competitive market, it does not sell directly to end users. 
National Grid owns another part of the system - the high voltage transmission network which takes energy from power plants and circulates it nationally.   
British energy watchdog Ofgem last year gave the go-ahead to 40 billion pounds in spending on its utility networks between 2021-26 in preparation for a shift to more renewable power generation, with the country aiming to achieve net zero by 2050.
National Grid, whose profits have been hit during the coronavirus pandemic by lower industrial and commercial power consumption, plans to invest around 10 billion pounds in the network over a five-year period. 
It also expects to kick off the sale of a majority stake in National Grid Gas, which owns the national gas transmission system, this year. 
""We expect strong interest when the sale process begins,"" Pettigrew said.

814,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 05:05AM ET</span>",Britain to shake up how companies are run and audited,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain proposed weakening the market grip of ""Big Four"" auditors on Thursday and making company directors responsible for spotting fraud after the collapses of retailer BHS and builder Carillion.
Directors would have to repay bonuses if their company went bust or serious failings came to light, and dividends and bonuses would have to be stopped if firms didn't have enough cash - a lesson from the Carillion collapse.
The long-awaited proposals, put out to a four-month public consultation, implement the bulk of recommendations made in three government-backed reports on audit market competition, regulation and corporate governance.
""It's clear from large-scale collapses like Thomas Cook, Carillion and BHS that Britain's audit regime needs to be modernised with a package of sensible, proportionate reforms,"" business minister Kwasi Kwarteng said in a statement.
Some of the proposals are already being introduced in voluntary form, such as operational separation of audit and more lucrative consultancy work at PwC, Deloitte, KPMG and EY - the ""Big Four"" firms that dominate auditing of blue-chip UK companies.
The Financial Reporting Council, criticised by lawmakers for being too timid in regulating auditors, is already undergoing an internal transformation to become the more powerful Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority or ARGA, proposed on Thursday.
The government proposed that smaller audit firms undertake a meaningful portion of a big company audit, stopping short of the joint audit initially recommended by the UK Competition and Markets Authority.
This would help ""challengers"" like Mazars, Grant Thornton and BDO build up expertise to fully take on the Big Four later on. If this competition strategy fails, the Big Four face caps on market share, the government said.
Mazars said targets of at least 20% of total audit fees at challenger auditors for FTSE-350 companies after five years of reform should be set.
COLLECTIVE VS INDIVIDUAL
New reporting obligations would be introduced on both auditors and directors around detecting and preventing fraud.
Company boards would be required to set out what controls they have in place in a British version of the stringent U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley anti-fraud safeguards introduced after energy giant Enron collapsed.
ARGA would have powers to investigate and punish all company directors.
The Institute of Directors said it was appropriate to consider how accountability of directors could be improved, but the collective responsibility of a board should remain the central feature of UK corporate governance.
Accounting experts say such increased responsibilities on directors would mean individuals taking on fewer directorships.
After the consultation ends in July, the government said it would propose legislation when ""parliamentary time allows"".

""We urge ministers to get on with implementation as quickly as possible, with the establishment of the new regulator as the top priority,"" said Michael Izza, CEO of the ICAEW, a professional accounting body.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a mixed fashion Thursday, with strong autos gains helping Germany’s DAX index outperform following a reassuring statement from the Federal Reserve.
At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.7% higher, climbing to a new all-time high, the CAC 40 in France grew 0.1%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was 0.2% lower.
The Federal Reserve concluded its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, and reassured investors that it was committed to maintaining an accommodative monetary policy for some time. 
Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that while inflation is expected to reach 2.4% this year, above the central bank's 2% target, this would be a temporary surge and he did not currently see the Fed raising its benchmark overnight interest rate through 2023. The central bank also projected the U.S. economy will grow by a massive 6.5% this year.
The news that the world’s largest economy, and global growth driver, was set to expand strongly without near term interest rate hikes has resulted in strong gains in the economically sensitive sectors in Europe, led by automakers and banks.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) stock jumped 10%, continuing recent gains which have made the car manufacturer the most valuable company in Germany's DAX, as it makes a jump into the electric car market.
BMW (DE:BMWG) stock also rose 3.7%, continuing Wednesday’s gains after it was upbeat on its own electric car sales.
 Renault  (PA:RENA) stock rose 3.4% after it announced Thursday that it will collaborate with  Solvay  (BR:SOLB) and Veolia Environnement (PA:VIE) to recycle electric-vehicle batteries.
In the banking sector,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) stock climbed 2% despite Swiss bank’s annual report showing its executives earned 12% less in total compensation in 2020.
The stocks of Banco BPM (MI:BAMI), Unicredit (MI:CRDI), Intesa (OTC:ISNPY), BBVA (MC:BBVA), Caixabank (MC:CABK),  Bankia  (MC:BKIA) and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) all hit 52-week highs Thursday.
However, it's not all good news. The European Medicines Agency’s safety review into the controversial Covid-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and the University of Oxford is due to be released later Thursday. This follows several European countries delaying their vaccination programs further by pausing the use of this vaccine over blood clot safety concerns.
Additionally, in the U.K., which has been one of the vaccination success stories, the country’s National Health Service warned of a ""significant reduction in the weekly supply"" of vaccines next month, citing supply issues. 
The Bank of England will hand down its latest policy decision later in the session, but the market isn’t expecting any significant changes.
Oil prices weakened Thursday after data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed another rise in U.S. crude inventories, of 2.4 million barrels last week, prompting worries of a sustained hit to demand.
U.S. crude futures traded 1% lower at $63.94 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1% to $67.29.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,735.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1945.

816,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 04:56AM ET</span>",Analysis: China delivers on threats to rein in internet economy,"By Tony Munroe and Pei Li
(Reuters) - On Tuesday, Chinese livestreaming e-commerce came under scrutiny. On Thursday, it was ""deepfakes"". And earlier this month, Chinese authorities imposed fines on operators of community group buying platforms.
Beijing is making good on its threats to clamp down on the sprawling ""platform economy"", with President Xi Jinping weighing in on the need to rein in behemoths that play a dominant role in the country's consumer sector. 
The drumbeat of warnings, fines and de-platformings of Chinese digital heavyweights started with last year's shelving of Ant Group's $37 billion IPO and has expanded across the sector, battering share prices and prompting some operators to take pre-emptive measures before they are punished.
""With the rapid development of the digital economy, people's lives have become inseparable from internet platforms,"" the official China Daily wrote on Thursday.
""However, after capturing the market, some platforms have abandoned their due social responsibilities and they are trying to monopolize the sector by becoming 'slaves' of capital"".
Chinese internet giants led by billionaire Jack Ma's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), as well as Tencent, ByteDance and a handful of others built immense scale and market power under an era of laissez faire treatment that ended dramatically with the halting of Alibaba affiliate Ant's listing in November.
That was followed by a spate of fines imposed on companies for failing to submit past acquisitions for anti-trust review, as well as an anti-trust probe into Alibaba and its ""one-from-two"" practice of forcing vendors to sell product on only one e-commerce site.
The momentum has intensified.
On Friday, China's market regulator fined 12 companies, including Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), Tencent, and Didi Chuxing over 10 deals that violated anti-monopoly rules.
On Monday night, Alibaba's UC Browser, which claims more than 400 million monthly active users, was shamed on state TV's annual consumer rights show for pushing advertisements by unqualified medical firms. UC apologised, but the app vanished from Chinese Android app stores.
That followed a Monday meeting chaired by Xi that warned of the risks of the ""irregular"" development of some platforms.
""The platform economy is not fully developed and has shortcomings, and we have a prominent problem of the regulatory system not adjusting to this issue,"" a readout by the official Xinhua news agency said.
This week, sources said Alibaba plans to bring its Taobao cut-price retail service to rival Tencent's ubiquitous WeChat messaging app, from which Taobao had blocked access since 2013. The move comes as Alibaba is under regulatory pressure and faces a growing challenge from Tencent-backed  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD).
Alibaba did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""There are millions of merchants on the platform economy in China and big platforms are squeezing more profits from them. So it makes sense for the regulators to weigh in and protect their interests,"" said Li Chengdong, a Beijing-based tech and e-commerce analyst.
'LONG BATTLE'
On Thursday, China's internet watchdog said it had summoned 11 firms including Alibaba, Tencent and ByteDance to discuss ""deepfakes"", which use artificial intelligence to create hyper-realistic but fake videos or audios where a person appears to say or do something they did not.
It also told the companies to ""conduct security assessments on their own"" and flag new functions or services that ""have the ability to mobilise society"", an apparent reference to the surge in Chinese copycats of U.S. audio app Clubhouse, which was blocked by Chinese censors in early February.
Reuters reported last month that Chinese tech giants were lawyering up, anticipating a widening crackdown. 
Liu Xingliang, a member of a committee led by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said platform companies had grown too big, forcing the government to act.

""It is a long battle and more actions can be expected,"" he told Reuters.

817,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 04:45AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse rejigs asset management under regulatory glare,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Rachel Armstrong
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) is overhauling its asset management business amid regulatory investigations into its dealings with collapsed Greensill Capital, the bank said on Thursday, warning the scandal could hit its results and client confidence. 
Switzerland's second-biggest bank and its asset management arm have been reeling over the collapse of around $10 billion of funds related to British supply chain financier Greensill, heaping pressure on CEO Thomas Gottstein, who said on Tuesday he was scrutinising the business's structure.
In its annual report, the lender said Swiss regulator FINMA was one watchdog looking into the matter, and reviewing it in relation to the bank's ""Pillar 2"" buffer - a pool of capital banks have to ensure they can withstand risks.
Credit Suisse also named Ulrich Koerner as the new head of asset management and said it would separate the business into its own division from April 1. It is currently part of the international wealth division run by Philipp Wehle.
In the annual report, the bank said some unidentified investors had threatened litigation over the matter, whose ultimate cost ""may be material"" to operating results. 
""We might also suffer reputational harm associated with these matters that might cause client departures or loss of assets under management,"" it added.
Vontobel analyst Andreas Venditti said the bank's emphasis of the new asset management division's ""strategic importance"" meant a sale of that business was unlikely.
Credit Suisse shares were up 1.5% in early trade. 
Koerner returns to the bank from arch-rival UBS, where he most recently served as senior adviser to the CEO from 2019 to 2020. He ran UBS Asset Management from 2014 to 2019. Koerner was previously a senior executive at Credit Suisse Financial Services and ran its Swiss business.
Current asset management head Eric Varvel, who is also chairman of Credit Suisse's investment bank and head of its U.S. holding company, will focus on his other roles. 
""Ulrich Koerner is an excellent addition to our leadership team, reinforcing its values and performance culture,"" Gottstein said in a statement. ""Ueli is a strong leader and strategic thinker with proven ability in business development and profitable growth in asset management, as well as in business transformation.""
Three senior asset management employees who helped oversee the Greensill funds, including the head of the business for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, have temporarily stepped aside.

The bank's annual report showed the payout and vesting of bonuses for a number of senior employees involved in these matters, ""up to and including Executive Board members"", had been suspended.

818,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 04:45AM ET</span>",Powell Faces Tough Campaign to Convince Traders of Fed’s Resolve,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve succeeded in pushing back against market expectations for a rate hike in the next two years, but only partially.
The central bank envisages keeping rates near zero to the end of 2023 despite a significantly brighter assessment of growth and higher inflation over the near term. After the release, traders trimmed some of the more-aggressive positioning they’ve been building for a “lift-off” by earlier in 2023.
But a 25 basis-point hike by the first quarter that year is still reflected in Eurodollar futures, which are priced off Libor and are a decent proxy for future borrowing costs. So traders haven’t exactly brought their views on the timing that much closer to the central bank’s guidance.
“The market will need to be reminded again and again of the Fed’s commitment” to support the recovery, said Anne Mathias, global rates and currencies strategist at Vanguard Group Inc. “If higher yields don’t slow the economy down, don’t upset the stock market, don’t upset risk-taking, then the Fed doesn’t need to push back hard against them,” she said in an interview.
Current rates-market pricing reflects a lingering conviction that the pace of the recovery will spur the Fed to action, earlier than it anticipates, though Chair Jerome Powell reiterated Wednesday that the Fed needs to see “substantial further progress” on its employment and inflation goals before thinking about a hike.
That statement helped short-end rates fall. Seven-year yields remained elevated, however, which suggests positioning for higher interest rates may be building further out the curve. A later rate hike could force the central bank to move faster to tame inflation.
Market gauges of inflation expectations imply some faith in the central bank’s ability to keep it under control. The five-year breakeven rate, which is derived from the difference between yields on Treasuries and their inflation-protected counterparts, is around the highest since 2008, at 2.63%. That compares with a lower 10-year breakeven rate showing price pressures returning to the Fed’s target over the decade.
That chimes with the Fed’s guidance, in Mathias’s view.
“We’re going to see some interim inflation pressure from pent-up spending,” she said. “Net-net, though, the overall secular forces that have kept inflation at bay have not changed.”

Gottstein, who became head of the bank last February after Thiam's abrupt departure, was granted 8.53 million Swiss francs ($9.24 million) in total compensation.
Gottstein has been trying to move Credit Suisse on from a string of bad headlines, spanning a spy scandal that ousted predecessor Thiam to a $450 million write-down on a hedge fund investment. The recent collapse of around $10 billion of funds related to British supply chain financier Greensill has put fresh pressure on him.
His awarded pay compared to 10.7 million Swiss francs Thiam was granted in his last full year at the bank. Thiam's pay had been cut 15% that year.
The report on Thursday showed Thiam was not compensated for the start of 2020.
""For 2020, no compensation payments were made to former Executive Board members who left Credit Suisse, which was also the case for 2019,"" the bank wrote in the report. ""Further, no payments were made to former Executive Board members pursuant to non-compete arrangements.""
Executives earned 12% less in total aggregate compensation in 2020, the report showed, while the bank's overall bonus pool fell 7% to 2.949 billion francs.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese courts delivered conflicting rulings on two nuclear reactors on Wednesday, lifting an injunction on one and slapping a no-restart order on another, highlighting the fitful state of the industry's recovery 10 years after the Fukushima disaster.
The rulings come after Japan's atomic regulator publicly rebuked Fukushima operator Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) this week for security lapses that make it unlikely the company can restart its only remaining nuclear station soon. Tepco's shares slumped 10% on Wednesday.
Shares in Shikoku Electric Power shot up on Thursday after a high court in western Japan overturned a lower court ruling that had kept the company's only usable reactor shut down for nearly 18 months.
The lower court had ruled that there was insufficient attention to the threat from earthquakes in the design of the facility.
""The court has accepted our assertion that the safety of unit No. 3 at Ikata Power Station has been ensured,"" Shikoku Electric said in a statement after the ruling, which sent the company's shares more than 6% higher.
It was the second time the Ikata reactor had been shut down by a court as anti-nuclear residents and campaigners filed multiple injunction requests in the wake of the Fukushima disaster.
Court rulings have contributed to the haphazard return of the sector a decade after the Fukushima meltdowns but only nine reactors have received approval to restart, out of 54 before the disaster. Only four are operating at present.
In another case, a court ruled on Thursday that an old reactor near Tokyo must stay shut.
It closed down automatically 10 years ago when one of the biggest earthquakes in world history caused a tsunami that swamped nuclear plants up and down the Japanese coast and sparked the Fukushima meltdowns.

The Tokai Dai Ni reactor operated by Japan Atomic Power is one of Japan's oldest and needed special approval to extend its life. Opposition to a restart is expected to make it difficult to return the unit to operation after years of costly upgrades.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening mixed Thursday, with investors digesting a reassuring statement from the Federal Reserve as well as problems with the region’s Covid vaccination program.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.3% but the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.5%.
The Federal Reserve concluded its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, and reassured investors that it was committed to maintaining an accommodative monetary policy for some time. 
Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that while inflation is expected to reach 2.4% this year, above the central bank's 2% target, this would be a temporary surge and he did not currently see the Fed raising its benchmark overnight interest rate through 2023. 
The Fed also projected the U.S. economy will grow by a hefty 6.5% this year, thanks in part to massive federal fiscal stimulus and optimism around the success of coronavirus vaccines.
Back in Europe, the region’s vaccination program has been more problematic, with the European Medicines Agency’s safety review into the Covid-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and the University of Oxford due to be released later Thursday.
A number of European countries have suspended the use of this vaccine over blood clot worries, despite the World Health Organization and the EMA defending the use of the drug.
In the U.K., which has been one of the world's vaccination success stories, the country’s National Health Service warned of a ""significant reduction in the weekly supply"" of vaccines next month, citing supply issues. 
Elsewhere, the Bank of England will hand down its latest policy decision later in the session, but the market isn’t expecting any significant changes.
In corporate news, earnings are expected from the likes of  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) and Fevertree Drinks (LON:FEVR), while  Credit Suisse  's (SIX:CSGN) annual report showed the Swiss bank’s executives earned 12% less in total compensation in 2020. The U.K.'s  National Grid  PLC (LON:NG) meanwhile said it plans to sell a majority stake in its gas transmission business later this year.
Oil prices weakened Thursday after government data showed another rise in U.S. crude inventories, prompting worries of a sustained hit to demand.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday that crude stocks rose by 2.4 million barrels last week, for the fourth consecutive week after refineries in the southern states were forced to shut due to severe cold weather. 
Data from the American Petroleum Institute, released on Tuesday, had shown a surprise draw of 1 million barrels, and had raised hopes the run of stockpile builds might have ended,
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $64.45 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $67.81.
Additionally, gold futures rose 1.3% to $1,750.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1985.

TOKYO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Asian shares and U.S. stock futures rose on Thursday after the Federal Reserve committed to maintaining accommodative monetary policy and projected a rapid jump in U.S. economic growth this year as the COVID-19 crisis eases.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.87%, while stocks in China rose 0.74%. Australia's market bucked the trend and fell 0.73%. 
E-mini futures for the S&P 500 edged up by 0.7%.
Euro Stoxx 50 futures were up 0.52%, German DAX futures rose 0.75%, and FTSE futures were up 0.4%, pointing to a bright start to European trading.  
While inflation is expected to reach 2.4% this year, above the central bank's 2% target, Fed Chair Jerome Powell called it a temporary surge that will not change the Fed's pledge to keep its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero.
Long-term Treasury yields remained elevated and the yield curve steepened as bond investors chose to focus more on rising inflation expectations.
The yen erased losses and government bond yields briefly rose after a media report that the Bank of Japan will agree to allow yields to trade in a wider band when it ends a two-day policy meeting on Friday.
""If the Fed isn't going to induce tightening, it's very bullish for risky assets,"" said Teresa Kong, head of fixed income and portfolio manager at Matthews Asia. ""We should be seeing a mild rally in Asian assets and currencies.""
Shares in South Korea and Singapore also jumped more than 1%, taking their lead from a strong session on Wall Street.
The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Wednesday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 33,000 points for the first time, bolstered by the Fed's strong economic forecast and Powell's comments that it is too early to discuss tapering-off measures.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.35% to approach an all-time high.
The Fed projected the U.S. economy would grow by 6.5% this year - the largest annual output growth since 1984 - thanks in part to massive federal fiscal stimulus and optimism around the success of coronavirus vaccines.
""It's sort of shocking ... that officially the United States government believes it will grow faster than the Chinese government believes it will grow this year,"" said Christopher Smart, chief global strategist at Barings Investment Institute in Boston, calling it a ""head-turning moment for investors."" The yen erased losses and steadied at 108.94 per dollar after the Nikkei newspaper said the BOJ will allow 10-year bonds to move up to 0.25% above or below zero, which is slightly wider than the current band of 0.2%.
Japan's benchmark 10-year government bond yield briefly rose and futures fell, but the focus shifts to the outcome of the BOJ's meeting on Friday.
The Australian dollar jumped to a two-week high of $0.7835 after data showed the nation's economy created more than twice as many jobs as expected in February. 
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields edged up to 1.6639%, not far from the highest since January last year. 
The spread between two-year and 10-year U.S. yields, the most-keenly monitored part of the yield curve, rose to 155 basis points, which is the steepest since September 2015.
The 10-year inflation breakeven rate hit 2.309%, which shows that inflation expectations are at the highest since January 2014.
Oil futures extended declines, weighed down by rising U.S. crude inventories and by expectations of weaker demand in Europe, where the coronavirus vaccine roll out is faltering.
Brent crude fell 0.63% to $67.57 a barrel, and U.S. crude declined by 0.57% to $64.23.

Spot gold rose 0.35% to $1,750.83 per ounce by 0119 GMT, while U.S. gold futures climbed 1.1% to $1,745.80 per ounce as the Fed's pledge to keep rates low and worries about inflation pushed up the precious metal.

825,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 01:45AM ET</span>",Nikola strategic partner Hanwha to cut its bet on electric-truck maker by half,"(Reuters) - Nikola Corp said on Wednesday that South Korea's Hanwha Corp has decided to sell up to half of its stake this year, setting out to reduce its bets on the prospects of the electric-truck maker.7 
Green Nikola Holdings, a subsidiary through which Hanwha holds its 5.65% stake in Nikola, is planning to sell up to 11.1 million shares, according to a securities exchange filing. 
The shares will be worth about $180 million based on Nikola's last closing price of $16.39.
A Hanwha Group spokesperson said it will use the proceeds to invest in hydrogen-related businesses, adding that the potential sales is not an end of cooperation with Nikola.
Hanwha Group first acquired a stake in November 2018, much before Nikola debuted on the Nasdaq in June last year. The company's shares have since then nearly halved in value. 
Nikola and its founder Trevor Milton were subpoenaed by the U.S. Department of Justice in November last year following allegations of fraud by short-seller Hindenburg.
It claimed that Milton, who has since resigned as chairman, had made false claims about the company's proprietary technology to form partnerships with large automakers.
The company is also being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in connection with the allegations.
Last month, following an internal review, the electric-truck maker said the company and its founder Trevor Milton had made several statements that were partially or completely inaccurate.
""Hanwha remains an important strategic partner and continues to play an active role on Nikola's board of directors,"" Nikola said in a statement to Reuters. 

Nikola shares were up 3.4% in after-market trading.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Markets may be less fearful of a “taper tantrum” after the Federal Reserve's latest meeting, but the prospect of higher yields and a steeper yield curve is likely to remain a major focus for investors.
This is especially true if the United States continues to outpace most of the world in its rebound from last year’s COVID-19 fueled economic decline. 
GRAPHIC: Still depressed - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjpqlyagvx/Pasted%20image%201616001879124.png 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday pledged to keep rates at record lows for years to come, despite expectations of a sharp acceleration in growth and inflation this year as the COVID-19 crisis ebbs. 
The dovish comments sent yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which move inversely to bond prices, down from the 13-month high touched earlier in the session to close at 1.6462%.
For investors concerned that rising yields would continue disrupting some areas of the stock market by dimming the allure of sectors such as technology, the Fed’s comments came as a relief. 
Despite the increase, yields remain low by historical standards after a four-decade bull market in bonds that was accelerated by the Fed’s response to the great financial crisis more than a decade ago. 
The recent rise, which took the 10-year to a high of 1.69% from 0.50% in August, has also been less violent than some yield surges of the past. It took roughly seven months for 10-year Treasury yields to rise by about 120 basis points, compared with a rise of about 137 basis over a four-month period in 2013.
GRAPHIC: Steeper and steeper - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmpjwnjwvr/Pasted%20image%201616004075552.png 
STEEPER AND STEEPER
One factor that has grabbed investors’ attention in the recent move has been a faster rise in yields on longer-dated bonds compared with those on shorter-dated debt, as seen in the gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes.
Yields on longer-dated bonds tend to outpace shorter-term yields when the market expects an environment of stronger growth, higher inflation or interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
Right now the spread is the widest it has been since 2015.
GRAPHIC: Taper tantrum - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdpxexalvx/Pasted%20image%201616004913931.png 
TANTRUM MINUS THE TAPER
Investors have also been worried about a possible repeat of the “taper tantrum” that markets experienced in 2013, when yields jumped on expectations of a tapering of stimulus. In 2013 this occurred after then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke told lawmakers the Fed could reduce its pace of purchases of assets that had been propping markets. 
Though Powell’s comments may have temporarily assuaged those concerns, they are likely to creep up again if burgeoning economic growth continues to fuel speculation of sooner-than-expected monetary tightening.
GRAPHIC: The biggest slice - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-MARKETS/BONDS/xlbpgxlzjvq/chart.png 
Higher yields have slowed a blistering rally in technology and other growth stocks that have helped lead the S&P 500 on a 80% rally from last year’s lows. 
Rising yields can be particularly harmful to tech stocks, which make up about 27% of the S&P 500 by market capitalization, as they threaten to erode the value of their longer term cash flows. 
At the same time, the increase in yields have helped lift financials and some other undervalued stocks, accelerating a rotation from growth to value that has gripped markets this year.
Russell's 1000 ""growth"" index is up 1% for the quarter-to-date, versus a gain of 11% for its value counterpart. 
GRAPHIC: Playing catch-up - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegvbgoqqpq/Pasted%20image%201616006876319.png 
MORE BANG FOR THE BUCK

Higher yields could also boost the attractiveness of the U.S. dollar relative to other major currencies. The dollar index, which is down about 10% from late March last year, has seen a limited boost so far. Persistently higher yields along with a rise in ""real"" yields - adjusted for inflation - could provide a lift to the dollar, helping the dollar index pull away further from the near 3-year low touched in January.

Investing.com – South Korea’s SK Bioscience Ltd. saw its shares soar in their KOSPI board debut on Thursday.
The shares opened at KRW130,000 ($115.078) and were trading at KRW169,000 at 12:16 AM ET (4:16 AM GMT), valuing the company at KRW 12.9 trillion and raising KRW 1.5 trillion. SK Bioscience had priced the shares at KRW65,000.
Investor bets on the COVID-19 vaccine developer’s prospects drove shares up as much as 30%, the best opening day on the bourse since global EV parts supplier Myoung Shin Industry’s December 2020 listing. The listing even raised more than the successful IPOs by game developer Kakao Games and affiliate SK Biopharmaceuticals in 2020, and according to Korea Exchange data, is the largest IPO since mobile game developer Netmarble’s KRW2.7 trillion listing in May 2017.
Some investors predict that the South Korean IPO market will remain busy in 2021. Strong investor demand is expected to drive more listings by companies in sectors that are profiting from increased health concerns and stay-at-home habits driven by COVID-19.
The company, in which SK Chemical holds a 68.4% stake, is producing the COVID-19 vaccines for AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN)/University of Oxford and  Novavax  Inc. (NASDAQ:NVAX) in Korea. It received regulatory approval to begin clinical trials for its own candidate in November 2020.
“SK Bioscience gained an opportunity to become a global vaccine company by being chosen to develop and produce for the COVID-19 vaccine purchasing scheme known as COVAX,” Park's colleague Byung-Hwa Han told Reuters.
“It’s the only company chosen that conducts development and manufacturing simultaneously... after [vaccine] approval, revenue will begin to come in the second half,” Han added before shares began trading."

LONDON/BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) on Thursday warned companies that rely on nature or have an impact on natural habitats to publish a ""no deforestation"" policy and their strategy on biodiversity or face pushback from the asset manager at their annual meetings.
The world's biggest asset manager is keen to position itself as a leader in sustainable finance and over the last year has looked to take a tougher position on companies not performing on environmental, social and governance related issues.
How companies manage 'natural capital,' such as water and forests, is seen as an integral part of their response to climate change and a driver of value for shareholders.
""All companies rely on natural capital in some way and, as the world transitions to a low-carbon economy, we ask companies to demonstrate how they are minimizing their negative impacts on, and ideally enhancing the stock of, the natural capital on which their long-term financial performance depends,"" BlackRock said in a report detailing its engagement priorities for 2021.
While BlackRock, which manages around $8.7 trillion in assets, has previously engaged with companies on the topic, the report lays out its position in more detail for the first time.
Going forward, BlackRock said companies should disclose how their business practices are consistent with the sustainable use of natural capital, and address their impact on local communities.
Those with a material dependence or impact on natural habitats, should publish a ""no deforestation"" policy and strategy on biodiversity.
""We may take ... action at companies by voting against the re-election of responsible board directors when companies have not effectively managed, overseen or disclosed natural capital-related risks,"" it said.

""We may also vote for relevant shareholder proposals addressing material natural capital risks if we believe a company could better manage such risks or report on its approach.""

Alongside its decision, handed down on Wednesday, the Fed said that it expected inflation to reach 2.4% above its 2% target, in 2021. However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell shrugged it off as a temporary surge that will not change the central bank’s pledge to keep its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero through to 2023.
Powell’s dovish stance on inflation and the recent spike in bond yields sent yields on shorter-dated Treasuries tumbling, with the ten and 30-year benchmarks retreated from their highest levels in over a year.

“It’s sort of shocking... that officially the U.S. government believes it will grow faster than the Chinese government believes it will grow this year,” Barings Investment Institute chief global strategist Christopher Smart told Reuters, adding that it was a “head-turning moment for investors.”
Markets had expected the Fed to take a more hawkish tone, as the global economic recovery continues thanks to continued progress on COVID-19 vaccines and the $1.9 trillion stimulus package signed into law earlier in the month. The growing concern about rising inflation drove bond yields up and triggered a rotation from growth stocks to value shares.
Other investors were more optimistic, however, after being reassured by the renewed emphasis on continued policy support.
“It looks like up, up, and away from here” for equities, Mahjabeen Zaman,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Australia senior investment specialist, told Bloomberg.
“We’re moving into value plays because we’re very clear PEs for growth stocks, in particular, are exceptionally high” and will be hit by higher yields, she added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. auto safety agency said on Wednesday it will send a team to investigate a crash involving a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) suspected of being in Autopilot mode when it struck a parked Michigan State Police patrol car.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it was sending the Special Crash Investigation (SCI) team in line with its oversight and authority ""over the safety of all motor vehicles and equipment, including automated technologies.""
Tesla did not immediately comment.
Michigan State Police said on Twitter a parked patrol car was struck at 1:12 am Wednesday, while investigating a traffic crash between a car and deer near Lansing on Interstate-96.
""While investigating that crash with their emergency lights on, a Tesla on autopilot strikes the patrol car,"" the agency said. No one was injured and the 22-year-old Tesla driver was issued traffic citations.
Before this week, NHTSA previously launched at least 14 SCI teams following Tesla crashes that were suspected of being tied to its Autopilot driver assistance system. The agency has taken no action as a result of those probes.
On Monday, NHTSA said it was sending another SCI team to investigate a ""violent"" March 11 crash in Detroit in which a Tesla became wedged underneath a tractor-trailer and left a passenger in critical condition.
Detroit police said Tuesday they do not believe that Autopilot was in use the March 11 crash based on ""all indications.""
Autopilot has been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016.
Concerns have grown about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches with little or no human intervention, but cannot completely replace human drivers.
Tesla advises drivers they must keep their hands on the steering wheel and pay attention while using Autopilot. However, some Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid putting their hands on the wheel for extended periods when using Autopilot.

In February 2020, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) sharply criticized Tesla's lack of system safeguards in a fatal 2018 Autopilot crash in California.

832,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 07:55PM ET</span>",Huawei CFO lawyer says Canadian police officials were 'less than truthful' in testimony,"By Sarah Berman
VANCOUVER (Reuters) - A lawyer for Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou charged in court on Wednesday that Canadian police witnesses gave ""less than truthful"" testimony when confronted with alleged abuses of process during her extradition hearings.
The allegation was part of a wider ""pattern of misconduct"" that Meng's lawyers argue should lead to her release from house arrest in Vancouver and rejection of the U.S. extradition request.
As Meng returned to court fighting her extradition case, the two Canadians who were detained by China on espionage charges shortly after Meng's arrest will face trial in Chinese courts starting this week, the Canadian government said.
The case has soured relations between Ottawa and Beijing.
Meng, 49, was arrested on a U.S. warrant on Dec. 1, 2018, during a stopover at Vancouver International Airport. She is accused by the United States of misleading HSBC about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's business dealings in Iran, putting the bank at risk of violating U.S. sanctions.
She denies the charges and has asked the extradition request be thrown out because her rights were violated.
Defense lawyer Tony Paisana said authorities on both sides of the border failed in their duties to conduct themselves honorably and transparently, listing many alleged violations of Meng's rights in submissions to the court on Wednesday.
'UNPRECEDENTED ACT'
Paisana said U.S. authorities made misrepresentations in their request for her extradition, that Canadian police disregarded an order to arrest Meng immediately, that her devices were seized without proper authority, and her device passcodes were improperly obtained.
""What we say animated much of this misconduct was an overarching preoccupation on the part of Canadian authorities to appease and otherwise comply with demands received from the FBI,"" Paisana said. ""At nearly every turn, the authorities prioritized U.S. requests over Ms. Meng's rights,"" he added.
Paisana said Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Staff Sergeant Ben Chang's refusal to testify during extradition hearings in late 2020 was an ""unprecedented act"" and amounted to a deliberate and flagrant disregard of police responsibilities.
He said officers who did appear as witnesses last year provided ""less than truthful"" testimony when confronted with alleged abuses of process.
Paisana said RCMP Constable Winston Yep gave testimony ""bordering on the absurd"" when defending his decision to allow border agents to question Meng before her arrest by police.
Yep suggested Meng could have had knives or a counter-surveillance team with her on the plane, Paisana recalled of earlier testimony.
The RCMP was not immediately available for response to a Reuters request for comment.
Paisana said the Canadian Border Service Agency’s interrogation of Meng was ""pointless"" unless its true purpose was not related to immigration. He said the defense intended to prove the interrogation had an investigatory goal and that the coordination between agencies was unlawful.

Canada has called for two of Meng's main arguments in her extradition case to be dismissed, saying her claims are not backed with evidence and that one issue has been ruled on, court documents released on Tuesday showed.

833,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 07:36PM ET</span>",Mexican president pressures Canadian miner over union dispute,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico could revoke a concession held by Canadian miner Americas Gold and Silver Corp in northern Mexico if it does not accept its new trade union representation there, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Wednesday.
Speaking at a regular news conference, Lopez Obrador said he would direct his foreign minister to speak to Canadian officials about the dispute playing out at Toronto-based Americas Gold and Silver's San Rafael mine, located in Sinaloa state.
Lopez Obrador, a frequent critic of the mining sector's footprint in Mexico, said the company had rejected the outcome of a vote by workers at the mine to put labor representation under the control of a national miners trade union led by a close ally of his who also serves as a ruling party senator.
Americas Gold and Silver needed to honor the result or it would be failing to uphold Mexico's labor laws, Lopez Obrador said.
""This shouldn't be understood as a threat or even a warning,"" said the president, who has vowed to strengthen the rights of workers in Mexico. ""But if they don't respect the law, the government can revoke the concession.""
Later on Wednesday, Americas Gold and Silver responded to the president's remarks, saying it was the victim of ""extortion and organized crime"" that has masqueraded as a workers' rights issue for over a year.
It pointed to a detailed chronology on its website, where it argues its mine has been victimized by an illegal blockade.
""If, and when, safe access to our facilities can be assured for our employees and we are free from the source of this extortion scheme that threatens us all, we would be happy to engage in any kind of labor discussion,"" the company said in a statement.
Americas Gold and Silver's collective bargaining agreement with its workers expired a year ago.
The company said Lopez Obrador's comment about the possible cancellation of its concession was ""concerning,"" but expressed confidence that there is no legal basis for such action. 

Lopez Obrador was responding to a question from a reporter about the dispute, and did not mention the company by name.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday ordered billionaire Macau real estate developer Ng Lap Seng's early release from prison, rejecting prosecutors' argument that Ng's receiving a COVID-19 vaccine negated the basis to free him.
Ng, 72, has served 34 months of his four-year term following his 2017 conviction for bribing two United Nations ambassadors, including former General Assembly President John Ashe, to win support for a multibillion-dollar conference center he hoped to build in Macau.
U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick in Manhattan had on Monday ordered Ng's ""compassionate release,"" citing Ng's worsening health and saying he would be safer in Macau than in a Pennsylvania prison with hundreds of COVID-19 cases.
Prosecutors asked the judge to reconsider, saying Ng was receiving  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's COVID-19 vaccine, with his second dose expected by March 26. The judge, who had not known Ng was being vaccinated, rejected that request.
""There's a certain level of humanity that I've decided to exercise,"" Broderick said at a hearing. 
Prosecutors had argued that the vaccination ""substantially diminishes"" Ng's argument for early freedom.
""Mr. Ng is not a danger to himself or anyone else because he is fully vaccinated,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Richenthal argued before Broderick ruled. ""That changes things.""
A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in Manhattan declined to comment.
Ng is expected to be fully vaccinated and transferred to the custody of immigration officials before flying home. He had been eligible for release on Dec. 23.
Broderick ""understood the human toll that changing his mind would have imposed on Mr. Ng, to first being told you are going home only to then be told that the court had changed his mind,"" Ng's lawyer Benjamin Brafman said in an email. ""That additional trauma was not something he would allow.""

The case is U.S. v. Ng, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00706.

836,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 04:41PM ET</span>","Travel Stocks, Home Builders, Fear Gauge: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve held rates steady as expected and said it was in no rush to raise them, and naturally that propelled both the Dow and the S&P 500 to all-time highs on Wednesday.
As the $1.9 trillion stimulus started to hit individual bank accounts on Wednesday, the central bank again brushed off concerns about rising inflation.
The economic reopening continues to lift shares of everything from home builders to live entertainment operators such as Walt  Disney  Company (NYSE:DIS), which will open its Disneyland theme park in Southern California next month.
The weekly jobless report on Thursday, which comes out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT) will provide investors another reading on the health of the economic recovery. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Travel stocks measure of the success of the recovery
Cruise operators are awaiting word when they can begin to set said again as more older Americans show interest in travel now that many have received their vaccines. Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corporation (NYSE:CCL) is up 121% in the last year in anticipation of an eventual return to the seas.  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd  (NYSE:NCLH) is up 204%.
As cruise operators see improved outlook for demand, airplane stocks will also likely benefit from upcoming spring holiday travel.  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) is up 61% in the last year, while United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) hit a new 52-week high on Wednesday.
2. Homebuilders set to gain from stimulus
 Lennar  Corporation (NYSE:LEN)set the tone for other home builders on Wednesday, rising 13% to a 52-week high. That came after it reported revenue that topped expectations.
Lennar announced earnings per share of $3.20 on revenue of $5.33 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.71 on revenue of $5.12 billion.
Other home builders responded. PulteGroup Inc (NYSE:PHM) jumped 4%, as did  Toll Brothers  Inc (NYSE:TOL).
3. How high can the Dow go?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average pierced through 33,000 to close at yet another record high on Wednesday, pumped by the Fed’s promise not to raise rates any time soon. It only hit the 32,000 milestone five trading days ago.
At the same time the CBOE Volatility Index, aka, Wall Street’s “fear gauge” has come down, dropping another 2.8% on Wednesday to below 20. That is the lowest since last March. Low volatility, such as was seen during the pre-Covid market, is considered a bullish sign for stocks.

837,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 04:30PM ET</span>",S&P 500 ends at record high after Fed projects stronger economy,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at record highs on Wednesday after the Fed predicted a fast economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and said it would maintain its interest rate at close to zero.
In its statement following its two-day policy meeting, the Federal Reserve projected a rapid jump in U.S. economic growth and inflation this year as the COVID-19 crisis winds down, and repeated its pledge to keep its target interest rate near zero for years to come. 
Wall Street extended gains after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during a news conference that it is too early to discuss tapering-off measures to support the struggling economy.
""The Fed statement today was more optimistic than some expected, they raised their outlook for both economic growth and the labor market. The market’s view of the statement is that it was fairly optimistic,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York.
A $1.9 trillion spending stimulus and the rollout of vaccines have fueled a rotation into so-called value stocks that are viewed as likely to outperform as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. 
At the same time, worries that the stimulus could overheat the economy and lead to higher inflation rates have triggered a strong rise in long-duration Treasury yields and made technology and other growth stocks less attractive.
Following the Fed's statement, the yield on 10-year Treasuries ticked lower to 1.6374%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.58% to end at 33,015.37 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.29% to 3,974.12. 
The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.4% to 13,525.20.
The Nasdaq remains down about 4% from its Feb. 12 record-high close.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) rose 1.4% and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc added 3.7%, with the two companies giving the greatest lift to the S&P 500. 
Six out of 11 S&P 500 sector indexes rose, with industrials and consumer discretionary the strongest performers and both up over 1%.
Fast-food retailer McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) gained 1.9% after  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) raised its target price on the stock and also upgraded its recommendation to ""buy"" from ""hold.""
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.33-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.46-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 44 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 124 new highs and 18 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.9 billion shares, compared with the 14.2 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 and Dow hit records Wednesday riding a sharp intraday reversal in tech stocks after bond yields were given their marching orders as the Federal Reserve said it was no hurry to lift rates despite signs the recovery is taking shape.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.58%, or 190 points, to a closing record of 33,015.397, and the S&P 500 rose 0.30% to close at a record fo 3,974.71. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.40%, but had been down more than 1% intraday. 
The Federal Open Market Committee left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 0% to 0.25% and said it would continue its $120 billion monthly bond purchases.
The central bank's policymakers appear in no hurry to hike rates, continuing to back them at near-zero through 2023 despite hiking their outlook on growth. 
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield retreated from 13-month high following the decision, helping tech cut losses and turn positive.
FAANG, which had led the decline in tech earlier in the day, ended well above session lows. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) were higher while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ended below the flatline.
Ahead of the Fed decision, some had said the recent hit to highly-valued growth names from rising yields was overdone as rates are normalizing amid an improving economic backdrop.
""The market's reaction, especially to the highly valued names, and the expectations for inflation moving forward are currently overdone right now,"" David Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, said in an interview with Investing.com.
""This [the rise in bond yields] is just a normalization in rates … if you go back to previous cycles, rates tend to average about 200 basis points off the bottom on the 10-year Treasury yields in the first year and that's really just what we're seeing now,"" Wagner added.
Cyclical stocks – those that move in tandem with economy – also played a role in the broader market rally. 
Industrials were pushed higher by  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), with the latter up more than 3%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government warned it could limit flights by Hong Kong-based carriers that got a leg up on U.S. rivals after the Asian financial hub imposed quarantine rules that forced U.S. cargo carrier FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) to move some crews to San Francisco.
The U.S. Transportation Department (USDOT) issued an order on Tuesday requiring Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Limited to file flight schedules for all U.S. flights within seven days to determine if any are ""contrary to applicable law or adversely affect the public interest"".
The USDOT order was issued in reaction to rules issued by Hong Kong in January requiring locally based air crews to quarantine when returning there from international locations, but exempted flights between Hong Kong and Anchorage, Alaska's biggest city.
USDOT said Hong Kong's restrictions exclusively benefited Hong Kong carriers and ""impaired the operating rights of U.S. carriers"".
While FedEx’s Hong Kong-based crews serve only intra-Asia routings and therefore do not benefit from the Anchorage exception, USDOT said, Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific operates a large transshipment operation at Anchorage.
""This carve out effectively provides Cathay Pacific with the ability to continue those operations without impact from the new crew quarantine requirements,"" said USDOT.
Cathay Pacific said it hoped the matter is ""resolved among all relevant parties as soon as possible,"" adding it has been hit hard by the quarantine measures and reduced weekly freighter frequency between Hong Kong and U.S. from 35-39 flights to 21-28 flights.
The airline has cut passenger capacity by about 60% and cargo capacity by 25% of January levels.
The Hong Kong Transport and Housing Bureau said U.S. concerns were ""unfounded"" and defended the Alaska exemption as ""equally applicable to all airlines"" and including ""stringent self-isolation requirements"".
The agency added it has ""will continue to engage FedEx in constructive dialogues, with a view to exploring and co-creating options to address the company’s business and operational issues while upholding the need to safeguard the public health of our community.""
It said FedEx had temporarily relocated its Hong Kong-based crews to San Francisco ""in order to maintain the viability of critical operations in its intra-Asia network."" 

On Tuesday, a FedEx spokesman said it hoped the USDOT order ""will aid in resolving this matter"" and added it was working with U.S. and Hong Kong authorities and the Air Line Pilots Association ""to address Hong Kong’s entry and quarantine requirements for locally-based crew members"".

(Reuters) - Shares in ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc tumbled on Wednesday, pausing a rally that has seen the stocks soar this year on increased appetite for value names, newly launched streaming services and an unwinding of bearish investor bets.
ViacomCBS Class B shares last traded down 4.4% at $92.02 after hitting a record of $101.97 on March 15. Discovery shares last traded down 3.6% at $73.09 after hitting a high of $76.61 on Tuesday. 
ViacomCBS and Discovery have gained 146% and 142% year-to-date, respectively, as investors piled into undervalued names on expectations of a broader reopening of the U.S. economy while also eyeing direct-to-consumer streaming services that could help the more traditional media companies compete against newer rivals.
Shares of the companies were also boosted by investors who had bet against the stock, now being forced to unwind their positions in the face of a rising stock price, said Chris Marangi, co-chief investment officer for value at Gabelli Funds, which was Viacom's second biggest holder of voting stock as of late January with 7.88% of Class A shares. 
A similar phenomenon, known as a short squeeze, helped spark a wild ride in shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and other names popular with retail traders on Reddit’s WallStreetBets and other online forums in January. 
""Viacom was a beneficiary of the early stages of the GameStop short-covering frenzy, as there was short covering across the market,"" Marangi said.
The number of Discovery Class A shares shorted have more than halved since mid-January and stood at 40.5 million on March 16, according to FIS Astec Analytics data.
Some 81.1 million Viacom shares are shorted compared to 96.4 million in January, the firm’s data showed. 
Along with an increasing appetite for value stocks broadly, Mirangi also cited interest in recent launches of ViacomCBS's Paramount+ and Discovery's Discovery+ streaming video services as both companies should benefit from a direct relationship with consumers.
They are following in the footsteps of Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's hugely successful launch of Disney plus in Nov. 2019. 
He noted that media stocks such as ViacomCBS and Discovery underperformed for years as investors felt they were ""just going to milk cashflow from the dying traditional media bundle.""

""The stocks have very quickly made up for several years of underperformance,"" said Marangi. ""From here its about execution and that will take several years.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday that it considers that the benefits of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) COVID-19 vaccine outweigh its risks and recommends that vaccinations continue.
The WHO listed AstraZeneca and Oxford University's vaccine for emergency use last month, widening access to the relatively inexpensive shot in the developing world.
More than a dozen European countries have suspended use of the vaccine this week amid concerns. 
The European Medicines Agency (EMA), which will release its findings on Thursday, has said it was investigating reports of 30 cases of unusual blood disorders out of 5 million recipients of the AstraZeneca vaccine. In total, 45 million COVID shots have been delivered across the region.
The WHO said its Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety is carefully assessing the latest available safety data for the AstraZeneca vaccine. 
""Once that review is completed, WHO will immediately communicate the findings to the public,"" WHO said in its statement a day after its experts met. 
""At this time, WHO considers that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh its risks and recommends that vaccinations continue,"" it added.
Mike Ryan, WHO's top emergency expert, told a social media event: ""We would advise people to keep taking the vaccines. Right now this virus has a much bigger chance of doing you a lot of harm than the very, very potentially tiny risks associated with this vaccine.""
Ryan, referring to the AstraZeneca shot, said: ""I think we need to be very careful that we don't end up over-reacting and damaging the product in people's mind until we are absolutely sure that there actually is a problem. Right now, that is not certain. Let's wait for the data to be looked at before we make any conclusions.""
Kate O'Brien, director of WHO's department of immunization, said that its panel was assessing whether adverse events such as blood clots were actually related to vaccination.

""We should not over-interpret these specific numbers that come out of trials. They are highly effective vaccines, they are life-saving vaccines, they are safe vaccines and we should get on with deploying them,"" O'Brien told a news conference.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 turned positive and the Dow hit record highs Wednesday, as tech cuts losses after U.S. bond yields slipped following the Federal Reserve's unchanged rate decision.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.63%, or 207 points, and had hit intraday record of 33,047.58, and the S&P 500 rose 0.39%, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.50%, but had been down more than 1%.
The Federal Open Market Committee left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 0% to 0.25% and said it would continue its $120 billion monthly bond purchases.
""Following a moderation in the pace of the recovery, indicators of economic activity and employment have turned up recently, although the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak. Inflation continues to run below 2 percent,"" The Fed said in a statement.
The central bank's policymakers appear in no hurry to hike rates, continuing to back rates to remain near-zero through 2023.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield retreated from 13-month high following the decision, helping tech tech's to pare some of its losses.
FAANG, which had led the decline in tech earlier in the day, moved off session lows. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) were higher while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was marginally below the flatline.
Ahead of the Fed decision, some said the recent hit to highly valued growth names from rising yields on inflation jitters are somewhat overdone as rates are normalizing amid an improving economic backdrop.

Crowdstrike Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD), was up 4% after reporting ""very strong"" quarterly results that topped Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom lines.

Investing.com - The Federal Reserve kept interest rates and its monthly pace of bond buying unchanged Wednesday, and continued to signal that rates will remain near-zero through 2023 even as it acknowledged an improved economic backdrop.
The Federal Open Market Committee left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 0% to 0.25% and said it would continue its $120 billion monthly bond purchases.
""Following a moderation in the pace of the recovery, indicators of economic activity and employment have turned up recently, although the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak. Inflation continues to run below 2 percent,"" The Fed said in a statement.
The central bank's policymakers appear in no hurry to hike rates, continuing to back rates to remain near-zero through 2023.
The Fed’s interest-rate outlook for 2021 through 2023 was 0.1%, unchanged from previous projections in December, the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections showed.
The unchanged guidance on interest rates comes even as the Federal Reserve upped its outlook on growth and inflation in the wake of an improving economic backdrop amid a boost from stimulus and vaccine deployments.
The economy is expected to grow by 6.5% in 2021, and 3.3% in 2022, up from previous estimates of 4.2% and 3.2% respectively.
The Fed's efforts have been helped by a wave of unprecedented pandemic fiscal relief measures undertaken by the U.S. government. The latest fiscal relief package, the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, together with the faster pace of vaccine roll outs have added fuel to the recovery.
But the improving economic backdrop has sparked inflation and U.S. bond yields into life, stoking speculation over whether the Fed will have to tighten policy sooner than expected.
The pace of inflation is forecast to improve to 2.4% in 2021, and 2.0% in 2022, compared with prior estimates of 1.8% and 1.9% respectively. Looking ahead to 2023, inflation is projected to reach the 2.1% target, up from 2% previously, though the Fed has reiterated that it would let inflation run above target for some time.
The updated guidance on inflation is in keeping with the Fed's narrative that the post-reopening inflation boom will be short-lived.
The second part of the Fed's dual mandate - to achieve maximum employment – has also justified its accommodative stance somewhat as the unemployment rate at 6.2% remains above pre-pandemic levels.
The unemployment rate for the 2021 is expected to come in at 4.5%, down from 5% previously, and fall further to 3.9% next year, down from a previous estimate of 4.2%. The unemployment rate was estimated to improve further, and eventually drop to 3.5% in 2023, down from a prior estimate of 3.7%.
Looking ahead, market participants expect the Fed to stick with its commitment to let inflation run hot, allowing bond yields to move higher as the central bank looks to achieve full employment.
“Breakevens are starting to price over 2% to almost 2.3% inflation so the market is fully expecting inflation, though I believe that the Fed is going to stay true to their words,” David Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, said in an interview with Investing.com. ""The Fed is in a tough spot and isn't renowned for being proactive ... and will likely let the market push rates higher until something really breaks before [deciding] to act.""
Fed chairman Jerome Powell suggested that the tapering was still a ways off as the economy has yet to achieve substantial economic growth. An eventual taper of bond purchases will be signaled well in advanced, the fed chief added.
""We will give a signal that we're on a path to possibly achieve substantial growth to consider tapering. I think what we've learned from the experience of these last dozen years, is to communicate very carefully, very clearly, [and] well in advance …"" Powell said."

The move sent the U.S. homebuilder's shares up by nearly 11% in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Lennar's focus on its core homebuilding business comes as housing has been one of the persistent bright spots throughout the coronavirus-driven recession and mortgage rates are hovering near historic lows of around 3%, boosting buyer affordability.
""We (are focusing) on driving higher returns with less noise in our numbers from lumpy profits,"" Lennar Chairman Stuart Miller said, adding that this would ""increase visibility for the capital markets"" into its core operation.
The expected size of Lennar's spun-off enterprise would be between $3 billion and $5 billion in asset base, with no debt, and could include Lennar's commercial mortgage business, the company said on a post-earnings call.
Lennar's rental venture, called Upward America Venture, will buy single family homes for rent in high growth markets in the United States, and is backed by private equity firm Centerbridge Partners as the lead investor.

TORONTO/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Miners from Australia to Canada are expanding operations despite concerns from indigenous groups about damage to wildlife, water supplies and religious sites, rankling investors who are pressuring the industry to improve its environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards. 
Prices for gold, copper and iron ore, which have recently hit record or multi-year highs, have spurred a hunt for growth that risks ignoring lessons the industry should have learned after the destruction of the Juukan Gorge caves in Australia by Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) last year, according to institutional investors. 
This is the second wave of pressure that investors concerned about ESG issues have laid on miners after successfully forcing mine waste standards updates in 2020, after a 2019 tailings dam collapse that killed 270 people in Brazil. ""I don't think there's an option of not changing behaviors,"" said Adam Matthews of the Church of England Pensions Board. Rio Tinto’s demolition of the Juukan sacred caves, which had permit approval, caused an outcry. Five executives linked to the incident have left or are planning to leave, including the chief executive and chairman.
Given miners have the requisite regulatory permits when undertaking projects that are later opposed by indigenous communities, legal and regulatory reform is critical, investors said. 
""In our discussions with listed companies, it is clear that practices are still widely varied and strongly influenced by regulatory requirements,"" said Alison George of investment advisor Regnan, owned by Pendal Group, which manages A$98.4 billion ($75.73 billion).
The group sees ""unfinished business in the area of law reform and revision to influential standards,"" she said. 
Canadian junior Baselode Energy Corp last month halted uranium exploration in the western province of Saskatchewan after the Birch Narrows Dene Nation said it lacked consent to conduct surveys on traditional lands. ""The province can't be handing out these permits and running roughshod over our territories,"" said Heather Bear, vice chief of the regional Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations. CEO James Sykes said Baselode is in talks with communities to restart work. 
Miners say they are doing their best to meet regulatory requirements and adjusting mine plans to meet the wishes of local groups while working to tight timelines. ""It hasn't been perfect but we have been able to consult a lot of the community,"" said Martin Plante, vice-president of Nunavut operations at Canadian gold miner Agnico Eagle (NYSE:AEM). 
Inuit in the Canadian Arctic territory said pandemic lockdowns have hindered talks with Agnico over its plans to pipe treated wastewater from its Meliadine mine into the Arctic Ocean and increase contaminants it can legally dispose in a nearby lake. Agnico said pollution would fall within regulated limits and that it has tried to find ways to safely meet with Inuit during the pandemic. 
'PRESERVING WHAT WE HAVE LEFT' 
In South Australia, Argonaut Resources will begin a major copper drilling campaign on Lake Torrens, a salt lake with fragile freshwater aquifers that is considered sacred by Aboriginal groups. ""It's all about the benefits to the state of royalties, but for us it's about preserving what we have left,"" said Jason Bilney, chair of the Barngarla Aboriginal Corporation, who have ancestral ties to the area. The state's mines department last June awarded A$320,000 ($246,272) to the miner to drill the shoreline. The government said the drilling would not permanently harm the lake and that a separate permit would be needed to mine. In New South Wales state, China's Shenhua Watermark has proceeded with plans to build a new coal mine against the wishes of the local Gomeroi people, with the approval of the federal government. Shenhua said it had adhered to all rigorous planning and environmental approval processes set out by state and federal government. 
Some indigenous groups have been successful in slowing mine projects. Native Americans opposed to Rio Tinto's Resolution copper project in Arizona won a reprieve in March after the new Biden administration blocked a land swap needed for the project.
More investors have signed on to a November letter sent by the Church of England and other investors to 78 miners seeking information on their dealings with indigenous peoples and the standards they employ. 

""As with tailings, we feel that (Juukan) has revealed a wider problem, and equally a need to question how the industry has been dealing with it,"" CoE Pensions Board's Matthews said.

852,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 01:35PM ET</span>",Explainer: How worried should we be about reports of blood clots and AstraZeneca's vaccine?,"By Ludwig Burger and Matthias Blamont
FRANKFURT/PARIS (Reuters) - Europe's drug watchdog is reviewing a small number of reports of bleeding, blood clots and low platelet counts in people who have received AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s coronavirus vaccine. 
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said it has so far found no causal link between the vaccine and the incidents. The World Health Organization has also said there was no proven link and people should not panic. 
At least 13 EU member states including Germany, France, Italy have suspended use of the shot pending the outcome of EMA's probe.
Here's what we know so far:
WHAT HAS HAPPENED?
More than 45 million COVID shots by all manufacturers have been administered across the EU and the European Economic Area since vaccinations started almost three months ago.
The EMA is investigating reports of 30 cases of unusual blood disorders out of 5 million people who got the AstraZeneca vaccine in the EU.
The EMA's focus and primary concern is on cases of blood clots in the head, a rare condition that's difficult to treat called cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT).
In Germany, seven people aged 20 to 50 have been diagnosed with CVT up to 16 days after vaccination as per Monday, according to the national vaccine authority Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI). Based on the known rate of CVT in the general population, the PEI would have expected one case in 1.6 million.
WHAT HAVE OTHER COUNTRIES AND ASTRAZENECA SAID?
Britain has administered more than 11 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and reports of blood clots were no greater than would have occurred naturally. The UK's medicine regulator has urged Britons to keep on getting their vaccines, including the AstraZeneca shot.
Canada has said health experts are sure all COVID-19 vaccines being administered in the country are safe, including AstraZeneca's.
AstraZeneca said on Sunday a review of safety data of more than 17 million people vaccinated in the United Kingdom and European Union with its vaccine had shown no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots.
​
WHAT IS THE EMA INVESTIGATING?
EMA investigators are checking if the frequency of incidences is higher in the vaccinated population than normal background rates. 
The normal frequency is drawn from public health statistics or insurance records. This would be combined with a medical analysis of each case and insight from scientific literature.
EMA's head of safety monitoring, Peter Arlett, added the rarity of CVT meant the watchdog would have to rely more heavily on case-by-case analysis rather than on the sparse statistical data.
A spokeswomen for Germany's vaccine authority, which is part of the investigation, said EMA would not rule on causality.
Instead, EMA will assess the likelihood of an increased risk of the condition and weigh that against the benefits of fighting COVID-19 and providing relief for health systems.
For example, the vaccines developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) have been linked with increased risk of anaphylaxis, but they are still recommended because benefits outweigh the risks of the side effect, which can be treated.
The regulator has said it remains for now ""firmly convinced"" that the product's benefit outweighs any risks. 
WHAT DID THE CLINICAL TRIALS SHOW?
AstraZeneca and European regulators have said that concerns about blood coagulation disorders did not emerge during human trials.
Safety monitoring after approval is key because extremely rare side-effects, or those affecting only a small subset of the population, are near impossible to identify during clinical trials, according to PEI.
ARE THERE PRECEDENTS OF VACCINE SAFETY SCARES? 
In Japan, a governmental recommendation for use of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to prevent cervical cancer has been suspended since June 2013, due to media reports of an alleged pain syndrome. This has drawn criticism from the WHO.
A study published in The Lancet Public Health last year concluded a continued suspension would lead to thousands of cancer deaths over the next decades.

In Ukraine https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-measles-ukraine-insight-idUKKBN1XE15T, deep mistrust of vaccines has allowed measles to grow into an epidemic. Vaccine hesitancy there is rooted in corruption and mistrust of authority but also in a temporary government suspension in 2008, when a 17-year-old boy died shortly after receiving a measles-rubella vaccine.

Investing.com –  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) zoomed to a record after saying it would set up a $4 billion venture to buy single-family homes to rent.
The business will initially be capitalized with a total equity commitment of $1.25 billion led by Centerbridge alongside Allianz (DE:ALVG) Real Estate and other institutional investors, the homebuilder said in a filing. Shares were up 11%. 
The platform, Upward America Venture, will acquire single family homes for rent in high growth markets across the U.S. Including leverage, the venture will be positioned to acquire over $4 billion of new single family homes and townhomes from Lennar and potentially other homebuilders.
Helping the stock’s momentum were its February quarterly earning announced Tuesday. The three-month earnings were $1 billion, more than two-and-half times of a year earlier. The company benefited from investments in technology and the liquidity-stoked boom in the economy that has sent homebuyers on a spree as inventory remains tight.
Lennar estimates second-quarter orders between 16,500 homes and 16,700 homes, above analysts' estimates of 16,240 homes, helped in part by a shortage of previously owned houses on the market, according to a Reuters report Tuesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Travel spending by Americans plunged by 42%, or $492 billion, in 2020, according to a report by an industry group, amid social, travel and business restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19.
The U.S. Travel Association said the industry shed 5.6 million direct and indirect jobs last year, and the decline in travel dragged down total economic output to $1.5 trillion, from 2019's $2.6 trillion. U.S. tax revenue collected from travel plummeted by $57 billion in 2020. 
""While the gradual progress of vaccinations has provided hope that a turnaround may be on the horizon, it is still unclear when travel demand will be able to fully rebound on its own,"" said U.S. Travel Association President and CEO Roger Dow. 
As millions of Americans get vaccinated and travel destinations begin to reopen, the industry is optimistic that demand will return this spring. Disney said Wednesday its California theme parks will reopen April 30.
Last year, U.S. passenger airline traffic sank 60.1% to the lowest since 1984, while Americans took far fewer road trips as millions stayed home instead of commuting.
In total, there were 368 million air passengers in 2020, down from 922.6 million in 2019. U.S. driving fell by 430.2 billion miles, or 13%, to 2.83 trillion total miles in 2020, its lowest level since 2001. 
Business and international travel were especially hard hit and have been slower to recover. The United States still imposes restrictions that bar the entry of nearly all non-U.S. citizens who have recently been in Brazil, South Africa and much of Europe.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still recommends Americans avoid all nonessential travel, even for those who have been vaccinated.
However, more Americans are resuming travel.
The Transportation Security Administration said last week it screened 1.357 million U.S. airport passengers on Friday, the highest number screened since March 15, 2020 in the early weeks of the pandemic, as air travel begins to rebound. 

Travel-related employment has been rebounding this year as some pandemic restrictions have been lifted. In February, employment in leisure and hospitality increased by 355,000 jobs.

Traders ignored the analyst's similar call for  Monster Beverage  (NASDAQ:MNST).  
Constellation shares were up 1.2% and those of Boston Beer 1.7%. Monster Beverage shares fell 2% despite the bullish call by Goldman analyst Bonnie Herzog.  
Herzog said these three are the stocks to own in the beverage segment, according to StreetInsider. She cited strong category momentum and robust innovation pipelines as reasons for her positive outlook on the stocks.
Constellation was added to Goldman’s ‘conviction buy’ list in February with the market under appreciating Modelo's momentum and distribution and Corona Hard Seltzer's imminent scalability.
Boston’s advantage in hard seltzer is one of the few big growth opportunities in alcoholic beverages, sustainable and broadly defensible as the category expands with new beverage entrants, StreetInsider quoted Herzog as saying. The analyst said Monster is reflecting topline momentum.

Investing.com --  Disney  shares popped after the CEO said Disneyland would reopen next month.
Chief Executive Officer Bob Chapek told CNBC that its two California parks, which have been closed for about a year, will return to operations on April 30. Revenue for the quarter ended Jan. 2 was 53% lower than a year earlier for the parks, experiences and products division because of pandemic-related shutdowns. 
The stock reversed earlier losses to trade slightly higher. Shares are trading about 3% short of a record hit earlier this month.
Disney has more than doubled over the past year with the start of Disney+, its streaming service, a division of the direct-to-consumer segment that saw revenue for the most recent quarter increase 73% to $3.5 billion. 
The reopening will be limited at first, at just 15% of capacity, and should accelerate as vaccines become more widespread and Covid-19 numbers drop. “I think as people become vaccinated, they become a little bit more confident in the fact that they can travel, and, you know, stay COVID-free,” Chapek said.  
The company returned to operations in Florida last year. 
“We’ve been operating at Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) World for about nine months, and there certainly is no shortage of demand,"" Chapek said.
Disney’s hotels in California will also start opening next month.

858,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 12:35PM ET</span>","Airline consolidation set back five years, IATA chief says","By Laurence Frost and Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - The large-scale government intervention in airlines triggered by the coronavirus crisis will hold back sector consolidation for up to five years, the head of global industry body IATA predicted on Wednesday.
Alexandre de Juniac, the International Air Transport Association's outgoing director general, made the comments in an interview with Reuters as the organisation called for a new round of subsidies to weather the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Governments have taken big stakes in many of their national airlines, so it will be difficult for them to sell this asset to any foreign actor and explain that to the taxpayer,"" De Juniac said. ""It will be a factor that will prevent consolidation in the coming three to five years.""
Airline tie-ups already faced obstacles before the crisis, including ownership rules linked to bilateral aviation treaties. That has not prevented the emergence of multinationals such as IAG (LON:ICAG), Lufthansa and Air France-KLM that preserve national carriers within their group structures.
Aid has further raised the hurdles by piling up debts, shielding potential targets and tying would-be buyers' hands. EU rules bar recipients such as Lufthansa and Air France-KLM from making acquisitions until bailouts are repaid.
The IATA head, who hands over next month to IAG veteran Willie Walsh, also urged governments that have already provided $225 billion in sector aid to support a travel recovery through new air ticket and route subsidies.
Australia last week announced plans to subsidise 800,000 domestic flights as part of a A$1.2 billion ($925 million) travel revival package.
""We've already seen some plans by governments to subsidise tickets, routes and domestic journeys,"" de Juniac said during a media briefing later on Wednesday. ""I urge governments to consider stimulus measures.""
After a year of partial shutdown, many airlines say they now need a significant rebound within months to survive - let alone to fund investment in cleaner aircraft and fuel technologies.
Global airlines are discussing more ambitious climate goals than their existing pledge to halve net carbon emissions by 2050, de Juniac said, confirming earlier comments to the Financial Times.
Nonetheless, any wider recourse to public subsidies for air travel is bound to bring some controversy.
""The new normal is going to mean less flying, especially corporate travel, and the industry must adjust,"" said Andrew Murphy of the campaign group Transport & Environment.
""Public funds should be channelled into developing cleaner fuels and new plane designs, not subsidising what's still the most carbon-intensive form of travel,"" Murphy said. 
IATA began preparing to lobby for route subsidies soon after the pandemic erupted last year, according to internal ""key messages"" previously reported by Reuters.
The organisation now expects borders to have largely re-opened by October, when it plans to hold its annual gathering in Boston, four months later than first scheduled.

The stock opened at $33 per share, giving the airline a valuation of $1.84 billion.
The Minnesota-based airline raised $218.2 million in its initial public offering on Tuesday, selling shares at $24 each, above the marketed range of $21 to $23 apiece.
The listing comes at a time when weak travel demand continues to weigh on the financials of airlines globally, as people stay at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sun Country, however, is betting on a turnaround in its fortunes as people get vaccinated. The airline expects to be one of the ""early beneficiaries"" of the rebound, as it is focused on leisure travel rather than business travel, it said. 
Sun Country operates a fleet of 31 passenger and 12 cargo aircraft. The carrier also provides air cargo services to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
The carrier expanded services in January this year, adding http://www.suncountryview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.26-New-Route-and-Schedule-Extension.pdf 16 new routes and nine new airports, encouraged by the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and betting on pent-up demand for leisure travel.
Founded in 1982 by Jim Olsen and a small group of pilots and flight attendants, Sun Country offers affordable flights and vacation packages to destinations across the United States, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. It was bought by Apollo in 2017.
The company said it plans to use a portion of the IPO proceeds to repay a loan it took from the U.S. government under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Sun Country rival Frontier Group Holdings Inc also filed to go public earlier this month.

 Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Securities, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Nomura were the underwriters for Sun Country's offering.

861,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 12:09PM ET</span>","Market Brawl Breaks Out Ahead of Fed With Tech, Bitcoin Battered","(Bloomberg) -- A surge in bond yields ahead of the Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated policy meeting is wreaking havoc across the stock market’s speculative corners.
The Nasdaq 100 fell as much as 1.5% on Wednesday as long-dated Treasuries continued to sell off, pushing 10-year yields to 1.67%, the highest since before the pandemic.. The tech pain was widely felt, with high-flying names such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. and Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) taking hits. Newly public companies also dropped, while a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) basket of unprofitable tech firms fell more than 3%, extending its worst monthly slide in a year.
Underlying the pain is a laser-like focus on the Fed’s updated “dot plot,” which displays policy makers’ projections for interest rate movements. A brightening economic outlook and building inflation expectations have fueled breakeven rates and bond yields higher, pushing traders to price in a Fed hike by March 2023. Expensive tech stocks -- which have dominated over the past year -- have been a casualty, as higher yields make it more difficult to justify their lofty valuations.
“All attention is focused on the dot plot and when the Fed anticipates its first rate hike,” said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager for GLOBALT Investments in Atlanta. “Tech has benefited from rates moving lower for longer for years, but the knife cuts both ways -- when rates move higher those stocks are at risk.”
Racing Off the Ark
The rise in yields has been particularly painful for growth darling ARKK, which dropped as much as 4% in early Wednesday trading as some of its biggest holdings sank. Electric vehicle maker Tesla dropped as much as 3.8%, while  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ). and  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc. stumbled as well.
Ark’s $24 billion flagship fund has been whipsawed in recent weeks amid a rotation into previously unloved value shares. It fell almost 30% from its February peak before recovering 14%, after a 149% rise in 2020. While Wood said this month that the rotation is healthy and Ark is keeping their “eye on the prize,” the ETF’s gains have been whittled to just 1.2% year-to-date.
Pain in IPOs
The Renaissance IPO ETF, tracking companies that just went public and have yet to prove their record, fell as much as 2.7% as trading kicked off, poised for a second day of declines. About 85% of the 130 companies that went public in the U.S. last year were unprofitable, according to data compiled by Bloomberg that excludes special purchase acquisition companies and real-estate investment trusts. But that’s no trouble for bulls willing to chase winners. The ETF doubled in 2020 for its best year on record.
Now, the spike in yields is evaporating those gains. The IPO ETF has tumbled as much as 22% since peaking in February.
“As the economy grows, as interest rates move higher, that makes speculative investments less attractive,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer of Independent Advisor Alliance. “Any IPO is going to be considered more speculative than more mature businesses that have been public for 20 or 50 years.”
Bitcoin Bruised
The cooling risk appetite is also taking a bite out of Bitcoin. While the world’s largest cryptocurrency topped $61,000 on Saturday to hit another record, it’s dropped every day since in its longest losing streak since December as rising rates roil markets. Crypto-exposed stocks such as MicroStrategy Inc. and Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. also fell Wednesday as Bitcoin broke below $55,000.
While crypto advocates pitch Bitcoin as digital gold and a hedge for rising price pressures, it tends to move in tandem with stocks. It’s also been a beneficiary of the Fed’s loose monetary policy, making it vulnerable to a pullback in that support, according to Miller Tabak + Co.’s Matt Maley.
“If the Fed is going to be willing to let long-term rates rise, that means they’re going to be a bit less accommodative going forward,” said Maley, chief market strategist at the firm. “Since some investors see the Bitcoin rally at least partly fueled by liquidity, less accommodation will create some headwinds for the cryptocurrency.”

863,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 11:57AM ET</span>",Texas utility regulator ousted after comments to investors disclosed,"By Kanishka Singh and Gary McWilliams
(Reuters) - The third and last remaining commissioner of the Texas utilities regulator resigned under pressure on Tuesday after the release of comments to investors vowing to protect utility profits and dismissing financial hits from a cold snap on municipal power companies.
The resignation came soon after the disclosure of inflammatory comments by the Public Utility Commission Chair Arthur D'Andrea in a March 9 call with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) utilities' analysts. The call took place two days before he was to consider rescinding billions of dollars payment to utilities. 
His stance against repricing helped sink a proposal this week to cut $4.1 billion from charges in the final hours of a deadly February blackout. The regulator and state grid operator raised power prices to about 400 times the normal rate over five days. But they left the pricing in place for 32 hours after the emergency passed, spurring state officials to call for a partial repricing.
On the March 9 call, D'Andrea told investors and analysts he had ""tipped the scale as hard as I could"" to prevent repricing and would keep ""the weight of the commission"" against it, according to a recording of the call published Tuesday by Texas Monthly magazine on its website. 
DISMISSES HIT TO CITY-RUN POWER 
Municipal power companies that could benefit from repricing proposals would get through the financial hit, he advised the investors. Several have had their credit ratings downgraded, raising future borrowing costs. 
Referring to San Antonio's city-run CPS Energy that has contested $200 million in power charges, D'Andrea dismissed the impact in remarks to Bank of America analysts: ""They've got a lot of money. They're fine."" 
High costs from the storm have led four Texas power companies to seek protection from creditors in bankruptcy court. Electricity firms have failed to pay $3 billion in storm-related charges, amounts that eventually would be passed to all Texas utilities and their customers. 
""Tonight, I asked for and accepted the resignation of PUC Commissioner Arthur D'Andrea,"" Texas Governor Greg Abbott said in a statement released late Tuesday. He plans to name a replacement in the coming days.
PUC spokesman Andrew Barlow did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
JOB PROTECTION
In his call with Bank of America, D'Andrea also claimed he had job protection after two of the three PUC commissioners resigned. Lawmakers could ""secure promises from me"" that they could not get if there were other commissioners, he said.
""I expect it to be this way for a while, at least a year, with just me,"" he said of the commission's makeup. 
Earlier in March, Shelly Botkin resigned from her post at the PUC, a week after former Chairman DeAnn Walker resigned.
The Bank of America recording threw new light on the commission's much-criticized handling of a deadly February blackout that killed more than 56 people in the state and could saddle power companies with bills for decades.
The state's independent market monitor testified power grid operator ERCOT, which is overseen by the PUC, made a $16 billion pricing error by keeping prices high for 32 hours after widespread outages ended Feb. 17.

Electricity retailer Brilliant Energy LLC on Tuesday became the fourth company to file for bankruptcy protection since the storm. Its bankruptcy court filing came a day after Griddy Energy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy with $29 million in charges for power.

Investing.com -- Uber (NYSE:UBER) slipped after saying its U.K. drivers will be treated as workers -- not quite employees, mind you, but workers -- starting Wednesday.Some 70,000 private-hire drivers will be classified as self-employed workers for tax purposes, but entitled to a minimum wage, holiday pay and a pension, according to The New York Times. Shares are down almost 4%.
Uber's move was prompted after it lost a legal battle last month, when Britain's Supreme Court said its workers deserved those rights. The ride-hailing giant and other gig economy companies are facing conflicts across Europe over their classification and subsequent treatment of the people who work for them.
Uber forecast no change in near-term earnings, but the company has yet to make money, and this could add yet another roadblock to profitability. The U.K. mobility business represented about 6.4% of global mobility gross bookings in the fourth quarter of 2020, the company said in a statement.
In California, Uber had faced a similar conflict, but escaped when a proposition passed in November allowed them to continue to consider drivers as independent contractors.
Uber said that 99% of its U.K. drivers already earn more than the National Living Wage, as the minimum wage in the country is known, with earnings of about 17 pounds an hour ($23.58) in London and 14 pounds elsewhere, after expenses.
The National Living Wage will be 8.91 pounds starting April 1, according to the UK government.
U.K. drivers will be paid holiday time based on 12.07% of their earnings, paid out every two weeks, while eligible drivers will automatically be enrolled into a pension plan with contributions from Uber.

871,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 10:00AM ET</span>",Political role under fire in European AstraZeneca vaccine suspensions,"By Douglas Busvine and Ludwig Burger
BERLIN (Reuters) - The decision by more than a dozen European countries to suspend AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 shot faced deepening scrutiny on Wednesday, amid concerns the step could undermine public confidence and delay efforts to beat the coronavirus pandemic.
The role of Germany, and in particular Health Minister Jens Spahn, is in the spotlight after a chaotic round of telephone diplomacy at the start of the week ended with the EU's biggest states agreeing to put AstraZeneca on hold.
Spahn says he acted on expert advice after Germany's vaccine watchdog reported on what it described as a statistically significant number of cases of a rare brain blood clot.
AstraZeneca says it has found no evidence that the blood clots were caused by the vaccine. The World Health Organization called on countries not to delay lifesaving vaccine programmes.
Germany's actions have been interpreted as political both at home and abroad, with opposition leaders calling on Chancellor Angela Merkel to sack Spahn. Officials in major European capitals have given mixed accounts over how the joint move to halt AstraZeneca came about.
The stop on AstraZeneca threatens to hobble Europe's vaccination campaign just as a third wave of infection breaks over the continent, accelerated by more infectious variants.
The bloc has already lagged far behind the United States and former EU member Britain in vaccinating citizens. Hospitals are filling up again, and politicians in several European countries have been forced to consider fresh lockdowns, even as comparable rich countries prepare for normal life to return.
""We need this vaccine,"" said Germany's best-known virologist Christian Drosten, whose regular podcast is widely followed. He cited forecasts of a resurgence in infection by Easter that could endanger Germans over the age of 60 who are next in line for a shot.
Ian Jones, a professor of virology at Britian's Reading University, said the blood clot issue had ""been picked up by politicians who don't know one side of a virus from another"".
""It's like falling dominoes. You just need one or two (countries) to state there's a problem and suspend use, and then a whole lot of others will fall in place. I don't think there have been any independent decisions,"" he told Reuters. 
A MATTER OF TRUST
Germany acted after its vaccine oversight body, the Paul Ehrlich Institute, found seven cases of a very rare cerebral vein clot among 1.6 million people given the AstraZeneca shot in the country, including three cases that were fatal.
The EU drug regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is investigating reports of around 30 cases of blood clots, bleeding and low platelet counts among the 5 million people in the EU that have received the AstraZeneca vaccine.
It will present its findings on Thursday, but meanwhile it has found no causal link to the vaccine, and says the shot's benefits clearly outweigh any risks. 
""We are worried that there may be an effect on the trust of the vaccines,"" EMA head Emer Cooke told reporters. ""But our job is to make sure that the products that we authorise are safe and can be trusted.""
AstraZeneca Plc said it had conducted a review covering more than 17 million people who had received its shots in the EU and Britain, and had found no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots. 
Yet a narrow majority of Germans believe it was right for the government to suspend AstraZeneca, a Forsa opinion poll showed on Wednesday, with 54% backing Spahn's decision and 39% saying it was excessive.
The willingness of Germans to be vaccinated against COVID, at 71%, meanwhile, has fallen by two percentage points since Forsa's last poll on March 3. Were AstraZeneca to be reinstated, 63% would be willing to take it.
NO PRESSURE
Officials in European capitals gave conflicting accounts of a round of whirlwind diplomacy on Monday that led Italy, France and Spain to follow Germany in suspending the shot.
Sources said Merkel telephoned Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi to brief him. One top Italian health official called Italy's suspension a political decision not to part ways with Germany.
Italian sources said Draghi and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed by phone that the measure was temporary and precautionary.
A senior German government source denied that Berlin had exerted any pressure, noting that smaller EU member states such as Austria and Belgium had already raised the alarm.
""Nobody is being forced to do anything,"" said the German source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""That's not how the EU works.""
Amid the European controversy, frustration over Spahn's pandemic management has boiled over among Germany's ruling conservatives, who have just suffered defeats in two regional elections. Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) are languishing at one-year lows in polls ahead of a general election in September in which she will not seek a record fifth term. 

Her successor as CDU chairman, Armin Laschet, a contender to run for chancellor, has criticised the AstraZeneca delay as ""bad news"". Rival Markus Soeder, the governor of Bavaria, has called for the shot to be made available to anyone who wants it.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Wednesday as nervousness about a possible withdrawal of monetary stimulus sent bond yields higher, weighing on the valuations of technology stocks in particular.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average had eked out a gain of 76 points, or 0.2%, to 32,902 points, but the S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.9%. 
Earlier, fresh data showed that both housing starts and building permits fell by more than expected in February, in what some interpreted as the first signs that the rise in bond yields in recent weeks is feeding through to the rate-sensitive housing market. The number of mortgage applications last week also fell for the fifth week in six, indicating that higher refinancing rates are starting to have an impact.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to a fresh 13-month high of 1.68% earlier, amid fears that a strong U.S. recovery this year will move up the date when the Fed starts to withdraw stimulus. At present, it's committing to buy $120 billion in bonds each month through the end of 2021, while its latest guidance indicates that policy-makers don't see any interest rate hike as necessary before 2024. 
Analysts expect the Fed's guidance after Wednesday's meeting to show at least one or two members bringing forward their expectations for higher rates into 2023, which would bring the central bank more into line with the market's own implicit forecasts. 
""Powell will be walking a fine line between acknowledging the rosier outlook and reiterating that policy will stay loose,"" Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) macro-strategist John Velis said in a note to clients.
The Fed's monetary policy statement is due at 2 PM ET, while Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference starts half an hour later. 
In corporate news,  Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG) stock fell 13.1% after the hydrogen fuel cell company said it would have to restate its financial accounts having identified what it called ""accounting errors"". The company has been a habitual loss-maker, despite signing a number of landmark agreements with companies such as Air Water (T:4088), Renault (OTC:RNLSY) and Acciona (MC:ANA) in recent months.
Elsewhere, PinDuoDuo ADRs fell 8.6% after the company announced its founder Colin Huang Zheng will step down. The news overshadowed a solid set of quarterly results that saw PinDuoDuo overtake Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) as China's biggest e-commerce company by revenue. 
Semiconductor stocks were mixed after Samsung (KS:005930), the world's biggest chipmaker, said it expects the global shortage of chips to last a while yet, noting that it hasn't yet restarted its foundry in Texas since it was forced to close during the recent cold snap.

(Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) expects to double electric vehicle deliveries and increase profits for its core brand this year after the world's second-largest carmaker stepped up its switch to fully electric vehicles.
The brand will deliver more than 450,000 electric cars this year, the company said on Wednesday. Volkswagen is targeting 1 million electric vehicle deliveries for the wider group.
The core brand is aiming for a significant year-on-year increase in sales revenue and an increase in profits, VW said.
The group's preferred stock rose as much as 7% to its highest since June 2015, as institutional and retail investors cheered VW's efforts to overtake Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the electric car market.
Volkswagen earlier this month unveiled its 'Accelerate' strategy for its main brand, saying it expected fully electric vehicles to account for more than 70% of total European vehicle sales by 2030, compared with a previous target of 35%.
The Volkswagen brand aims to invest 16 billion euros ($19 billion) in electrification and digitalisation by 2025.
To help finance the investment, it aims to reduce fixed costs by 5% by 2023, freeze headcount at January 2021 levels, boost productivity at its plants by 5% a year and reduce raw material costs by 7%.
The new strategy would generate hundreds of millions of euros in revenue in the coming years, it said.
The group's stock has doubled in value in just four months, giving Volkswagen a market capitalisation of more than 130 billion euros on Wednesday.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is expanding its virtual healthcare service to other Washington-state employers starting Wednesday and to its own employees nationwide this summer, the company said in a press release.
Piloted in September 2019 for staff near its Seattle headquarters, ""Amazon Care"" lets employees video-chat with doctors for diagnoses and referrals. It also facilitates housecalls and drug delivery in greater Seattle, a non-virtual benefit that Amazon said would be available in greater Washington, D.C and Baltimore in the coming months.
The news shows how the No. 2 U.S. private employer is diving further into healthcare, the latest industry it has aimed to disrupt after retail, enterprise technology and Hollywood.
Amazon is now delivering prescription medications through an online pharmacy it launched last year and earlier worked with Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) on lowering care costs in a now-disbanded venture called Haven.
Its playbook for offering healthcare in-house and then to other employers resembles how Amazon built data centers to satisfy its own web needs, before opening up the same infrastructure to startups in what became its cloud-computing business.
Kristen Helton, director of Amazon Care, said the service has grown during the COVID-19 pandemic and work-from-home period, but the opportunity goes far beyond that.
""Virtual medicine is absolutely part of the future of how healthcare is delivered,"" she said in an interview.
Enterprises can contract with Amazon Care, offer that as a workplace benefit and subsidize healthcare costs for employees, Amazon said. It did not disclose financial terms, and Helton did not specify how big a business Amazon anticipates this will be.
Helton said Amazon Care was an add-on for some patients, a way to quickly get help after hours. But for others without a regular doctor, it is shaping up to be more.

""We've now evolved to offer more services,"" she said. ""We can do more primary care.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union agreed on Wednesday to blacklist Chinese officials for human rights abuses, two diplomats said, the first sanctions against Beijing since an EU arms embargo in 1989 following the Tiananmen Square crackdown.
EU ambassadors approved the travel bans and asset freezes on four Chinese individuals and one entity, whose names will not be made public until formal approval by EU foreign ministers on March 22, as part of a new and wider rights sanctions list.
While the sanctions are mainly symbolic, the adoption marks a significant hardening in the EU's policy towards China, which Brussels long regarded as a benign trading partner but now views as a systematic abuser of basic rights and freedoms.
The 1989 EU arms embargo on China, its second-largest trade partner, is still in place. 
""Restrictive measures against serious human rights violations and abuses adopted,"" one EU diplomat said.
The Chinese officials were accused of human rights abuses against China's Uighur Muslim minority, EU diplomats told Reuters. They said the move reflected deep concern about the Uighurs in Europe, the United States and Canada.
Activists and U.N. rights experts say at least 1 million Muslims are being detained in camps in the remote western region of Xinjiang. The activists and some Western politicians accuse China of using torture, forced labour and sterilisations.
The Dutch parliament followed Canada and the United States in labelling China's treatment of the Uighurs as genocide, which China rejects. 
On Twitter, the Chinese mission to the EU republished comments on the new sanctions made on Tuesday by China's ambassador to the bloc, Zhang Ming, saying that Beijing would not change its policies.
""Sanctions are confrontational,"" the Chinese mission said on Twitter. ""We want dialogue, not confrontation. We ask the EU side to think twice. If some insist on confrontation, we will not back down, as we have no options other than fulfilling our responsibilities to the people.""
China denies any human rights abuses in Xinjiang and says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism. Beijing has on numerous occasions invited EU ambassadors to Xinjiang but envoys say they cannot visit under the strict conditions and monitoring set by Chinese authorities.
The EU has also called for the release of jailed ethnic Uighur economics professor Ilham Tohti, who was jailed for life in 2014. He was awarded the European Parliament's human rights prize in 2019.

The EU's full sanctions list of 11 names approved by EU ambassadors also includes officials from Russia, Libya, South Sudan and North Korea, diplomats said.

The U.S. is projected to lose 20% of its per-capita gross domestic product by 2050 in a worse-case scenario, with nations closer to the equator or with high-carbon economies even more vulnerable, according to the report, scheduled to be published on Wednesday. It forecast Malaysia would see the worst economic hit at 31%.
The projections, based on trends of greenhouse-gas emissions and countries’ mitigation efforts, show the risk for investors of long-term bets on sovereign bonds. Many governments have been taking advantage of low borrowing costs to issue such debt this year as they finance a recovery from the pandemic.
“These results confirm that investors should take into account climate-change consequences very seriously,” researchers Nicolas Lancesseur and Thomas Lorans said in the report. “When assessing risk, it is generally a reasonable approach to consider the more pessimistic scenarios. Furthermore, these hypotheses are not so far from current trends.”
Bond markets have been adapting to the threat of climate change, most notably through a record surge in issuance of green bonds that fund environmental projects. Progress has been slower in quantifying the climate risks to sovereign issuers, a key question given many bonds won’t mature for decades -- a timescale where environmental models become increasingly uncertain.
The study provides estimates of climate change risks for the 26 constituents of the FTSE World Government Bond Index.

878,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 09:00AM ET</span>",Battling for batteries: Two Korean companies court Washington,"By David Shepardson and Ben Klayman
WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) - When U.S. President Joe Biden flies to Georgia Friday, he will land in the middle of an increasingly politicized battle between two South Korean electric vehicle battery makers and the state and federal politicians who want to prevent their feud from costing American jobs.
The companies, LG Chem and rival SK Innovation Co, are trying to take advantage of past and promised U.S. investments, and ties to politicians in Georgia, Ohio and Tennessee, to win the end game in a long-running legal dispute over intellectual property and access to the growing U.S. electric vehicle market.
The Biden Administration, through the U.S. Trade Representative's office, may ultimately pick a winner by the early April deadline. Both declined to comment.
The global auto industry is racing to develop EVs. Batteries made by LG, SK and other suppliers are critical to meeting the target of building zero-emission vehicles.
Georgia is the center of action. Unless the White House intervenes, SK says a Feb. 10 ruling by the International Trade Commission would force it to halt construction on a $2.6-billion factory in a state whose two newly-elected Democratic Senators are the linchpin of Biden's slim Democratic Congressional majority.
Democratic Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock told Reuters he has spoken with the Biden administration and hopes a deal can be reached. ""I am working to make sure Georgians will benefit from the jobs they were promised.""
LG wrote to Warnock, arguing SK is ""holding the people of Georgia hostage in a last-ditch lobbying effort to avoid settling."" LG said, if SK abandoned the plant, LG ""will do our best to fill in any voids.""
Concern in Georgia is bipartisan. On Friday, Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican, urged Biden to overturn the decision, noting SK's plant will employ nearly 2,600 people in the largest foreign investment in Georgia history. ""Simply put: the livelihoods of thousands of Georgians are now in your hands.""
BATTLEGROUND STATES
LG's political allies warn that reversing the ITC could hurt workers in Michigan and Ohio, also key political battleground states.
LG is nearing completion of a cell manufacturing plant in Ohio with General Motors (NYSE:GM) and sources said they are in talks to build a second facility in Tennessee.
""LG Chem's stolen intellectual property should not be used to directly compete against Ohio workers at the new factory or the Ohio- and Michigan-based businesses in the factory's supply chain,"" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine wrote in a March 8 letter to Biden.
In Tennessee, home to SK customer Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s U.S. assembly plant, state economic development chief Bob Rolfe said politics and jobs take center stage.
""You can weigh certainly the political side of this and then you also need to weigh the impact to the economy,"" said Rolfe, who declined to support either battery maker.
LG said it plans to invest more than $4.5 billion in U.S. battery production over the next four years and build at least two plants, including possibly in Georgia. LG insists it can handle auto industry's battery needs if SK abandons its Georgia plant.
SK said LG's spending plans are meant to sway Biden and added it would be impossible for LG to handle the VW and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co contracts.
""Georgians know the difference between our real commitment to the state and LG's paper promises,"" an SK spokeswoman said.

SK warned Chinese manufacturers may replace lost battery capacity, striking a chord with some lawmakers sensitive to ceding ground to a major trade rival.

880,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 08:31AM ET</span>",Special Report: Suit over deadly crash renews spotlight on GM safety practices,"By Mike Spector and Benjamin Lesser
NEW YORK (Reuters) - On a clear afternoon in November 2014, Glenda Marie Buchanan set off in her silver Chevrolet Trailblazer SUV from her home in rural Georgia. Several minutes into the drive, she started veering off the road. Buchanan swerved left and lost control, and the vehicle rolled onto its side into a ditch.
The 42-year-old mother and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) saleswoman died in the crash. The cause, her widower alleges in a lawsuit, was a defective steering sensor that the vehicle’s manufacturer, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), failed to adequately warn drivers about despite long knowing the component had issues.
The sensor’s failure disabled the 2007 Trailblazer’s electronic stability control, a significant safety feature designed to prevent crashes, according to the lawsuit, which was filed in a local Georgia court in 2016 and updated in 2020. GM, the top-selling automaker in the United States, denies the allegations.
The case renews a spotlight on GM’s safety practices, seven years after the Detroit automaker vowed never to repeat a notorious failure to recall millions of vehicles with defective ignition switches later linked to 124 deaths. The ongoing litigation alleges that GM long concealed problems with the steering sensor that risked creating dangerous conditions for drivers, even after an internal investigation uncovered issues with the component.
A Reuters review of hundreds of pages of documents submitted in the Buchanan litigation shows that GM has since 2007 confronted a series of issues with the steering sensor, including high levels of warranty claims and a manufacturing flaw, without recalling affected vehicles. Buchanan’s case is the only one Reuters has identified in which a death is alleged to have stemmed from a failure of the steering sensor.
Many of the key documents Reuters reviewed, including depositions taken of GM employees and findings from an internal GM probe in 2018, are filed under seal or otherwise shielded from public view under a Georgia judge’s sweeping protective order. Their contents are reported here for the first time.
The 2018 GM investigation into the steering sensor was launched after evidence in the Buchanan case suggested a problem with the component in her car. That probe found more than 73,700 warranty claims related to the part, according to a GM document and the deposition of a company employee. The documents don’t detail the specific issues raised in the warranty claims. GM declined to comment on the claims.
The number of claims is equal to about 10% of the roughly 778,000 SUVs GM manufactured with the sensor between 2006 and 2009. Car companies usually expect a rate of defects or other problems among vehicle components closer to a fraction of 1%, according to industry advisers. About a half a million vehicles containing the component remain on U.S. roads, according to 2019 registration data from digital automotive marketing firm Hedges & Company.
GM decided against recalling vehicles after the internal probe found it inconclusive as to whether electronic stability control was inoperative at the time of Buchanan’s crash, according to employee testimony reviewed by Reuters. The probe made no determination on whether the sensor was defective.
The sensor is a key part of GM’s version of electronic stability control, called StabiliTrak. Like other such systems, StabiliTrak adjusts brakes and engine power to help drivers avoid losing control and crashing.
Both GM and regulators have lauded electronic stability control as among the most significant automotive safety features since the seatbelt. A 2007 U.S. safety regulation has made the life-saving feature mandatory in almost all new vehicles since September 2011. It saved more than 7,000 lives during the five-year period from 2011 to 2015, according to regulators.
The primary U.S. vehicle safety regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), told Reuters it reviewed concerns raised by Lance Cooper, the lawyer representing Buchanan’s widower. In a February 2020 letter to NHTSA, Cooper urged regulators to investigate GM for failing to disclose the allegedly defective steering sensor in a timely manner and recall affected vehicles. Cooper previously unearthed evidence in another case that helped set off GM’s ignition-switch crisis.
But NHTSA said it decided in late January against opening an investigation. That previously unreported review included confidential documents related to the litigation that GM provided to the agency in March of last year, in response to an informal request for information, according to court documents. 
The NHTSA review “determined there was insufficient evidence to lead to a formal investigation at this time,” the agency said, adding that it would take future action if warranted. The agency noted that the SUVs containing the steering sensor were built before almost all new vehicles sold in the United States were required to come equipped with electronic stability control.
In written responses to questions from Reuters, GM said that after the ignition-switch crisis, it “comprehensively rebuilt and strengthened its product safety processes.” That includes encouraging employees to elevate concerns, the company said. GM also underwent several years of extra oversight from regulators. It declined to comment on NHTSA’s decision to not open an investigation.
Asked about the alleged issues with the steering sensor and GM’s decision to not recall vehicles, the automaker said it had conducted thorough investigations involving experts across many disciplines. After “a rigorous analysis of internal and external data,” the company said, “we’re not aware of any other complaints alleging accidents,” aside from Buchanan’s, that involve StabiliTrak disengaging due to a faulty steering sensor. 
The sensor-related data scrutinized in GM’s 2018 investigation included the warranty claims as well as three other legal claims and more than 5,800 complaints from dealers and customers. GM declined to comment on the complaints and the volume of claims.
On the Buchanan crash, GM said that a warning light in the vehicle had flashed hundreds of times before her fatal journey, indicating service was required. Current and former GM employees testified that even after losing StabiliTrak, drivers can still steer and brake, so vehicles remain safe.
GM, in a court filing, has denied that the sensor in Buchanan’s vehicle failed and disabled StabiliTrak. Buchanan was texting minutes before the crash on a dangerous roadway replete with winding curves and narrow shoulders, GM said in another court filing. Buchanan was also driving five to 10 miles-per-hour above the posted speed limit, GM said in the court filing, pointing to testimony of a woman who was driving behind her for several miles before the crash. 
The widower’s lawyer, Cooper, countered GM’s account of the crash in a court filing, saying phone records show she wasn’t texting at the time of the wreck and disputing that the road was dangerous. Cooper told Reuters that the Trailblazer’s black box did not record her speed.
GM is fighting an attempt by Cooper to depose its chief executive, Mary Barra. In a sworn affidavit, Barra has said she knew nothing about the automaker’s inquiry into the steering sensor. Barra, via the company spokesman, declined an interview request.
GM noted the vehicles containing the component were built more than a decade ago. The GM models containing the steering sensor are the 2006-2009 Trailblazer and GMC Envoy; 2006-2007 Buick Rainier; 2006-2009 Saab 9-7x; and 2006-2007 Isuzu Ascender, according to court records.
“DEJA VU”
Two former heads of NHTSA questioned GM’s decision not to launch a recall. They told Reuters they would expect a vehicle manufacturer to conduct a recall when presented with evidence of high warranty claims related to the same component, such as those GM found with the steering sensor, and a condition that risks disabling a key safety feature like electronic stability control.
The two former NHTSA heads also questioned the agency’s decision not to open an investigation. One of them is David Friedman, who was acting head of NHTSA during GM’s ignition-switch crisis. Friedman said he would have expected the agency to do more because the technology, even if not required, was well on its way to becoming mainstream when the affected vehicles were built. GM began including StabiliTrak as a standard feature in the Trailblazer and other similar SUVs in model year 2006, five years before it became mandatory.
“Taking it away makes the car more dangerous, and that’s likely an unreasonable risk to safety,” Friedman said, adding that he believed it warranted further investigation. “Imagine if your seatbelts, before seatbelts were required, didn’t work.”Cooper expressed disappointment with NHTSA’s decision, saying the risk of sensor failure “unquestionably relates to automotive safety.”
NHTSA said it reviewed all available data “for severity of outcome and verified frequency of occurrence” related to the sensor before deciding not to pursue a formal probe. The agency said it would continue to monitor complaints and other data.
GM said it reported Buchanan’s claims to NHTSA after the lawsuit was filed in 2016 under legal obligations requiring automakers to disclose the existence of such incidents and allegations.
U.S. law requires car companies to alert regulators within five days of discovering a vehicle defect that poses an unreasonable safety risk, which includes conditions increasing the chance of a crash or a component malfunctioning that could harm consumers. Manufacturers must then recall affected vehicles.
The maximum fine for compliance failures is about $100 million, a small fraction of the billions of dollars in annual sales for many large automotive companies. Criminal liability for failing to disclose a safety defect is limited under federal law, so prosecutors looking to bring charges usually need to pursue other allegations, such as illegal coverups or fraud.
Regulators cracked down seven years ago on automotive companies skirting legal requirements to disclose safety risks. Yet manufacturers still have significant leeway in deciding how to address concerns in vehicles, including whether a problem is serious enough to launch a recall, according to industry advisers and former U.S. officials.
The term “defect” is not narrowly defined under U.S. law, leaving it open to debate, including over the likelihood of a problem harming drivers. But even a remote chance of injury can trigger recalls, industry advisers and former U.S. automotive safety officials said.
GM has in the past recalled other vehicles with conditions that risked disabling electronic stability control.
Cooper told Reuters that GM’s approach to the alleged sensor issues drew parallels with the automaker's years-long scramble to make sense of concerns related to vehicles with defective ignition switches before launching a recall.
“It’s deja vu,” Cooper said.
GM previously admitted it kept regulators and consumers in the dark about the faulty ignition switch despite clear internal evidence it could lead to dangerous airbag failures. In 2015, GM resolved criminal charges stemming from the lapse in a deferred prosecution agreement. In its responses to Reuters, the automaker rejected Cooper’s ignition-switch comparison and said concerns raised in the Buchanan case were subjected to “robust” investigation.
The component at issue monitors the steering wheel’s position and is part of the StabiliTrak system. According to a Reuters analysis of NHTSA consumer complaint data, regulators have received more than 100 complaints concerning the sensor or StabiliTrak in vehicles with the component over the past 15 years. That included one complaint involving a crash in 2014, alleging StabiliTrak operated when it shouldn’t have. If electronic stability control activates at the wrong time, the system could suddenly apply brakes, potentially causing a driver to lose control of the vehicle.
The complaints include reports of steering sensors malfunctioning, StabiliTrak warning lights illuminating, and StabiliTrak being disabled or improperly activating. More than 30 of the complaints involved consumers allegedly losing control of their vehicles.
A complaint is not dispositive evidence of sensors or StabiliTrak malfunctioning, however. Complaints often lack key details or have varying amounts of information, which limits regulators’ ability to pinpoint specific problems.
GM declined to comment on Reuters’ analysis of the NHTSA data. But it said its experts usually cast a wide net when reviewing such consumer complaints early in investigations before zeroing in on information deemed more precisely related to the issue under scrutiny. A crash involving StabiliTrak improperly activating is distinct from allegations in the Buchanan case that the system disengaged, GM said.
MANUFACTURING ANOMALY
GM began including StabiliTrak as a standard feature in the Trailblazer and the other similar SUVs in model year 2006.
Issues with the steering sensor soon arose. In 2007 model-year vehicles, warranty claims related to the component increased to a high level, according to a February 2020 deposition of Mario Kennedy, a longstanding GM engineer who worked on electronic stability control. That increase, in part, prompted a GM problem-solving team to study the sensor, he said.
Kennedy testified that a batch of steering sensors on the 2007 Trailblazer and other similar vehicles had a “manufacturing anomaly.” The nature of the anomaly is unclear from Kennedy’s testimony because the transcript reviewed by Reuters is heavily redacted. But he said GM fixed it.
Kennedy, now retired from GM, couldn’t be reached for comment.
Cooper told Reuters the anomaly related to improper metal coating applied to the sensor. An expert for Cooper has since determined the coating problem likely didn’t affect Buchanan’s sensor, though it hasn’t been ruled out, the lawyer said.
In 2008, several wiring-related issues contributed to high levels of warranty claims potentially related to the steering sensor, Kennedy said in his deposition. GM instructed dealerships on how to fix them, Kennedy testified.
GM declined to comment on the volume and nature of the claims.
TROUBLE CODE
Glenda Marie Buchanan purchased her previously-owned 2007 Chevrolet Trailblazer three years before her crash. Her widower said in an interview that she chose a Trailblazer partly because it was a bigger, heavier car that they thought would be safe.
On the afternoon of the November 2014 crash, she had been on her way to pick up a dessert from a nearby house, her widower, Robert Randall Buchanan, told Reuters. Before the accident, she appeared to be driving normally, the woman following behind her on the road testified.
Buchanan was wearing a seatbelt, according to a police report and her widower’s complaint.
In March 2018, as part of the case, a GM supplier downloaded data from the vehicle’s electronic brake control module with experts for Cooper and GM present. It showed the presence of a trouble code that indicates a malfunctioning steering wheel angle sensor or problems with electronic signals coming from the component, according to Kennedy’s testimony and GM.
The supplier that conducted the download, now part of ZF Friedrichshafen AG, declined to comment.
The code’s presence causes StabiliTrak to deactivate, according to employee testimony and GM. One reason StabiliTrak disables under that condition is to prevent it from unsafely activating when it is not supposed to, according to Kennedy’s testimony and GM.
A few months later, in June 2018, GM opened its internal investigation. A member of the automaker’s legal department had alerted colleagues to the Buchanan case via a program its chief executive created after the ignition-switch crisis to elevate concerns, according to employee depositions and other documents.
The GM investigator leading the probe, Christa Zilincik, found the automaker had received 73,711 warranty claims related to the steering wheel angle sensor as of mid-July 2018, according to her testimony and a document reviewed by Reuters.
GM’s probe also identified 5,861 complaints from customers or dealers plus 59 complaints to regulators related to the sensor, Zilincik testified. The documents don't detail the nature of the complaints, and GM declined to comment on them.
Two GM committees reviewed Zilincik’s findings and decided against recalling affected vehicles, she testified. Zilincik couldn’t be reached for comment.

Dan Sharkey, a Detroit-area automotive industry lawyer who isn’t involved in the Buchanan case, said GM’s findings could not be ignored. The volume of warranty claims amounting to roughly 10% of vehicles built with the component that GM uncovered is ""materially high,"" he said. ""That's enough where you would say, 'We've got a big problem here.'""

882,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 08:00AM ET</span>",U.S. SPACs overtake 2020 haul in less than three months,"By Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Wall Street thought 2020 was a frenetic year for special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs).
Yet with more than nine months to go until the end of 2021, initial public offerings (IPOs) of U.S. SPACs this week surpassed the $83.4 billion the sector raised in all of 2020, data from industry tracker SPAC Research showed. 
This is also more than the $29.5 billion that IPOs of companies that operate businesses - as opposed to being empty shells like SPACs - have raised since the start of the year, according to IPOScoop data. 
The breakneck growth of what was once an obscure backwater of capital markets reflects the popularity of SPACs as an alternative vehicle to traditional IPOs. By merging with a SPAC, companies can debut in the stock market with forecasts and predictions that are not as regulated as they would be in IPO investor roadshows. In exchange, however, they often give away a larger stake of themselves than they would have in an IPO. 
""If you had told me at the beginning of the year that we would already exceed 2020 totals before the end of the first quarter, I would not have believed it. It's been quite phenomenal and there are no real signs of the momentum stopping meaningfully anytime soon,"" said Carlos Alvarez, head of permanent capital solutions at UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG). 
The $200 million IPO of Build Acquisition Corp on Tuesday pushed the total raised by U.S. SPACs in IPOs above last year's haul, which was already more than six times the previous all-time record, according to SPAC Research.
The value of mergers between SPACs and private companies has also already outpaced last year's total deal volume, even though the sector has not been a one-way bet for investors.
Graphic: SPAC craze sees 2021 topple IPO record - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdvxenerpx/Pasted%20image%201615932233799.png
Currently, 408 SPACs with $131.1 billion in cash are looking for companies to merge with. Based on the rough rule of thumb that a SPAC typically merges with a company 3-5 times its size, this equates to potentially over $600 billion in purchasing power. 
SPACs have gained immense popularity among amateur retail traders as well as Wall Street funds that are hoping to ride the coattails of the prominent investors launching them. Billionaire Bill Ackman, tennis player Serena Williams (NYSE:WMB) and former U.S. House speaker Paul Ryan are among those who raised SPACs. 
SPACs have burnished their appeal by focusing on deals in futuristic industries such as electric vehicles, self-driving cars and space exploration. While they are typically afforded two years by investors to find a deal, most of them now clinch a merger within months.
""The amount of liquidity in the system right now is unprecedented. Not only is there a great pricing umbrella for these deals to come to market, the cost of holding a SPAC is significantly lower for investors as business combinations are coming remarkably fast,"" said Warren Fixmer, managing director at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and co-head of its SPAC practice. 
EASY COME EASY GO
The rise of SPACs has been fraught with risks. While many have scored meteoric gains on finding a deal, others have quickly seen their stock rallies reversed.
Churchill Capital IV Corp's shares had run up more than 500% last month in anticipation of a merger with electric vehicle startup Lucid Motors, yet they slumped on the deal's announcement as investors became more skeptical about the prospects of it making a car in the short tern. 
The Defiance Next Gen SPAC Derived ETF, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks SPACs, fell as much as 30% off its record high this month following its launch in September. It is currently trading around 15% off its high. 
""Where SPACs go from here is going to be 100% dependent on what happens with the broader equity market,"" said Michael Ohlrogge, an assistant professor of law at New York University who has studied SPAC performance.
""When there is a correction, though, there's going to be a lot of pain in the SPAC market.""

The special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) said it sold 120 million units, up from the 100 million units it had marketed earlier, at $10 each. 
KKR Acquisition Holdings I is led by Glenn Murphy, who is also the chairman of yoga apparel maker  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) Inc, and said it plans to merge with a company in the consumer or retail industries.
The units are expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""KAHC.U"" on Wednesday.
KKR is among several private equity firms including Warburg Pincus, Cerberus Capital and Reverence Capital which have joined the SPAC frenzy in recent months. 
SPACs are companies listed on exchanges but with no business operations, except to find a private company to merge with.

884,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 07:54AM ET</span>",Airlines Get Glimpse of New Normal With EU’s Reopening Plan,"(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s battered airlines and hospitality industry were promised a gradual return to a semblance of normalcy on Wednesday, with a plan to ease coronavirus-induced restrictions on travel.
The European Union’s executive arm proposed the introduction of digital certificates that will offer proof their holders have been vaccinated, recovered from the illness or recently tested negative, and thus pose no significant health risks. The passes are meant to facilitate leisure trips both within the EU and from outside the bloc, according to a statement on Wednesday.
The European Commission also unveiled a plan for a coordinated lifting of lockdowns. The roadmap, which is explicitly meant to help restore tourism, will be based on a tier system “reflecting the epidemiological situation in each member state.”
The effort is aimed at creating a unified policy as some tourism-dependent member states threaten to unilaterally reopen to outsiders. Even with wide agreement, it will take months to implement the technology. The goal is to have the vaccine pass system in place by the middle of June, according to a draft copy of the proposal seen by Bloomberg.
A gauge of European leisure and travel stocks has recouped the losses suffered at the start of the pandemic and is hovering around record highs, on the expectation that vaccine rollouts and a gradual easing of lockdowns will boost holiday bookings. Deutsche Lufthansa (OTC:DLAKY) and InterContinental Hotels Group Plc. (LON:IHG) have both gained 11% this year.
An EasyJet PLC (LON:EZJ) spokeswoman said in an email the carrier welcomes the vaccine certificates plan. “Given the continued progress of the vaccine roll-out we must ensure there is a risk-based and data-driven approach to removing restrictions, with the objective of returning to unrestricted travel where it is possible and safe to do so.”
Adding to signs that the EU is shifting its focus on reopening, its leaders will declare next week that preparations should start “on a common approach to the gradual lifting of restrictions, to ensure that efforts are coordinated when the epidemiological situation allows for an easing of current measures,” according to a draft of their joint statement seen by Bloomberg. The wording contrasts sharply with their communique from last month, when EU leaders said that tight restrictions must be upheld.
Excessive Optimism
Still, the optimism that has buoyed travel stocks may be short-lived as projections show that air traffic and tourism are nowhere near their pre-pandemic levels. The pace of vaccinations in the EU lags behind both the U.S. and the U.K., the spread of infections shows little signs of abating, and officials in Brussels have warned that new strains of the coronavirus that are resistant to existing vaccines may emerge.
Kristina Mamic, an official at the state-run Croatian Tourism Community, said that overnight stays this year are expected at 60% of their pre-crisis levels. “People are eager to travel and we see an interest in bookings, but ultimately it will depend on epidemiological situation,” she said.
About 30% of hotels in Portugal won’t reopen for business in 2021 as bookings for the critical summer season remain weak, especially from foreign travelers, according to Portugal’s Hotel Association.
“We thought the vaccine announcements would bolster reservations but there was no impact,” Cristina Siza Vieira, head of the hotel association, said during a webcast event on March 3. “It’s going to be a very poor year in terms of the offer of accommodation because there will be very little demand.”
Cash Burn
Reviving travel is crucial for airlines as well as tourism dependent southern European destinations such as Spain, Portugal and Greece, that have seen revenues wiped out after the Covid-19 pandemic decimated travel. The International Air Transport Association said that globally, airlines could burn through as much as $95 billion this year, almost double the industry body’s previous forecast, as new coronavirus strains lead governments to extend travel restrictions.
While there’s evidence people want to travel, uncertainty about the rules has held back reservations. Airlines in Europe have been trying to stimulate demand by lowering ticket prices for travel in the second quarter of 2021, according to Skytra, a unit of Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) which collates travel industry data. While tickets booked in advance are cheaper than last minute bookings, this year they are even more discounted than usual, Skytra said.
British Airways has been calling on the U.K. Government to allow the use of digital health passports to verify vaccination or negative test results. The carrier asked for vaccinated travelers to be allowed to fly without restrictions, while unvaccinated passengers could be allowed on planes with a negative Covid-19 test.
“Vaccine passports and such like will at least enable people to travel if they want,” Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said in an email. “There is so much pent-up demand.”

885,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 07:45AM ET</span>",Vodafone seen reaping 2.13 billion euros from Frankfurt IPO: bookrunners,"By Arno Schuetze
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) is expected to price shares in infrastructure unit Vantage Towers at 24 euros ($28.60) each, valuing the firm at 12 billion euros in one of Europe's largest initial public offerings of 2021, bookrunners on the deal said on Wednesday.
The company is expected to reap 2.13 billion euros from the deal, assuming that an overallotment option is not exercised, one of the deal organisers added. 
The bookrunners said books were covered multiple times at that pricing and above, with closing expected at 1300 GMT.
The British-based operator had set the initial price range for the flotation of Vantage Towers at 22.50 to 29 euros per share, before narrowing that to 24-25 euros this week. It had targeted proceeds of 2-2.8 billion euros.
The deal adds to a strong pipeline of new listings this year including Polish e-commerce firm InPost, German used-car trading platform AUTO1, British footwear brand Dr. Martens and food delivery firm Deliveroo.
Telecom towers have become the target of several big deals as Spain's Cellnex and U.S.-based American Tower Corp (NYSE:AMT) race to increase their European footprint, eyeing the roll-out of next-generation 5G technology.
Upgrading networks, including towers, for 5G - which promises an age of self-driving cars and brain surgery performed at a distance - will soak up some $890 billion between 2020 and 2025, the GSMA industry body says.
European operators are increasingly willing to exploit assets to help finance those build-outs. 
While selling towers outright brings piles of cash, many are also looking to create separate tower units or launch joint ventures with independent companies as a way to keep a chunk of potential future growth.

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares were down 2.6% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as  worries grow about rising competition, higher interest rates and its valuation.
Volkswagen (OTC:VWAPY), which owns the Porsche, Audi and Bentley brands, said on Tuesday it expects to make 1 million electric vehicles this year, which would put it comfortably ahead of Tesla in volume sales. 
In a further sign of more competition for Elon Musk's company, Japan's  Honda  (NYSE:HMC) this month launched a limited edition level-3 autonomous sedan in its home market. Tesla is so far behind its projections of launching a fully autonomous vehicle and Musk recently admitted that the company's latest software iteration will not reach level-3.
Lansdowne Partners fund manager Per Lekander told CNBC that Tesla's stock has been in a bubble that is now deflating 
“My take is that this year is going to be the comeback for the incumbents,” Lekander said.
Tesla stock lost over one-third of its value from its January peak in the first two months of the year but has since recovered about a quarter of those losses."
887,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 07:20AM ET</span>",BMW expects at least half of sales to be electric cars by 2030,"By Nick Carey and Riham Alkousaa
(Reuters) - BMW expects at least half of its sales to be zero emission vehicles by 2030, setting a more conservative target than some rivals in the race to embrace cleaner driving. 
In the short term, the German carmaker forecast on Wednesday a big rise in pretax profit for this year, with a strong performance in all areas - from MINIS through its upmarket BMW brand to top-of-the-range Rolls-Royces.
Its shares rose as much as 4.9% to a 2-1/2 year high of 84.42 euros, buoyed by its forecast for a strong recovery from a pandemic-hit 2020. 
Bernstein analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said BMW had entered 2021 ""very confidently."" 
""In terms of electromobility, BMW is making good progress and is taking significantly fewer risks than VW,"" he said.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has said it expects 70% of European sales at its core VW brand to be electric by 2030 and this week unveiled ambitious plans to expand in electric driving - including building half a dozen battery cell plants in Europe - sending its shares sharply higher.
BMW said around 90% of its market categories would have fully-electric models available by 2023 and the electric BMW i4 would be launched three months ahead of schedule this year.
The carmaker said its MINI brand would be fully electric ""by the early 2030s"" and electric models would account for at least 50% of group deliveries by 2030.
When asked if BMW could set a date for ending sales of internal combustion engines, as some rivals have, Chief Technology Officer Frank Weber said: ""it's not us who decides on the end of the internal combustion engine, but it's the markets.""
In an industry chasing electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and facing tightening CO2 emissions standards in Europe and China, some automakers have promised a faster shift in technology, despite the huge costs and manufacturing changes involved. 
Sweden's Volvo said this month its lineup would be fully electric by 2030, and Ford said in February its lineup in Europe would be too.
Sales of electric and plug-in hybrid cars in the European Union almost trebled to over 1 million vehicles in 2020 and accounted for more than 10% of overall sales, taking zero-emission models from niche products into the mainstream. 
Chief Executive Oliver Zipse told a news conference that BMW could accelerate its plans if consumers embraced electric models more quickly than expected.
""Should demand in certain markets shift completely to fully electric vehicles in the coming years - we can deliver,"" he said.
Last week, BMW said 2021 had started well after its profit recovered in the second half of 2020 from pandemic shutdowns, thanks largely to strong sales in China.
For this year, it expects an operating profit (EBIT) margin of 6%-8% after 2.7% in 2020. 

Volkswagen said this week its 2021 operating margin should be at the upper end of its 5%-6.5% target range, with a goal of 7%-8% by 2025.

888,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 07:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. safety regulators reviewed concerns over GM sensor,"By Mike Spector
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. automotive safety regulators reviewed evidence related to an allegedly defective steering sensor that was used in roughly 778,000 older General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) vehicles but ultimately decided against opening a formal investigation into the matter.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) told Reuters about the previously unreported review. The agency evaluated information related to a lawsuit against the automaker brought by the widower of a 42-year-old woman who died after her 2007 Chevrolet Trailblazer SUV crashed, according to documents Reuters reviewed. The cause, her widower alleges in the lawsuit, was a defective steering sensor that the automaker failed to adequately warn drivers about despite long knowing the component had issues.
The lawsuit, filed in a local Georgia court in 2016 and updated in 2020, is ongoing. GM, the top-selling automaker in the United States, denies the allegations and declined to comment on the decision by NHTSA, the primary U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
The lawyer representing the widower, Lance Cooper, wrote to NHTSA in February 2020 urging it to investigate GM for failing to alert regulators to alleged issues with the sensor in a timely manner and recall affected vehicles, according to the letter, which was reviewed by Reuters. Cooper previously unearthed evidence in another case that helped expose GM's failure to recall millions of vehicles with defective ignition switches, a crisis that eventually led the automaker to resolve criminal charges in a 2015 deferred prosecution agreement. 
Following a request for information from regulators, GM provided documents produced in the recent case focused on the steering sensor, according to court documents.
On Jan. 28, NHTSA officials determined there was ""insufficient evidence to lead to a formal investigation at this time,"" the agency told Reuters, adding it would take future action if warranted. The agency said the vehicles Cooper highlighted were built before a U.S. regulation began mandating electronic stability control in September 2011.
The sensor is a key part of GM’s version of electronic stability control, called StabiliTrak. Like other such systems, StabiliTrak adjusts brakes and engine power to help drivers avoid losing control and crashing.
Cooper told Reuters he was disappointed with NHTSA’s decision to not pursue an investigation. The risk of the sensor failing and disabling electronic stability control “unquestionably relates to automotive safety,” he said.
Two former heads of NHTSA questioned the agency’s decision not to open an investigation. One said the technology, even if not required, was well on its way to becoming mainstream at the time.
A Reuters review of hundreds of pages of documents submitted in the litigation shows that GM has since 2007 confronted a series of issues with the steering sensor, including high levels of warranty claims and a manufacturing flaw, without recalling affected vehicles.
GM, in responses to questions from Reuters, said it had conducted thorough investigations involving experts across many disciplines. After “a rigorous analysis of internal and external data,” the company said, “we’re not aware of any other complaints alleging accidents” that involve StabiliTrak disengaging due to a faulty steering sensor.

Current and former GM employees have testified as part of the litigation that even after losing StabiliTrak, drivers can still steer and brake, so vehicles remain safe.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen mixed in tight trading ranges Wednesday, with the Federal Reserve set to conclude its two-day meeting later in the session.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 20 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 Futures traded 4 points, or 0.1%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 60 points, or 0.5%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.4% lower on Tuesday, ending a five-day win streak, but still on course to record its best month since November. The S&P 500 was down 0.2%, after hitting a record intraday high, while the Nasdaq Composite ended up 0.1%.
Market participants will be focusing Wednesday on the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s latest two-day meeting, its second this calendar year.
The central bank is expected to keep rates unchanged and its $120 billion pace of monthly bond purchases on hold. Of more interest will be its updated economic predictions and its predicted path of interest rate movements going forward. In addition, the Fed will likely say whether it's extending a key exemption on bank capital requirements that could have far-reaching consequences for the bond market.
“Markets already price in almost one full rate hike during 2022, and we doubt that the dot plot will look more hawkish than that. The market pricing for the next 12 months is still very muted,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note.
Rises in Treasury yields--caused largely by bets the central bank will have no option but to step up bond buying as the pace of inflation is set to accelerate--have been a key factor influencing the movement in stocks in recent weeks, specifically the tech sector, with higher rates forcing a shift into value stocks from growth.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was last seen over 1.6%, not far from the highest level in a year it hit last week.
As well as the news from the Fed, there will be February data on housing starts and building permits, as well as weekly numbers on mortgage rates and refinancing.
In the corporate sector, Uber (NYSE:UBER) is likely to be in the spotlight after the ride-hailing firm agreed to treat its U.K. drivers as employees after losing a court case.
Oil prices weakened Wednesday, after the International Energy Agency warned that global demand won’t return to pre-pandemic levels until 2023, and growth will be subdued thereafter.
Traders will carefully study U.S. inventories data from the Energy Information Administration, to be released later in the session, after the American Petroleum Institute detailed late Tuesday a surprise fall in crude stocks of 1 million barrels last week.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% lower at $64.06 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.4% to $67.47.

892,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 06:26AM ET</span>",How a Petrobras sacking ended Bolsonaro's free-market flirtation,"By Sabrina Valle, Gram Slattery and Lisandra Paraguassu
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - For many investors, President Jair Bolsonaro killed the dream of Brazil’s free-market renaissance with a Friday night Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
In a curt public statement on Feb. 19, Bolsonaro canned the head of state-run oil firm Petrobras, who had infuriated the president by raising fuel prices. Bolsonaro then named a retired Army general with no experience in the oil and gas industry to lead Latin America's biggest crude producer.
The abrupt move, coming after assurances from Bolsonaro that he would not ""interfere"" in the publicly listed company, triggered panic selling of Petrobras shares and other Brazilian equities. Analysts quickly downgraded a slew of Brazilian assets from state banks to sovereign debt.
Petrobras has lost 18% of its value this year, dragging São Paulo's Bovespa index to the steepest drop of any major world index.
While the Petrobras bombshell took some investors by surprise, it was consistent with Bolsonaro's track record. An ex-Army captain and outspoken admirer of Brazil's former military dictatorship, he has long espoused a brand of right-wing populism that, in his support for government-controlled industries, overlaps with that of the leftist politicians he loves to trash. In nearly three decades as a legislator, Bolsonaro voted repeatedly to maintain state monopolies.
During his 2018 presidential campaign, however, Bolsonaro pivoted to win the support of the country's business class. He portrayed himself as a free-market convert ready to unleash a trillion dollars worth of privatizations. He named some market-friendly economists to his team and promised to let Petrobras be run like a private company.
The president's recent moves have strained that tenuous alliance.
In recent months, Bolsonaro has harangued the head of a state bank over staff cuts, slow-walked privatizations of state-run enterprises and derailed promised reforms, including one that would have made it easier to fire civil servants and cut their benefits. In the process, he has drawn comparisons in local press to another military man-turned-president: Venezuela's late leader Hugo Chavez, the socialist firebrand.
Looking ahead to the 2022 presidential election, Bolsonaro may have little incentive to change course. Former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva - a lion of the Brazilian political left and avowed foe of privatization - now looms as a possible opponent.
Such pressure may push Bolsonaro even further from the already weakened market-friendly wing of his cabinet.
""All these controversial reforms have lost their appeal for a president who was never a fan of orthodox economic policies,"" said Leonardo Barreto, director at the political consultancy Vector in Brasília. ""Bolsonaro will increasingly wear a populist vest.""
Petrobras declined to comment.
Bolsonaro did not respond to requests for comment. He said recently that Brazil's state companies must have a ""social vision"" and that any CEO who did not share that vision had to go.
DIESEL PRICE SPAT
Bolsonaro is just the latest Brazilian leader to intervene in Petrobras, whose virtual refining monopoly gives it control over domestic fuel prices.
Leftist President Dilma Rousseff, for example, subsidized fuel prices from 2011 to 2014 to control inflation, a move that cost Petrobras $40 billion. Her centrist successor, Michel Temer, let prices rise for a time, only to face a nationwide truckers' strike that paralyzed the economy.
Like Rousseff and Temer, Bolsonaro faced pressure this year as global oil prices rebounded to a one-year high, spurring Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco to raise prices six times from early November through January. Truckers responded by threatening another strike in late January, testing Bolsonaro's professed commitment to an independent Petrobras.
Castello Branco, a 76-year old University of Chicago-trained economist installed two years ago to restructure the company, said during a Jan. 28 webinar that the truckers' demands for lower diesel prices were ""not Petrobras' problem,"" a comment that irked Bolsonaro, two sources told Reuters.
The issue came to a head on Friday, Feb. 5 when Castello Branco arrived in Brasília for an in-person meeting to discuss fuel prices with Bolsonaro and his cabinet.
At a post-meeting press conference, Bolsonaro said the government would lower pump prices by cutting fuel taxes, but would not intervene in the oil company.
""We will never control Petrobras' prices,"" he pledged, flanked by Castello Branco and cabinet ministers. ""Petrobras and its own policies are part of the international market and we respect that.""
His declaration was undermined that very afternoon when Reuters published a story revealing how Petrobras leadership had delayed the company's adjustment of its prices to international crude fluctuations, a move that allowed pump prices to remain artificially low.
The story triggered a 4% drop in Petrobras shares, reversing an initial 3.5% rally on Bolsonaro's ""hands off"" promise. Analyst downgrades followed.
Castello Branco - eager to show his independence, according to a person close to him - raised diesel by a further 6% on Feb. 8.
An even bigger diesel hike of 15.2% on Feb. 18 left Bolsonaro in a rage, according to two sources close to the situation. He viewed it as destabilizing to government efforts to calm truckers, the people said.
That evening, during a weekly broadcast on social media platforms, the president griped about the ""excessive"" price increase and leveled a threat: ""Something will happen at Petrobras in the coming days,"" he said, without elaborating.
Castello Branco was fired the next day in the Facebook post that shocked the market. He'll be out for good on March 20, when his term ends.
Castello Branco declined to comment.
Replacing him will be retired general and former Defense Minister Joaquim Silva e Luna, the latest in a slew of active duty and former military men Bolsonaro has surrounded himself with since he took office.
Asked by Reuters about public speculation that he would give the government disproportionate influence in the company, Luna noted Petrobras has mixed private-public ownership, calling its governance ""very well-balanced and controlled.""
He declined further comment.
DOUBTS ON PRIVATIZATIONS
Bolsonaro said last month that the privatization of state companies, specifically the post office and state-run electricity company Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras, or Eletrobras, were among his legislative priorities this year.
His commitment to that effort remains to be seen.
In mid-January, he came close to firing Banco do Brasil Chief Executive Andre Brandao over his plan to close 361 branches as part of a cost-cutting program.
On Jan. 25, Eletrobras CEO Wilson Ferreira Junior, who had been appointed by Temer in 2017 with a directive to privatize the company, stepped down saying he lacked support to do so. In conference calls with analysts and journalists, he blamed Congress, not Bolsonaro.
The same day, Petrobras refinery chief Analise Lara retired. She was the face of an ambitious program to sell off eight refineries nationwide, or roughly 50% of Brazil's refining capacity. Analysts from BTG Pactual and other banks said that plan is now in doubt given the company's new leadership.
Days later, Petrobras Chief Compliance Officer Marcelo Zenkner also departed.
Worries about government interference at Petrobras played a role in their decisions, two people close to the former executives told Reuters.
Zenkner did not respond to a request for comment. Lara declined to comment and referred Reuters to the Petrobras press office, which reiterated its earlier statements that Lara had retired and that Zenkner had left for personal reasons.
Investors still looking for Bolsonaro to shake up Brazil's state companies are deluding themselves, said Mauro Cunha, a former Petrobras independent board member and ex-head of a minority shareholders' rights group.

“The arguments that 'this time it’s different' are like a childish dream,” Cunha said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Caution descended on markets on Wednesday with world stocks holding below recent record highs as investors waited to see whether the U.S. Federal Reserve would signal a faster path toward policy normalisation than previously expected.
The U.S. central bank ends a closely anticipated two-day meeting later in the day, after a sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields this year on expectations for stronger growth and inflation.
The Fed is expected to forecast that the U.S. economy will grow in 2021 at the fastest rate in decades. But investors who expect rosier projections to translate to any change in monetary policy will probably be disappointed. 
""This is one of the most important Fed meetings we've had for some time and the impact will be felt across asset classes,"" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. 
""Markets are hoping for reassurance from the Fed that rising bond yields are not something to worry about, and that takes a bit of steam out of the bond market."" 
Before the Fed statement at 1800 GMT, calm prevailed across world markets.
MSCI's world equity index was down 0.1%, but keeping last month's record highs within sight. 
European shares were a touch softer, while in Asia, an index of regional equities excluding Japan pulled back 0.4%. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed flat.
There was some good news for AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) as Australia's pharmaceutical regulator said the rollout of the company's COVID-19 vaccine would continue, even though many European nations have paused vaccinations to investigate reported side-effects.
U.S. stock futures pointed to a flat open on Wall Street, after the S&P 500 lost 0.16% on Tuesday.
DOVISH?
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were a touch higher at 1.63%, holding near 13-month highs reached on Friday. They have risen 72 basis points so far this year. That compares with a 24 bps increase in German peers and a 7 bps rise in Japanese borrowing costs.
Inflation expectations have also ticked higher with the break-even rate on 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) on Tuesday rising above 2.3% for the first time since July 2014. The break-even rate for 30-year TIPS hit 2.24%, the highest since September 2014.

""We expect (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell to note the FOMC has the tools to intervene if the bond market becomes disorderly or constrains the economic recovery,"" analysts at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) wrote.
""But we expect Powell to push back against talk of policy tightening because of the large amount of labour market slack ... U.S. bond yields and the U.S. dollar could jump if the FOMC’s post‑meeting statement and Powell’s statement are not deemed dovish enough.""
An index tracking the dollar against six major peers was around 91.92. The euro was weaker on the day at $1.1892. The dollar was up about 0.1% at 109.13 yen.
Currency market caution may extend all week, with the Bank of England meeting on Thursday and the Bank of Japan wrapping up a policy review on Friday, in which it may phase out a numerical target for its asset buying.
Elsewhere, oil prices slipped for a fourth day as concern about weaker demand in Europe outweighed an industry report that showed U.S. crude stockpiles unexpectedly fell last week.
Brent crude futures fell 27 cents to $68.12 a barrel and U.S. crude futures slipped 14 cents to $64.65.

(Reuters) - European stocks ticked lower on Wednesday as most investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy decision, while German carmaker BMW jumped after forecasting significant profit growth in 2021.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index edged 0.3% lower, trading below a one-year peak after a cautious session in Asian markets.
The Fed's monetary policy stance will be closely watched after a recent run-up in Treasury yields stoked concerns about a pick-up in inflation as the U.S. economy rebounds from pandemic lows. The central bank's policy statement and economic forecasts are due at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT).
""The Fed at this point probably thinks that the impact of the high yield is relatively modest on the stock market,"" said Dhaval Joshi, chief strategist at BCA Research in London.
""They will stick to their narrative, and only if there is a big sort of pushback in the market crisis, would they intervene aggressively.""
A move into some of the cheaply valued sectors such as banks and energy has pushed European stocks closer to record levels hit last year, with investors counting on vaccination drives and stimulus measures to spur a strong global rebound this year. 
BMW rose 4.4% after it said it expects a significant annual increase in group pre-tax profit in 2021 as it forecast a strong performance in all its segments.
Europe's automobiles & parts index gained 1.5% to hit a fresh 2018 high, with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) rising 3.1% after it forecast its 2021 deliveries, sales and earnings to come in above the previous year's level.
German airport operator Fraport jumped 3.9% after HSBC upgraded the stock to ""buy"", saying the pandemic has forced the company to become ""better"".
Austrian hydropower producer Verbund slid 4.3% as it expects 2021 profit to fall after a 14% rise in 2020, thanks to lower electricity prices.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged largely lower Wednesday ahead of the conclusion of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting, with BMW and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) helping the German market outperform. 
At 4:10 AM ET (0910 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, but the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.4%.
BMW (DE:BMWG) stock soared 5%, climbing to its highest level in a year, after the German automaker said it expects a significant year-on-year increase in pretax profit in 2021 as it forecast a strong performance in all of its segments.
Staying in the sector, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG) stock climbed over 10% after the company said it expects its 2021 deliveries, sales and earnings to come in above the previous year's level, as it announced the start of its new strategy to deliver more than 450,000 electrified cars this year.
Away from this, the tone in Europe has been more subdued with France entering a third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, French Prime Minister Jean Castex told his country’s parliament Tuesday.
This followed the Robert Koch Institute warning earlier Tuesday that coronavirus infections are spreading exponentially in Germany, up 20% in the last week.
France and Italy said on Tuesday they will resume distribution of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine if the European Medicines Agency says again that the vaccine is safe for use. The EMA has already approved the drug once and repeated at a press conference on Tuesday that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh any risks. Germany and others have yet to reverse their suspensions. 
Away from Europe, the Federal Reserve concludes its latest two-day meeting later Wednesday and is scheduled to release new economic and interest rate forecasts. With the Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package yet to have its impact, the market is beginning to anticipate interest rates rising sooner than in 2024, as the central bank’s current guidance suggests.
Other central bank meetings are also scheduled this week, with the Bank of England on Thursday and the Bank of Japan's two-day get together concluding Friday.
Oil prices drifted lower Wednesday, selling off despite the surprise fall in U.S. crude inventories of 1 million barrels last week, as detailed by the American Petroleum Institute.
U.S. stockpiles had been rising as February’s unexpected cold snap in the southern states had knocked out a significant portion of the country's refining capacity.
Official data from the Energy Information Administration are due later in the session, and will be studied carefully for confirmation of this crude drawdown.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $64.66 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $68.11.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,732.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1905.

Market Forces, which made the request on Wednesday, said in a statement that aside from Myanmar links, Adani Ports should be scrutinised for its role in opening up the thermal coal mine in Australia, and also past ecological damage at ports in India. 
Adani Ports did not immediately reply to a request for comment while S&P Global said it could not comment on individual companies. Market Forces is a Melbourne-based activist group affiliated to Friends of the Earth Australia.
The Dow Jones Sustainability Emerging Markets added Adani Ports at number 14 in the transportation and transportation infrastructure sector in November, sending its shares up 6%. 
The group aims for its port operations to be carbon neutral by 2025 thanks in part to its large investment in renewables.
Market Forces said that Adani Ports should be disqualified from the index given its subsidiary will build a railway line to haul coal from the Carmichael project in Australia's Queensland state, at a time when financiers are increasingly withdrawing from new thermal coal projects due to climate concerns.
""Investors need to have confidence that ESG indices take into account the full picture of a company's activities and the impacts they cause,"" Market Forces campaigner Pablo Brait said in the statement.
""The signatories to this case believe DJSI has not properly accounted for Adani Ports' links to thermal coal mining expansion and the devastating ecological damage found at some of its port sites.""
India's government blamed Adani Ports for causing damage to the environment during the construction of the Mundra port project in Gujarat.
Political campaigners have also questioned Adani Ports' investments in Myanmar, where a military coup on Feb. 1 led to the ouster of an elected government led by Nobel peace prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

The Adani Group is developing a $290 million port in Yangon, on land owned by the Myanmar Economic Corporation, which is controlled by the military.

(Reuters) - Chinese companies targeted by a sweeping investment ban imposed by former President Donald Trump are considering suing the U.S. government after a federal judge on Friday suspended a similar blacklisting for Beijing-based smartphone maker Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF).
Lawyers familiar with the matter said some of the banned Chinese companies are in talks with law firms including Steptoe & Johnson and Hogan Lovells, emboldened by U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras' preliminary order halting Xiaomi's inclusion on a U.S. list of alleged Communist Chinese military companies that are subject to an investment ban. 
The Trump administration's move to blacklist Xiaomi Corp, which knocked $10 billion off its market share and sent its shares down 9.5 percent in January, would have forced investors to completely divest their stakes in the company.
""Companies are reaching out to lawyers to challenge the listings and the grounds for the listings,"" said Wendy Wysong, managing partner of the Hong Kong office of Steptoe & Johnson, a worldwide law firm headquartered in Washington. Wysong and a person familiar with Hogan Lovells, another global law firm, declined to name the companies involved in discussions.
Contreras flagged the U.S. government's ""deeply flawed"" process for including the company in the investment ban, based on just two key criteria: its development of 5G technology and artificial intelligence, which the Defense Department alleges are ""essential to modern military operations,"" and an award given to Xiaomi founder and Chief Executive Lei Jun from an organization said to help the Chinese government eliminate barriers between commercial and military sectors.
The judge noted that 5G and AI technologies were fast becoming standard in consumer electronics, and that over 500 entrepreneurs had received the same award as Lei since 2004, including the leaders of an infant formula company. 
    ""The facts that led to Xiaomi's designation are almost laughable, and I think it absolutely is going to lead to additional companies seeking relief,"" said Washington lawyer Brian Egan, a former legal adviser in both the White House and State Department who also works at Steptoe. 
GOVERNMENT UNDECIDED ON PATH FORWARD
In a joint filing on Tuesday, the government said it had not decided on the ""appropriate path forward"" in the Xiaomi case in light of the judge's decision.
    A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice, which is defending the case, declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the Department of Defense referred questions to the White House, which has not responded. 
Xiaomi and 43 other companies were added in the waning months of the Trump administration to the blacklist, which was mandated by a 1999 law requiring the Defense Department to publish a compilation of companies ""owned or controlled"" by the Chinese military. 
Seeking to cement a tough line on China and box his Democratic successor, Joe Biden, into hardline policies, Trump signed an executive order that was later expanded to bar all U.S. investors from holding securities in the named companies beginning on Nov. 11, 2021. 
Other companies listed include video surveillance giant Hikvision, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC (NYSE:CEO)) and China's top chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.
SMIC, Hikvision and CNOOC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Luokung Technology Corp, a mapping technology company on the list, also sued the U.S. government earlier this month, and is expected to seek preliminary relief similar to that awarded to Xiaomi.

899,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 03:40AM ET</span>",Uber to give UK drivers workers' rights after court defeat,"By Costas Pitas
LONDON (Reuters) - In a major victory for unions, Uber's more than 70,000 British drivers will be paid the minimum wage while picking up and driving passengers as part of the ride-hailing company's agreement to grant workers' rights after it lost a groundbreaking Supreme Court case last month. 
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc has pushed back against European and U.S. labor advocates' demands for better driver compensation with some success, calling for a ""third way"" of combining flexible on-demand work with more limited benefits than traditional employees receive.
The agreement in Britain classifies Uber drivers as workers who are entitled to fewer rights than those classed as employees, who are also guaranteed sick pay and parental leave. Uber in California last year pushed and won a similar compromise on drivers' status.
In a case led by two former Uber drivers, a UK employment tribunal ruled in 2016 that they were due entitlements such as paid holidays, prompting Uber to appeal all the way to Britain's top court, which ruled against it in February.
Uber said at the time it would consult with drivers whilst lawyers said it could take several months for the details of the ruling to be worked out at a further employment tribunal hearing. Meanwhile, more cases could be filed.
On Tuesday, Uber said UK drivers would receive some added benefits, including paid holiday time, be enrolled in a pension scheme and receive no less than the minimum wage, which stands at an hourly 8.72 pounds ($12.07) for those aged 25 years and over, after they accept a trip request.
""This follows the recent UK Supreme Court ruling, which provides a clearer path forward as to a model that gives drivers the rights of worker status while continuing to let them work flexibly,"" Uber said. 
Drivers will not receive minimum wage during the time they spend waiting for a passenger. That portion, known as cruising or dead-heading, can account for as much as a third of the time drivers spend behind the wheel with the app turned on, according to several U.S. studies.
UK and U.S. labor activists have called on Uber to pay drivers from the moment they log onto the app and are available, but Uber has said it could not control what drivers did during that time and whether they were actually working.
The Silicon Valley-based company said its drivers in London, by far its largest market in Europe, earn 17 pounds an hour on average and the flexibility to choose if, when and where they work will be retained. 
Uber has faced opposition from traditional taxi operators and unions who criticised the app for undercutting existing players, leading to protests and regulatory and legal challenges which have forced the company to pull out of some markets.
France's top court in 2020 recognised the right of an Uber driver to be considered an employee while European Union regulators are considering new rules to protect gig economy workers. 
California lawmakers last year implemented a bill that would have forced gig economy companies to treat their workers as employees, leading Uber to put forth its ""third way"" ballot proposition, which voters approved.
That cemented app-based workers' status as independent contractors while offering some benefits, including minimum pay while riders are in their cars, healthcare subsidies and accident insurance.
In California, Uber has financed at least some of the added benefits by increasing prices for riders.
Tuesday's announcement could impact others in the gig economy, where millions of people tend to work for one or more companies on a job-by-job basis. 

""Uber is just one part of a larger private-hire industry, so we hope that all other operators will join us in improving the quality of work for these important workers who are an essential part of our everyday lives,"" said Uber's Northern and Eastern Europe boss Jamie Heywood.

901,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2021 03:16AM ET</span>",Power Play: Volkswagen abruptly pulls plug on South Korean battery makers,"By Heekyong Yang, Yilei Sun and Christoph Steitz
SEOUL/BEIJING/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Days before Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) held an event to announce a major ramp-up in its electric vehicle production, the German car maker abruptly told its South Korean battery suppliers their current technology would be largely excluded from those plans. 
The decision by the world's second largest automaker to move the bulk of its cars to a different battery cell in two years came as a shock to LG Energy Solution and SK Innovation, three people with knowledge of the situation told Reuters. 
""It's not our everyday business routine to get such one-sided notice from a partner ... people seemed to be pretty alarmed,"" one of the sources said.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s shift to a new unified prismatic battery, away from the pouch-style manufactured by LG and SK, is likely to be a massive blow given the pair have invested billions in pouch production sites in the United States, Europe and Asia.
The shift also raised concerns among battery suppliers that the race by automakers to meet growing demand for EVs in a rapidly changing technological environment could leave them behind almost overnight.
""Volkswagen's announcement is just the beginning of the competition in the EV market, signalling that huge investment will be made competitively in the future,"" said Lee Jae-il, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities. 
Volkswagen is under intense pressure to cut battery costs, strengthen its position in China, and better compete with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL), which already supplies Volkswagen and Tesla, is making prismatic batteries, the technology favoured for Volkswagen future vehicles.
Thomas Schmall, Volkswagen's board member in charge of technology, said this week the company would keep its current contracts, adding 80% of its post 2025 generation of EV cars would use prismatic batteries. Schmall did not specify battery technology for the remaining 20%.
Schmall said it would not be a big deal for battery suppliers to switch to production of prismatic cells, although analysts suggested doing so would require significant reinvestment and time to overhaul factories.
SK, which had announced a contract in 2018 to supply Volkswagen with pouch batteries but had not yet started doing so, said it currently has no plans to produce prismatic batteries. It supplies pouch batteries to Hyundai Motor and its sister company Kia.
LG, which makes prismatic batteries but only for smaller goods such as laptops, declined to comment on whether it would expand that production to EV batteries. Volkswagen was one of its biggest clients for pouch batteries, but it retains Tesla, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Hyundai Motor. It also builds cylindrical batteries for Tesla.
CHANGING ALLEGIANCES
Of particular concern to executives at auto parts suppliers was Volkswagen's relative lack of consultation with LG and SK about the battery shift, a break with tradition from the industry strategies pioneered by Toyota decades ago. 
When LG told Volkswagen it would send an executive to Germany to discuss the potential battery switch, Volkswagen told LG not to, all three people with knowledge of the situation told Reuters. They declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak to the media. 
""This is rare among automakers and suppliers which they have good relationship with,"" said Yale Zhang, head of the Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight. ""Traditionally automakers invite core suppliers to discuss future technology before finalising as they need to ensure supply.""
It comes just days after outgoing Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Chief Executive Kazuhiro Tsuga told the Financial Times his company needed ""to graduate from our one-legged approach of relying solely on Tesla."" Panasonic lost its coveted decade-long position as Tesla's exclusive supplier last year when the carmaker unveiled plans to begin developing its own batteries and add LG and CATL as purchasing partners.
Two sources told Reuters SK and LG's situation was complicated by a U.S. legal battle between the bitter rivals that has threatened to disrupt Volkswagen's EV production at its Tennessee factory and left the carmaker ""very unhappy"" with the pair. 
""Volkswagen warned South Korean battery makers early last year that Chinese battery makers would be beneficiaries of the legal disputes,"" one person told Reuters.
CHINA WINS
China, the world's biggest car market and a key battleground for EV, is the winner in Volkswagen's shift from the lighter pouch batteries to the generally safer and easier to source prismatic batteries.
As well as its deal with CATL, Volkswagen told Reuters it planned to source batteries from Wanxiang A123 and Guoxuan High-tech Co Ltd. A source close to Guoxuan told Reuters it anticipates striking a supply deal for lithium iron phosphate batteries in a year or more.
Other China suppliers were likely, Volkswagen said, as it begins the roll-out of five models of its ID series of EVs in the country this year.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Wednesday, on mounting Covid concerns ahead of the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.3% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.8%.
France has entered a third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, French Prime Minister Jean Castex told his country’s parliament Tuesday, with the seven-day average of new cases rising to levels last seen in late November.
French health authorities reported 29,975 new cases on Tuesday, a 4.5% jump versus last Tuesday's total and the sharpest week-on-week rise in a month and a half.
This followed the Robert Koch Institute warning earlier Tuesday that coronavirus infections are spreading exponentially in Germany, up 20% in the last week.
France and Italy said on Tuesday they will resume distribution of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine if the European Medicines Agency says again that the vaccine is safe for use.  The EMA has already approved the drug once and repeated at a press conference on Tuesday that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh any risks. Germany and others have yet to reverse their suspensions. 
Market losses are likely to be small as traders await the outcome of the Fed’s two-day policy meeting later in the day, and the subsequent press conference from Chairman Jerome Powell.
The U.S. central bank is scheduled to release new economic and interest rate forecasts, and is likely to acknowledge stronger growth in 2021. With the Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package yet to have its impact, the market is beginning to anticipate interest rates rising sooner than in 2024, as the central bank’s current guidance suggests.
Other central bank meetings are also scheduled this week, with the Bank of England on Thursday and the Bank of Japan’s two-day get together concluding Friday.
In corporate news, German insurer Munich Re is scheduled to release quarterly earnings while car giant BMW (DE:BMWG) releases its annual report.
Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday, boosted by a surprise fall in U.S. crude inventories of 1 million barrels last week, as detailed by the American Petroleum Institute.
U.S. stockpiles had been rising as February’s unexpected cold snap in the southern states had knocked out a significant portion of the country's refining capacity.
Official data from the Energy Information Administration are due later in the session, and will be studied carefully for confirmation of this crude drawdown.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $65.21 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.5% to $68.72.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,735.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1904.

The pharmaceutical industry increasingly relies for its profits on costly biologic drugs, made from living organisms that are tougher and more expensive to make than conventional medicines with chemical ingredients.
""The site was planned to manufacture three biosimilars for the China market,"" the company said in a response to Reuters.
""Pfizer commercially and technically evaluated other products for the site but none reached the level of activity for the scale of the site."" 
Neither Pfizer nor WuXi disclosed the deal value, or the products to be made after the transaction closes, which is expected in the first half of this year.
WuXi said the deal would allow it to address surging manufacturing demand for drug substances and drug products.
The facilities are equipped with bioreactors and capable of filing vials and syringes, the Chinese firm said in a statement on the WeChat app.

WuXi also makes vaccine substances for a COVID-19 shot developed by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) PLC and the University of Oxford to supply them to Brazil, but did not have immediate comment on whether the plant would turn out such substances.

904,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 16, 2021 11:45PM ET</span>",Value Stocks a Week Away From ‘Holy Grail’ Momentum Boost,"(Bloomberg) -- Value stocks are morphing into their once-feared momentum rivals, a shift that could accelerate in coming weeks and give their rally a fresh boost.
Next Tuesday marks the 12-month anniversary of the MSCI AC World Value Index’s eight-year low, a key timeframe that many quantitative models use to screen for momentum shares to buy. May 6 would be the six-month anniversary of the relative low for value stocks against their growth and momentum peers -- their outperformance began after the election of U.S. President Joe Biden.
“There is a significant overlap emerging between deep value stocks and momentum stocks -- there are a number of autos, banks, materials, and energy stocks which are screening as both value and momentum,” wrote Bernstein strategist Sarah McCarthy in a note Wednesday. “This is the holy grail of quant and value investing.”
Biden’s victory and his immediate calls for further stimulus sent investors rushing to buy stocks exposed to a jump-started economy and the prospect of rising inflation. That meant a switch to long-overlooked value shares such as those in the financials, energy and industrials sectors and away from high-priced technology stocks, which had dominated momentum investing for most of the last decade.
The global value stock gauge has jumped 22% since Nov. 6, while the equivalent growth index is up just 8%. The MSCI AC World Momentum Index -- which is up 5% over the same period -- chooses its members based on a combination of 12-month and 6-month performance, according to its factsheet.
Momentum bets are popular within the roughly $2 trillion systematic community, which groups stocks together by their characteristics, an approach known as factor investing. Exchange-traded funds tied to momentum command $20 billion in the U.S. alone.
Momentum Quants Will Unleash the ‘Most Turbulent Rebalance Ever’
The overlap between value and momentum for certain stocks hasn’t happened since 2016, “the last period of short but meaningful value outperformance,” according to Bernstein. “We are tactically long value and think there is further to go.”

905,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2021 11:45PM ET</span>",Airlines face headache over 'use-by' date on some jet parts as pandemic grounds fleets,"By Jamie Freed
(Reuters) - Airlines with planes idled by the pandemic are cutting costs by delaying some maintenance tasks like changing life vests, testing oxygen bottles and checking emergency exits under COVID-19 waivers from airplane manufacturers and regulators.
The move allows airlines to stop the clock on a category of parts that would otherwise need checks or pass their ""use-by"" date without leaving the ground because of the huge number of planes parked during the pandemic.
In special guidance to airlines, Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY), Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, Brazil's  Embraer SA  (NYSE:ERJ) and turboprop manufacturer ATR say there is no risk to safety because the work will be done before the planes return to the skies.
But there are concerns that delays could trigger commercial disputes between airlines and their lessors and financiers if they breach contractual maintenance agreements.
""I think there is going to be some argument,"" said Phil Seymour, president of aviation intelligence and advisory firm IBA.
Delayed checks also mean it will take longer to reactivate planes.
In the highly regulated world of airplane maintenance, the frequency of many tasks is determined by the number of take-offs and landings or flight hours. But others, such as life vests and portable oxygen bottles, have a fixed schedule for replacement. 
The world's two major aviation regulators in the United States and Europe have both provided COVID-19 related guidance on extending some time-related tasks while a plane is stored.
""Prior to an aircraft return to service from storage, all scheduled maintenance tasks that were scheduled during the non-operational status must be performed,"" a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman said.
In a sign of the scale of the issue, Boeing put an engineering team to work analysing all of the roughly 1,400 tasks per model to help airlines keep costs down and delay work that was not deemed urgent or safety-critical.
That allowed the maximum extension of 10% beyond the scheduled time to be increased to as much as 12 months for grounded planes not subject to passenger foot traffic, cargo carriage, and other wear and tear. 
""The unique, individual assessments for each Boeing model accounted for all climates around the world and can support all operators,"" a Boeing spokesman said.
Airbus also analysed calendar-driven tasks to give more flexibility to customers, said Airbus head of scheduled maintenance services Claire Kauffmann.
""This ensures that the task is performed in a safe way and that they have proper time and staff to do that,"" she said. 
An ATR spokesman said airlines had used a three-month ""clock stoppage"" on parked planes to ensure time-driven tasks were not scattered over a longer schedule.
Consulting group Oliver Wyman said in a recent report that the mass return to service of grounded aircraft expected over the next two years could create a maintenance-demand bubble.
Although the airline industry does not expect passenger traffic to rebound to 2019 levels until 2024, Oliver Wyman forecasts spending on airframe maintenance will recover to 2019 levels by 2022. 
The decision by many airlines to spread their limited flying among more planes than usual to be ready for a sharp increase in demand could also drive more maintenance spending as manufacturers consider requiring some work to be done regardless of flight hours. 
For example, most of the tasks related to the air conditioning system need to be done every 2,000 flight hours, normally about six months. But if the plane only flies 400 hours in six months, the check might be moved up to 1,600 hours to account for the longer passage of time, Kauffmann said.

""Here we would actually recommend increasing the number of tasks to be performed if you have a low utilisation,"" she said. ""This is always an engineering driven and safety driven analysis.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down Wednesday morning ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision due later in the day.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged down 0.12% by 11:28 PM ET (3:28 AM GMT), with investors digesting disappointing February trade data released earlier in the day. Exports contracted 4.5% year-on-year, imports grew 11.8% and the trade balance stood at JPY217.4 billion.
South Korea’s KOSPI slid 1.08% and in Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.80%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.21%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.21% while the Shenzhen Component jumped 1.04%. U.S.-China tensions are back in the news ahead of diverging goals at Thursday’s meeting between the U.S. and Chinese officials in Alaska.
Benchmark Treasury yields were near their highest levels in over a year, with the ten-year yield trading around 1.62% on Tuesday and a 20-year bond auction also drawing strong demand. The dollar also inched up on Wednesday.
All eyes are on the Fed’s policy decision, with the updated projections for rates and the economy of particular interest. However, rates could rise sooner than the central bank’s current guidance suggests, as growing inflation expectations boost bond yields and drive a rotation from growth to value stocks.
“We’re inclined not to fight the Fed, at least until wage pressures show up … that said, growing uncertainty over the front end of the curve will contribute to market volatility in the coming months,” New York Life Investments portfolio strategist Lauren Goodwin said in a note.
Ten-year Treasury yield could hover close to 2% by the end of 2021 and “if rates increase faster than that, we could see some churn in equity markets,” the note added.
With the Fed expected to forecast that the U.S. economy will grow in 2021 at the fastest rate in decades, other investors also predicted that yields and the dollar would both continue their upward trend.
“We expect [Fed Chairman Jerome] Powell to note the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) has the tools to intervene if the bond market becomes disorderly or constrains the economic recovery … but we expect Powell to push back against talk of policy tightening because of the large amount of labor market slack … U.S. bond yields and the USD could jump if the FOMC’s post‑meeting statement and Powell’s statement are not deemed dovish enough,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) analysts said in their own note.
Other central banks also due to hand down their policy decisions are the Bank of England, whose decision is due out on Thursday, followed by the Bank of Japan on Friday."

A measure of 30-day volatility in Chinese shares has surged to its highest since August as the benchmark CSI 300 Index struggles to recover from a rout that’s seen it lose more than 13% since closing at a 13-year high last month. Meanwhile, swings in China’s key 10-year sovereign bond yields have narrowed to the lowest since late 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Bonds Remain Resilient Amid Global Debt Selloff: Inside China
Not just relative to local stocks, Chinese bonds have proved resilient even when compared to peers in other markets, as the global reflation trade has triggered increased price swings from Australia to Europe. China’s 10-year yield has moved within a tight seven basis-point range over the past month.
“The expensive valuations of stocks has made traders extremely sensitive to bad news these days,” said Jackson Wong, Hong Kong-based asset management director at Amber Hill Capital Ltd. “Also, lots of recent government measures do not affect bond market that much, such as the clampdown on technology giants, but those hurt heavyweight stocks directly.”
Meanwhile, the ongoing corporate earnings season in China has also contributed to volatility in the stock market.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co said late Tuesday supply chain issues will force a halt to production at a majority of U.S. and Canadian auto plants for a week.
The Japanese automaker added the issue will result in some production cuts next week at all U.S. and Canadian plants, citing ""the impact from COVID-19, congestion at various ports, the microchip shortage and severe winter weather over the past several weeks.""
""In some way, all of our auto plants in the U.S. and Canada will be impacted,"" Honda said.
Some U.S. and Canadian plants are expected to have smaller production cuts next week, but a spokesman for Honda added ""the timing and length of production adjustments could change."" 
The company declined to specify the volume of vehicles impacted but said ""purchasing and production teams are working to limit the impact of this situation."" 
The company added when production is suspended Honda workers ""will continue to have the opportunity to work at the impacted plants."" Honda workers were notified of the production cuts Monday.
Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, said Honda typically produces about 30,000 vehicles a week in the United States and Canada. 
The production issues are hitting Honda plants in Ontario, Ohio, Alabama, and Indiana. Honda said its Mexico operations have not announced any production cuts.
The chip shortage, which has hit most of the global automakers, stems from a confluence of factors as carmakers, which shut plants for two months during the COVID-19 pandemic last year, compete with the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip supplies.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) has cut production at many plants and warned it could shave up to $2 billion from this year's earnings.

GM's U.S. rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co previously said the shortage could hurt 2021 profit by up to $2.5 billion and said it had curtailed production of its flagship F-150 pickup.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Detroit police said Tuesday they do not believe Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s driver assistance system Autopilot was in use during a crash last week of a Tesla that became wedged underneath a tractor-trailer and left a passenger in critical condition.
On Monday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it was aware of the ""violent crash"" in Detroit on March 11 and a Special Crash Investigation (SCI) team would investigate.
Detroit Police Assistant Chief David LeValley said Tuesday at a press briefing ""that all indications"" are that the Tesla was not in Autopilot mode at the time, citing statements made by the driver and video evidence showing some evasive maneuvers before the crash. 
The passenger is still hospitalized while the driver, who was previously hospitalized, is being charged with reckless driving, LeValley said, adding that speed was a significant factor in the crash.
NHTSA has previously launched at least 14 special crash investigation teams following Tesla crashes that were suspected of being tied to its Autopilot driver assistance system, but has taken no action against the automaker as a result of those probes.
NHTSA investigators will meet with Detroit police later this week to review data from the vehicle's data recorder, LeValley said.
Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.
Autopilot has been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016.
NHTSA and the National Transportation Safety Board have probed other crashes in which a Tesla struck a trailer, including two fatal crashes in Florida. 
Tesla advises drivers they must keep their hands on the steering wheel and pay attention while using Autopilot. However, some Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid putting their hands on the wheel for extended periods when using Autopilot.

The housing market has been one of the persistent bright spots throughout the coronavirus-driven recession. However, it faces prospects of a slowdown as mortgage rates rise on the back of a surge in U.S. Treasury yields.
Lennar estimated second-quarter orders -- an indicator of future sales -- between 16,500 homes and 16,700 homes, above analysts' estimates of 16,240 homes, helped in part by a shortage of previously owned houses on the market.
""A combination of still low interest rates, strong personal savings rates during the pandemic, strong stimulus from the government, and solid household formation continue to drive demand,"" Executive Chairman Stuart Miller said.
The Miami, Florida-based homebuilder's shares were 1% higher in extended trading, having gained over 16% so far this year.
But Lennar's delivery forecast of between 14,200 homes and 14,400 homes was below expectations of 15,067 homes, as land constraints and soaring lumber prices limit homebuilding activity.
The company's profit jumped more than two-fold in the first quarter to $1 billion, buoyed by a one-time gain of $469.7 million related to its investment in online real estate firm Opendoor Technologies Inc, which went public in December.
Excluding that, profit was $2.04 per share, higher than analysts' estimates of $1.71 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

(Reuters) - U.S. retail investors are buying the American depositary receipts of German automaker Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), some market participants said, accelerating a rally spurred by well-received VW announcements on its efforts to overtake Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc in the electric vehicles market.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s U.S.-listed stock rose nearly 17% on Monday and Tuesday. By contrast, its preference shares, which comprise its main class of stock, gained almost 9% during the same period in Frankfurt. 
Since institutional investors tend to trade the company's more liquid preference shares, the outsize rise in Volkswagen’s thinly traded U.S. ADR is an indication of buying from U.S. retail investors, said Angelo Meda, head of equities at Banor SIM in Milan.
""U.S. retail investors have targeted Europe,"" Meda said.
Volume in the ADRs, which are the only class of shares accessible by U.S. individual investors, was nearly 12 times the 90-day average on Tuesday, while volume in the preferred shares was around 2.5 times, according to Eikon data.
Retail investors have helped spur wild rides in a handful of stocks this year, most famously in shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), which surged by more than 1,600% in late January only to pare most of those gains the following month. 
There was little recent mention of Volkswagen on Reddit’s WallStreetBets, the stock discussion forum whose denizens have been diehard supporters of GameStop, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc and other so-called meme stocks. 
But the carmaker drew heavy interest on trading-focused social media site Stocktwits, where message volume related to the U.S. listing spiked over 70%, with more than 97% of messages reflecting positive sentiment, according to the site.
A day after unveiling plans to build half a dozen battery cell plants in Europe, the German company said it aimed to more than double deliveries of electric vehicles this year. It also reiterated its confidence that cost cuts would help to raise profit margins in the coming years.

Volkswagen's ordinary stock in Germany, which unlike the preferential class of shares is tied to the ADRs, gained 15.5% in two sessions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union criticized Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's plan to build a new vehicle in Mexico rather than at an Ohio plant, suggesting it might be in violation of the automaker's contractual commitments.
In a letter made public on Tuesday, UAW Vice President Gerald Kariem said Ford intends to build a next-generation vehicle in Mexico.
""We 100% reject the company’s decision to put corporate greed and more potential profits over American jobs and the future of our members. We expect the company to honor its contractual commitments to this membership and when it fails to do so we will take action,"" Kariem wrote in the Friday letter.
""We are intensely exploring our options at this time,"" he added.
The UAW said Ford in 2019 as part of its four-year contract agreement had committed $900 million for the plant in Avon Lake, Ohio, including a next-generation product to be added in 2023, which the UAW letter said would secure the plant's ""employment well into the foreseeable future.""
Ford issued a statement on Tuesday that did not directly address the union's criticism but said in a letter to employees on Monday that conditions had changed since 2019.
A company spokeswoman said Ford had invested more than $185 million since 2019 at its Ohio Assembly Plant, including plans to increase capacity to build additional Super Duty trucks. The plant has about 1,600 UAW-represented employees.
Ford said in November it was planning to build an additional electric vehicle at its plant in Cuautitlan, Mexico, where the Mustang Mach-E is produced.
Automotive News cited a person familiar with Ford's plans that the automaker had been considering building electric vehicles in Ohio and had instead decided to assemble them in Mexico. Ford declined to comment.
Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions, said Ford planned to launch production of electric crossovers at the Mexico plant in June 2023 under both the Ford and Lincoln brands.

UAW President Rory Gamble said in a Detroit News essay last month that new subsidies and tax breaks for electric vehicles must come with ""a commitment to locate any new jobs that are part of this transition in the United States in exchange for any tax dollar investment.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The recent trading frenzy around  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and other so-called ""meme"" stocks highlights shortcomings and challenges in the U.S. markets as retail investors become a bigger presence, exchange leaders said on Tuesday.
""The regulatory structure of the U.S. equity markets, in my mind, is flawed,"" Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc, said on a panel at the Future Industry Association's virtual FIA Boca conference.
Regulators have focused on competition between market intermediaries, like brokers and exchanges, rather than between buyers and sellers seeking to get the best prices, and the GameStop event exposed issues with that structure, he said.
In January, retail investors coordinated through social media forums in an attempt to punish hedge funds by buying shares of GameStop and other heavily shorted names, driving up their prices and forcing short sellers to close out positions at big losses.
At the height of the trading mania, several retail brokers restricted the buying of GameStop after collateral requirements needed to clear the trades spiked, angering many traders. 
The saga has sparked congressional hearings, regulatory probes and put short selling under scrutiny.
""I'm hoping that in the future regulators will roll back some of the punitive rules and allow the market itself to deal with the intermediary structure,"" Sprecher said.
The challenge now is to determine what constitutes unacceptable trading behavior as retail traders coordinate online, said Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY) CEO Loh Boon Chye.
Market manipulation, when it comes to retail investors' online activity, has not been defined, which is ""concerning,"" said CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) CEO Terry Duffy. 
He pointed to the legalization of gambling and marijuana in most U.S. states as examples of regulators taking a more hands-off approach.

""People want to be in charge of their own destiny,"" he said.

Investing.com – The Dow snapped a five-day winning streak Tuesday on weakness in cyclical stocks, while tech gave up some gains after U.S. bond yields bounced off lows as investors fretted over the Federal Reserve's decision due Wednesday.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.39%, or 127 points, the S&P 500 was down 0.2% after hitting a record intraday high of 3,981.30 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1%, though had climbed by more than 1% intraday.
Energy and industrials led the broader market lower, with the latter coming under pressure from a 3% decline in Boeing (NYSE:BA) and a pause in airlines stocks following rally a day earlier.  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) ended the day in the red. 
Optimism on airlines, however, has picked up in recent weeks on signs of a recovery in air travel demand.
The sea of red across cyclicals were partly offset by strength in tech stocks aided by second-straight day of gains for chip stocks. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was among the chip stocks to end the day in the red after the chipmaker unveiled its full range of 11th-generation desktop processors, set to debut at March-end.
Big tech cut some gains, meanwhile, after U.S. bond yields turned positive and served as remainder of the squeeze on long-duration growth stocks seen earlier this month.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) were off the day's highs, but still in the green as the U.S. United States 10-Year yield rising above 1.6%.
With a day to go until the Federal Reserve reveals its monetary policy and Chairman Jerome Powell makes an appearance, some have called for caution.
The central bank is expected to keep rates unchanged and its $120 billion pace of monthly bond purchases on hold. An update from the Powell, however, has the potential to trigger a move in bond yields that would likely move stocks.
""[W]e do expect the rate move to continue in the very near term. The Fed as ever remains a key wildcard,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said. ""So we do think folks need to watch the price action quite closely here going into [this week's] Fed meeting.""
Others, however, are not waiting around for the update from the Fed amid bets the central bank will have no option but to step up bond buying as the pace of inflation is set to accelerate. 
""I have a hunch that what was known as Operation Twist in the late 40s after World War Two and the Fed trying to keep interest rates down by buying 10s and longer bonds that Operation twist may be in our future where the Fed is limited to about $1 trillion in outright spending, and would begin to spend more on 10s, 20s and 30's to keep long interest rates down,"" former PIMCO Chief Executive Bill Gross said. Gross has been bearish on Treasuries for years. In a tweet on Jan. 9, 2018, he said: ""bond bear market confirmed today.""
The note of caution has been echoed by the latest Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) survey showing that fund managers are more worried about the Fed tightening policy too early, a so-called taper tantrum, and a spike in inflation than the Covid-19 pandemic.
On the economic front, meanwhile, the consumer was in the spotlight as retail sales fell by more than expected. Economists, however, shrugged off the weaker headline number, blaming it on weather-related events as a cold snap wrecked havoc across the U.S.
""The February weakness was weather-related and will likely prove temporary. Based on card spending data, the dip was concentrated in the third week of the month which coincided with the winter storms that caused extended power outages in Texas,"" Jefferies said in a note.

Investing.com -- Stocks were muted in advance of the Federal Reserve’s rate decision on Wednesday, even though most people expect no changes in central bank policy.
At the same time, the $1.9 trillion in federal stimulus hits starting on Wednesday, and the households and individuals getting a piece of that pie are bound to spend some of it in stores and restaurants as economies across the U.S. reopen.
As President Joe Biden takes to the road to sell his stimulus plan to American voters, vaccines continue to roll out and states lower requirements so more people are eligible. 
March Madness will be a welcome distraction starting Thursday evening, when the first four games in the U.S. college basketball tournament get underway. Get your brackets in early.
Wednesday is also a day to celebrate Irish heritage, though parades and large bar parties are still not allowed in a lot of places because of Covid restrictions. Grab a pint of  Diageo  (LON:DGE) PLC ADR (NYSE:DEO)’s Guinness anyway.  
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. All eyes on the FOMC decision
Some have called for caution awaiting the Fed’s monetary policy for the current meeting. Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to make an appearance after the FOMC statement is released at 2:00 PM ET (1700 GMT).
The central bank is expected to keep rates unchanged and its $120 billion pace of monthly bond purchases on hold. An update from Powell, however, has the potential to trigger a move in bond yields, which would also move stocks. Eyes on the tech sector, which has been sensitive to recent yield hikes in government bonds.
2. Retail and bank stocks
Retail sales fell 3% in the latest reading, but that doesn’t mean the outlook for retailers is bad. Many expect a bump from the $1,400 stimulus checks hitting individual bank accounts starting Wednesday. It could be a boon for discount retailers, especially, including Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT),  Kohls Corp  (NYSE:KSS) and  Target  Corporation (NYSE:TGT). 
Big banks, which Bloomberg reports are prepared to release the federal stimulus funds to accounts on Wednesday, could also benefit. Extra credit card spending could reap them more revenue, as could extra home and car loan activity.  
3. Investors await data on oil stockpiles
The latest weekly crude inventory report from the petroleum industry is due out after the market close today, and people are certainly watching for the release of the government’s own crude inventory numbers at 10:30 AM ET on Wednesday.
Crude prices fell another day after Bloomberg reported that a torrent of Iranian oil had been gushing into China in recent weeks, crowding out imports from other nations and complicating efforts by the OPEC+ alliance to tighten supply in the global market.
OPEC members have been holding back production. That, combined with optimism over the recovery, has pushed oil higher in an uninterrupted rally since October.

Investing.com - Unlike some investors, former Pimco Chief Executive Bill Gross is not waiting around for clues from the Federal Reserve or its Chairman Jerome Powell for his next big trade as the former bond king said he is betting that rates will increase and the Fed will be forced to step up bond buying to keep rates under control. 
Gross reportedly said he is short United States 10-Year and United States 30-Year Treasuries, betting the Federal Reserve will be forced to step and buy bonds, pushing prices up and yields down, as inflation is on the road to 3% to 4%.
""I have a hunch that what was known as Operation Twist in the late 40s after World War Two and the Fed trying to keep interest rates down by buying 10s and longer bonds that Operation twist may be in our future where the Fed is limited to about $1 trillion in outright spending, and would begin to spend more on 10s, 20s and 30's to keep long interest rates down,"" Gross said in a Bloomberg interview.
He also speculated that the Fed may have already initiated operation twist - a monetary policy tool previously used by the Fed in the past to lower long-term interest rates by buying and selling U.S. Treasuries of different maturities - following the recent spike in bond yields during the last weeks.
Gross has been bearish on Treasuries prices, which trade inversely to yields, for years. In a tweet on Jan. 9, 2018, he said: ""bond bear market confirmed today.""
But the man who reigned over the bond market for over four decades when rates interest rates were ranging at 15% to 20% continues to cast his eye over the Reddit-linked trading action that has captivated global attention. Gross, seemingly unfazed by the angst directed at short-sellers like Melvin Capital, said he is still short  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) after revealing last month that he made about $10 million on the bearish bet.
""[R]ight now the borrowing rate on shorting shares for Gamestop is only one and a half percent which indicates no real squeeze or no pressure and so with volatility of 400% annualised you need see a doubling of the price in order to lose money. I think it is a perfect opportunity for option sellers not buyers,"" Gross said.
Gross initially took up the position after seeing the stock double overnight following Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's tweet of ""Gamestonk!!"" on Jan. 26.   ""Why would the market double overnight when Musk does “Gamestonk!!”? What does it mean? Half of this I’m oblivious to. It’s almost like I’m an idiot, but I didn’t think that was right. Musk is a little devil,"" Gross said in an interview with Citywire last month."

(Reuters) - Wall Street dipped on Tuesday, pulled lower by energy stocks and threatening to put an end to a recent rally, while investors awaited the result of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting.
The Nasdaq turned negative in afternoon trading after earlier touching a two-week high. 
The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at record highs in the prior session as optimism about a $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package and ongoing vaccination drives bolstered views that the economy was on a path to recovery.
However, stimulus and improving economic data have recently stoked inflation worries, pushing up yields and upending equity markets in February.
Wall Street's fear gauge hit a five-week low at 19.68 points as yields on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury slipped for the second straight session to 1.59% from a 13-month high hit last week.
Fears about an overheating economy and a jump-forward in interest rate expectations have increased scrutiny on the Fed meeting, where policymakers are likely to raise economic forecasts and repeat their pledge to remain accommodative for the foreseeable future.
Investors have slightly increased their cash allocation, deeming that inflation and 'taper tantrums' could topple the record rally in financial markets, BofA's March fund manager survey showed on Tuesday.
""This Fed meeting is one of the most important ones for the market in a long time. It is the first we have had after the recent inflation rate rise and concerns about inflation,"" said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta.
Data showed retail sales dropped more than expected in February due to bitterly cold weather across the country. Another report indicated winter storms in Texas led to a plunge in U.S. factory output last month.
At midafternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.45% at 32,805.03 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.28% to 3,957.79.
The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.18% to 13,435.18.
Energy stocks slumped 2.4% after a drop in oil prices while financials retreated about 1%. Technology and communication services jumped about 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.
The Russell growth index was marginally higher versus the Russell value index's 0.7% fall, in a slight reversal of a recent trend away from technology and other high-growth stocks.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co dropped over 4% after announcing a $2 billion convertible debt deal.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.87-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.65-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 72 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 214 new highs and 13 new lows.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" slipped to a fresh COVID-19 pandemic low on Tuesday, as U.S. stocks soared to new highs on expectations that fiscal stimulus and signs of progress in a countrywide vaccination drive will spur a broader economic rebound. 
The VIX was recently down 0.54 points at 19.49, its lowest since Feb. 21, 2020, days before the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic. 
A pandemic-fueled tumble that shaved about a third of the value off the S&P 500 last March pushed the VIX index to a near-record high of 85.47, a level it only topped during the global financial crisis. 
The index has retreated since then, as the S&P 500 rallied 80% from its March lows to hit a fresh high on Tuesday, led by technology stocks. 
Investor appear to have become more optimistic over the pandemic’s trajectory in recent weeks, as a vaccine rollout in the U.S. expands. The United States has administered 110,737,856 doses of COVID-19 vaccines and distributed 142,918,525 doses in the country as of Tuesday morning, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Fund managers in a monthly survey from BofA Global for the first time in a year did not name COVID-19 as the market’s top “tail risk,” citing inflation instead. 
Still, the VIX remains above the 15.4 average seen for 2019.
And volatility futures expiring further out in time still remain relatively elevated, a sign that some investors continue to maintain a cautious stance. 

""The coronavirus volatility spike is still lingering in investor’s memories,"" Susquehanna International Group’s Chris Murphy said in a note. ""Although near term volatility has decreased, the scars from Covid likely leave investors hesitant to bring down medium and longer term volatility. We saw something very similar after the great financial crisis,"" Murphy said.

San Francisco-based Indaba five weeks ago called on Charleston, South Carolina-based Benefitfocus to sell itself following years of poor returns. On Tuesday, it increased the pressure by nominating two men with technology and software expertise to the company's board. Shareholders will vote on whether to add them to the board.
The company in turn seated a woman with human resources experience on the board. 
Indaba, which owns a roughly 9.5% stake in Benefitfocus, has criticized the company's sluggish stock price during booming markets and warned that shareholders will lose confidence if nothing changes. The stock price fell by 1% in early trading to $14.95 a share on the Nasdaq. 
In a letter to shareholders, Indaba wrote, ""We believe the current Board has fostered an anti-shareholder culture that has been defined by excessive related party transactions, insufficient boardroom diversity and independence, and unjustifiable corporate waste.""
Benefitfocus, valued at $490 million, took steps to overhaul corporate governance earlier this year by naming a new director and promising to appoint an independent chairman at the annual meeting. Indaba contends these steps fall short of what investors deserve.
The hedge fund objected to these specific moves, although it had asked for new, diverse, independent board members and for the company to unwind financial transactions with an entity controlled by a current director.
Indaba nominated Ronald Mitchell, managing partner of Low Post Ventures, and Nicholas Pianim, a managing director at venture capital firm DAG Ventures, as directors. Each man is African American. The company seated Coretha Rushing, who previously worked for Equifax (NYSE:EFX) and the Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co and is also Black.
In addition to being one of the company's largest stock owners, Indaba holds approximately 22.9% of Benefitfocus’ outstanding issue of 1.25% convertible senior notes.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian authorities launched raids and issued multiple arrest warrants as part of a probe to crack down on coffee industry companies accused of evading taxes, according to prosecutors in the state of Minas Gerais on Tuesday.
Coffee cooperatives, wholesalers, coffee brokers and roasters in four Brazilian states took part in the scam, the Minas Gerais prosecutors office said in a statement, adding that their actions avoided tax collection in a total value of 1 billion reais ($178.75 million).
The investigation spans 39 cities in the states of Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, Sao Paulo and Parana, the statement said.
Minas Gerais is Brazil's No. 1 coffee producer, while Espirito Santo state leads in the production of the robusta variety widely used by the instant coffee industry.
Tiago Vicentini de Oliveira, a police officer coordinating the task force that investigated the scheme, said in a press conference on Tuesday that roasters in Parana benefited from buying coffee in Minas and Espirito Santo using shell companies based in Sao Paulo to avoid payment of certain state taxes.
The Brazilian tax system is complex, particularly regarding the ICMS state tax whose rate varies from state to state. 
The authorities did not name the companies being investigated.
Brazilian authorities were serving 35 arrest warrants in connection with the probe, which also involves freezing assets of the suspected parties, the prosecutors said.

A German court earlier on Tuesday opened insolvency proceedings for Greensill Bank, owned by Britain's Greensill Capital. The obscure Bremen, Germany-based lender was locked down by German financial regulator BaFin this month with a warning that there was an imminent risk that its debt would become unmanageable. The regulator also questioned some of the bank's financial accounts.
That left a number of German towns that had deposits with Bremen-based Greensill Bank fearful they would lose the funds. The municipal holdings of institutional investors are excluded from a deposit guarantee scheme that protects individuals.
Monheim am Rhein, which is one of the hardest hit communities, announced the initiative it has been coordinating.
""The representatives of towns agreed on Monday on a coordinated legal approach and are preparing a joint representation of their interests,"" Monheim said in a statement.
German towns have turned to alternative investments such as those offered by Greensill Bank as European Central Bank efforts to prop up the wider economy have resulted in so-called negative interest rates, with fees charged for savings.
Many of the towns said they opted for Greensill to avoid those fees and were encouraged by its once healthy credit rating.
The insolvency manager for Greensill Bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The insolvency manager for Greensill Capital declined to comment.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The United States should respond by Friday to Mexico's request to share doses of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine it has in stock, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Tuesday.
Reuters reported this week that Mexico had asked for doses of the British-developed vaccine, since it has yet to be approved for use in the United States.
""I'd say we've made good progress, but the details, figures, provisions, won't be known until Friday. We requested as many (AstraZeneca doses) as possible and we will have the answer on Friday,"" said Ebrard.
Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador asked U.S. President Joe Biden for a vaccine ""loan"" during a virtual meeting on March 1, after Mexico's vaccine strategy was knocked off course by a delay in deliveries of the vaccine developed by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX).
""We are hoping for the help, support and solidarity of the U.S. government. I can confirm that in a month and a half, before the end of April, we will have (vaccinated) all the adults over 60 years of age,"" Lopez Obrador said at a regular news conference on Tuesday.
The delays in deliveries have set back Mexico's vaccination plans by at least a month. Previously, Lopez Obrador had said all senior citizens would be vaccinated by the end of March.
""The president has been clear that our priority is vaccinating the American people and that if we have surplus vaccines from that effort we will look for ways to share them,"" a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said when asked about Ebrard's comments.
The official did not directly address the question of whether the U.S. government would respond by Friday, as Ebrard said.

Mexico will also sign a contract on Tuesday with China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd to purchase 20 million COVID-19 vaccine doses, Ebrard said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust enforcers have teamed up with their U.S. and British counterparts to share expertise on how to examine mergers in the pharmaceutical industry amid concerns such deals could push up prices or hold back innovation.
The COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine supply bottlenecks have spurred regulatory interest in the pharmaceutical industry which has seen a wave of consolidation in recent years. 
The European Commission said the working group, which was launched on Tuesday, included the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Canadian Competition Bureau, Britain's Competition and Markets Authority and the U.S. Department of Justice.
The group would ""take stock of the lessons learned in recent years and explore new ways to foster vibrant competition to the benefit of citizens"", European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
The EU competition enforcer said greater scrutiny of pharmaceutical deals was needed to single out those that might lead to higher drug prices, lower innovation or anti-competitive conduct.
""Given the high volume of pharmaceutical mergers in recent years, amid skyrocketing drug prices and ongoing concerns about anti-competitive conduct in the industry, it is imperative that we rethink our approach toward pharmaceutical merger review,"" FTC Acting Chair Rebecca Slaughter said in a statement.

High and rising U.S. prescription drug prices, even for older medicines like insulin and epinephrine, have been a focus of concern for both U.S. political parties. Both former President Donald Trump, in his 2016 campaign, and President Joe Biden, in his 2020 campaign, pledged to reduce drug costs.

Investing.com -- Ford dropped after reaffirming that the global semiconductor shortage could hurt earnings by as much as $2.5 billion.
Ford confirmed its guidance announced last month, reiterating that a lack of chips could hurt adjusted earnings before interest and taxes by between $1 billion and $2.5 billion, net of reasonable cost recoveries and some production make-up in the second half of the year.
Shares are down almost 4%, though still trading close to the highest in about five years. 
The company reported adjusted EBIT of $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 and is set to earn $8 billion to $9 billion in adjusted EBIT next year, generating $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow. The scenario anticipates continued earnings improvement in each of Ford’s regional businesses, except South America, where it recently abandoned Brazil. Last month, the company said the global semiconductor shortage is creating uncertainty across multiple industries and will influence Ford’s 2021 operating results. 
“The semiconductor situation is changing constantly, so it’s premature to try to size what availability will mean for our full-year performance,” Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said in a statement at the time. “Right now, estimates from suppliers could suggest losing 10% to 20% of our planned first-quarter production.” 
“Our team is working with suppliers around the clock to optimize the constrained supply and minimize profit impact, while prioritizing customer orders, new-vehicle launches and compliance with CO2 emissions regulations,” said Lawler. Ford plans to provide an update on the semiconductor issue when it reports first-quarter 2021 financial results on April 28.

Analyst Peter Saleh raised his view from a neutral rating. He called a price target of $130 on the stock, according to Seeking Alpha. They are currently trading at a 52-week high around $112.
BTIG expects the coffee chain to benefit from the faster-than-anticipated pace of restaurant reopenings, coupled with massive federal stimulus. It expects these to lead to upward earnings revisions for Starbucks.
In January, Starbucks guided for a global comparable store sales growth of 18% to 23%. BTIG called it “conservative.”

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian companies, back on global investors' radar since late last year, are set for an IPO boom in 2021 with initial public offerings expected to raise at least $10 billion, the highest in more than a decade, says UBS.
Russian gold miner GV Gold on Monday became the latest Russian company to announce plans for an IPO, following e-commerce firm Ozon's Nasdaq listing in November and retailer Fix Price's offering in London earlier this month.
""This year could be best for equity raisings from Russia since 2007 given the global liquidity boost and the fact that Russia was overlooked and underinvested in the recent past,"" Fedor Tregubenko, UBS Group country head in Russia, told Reuters.
Last year, Russian companies raised less than $2 billion in IPOs as investor sentiment was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and the risk of possible new Western sanctions on Russia following the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
With the global economy set to pick up this year and U.S. President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion fiscal package adding to already vast central bank and government stimulus around the world, equity markets are expected to see inflows.
On a price-to-earnings ratio, Russian stocks' discount to their emerging and developed market peers has widened this year from 2020 levels, returning to the historical average of around 50%, according to Gazprombank.
Valuations are especially attractive given that some companies are offering high dividend yields combined with above average growth rates, Tregubenko, whose bank is among regular arrangers for Russian IPOs, said.
""We expect to see at least $10 billion in IPO volumes from Russia this year in a wide variety of sectors ranging from retail to mining and the financial sector to IT,"" he said.
Fix Price alone raised $2 billion in its IPO and GV Gold, which counts UBS as one of its IPO arrangers, targets another $500 million, banking sources have said.
Forestry group Segezha, gold producer Nordgold and Svetofor which operates driving schools and online driving theory courses, are also considering IPOs, according to sources and media reports.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Tuesday, as a weaker-than-expected retail sales report for February cooled the enthusiasm toward beaten-down cyclical stocks, leaving the tech sector to outperform.
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 42 points or 0.1%, while the S&P 500 was up 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7%.
Earlier, the Commerce Department said U.S. retail sales had fallen 3.0% in February from January, while core retail sales had fallen 2.7%. Both numbers were well below expectations of a more modest drop, but were affected by the prolonged cold snap across much of the country.
Additionally,industrial production fell 2.2% from January, affected by similar factors.
The numbers came ahead of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting which begins later Tuesday, but the distortion from the extreme weather reduced the chance of their having any meaningful impact on the thinking of the Fed’s policy-making committee. Analysts expect the Fed to leave its bond purchases and interest rates unchanged, but will be alive to any change in guidance as to when the extraordinary level of monetary stimulus will be withdrawn.
Another important question to be decided at the Fed meeting will be whether or not to extend an exemption from capital rules to the banking sector that is due to expire at the end of the month. If the Fed decides to reintroduce the Supplementary Leverage Ratio as a binding constraint on banks, it could not only affect their freedom to make payouts to shareholders, but also their ability to absorb the vast amounts of bonds being sold by the Treasury to finance the $1.9 trillion stimulus plan.
The 10-year Treasury yield, a proxy for long-run inflation expectations, dipped below 1.60% in early trade in New York as the market settled down to await the meeting’s results.
On a generally quiet day for corporate news flow, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) stock fell 2.7% after it forecast a hit of up to $2.5 billion from the semiconductor shortage affecting the global car industry, while Volkswagen (OTC:VWAPY) ADRs rose 5.8% to a six-year high after the company raised its target for profitability and for electric vehicle sales. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock rose 2.0% after it ended a dispute over content in Australia by agreeing to pay Rupert Murdoch's News Corp  (NASDAQ:NWSA) in the future for the news it carries.
Despite a couple of days of tech underperformance, Bank of America’s weekly fund manager survey still named tech as the most crowded trade in town, along with bitcoin and ESG-themed investments.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial regulator has started a criminal action against NatWest over allegations it failed to detect suspicious activity by a customer depositing nearly 400 million pounds ($553 million) over five years, mostly in cash.
The action is the first such case against a British bank under a 2007 money laundering law. If convicted, the bank faces a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it was bringing the proceedings after NatWest's systems failed to adequately monitor and scrutinise activity over an account held by a British customer between November 2011 and October 2016. 
Around 365 million pounds was paid into the unnamed customer's accounts, of which around 264 million pounds was in cash, the watchdog alleged.
NatWest had previously disclosed in its 2020 annual report an FCA investigation in relation to ""certain money services businesses and related parties"".
The business was Fowler Oldfield, a Bradford-based gold dealer and jeweller liquidated after a police raid in 2016, a source familiar with the matter said. Bloomberg first reported the identity of the customer.
In the last statement by liquidators for Fowler Oldfield, dated December 2020 and filed at Companies House, they said NatWest was the secured creditor and that the police held the company's seized assets.
Telephone numbers listed for Fowler Oldfield did not work.
NatWest will appear in court on April 14, the FCA said.
The watchdog was keeping the possibility of charging individuals under review, a source said. 
The bank said on Tuesday it took the matter ""extremely seriously"" and was cooperating with the investigation, adding it had made multi-year investment in its financial crime systems and controls.
'SHOCKWAVES'
The case threatens NatWest with further costs for past misdeeds at a time when it has been trying to clean up its image under CEO Alison Rose, who took over in 2019.
The bank - which remains 62% state-owned after a bailout in the 2007-09 financial crisis - rebranded from the scandal-tainted Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS_old_old) name last year.
""In terms of enforcement, initiating a criminal prosecution against a leading bank is like pressing the nuclear button,"" commented Jonathan Fisher QC, Barrister at Bright Line Law. 
""In terms of reputation it is potentially very damaging, and given that anti-money laundering procedures have been around for a long time, if NatWest has fallen short, it leaves the bank with a lot of explaining to do."" 
Claire Cross, a partner at law firm Corker Binning, said the FCA's move would send ""shockwaves"" across the finance industry. ""It also sets an important precedent - no-one is too big to escape the FCA’s criminal net,"" she added.
The company's shares fell 3% in early trading and were last down around 1%, compared to a 1% gain for the FTSE 350 banks index.

948,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 16, 2021 09:09AM ET</span>",Wall Street Steps Up Crypto ETF Push With SEC Verdict Unknowable,"(Bloomberg) -- Issuers across the $5.9 trillion U.S. ETF industry are racing to win approval for the first Bitcoin fund, with one big hurdle standing before them: A regulator whose position right now is anyone’s guess.
At least four firms now have live applications for an exchange-traded fund tracking the largest cryptocurrency, with WisdomTree Investments (NASDAQ:WETF) joining their ranks late last week. VanEck Associates Corp., NYDIG Asset Management and Valkyrie Digital Assets were the names already in the running.
Their odds of approval are a complete unknown. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected all previous filings, but since then two Bitcoin ETFs launched in Canada, institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies has snowballed and -- perhaps most importantly -- the regulator’s leadership has changed.
Gary Gensler, the nominee to be next SEC chairman, is known for having a more open stance toward cryptocurrencies. That means hopes are riding high, and applications are piling up even before he’s in place and despite the regulator being unlikely to make big policy changes in his absence.
“These funds are getting their ducks in a row,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for CFRA Research. “They’re getting their paperwork filed, so if or when the SEC does OK a Bitcoin ETF, these asset managers will be ready.”
Despite the shifting landscape, the early applications still look ambitious. U.S. regulators have raised concerns about Bitcoin’s infamous volatility and how that could whipsaw unsuspecting retail investors. There remain worries about manipulation and criminal activity, with the likes of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen pointing to the threat of terrorist financing.
One particular issue involves last-minute rules proposed by the outgoing Trump administration that would create new requirements for financial services firms to record the identities of cryptocurrency holders. These could have far-reaching consequences for an industry that prizes anonymity, and it remains unclear how the Biden administration will deal with them.
Read more: Bitcoin Storm Brewing Over Trump’s Anti-Money Laundering Push
Issuers are pushing on regardless because of the stakes involved, with a potential bonanza on offer for the first to get an ETF over the line.
The Purpose Bitcoin ETF (TSX:BTCCb) in Canada, the first of its kind in North America, saw more than $165 million worth of shares change hands at its launch. One day later, just $14.6 million of shares traded in Evolve Fund Group’s Bitcoin ETF (TSX:EBIT) in its debut.
“The difference between being first and second in this two-ETF race hasn’t been so much gold versus silver as gold versus a participation trophy,” said Ben Johnson, Morningstar Inc.’s global director of ETF research.
‘Optimism Abounds’
With Gensler not due to take his position until later in the year, plenty in the industry still think approval is a long way off.
Yet in the past two years the SEC has shown its willingness to work with crypto companies “through guidance, requests for comment, statements and engagement through its innovation arm Finhub,” according to Jackson Mueller, director of policy and government relations at Securrency, a developer of Blockchain-based financial and regulatory technology.
The SEC didn’t respond to a request for comment from Bloomberg News.
Why a U.S. Bitcoin ETF Could Be a Real Thing in 2021: QuickTake
In addition to the four pending applications for a crypto ETF, there are other filings that appear to be seeking to sidestep SEC reticence by combining Bitcoin with other assets.
For example, Simplify Asset Management is working to launch an “equity plus Bitcoin” ETF that will invest up to 15% of its assets in cryptocurrencies indirectly through the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Bitwise Asset Management filed for a fund filled with companies considered to be crypto innovators.
“With Canada recently approving Bitcoin ETFs and Gary Gensler poised to serve as SEC Chairman, optimism abounds,” said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, an advisory firm. “Every issuer with any hope of having a meaningful Bitcoin ETF presence should be throwing their hat in the ring at this point.”
One of those is arguably Grayscale Investments, the firm behind GBTC. That’s an investment trust as opposed to an ETF, meaning there are different rules around share creation and trading.
Nonetheless, it’s been a smash hit, ballooning in size to more than $37 billion, up from only $1.9 billion a year ago. Now Grayscale is recruiting an entire ETF team, apparently in anticipation that the first American exchange-traded crypto products will eventually be approved.
Bitcoin’s price has skyrocketed around 10-fold in the past 12 months. The digital asset climbed above $60,000 for the first time this weekend before dropping to below $56,000 by Tuesday morning in New York.
With so much potential cash involved, the SEC should consider approving multiple filings at once to “avoid giving any issuer a significant first-mover advantage,” James Seyffart, ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a recent note.
If that happens, the funds currently trying their luck with applications could be richly rewarded.
“All of these firms want to be at the starting line with their feet on the blocks if and when the SEC pulls the trigger,” said Johnson at Morningstar.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Global health experts came under increasing pressure on Tuesday to clear up questions over the safety of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 shot, as Sweden and Latvia joined countries suspending their use in a further blow to Europe's vaccination rollout.
So far, a handful of cases of bleeding, blood clots and low platelet counts have arisen, compared with 45 million doses of various vaccines given in the European Union and its near neighbours. Germany has reported seven such cases, of which three died, out of 1.6 million people who received AstraZeneca.
A World Health Organization (WHO) committee of experts was reviewing the cases and was in dialogue with the European Medicines Agency (EMA), an EU regulator, which was due to hold a news conference at 1300 GMT.
The EU's largest members - Germany, France and Italy - suspended use of AstraZeneca's vaccine on Monday pending the outcome of investigations into unusual cases of a rare cerebral thrombosis in people who had received it.
The addition of Sweden and Latvia on Tuesday brought to more than a dozen the number of EU countries to act since reports first emerged of thromboembolisms affecting people after they got the AstraZeneca shot.
The WHO and EMA had earlier joined AstraZeneca in saying there is no proven link, but some experts said rare cases of highly unusual cerebral thrombosis in younger people did appear to indicate a causal connection to the AstraZeneca shot.
""The benefits of vaccination significantly outweigh the risks, especially for the elderly,"" said Karl Lauterbach, health spokesman for Germany's Social Democratic Party.
""But it could be the case that the risks of the vaccine are higher for certain patient groups such as young women. It is possible that the EMA will issue specific warnings,"" he told Deutschlandfunk radio in an interview.
European epidemiologists remained baffled that similar cases had not occurred in unusual numbers in Britain, which began using AstraZeneca earlier and has administered more than 10 million doses.
""It still remains the case that a very likely explanation of at least some of the clotting disorders seen are a result of Covid-19 rather than the vaccine,"" said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
""There are published papers that make clear that these problems definitely occur in COVID-19 and there is no doubt that all the vaccines in use prevent that disease. Hence the risk and benefit balance for the AstraZeneca vaccine remains clearly in favour of its benefits.""
Graphics: Vaccine rollout across EU by brand - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjpqlwaqvx/vaccine%20rollout.PNG
POLITICAL DECISION?
In the EU's largest states, including Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, AstraZeneca has accounted for about 13-15% of shots given since the rollout started almost three months ago, with Pfizer-BioNTech making up the majority, according to official data.
Nicola Magrini, the director general of Italy's medicines authority AIFA, told daily la Repubblica in an interview that the choice to suspend the AstraZeneca shot was ""political"".
He said it was safe and said its benefit to risk ratio was ""widely positive"". There have been eight deaths and four cases of serious side-effects in Italy following vaccinations, he added.
In France, Health Minister Olivier Veran told reporters the risk-reward ratio for the AstraZeneca vaccine remained positive.
Governments say they acted out of an abundance of caution but the move deprives them of vitally-needed doses to step up vaccination campaigns that have got off to a slow start due to scarce supply.
AstraZeneca said last week it would try to deliver 30 million doses to the European Union by the end of March, down from a contractual obligation of 90 million and a previous pledge made last month to deliver 40 million doses.
Still, the European Commission said on Tuesday it expects to receive more than 200 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech in the second quarter, putting the EU on course to meet its inoculation target. 
The EU aims to vaccinate at least 255 million people, or 70% of its adult population, by the end of the summer. The bloc has administered 11 shots so far for every 100 residents, while Israel - a world leader in vaccination - has given 108 doses, according to Our World in Data.
At the same time a third wave of infection, driven by more infectious viral variants, threatens to worsen Europe's year-old coronavirus pandemic that has claimed 575,000 lives and further delay recovery from a pandemic economic slump.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) on Tuesday slashed 2021 economic growth forecasts for the euro area by a whole percentage point, citing spillover of the ongoing pandemic-linked activity restrictions.
Sources said Germany had no choice but to act after its vaccine watchdog identified an unusual number of cases of rare cerebral vein thrombosis. Of 1.6 million people in Germany who had got AstraZeneca, seven fell ill and three died.
Yet the risk of dying of COVID is still orders of magnitude greater, especially among those most vulnerable such as the elderly, said Dirk Brockmann, an epidemiologist at the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases.

""One is probably 100,000 times more likely to die of COVID than because of an AstraZeneca vaccine,"" Brockmann told ARD public television.

951,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2021 09:00AM ET</span>","Ad man Sorrell eyes roaring recovery, and maybe a major deal","By Kate Holton and Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - Martin Sorrell, the world's most famous advertising executive, expects global economies to roar back to life as they recover from the pandemic over the next two years, but is worried about what comes after that.
    ""The drum beat in our daily meetings is getting louder and louder and louder, things are flying,"" he told Reuters, adding that tech and healthcare were leading the charge.
    The 76-year-old, who has spent almost half a century making acquisitions - first at Saatchi & Saatchi and then as he built WPP (LON:WPP), is eyeing more deals for his S4 Capital, including a possible transformational one further down the line. 
The almost three-year-old company counts Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and another undisclosed global tech firm as clients and is purely focused on digital advertising, which has continued to grow through the pandemic and now accounts for more than half of ad spend.
""I think we're a royalty on the growth of digital transformation,"" Sorrell said, on the potential for the firm to be at the heart of the shift. ""We will be at the north end of the market's estimates of 15 to 20% like-for-like growth during COVID,"" he said, of S4's 2020 gross profit performance. 
    He said he was ""extremely bullish"" about 2021 and 2022, but longer term is worried about soaring government debt.
    ""The consumer has been saving like crazy, and I think companies have been saving like crazy and I think they're going to open the spigots in Q2,"" he said.
    ""It'll be great for '21 and '22, but then how do we figure out who's going to pay for this?""
GROWTH
    Sorrell, who built WPP into the world's largest ad company by acquiring the likes of Y&R, JWT and Ogilvy, launched S4 shortly after he left the British group in 2018 over a complaint about personal misconduct. He had always denied any wrongdoing. 
    It is already worth $3.5 billion after its shares rose over 200% in the last year, when many ad groups faltered.
    Able to analyse data quickly to place targeted ads online, S4 succeeds because it is not held back by legacy agencies designed for an era of TV and traditional campaigns, Sorrell said.
    The company he wants to rival is Accenture (NYSE:ACN), the consultancy using its expertise in data to muscle into marketing. 
    Sorrell suggested the ideal destination for S4 would be to find a bigger company it could inject itself into and run. The most suitable, he says, would be New York-listed Globant, a digital transformation group that WPP held a stake in. 
""Globant comes at the digital transformation process from the IT and tech end and we come at it from the marketing end,"" he said. ""If you put S4 together with Globant you have the perfect competitor, in my view, to Accenture.""
Globant did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment outside of normal U.S. business hours.
    In the meantime, Sorrell expects to announce another smaller acquisition on the content side soon. 
    While his appetite for deals is undiminished, the pandemic had forced Sorrell to re-examine the value of constant globe-trotting. He said he won't be travelling as frequently in future, but the trips will be longer.
    ""Businesses have been better run during COVID because we haven't been able to travel,"" he said. ""Management has been given more room to manoeuvre. 

    ""The stranglehold of the centre has not been as great.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - France has supported its virus-hit companies to the tune of 155.36 billion euros ($185.5 billion), just over a quarter of the 544 billion euros spent by EU countries to prop up businesses, with Germany in third place, European Commission data showed.
The EU approved 2.96 trillion euros in aid sought by governments to help farmers, the travel and tourism industry as well as companies in different sectors. But just 544 billion euros has been paid out, equivalent to 3.9% of the EU's gross domestic product, the EU figures showed.
The data covered the period from mid-March to end 2020 and referred to state aid given out in direct grants, loans and guarantees and other instruments.
Germany's approved aid amounted to 53% of the total 2.96 trillion, which prompted concerns among some EU countries that Europe's largest economy may be giving its businesses an unfair advantage.
Italy, one of the hardest hit by the pandemic, disbursed 107.9 billion euros or 19.8% of the total aid paid out, putting it in second place after France, based on the EU data.
Germany paid out 104.25 billion euros, followed by Spain at 90.8 billion.
When disbursed aid is calculated as a percentage of a country's GDP, Spain comes top at 7.3%, followed by France at 6.4% and Italy at 6.0%.
The EU executive, tasked with ensuring a level playing field in the 27-country bloc, has to date cleared more than 570 national measures.

953,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2021 08:55AM ET</span>",Analysis: Private equity investors fret over record U.S. buyout prices,"By Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) - Private equity firms are paying more for leveraged buyouts to keep pace with soaring valuations of acquisition targets, making some investors leery of whether the industry can keep delivering on promises of lucrative returns.
    The booming stock market and cheap debt financing have helped push leveraged buyout prices to a record high, driven by sectors that have grown as people work and stay at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as technology and business services. 
Private equity firms paid an average 13.2 times a company's annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for U.S. leveraged buyouts in 2020, an all-time high, up from 12.9 times in 2019, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.
Graphic: U.S. leverage buyout multiples - https://graphics.reuters.com/PRIVATE-EQUITY/VALUATIONS/ygdpzgwzjvw/chart.png
    Some investors are growing concerned about whether buyout firms can deliver the 15% to 20% annual returns they target when they raise new funds.
""We can tilt towards better valuations and opportunities,"" said David Holmgren, who oversees $3.5 billion in endowment and pension assets at Connecticut-based hospital system Hartford HealthCare. He said he has been shifting his portfolio away from private equity funds that invest in pricey buyouts to those that specialize in middle-market deals and emerging markets. 
Many banks have grown reluctant to help finance leveraged buyouts at inflated valuations, exacerbating investor concerns about overpaying, investment bankers and private equity executives said. Private equity firms must write bigger equity checks, making it harder to juice returns through use of debt. 
The share of U.S. leveraged buyouts where private equity firms put down more than 50% of the deal price as equity jumped to 41% in 2020 from 25% in 2019, according to Refinitiv. 
""Bigger equity checks are needed for deals where prices are high. For a business with any growth, some buyers are willing to pay astronomical prices,"" said Rob Fullerton, global head of leveraged finance at investment bank Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Financial Group Inc. 
    For example, buyout firms TPG Capital and TA Associates paid the equivalent of 16.5 times the annual earnings of Planview Inc when they acquired the U.S. work management software company in December for $1.6 billion from Thoma Bravo, another private equity firm. Thoma Bravo had paid 6.7 times the annual earnings of Planview when it first acquired it from Insight Venture Partners for $800 million in 2017, according to financial data providers Refinitiv and Pitchbook.
TPG declined to comment, while TA Associates did not respond to a request for comment.
While some private equity firms are willing to place risky bets on fast-growing technology companies that have yet to turn a profit, banks are more reluctant, said Gero Wittemann, partner and co-head of U.S. at Hg, a London-based private equity firm with $30 billion in assets under management.
""These companies inherently are more difficult to leverage,"" Wittemann said.
FUNDRAISING SLOWS DOWN
Buyout firms typically hold onto acquired companies for three to seven years, so it will be awhile before their investment returns reflect the current record deal prices. 
There is evidence some investors are apprehensive. U.S. private equity fundraising dropped to $203.2 billion in 2020 from its record high of $320.5 billion in 2019, according to Pitchbook.
Investors still have faith that private equity firms can deliver strong returns by making companies better, rather than snapping them up on the cheap, said Brian Gildea, head of investments at Hamilton Lane (NASDAQ:HLNE), a major investor in private equity funds. 
""Valuation matters, but it's one of many things that matter in generating returns. Our data shows returns in our asset class don't come from buying assets cheap,"" Gildea said.
Private equity firms are becoming more selective. The total volume of U.S. leveraged buyouts dropped to $84.7 billion in 2020 from $124.3 billion in 2019, according to Refinitiv.
Some buyout firms that do agree to sky-high prices insist that they manage to clinch concessions that protect their downside. These include earnouts that allow them to pay the purchase price in installments contingent on the company's future financial performance, as well as priority in recouping their investment among shareholders.

""General partners have negotiated to ensure that valuations are in line with return expectations and to regulate downside risk,"" said Erik Wong, co-investment partner at Pantheon Ventures, which invests in private equity funds.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is confident that cost cuts will help it raise profit margins in the coming years, the world's second-largest carmaker said on Tuesday, a day after outlining an ambitious electric mobility expansion.
""Our good performance in 2020, a year dominated by crisis, will give us momentum for accelerating our transformation,"" Chief Executive Herbert Diess said in a statement.
Asked about the closely-watched issue of a potential listing of luxury division Porsche AG, Diess said there was no need for immediate action given Porsche's importance to the carmaker's turnaround efforts.
""That's why you need to think very very hard about every single step,"" he said.
Preferred shares in the company rose as much as 6.5% to their highest level since July 13, 2015, giving the carmaker a market valuation of more than 118 billion euros ($141 billion). They are up more than a third year-to-date.
Volkswagen aims to more than double deliveries of electric vehicles to 1 million this year, it said, adding it would also apply a standardised platform model introduced for vehicle production years ago to software, batteries and charging.
Diess' comments come a day after Volkswagen unveiled plans to build half a dozen battery cell plants in Europe and expand infrastructure for charging electric vehicles globally, accelerating efforts to overtake Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Volkswagen confirmed it aimed for an operating margin of 7%-8% by 2025, adding it would likely end 2021 at the upper end of a 5%-6.5% target corridor.
Stellantis, the world's fourth-largest carmaker created through the merger of FCA and Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA in January, is targeting an adjusted operating profit margin of 5.5%-7.5% this year.
This will be achieved by lowering fixed costs by 2 billion euros by 2023 compared with 2020, a decline of 5%, as well as a decline of 7% in materials costs over the same period, Volkswagen said.
To get a better handle on personnel costs Volkswagen on Sunday offered early or partial retirement to older employees in a move sources said could cut up to 4,000 jobs at its plants in Germany.
The group employs about 670,000 staff globally.
""We aim to put the ambitious transformation of the Volkswagen Group on a solid financial basis,"" incoming finance chief Arno Antlitz said.

Amsterdam’s left-wing city council last year issued an outright ban on rentals through Airbnb and other platforms in three areas that make up its central canal ring, in an effort to curb what it described as the nuisance caused by tourists in the old city centre.
But in a case brought on by an association of property owners, a local court last Friday ordered it to lift this ban immediately as it had no legal basis.
In a response, the city said that as of Tuesday residents of the areas could apply for the same permit available to home owners elsewhere in town, giving them the right to rent out their homes for up to 30 nights per year to a group of no more than four at a time.
In its verdict, the court indicated that the city could cap the number of houses available for vacation rentals in any district and could also opt to determine that certain properties were meant for residents only.
The city said it was still studying the verdict to see what action could be taken.
One in 15 dwellings in Amsterdam showed up on online rental platforms such as Airbnb last year, according to the city's calculations.

Investing.com –  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) shares were down nearly 1% in Tuesday’s premarket trading after its UC Browser was taken off Android app stores in China.
The browser continues to be available on Apple’s app store but is no longer available on stores operated by Huawei, Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) and Vivo.
The action by the handset makers follows Monday’s criticism of the company on Chinese state television's annual consumer rights show for including medical ads by unqualified companies.
Following the show, UC issued an apology and said it had begun an investigation and initiated corrective measures, Reuters reported.
In another development that indicates a tougher environment for the likes of Alibaba, Reuters reported today that China's market regulator has tightened scrutiny over the country's booming livestreaming e-commerce platforms, where internet influencers sell goods directly to consumers. There have been concerns about poor quality products and misleading advertising over such influencer-led marketing. 
President Xi Jinping instructed China's top economic committee on Monday to close a raft of regulatory loopholes that have been exploited in the past by the country's tech giants.

Investing.com -- Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) took another big step to narrowing the gaping valuation discount between it and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on Tuesday, after raising its target for electric vehicle sales and for profitability in the current year.
Shares in the world’s second-largest automotive group soared nearly 6% to a new six-year high after the group said it wants to sell 1 million EVs this year. The new sales target for this year, if met, would put the German company comfortably ahead of Tesla by sales: Elon Musk’s company expects to grow sales by more than 50%, implying a baseline sales volume of 750,000. VW was the top performer in a DAX index that rose 0.7% on Tuesday.
VW's preferred shares are now at their highest level since the onset of the Dieselgate crisis in 2015, which wiped tens of billions of euros off the company and which, ultimately, was the catalyst for an electrification drive that is now rapidly gaining momentum. VW plans to invest 46 billion euros ($55 billion) in its electric and hybrid models over the next five years, with a view to having 70% of its European sales electric by 2030 - double its previous target.
VW made its new forecasts as it presented full-year results for 2020 which were largely in line with expectations, propped up by its Porsche unit and by its financial arm. The company expects a vigorous rebound this year. On Tuesday, VW announced plans to cut fixed costs by another 2 billion euros through 2023, allowing it to raise operating profit margins to between 7%-8%. That’s up from a previous target of 5%-6.5%.
The new targets came a day after VW showcased its ambitions in battery supply.  At a two-hour presentation on Monday intended to echo Tesla’s ‘Battery Day’ event, the company said it intends to have 80% of its models operating on a ‘unified cell design’ by 2023 that – it hopes – will help halve unit costs.
In Europe alone, it also plans to have six battery cell production plants operating by 2030, either on its own or together with partners, and a network of 18,000 public fast-charging points by 2025. For the latter, it’s partnering both with legacy fuel retailers such as BP (NYSE:BP) and electricity utilities such as Spain’s Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY) and Italy’s  Enel  (MI:ENEI). It’s also aiming for a network of a further network of 17,000 fast-charging points in China.
For now, the company is relying on the Chinese and Korean battery suppliers that have dominated the infancy of the EV market. However, VW is also an investor in U.S.-based Quantumscape (NYSE:QS), whose work on next-generation, solid-state batteries has garnered increasing attention in recent months.
Quantumscape aims to produce a solid-state battery with an 80% range advantage over existing lithium-ion batteries – as well as a reduced combustion risk."

(Reuters) - Ferguson announced a special dividend and share buyback of about $400 million each on Tuesday after cost cuts and strong U.S. home improvement demand helped the plumbing and heating parts distributor increase first-half profit.
Tuesday's results chimed with those of U.S. rivals  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW), both of which also benefited from stuck-at-home Americans snapping up building materials through COVID-19 lockdowns in Ferguson's biggest market by sales.
London-listed Ferguson, shares of which also began trading in the United States this month, said half-year profit rose 12.2% as residential sales recovered on the back of a pick-up in the housing market.
However, analysts have said that pandemic-led demand could fade for home-improvement chains as COVID-19 vaccine programmes are rolled out.
Ferguson warned that the outlook for the second half of the financial year remains ""very uncertain"" and it expects rising supply chain pressures, transportation and other costs to partially offset revenue growth.
The United States-based company's London-listed shares were up slightly at 90.44 pounds at 1115 GMT.
""We are well positioned to manage through this environment,"" Chief Executive Kevin Murphy said, adding that the company has generated high single-digit organic revenue growth since the beginning of its third quarter.
The company's special shareholder payout reflects the sale of its UK-focused business for about $420 million this year while it also raised its interim dividend by 5% to 72.9 cents per share.
The sale of its British arm,  Wolseley  (LON:FERG) UK, was aimed at allowing the group to focus solely on its main U.S. business. The company also operates in Canada.
Ferguson's underlying trading profit rose to $837 million for the six months to Jan. 31, up from $746 million a year ago, on sales of $10.31 billion.
Liberum analysts said the revenue would be a ""little disappointing"" for the market, given the strength of the U.S. housing market.

Investing.com –  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) shares were up 2.3% in premarket trade Tuesday after the company said it had begun dosing of its Covid-19 vaccine in children aged between six months and 12 years.
The study will assess the safety and effectiveness of two doses of the vaccine, mRNA-1273. It aims to enroll about 6,750 children in the U.S. and Canada.
The vaccine has already been authorized for emergency use in Americans aged 18 and above. That vaccine has been found to be effective without many cases of major side effects. The company is already testing the shot in adolescents between 12 and 18 years.
Vaccine rollout in the U.S. gathering pace might also be adding to the positive sentiment for the stock. Connecticut and Kansas became the latest states to announce an accelerated timeframe for adult vaccine eligibility on Monday, following Alaska, Michigan and Mississippi.

The CBOE Volatility Index closed Monday at 20.03. That was its lowest since Feb. 12, the date on which it closed below 20 for the first time since the pandemic rout gripped markets last year. The index has had similar difficulties in breaching that level in other times of stress, according to strategists.
Susquehanna International Group derivatives strategist Chris Murphy pointed out the “pretty shocking” similarities between the VIX’s behavior during the Global Financial Crisis and now, in a note dated Monday.
“Part of the reason the medium-term VIX futures are remaining elevated now is likely due to concerns regarding potential ‘mini shocks’”, Murphy wrote.
The 20 level on VIX has been seen for months as a key hurdle and compares with the gauge’s five-year average of 17.7. Potential factors keeping it elevated include a dearth of volatility sellers and a raft of retail-investor activity in options.
VIX futures remained elevated in 2009 after the credit crisis, which turned out to be justified, according to Murphy. The VIX endured two more shocks afterward: the Flash Crash in 2010 and the European sovereign-debt crisis in 2011, he added.
Even as stock gauges such as the S&P 500 and MSCI All-Country World Index trade at or near record highs on optimism over the global recovery, market nerves remain elevated. AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc’s vaccine challenges, for example, are a reminder of the issues that can spring up.
“Risk-on behavior has been at a very high level for a prolonged period” Jason Goepfert, president of Sundial Capital Research Inc., wrote in a note Tuesday, adding that such bullishness usually leads to periods of uncertainty.
In six other instances he identified as being similarly bullish, the VIX “rose every time, and its average gain was substantial with a median gain of 34% and an average of 71%.”

962,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2021 07:30AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse flags financial hit over Greensill collapse,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi, Carolyn Cohn and Oliver Hirt
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) may have to book a charge over its dealings with Greensill, it warned on Tuesday, as investor scrutiny grows over its relationship with the British supply-chain finance company that collapsed into insolvency.
The Swiss bank has had to close around $10 billion of supply-chain finance funds that bought notes issued by Greensill, and which it marketed to clients. It is also trying to recoup a $140 million loan it made to the company last year.
""While these issues are still at an early stage, we would note that it is possible that Credit Suisse will incur a charge in respect of these matters,"" it said.
Greensill filed for insolvency last week after losing insurance coverage for its debt repackaging business. 
Credit Suisse's share price has fallen over 10% since it announced its supply-chain funds were suspended on March 1. It has paid investors about $3.1 billion in redemptions from the four funds so far, and said it would be announcing further cash distributions over coming months.
The bank also said on Tuesday that, ""contrary to certain reports"", its chief risk and compliance officer, Lara Warner, was not aware until Feb. 22 that insurance related to Greensill could expire on March 1.
Greensill founder Lex Greensill said in a court filing last week that he kept senior individuals at Credit Suisse, including Warner, informed about the funds' insurance coverage in the ""weeks"" leading up to its insolvency application on March 8. 
The collapse has put fresh pressure on Credit Suisse Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein who has been trying to move the bank on from a string of bad headlines, spanning a spy scandal that ousted predecessor Tidjane Thiam to a $450 million write-down on a hedge fund investment.
The level of oversight and risk management applied at the bank's asset management division is under scrutiny particularly as Gottstein had ordered a review of the Greensill funds last year.
Supply-chain financing, or reverse factoring, is a method by which companies can get cash from banks and funds such as Greensill to pay their suppliers without having to dip into their working capital. See EXPLAINER:
Greensill had large exposure to one client, GFG Alliance, which is controlled by steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta and has started to default on its debts, according to Greensill's insolvency application. Gupta said on Friday the conglomerate was in talks with Greensill's administrators on a standstill agreement to pause its debt payments to Greensill for an agreed period.
COSTS 'IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE'
The saga overshadowed what was otherwise a strong start to the year for Credit Suisse, whose shares opened up 1.8% on Tuesday as it said it had achieved the highest level of pretax income in both January and February in a decade. 
Andreas Venditti, analyst at Bank Vontobel, said the bank was facing a loss of confidence among investors.
""The Greensill case has cost Credit Suisse around three billion francs in market capitalization. Investors have been reassessing the risks to which the bank is exposed. In a worst-case scenario the bank faces years of litigation,"" he said.
""It is currently virtually impossible to estimate how high the direct costs of the case will be for Credit Suisse. Investors don't like uncertainty."" 
Three Credit Suisse investors told Reuters they were concerned about the fallout for the bank. They declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
An investor in Credit Suisse debt said the main financial risk was to the bank's reputation, which it said was a key asset for the wealth management business.
One Credit Suisse shareholder said the bank should fully compensate investors in the supply chain funds. A second equity investor said that, as well as reputational risk, it was worried about the effect of the Greensill collapse on the bank's future asset-raising and its credentials in the growing business of socially responsible investing.
Credit Suisse declined to comment beyond its statements.
The bank has hired external firms to help deal with regulators and insurers amid questions over the contracts that underpinned Greensill's security. It has also recovered some $50 million of the $140 million bridge loan, it said, leaving its outstanding collateralised loan at $90 million.
Credit Suisse said on Tuesday that its asset management division, which sold the funds to investors, was working closely with Greensill's administrator, Grant Thornton, and with other parties to facilitate the recovery of funds.

Japanese insurer Tokio Marine, which provided $4.6 billion of coverage to Greensill credit notes through an Australian unit, is investigating the validity of those policies. A person with knowledge of the matter has said these were directly linked to the Credit Suisse funds.

LONDON (Reuters) - A review of rules will not lead to any ""radical departure"" or a reduction in capital requirements, but it will take time to complete, Bank of England Deputy Governor Sam Woods said on Tuesday.
Britain's exit from European Union has prompted the government to review insurance capital rules inherited from the bloc, raising industry hopes of less burdensome requirements.
Woods, who also heads the BoE's Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Regulation Authority, which regulates Britain's top banks and insurers, played down any such expectations.
""Now that we have left the EU we have no interest whatsoever in lowering levels of resilience or policyholder protection, but we can and should make changes to tailor regulation so it fits our market better and is more efficient and coherent,"" Woods told the Association of British Insurers (ABI).
The ABI said last month that 35 billion pounds ($48.4 billion) of capital locked in by the risk margin element in capital rules known as Solvency II, could be used to increase investment in the UK economy and tackle climate change.
The risk margin is an extra layer of capital insurers must hold as a safety buffer in case they get into trouble.
However, Woods said he had doubts ""about a reform package which materially decapitalises the insurance sector,"" adding: ""While it's natural for the private sector to focus on private interests, it’s part of our job to keep an eye on the potential public costs of significant insurance failures.""
He was ""wary"" of cutting capital requirements on 'green' or climate-friendly investments.
Regulators face calls to have a remit to keep the City globally competitive. It is ""not normal"" for prudential regulators to have an actual competitiveness objective, which could be seen internationally as an intention to weaken UK regulation, Woods said.
""Loading something up with ever more objects is an excellent way to decorate your Christmas tree, but it's not the best way to create an effective regulator,"" Woods said.

964,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2021 07:15AM ET</span>",EU says Pfizer to deliver over 200 million vaccine doses in second quarter,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission expects to receive more than 200 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech in the second quarter, it said on Tuesday, putting the European Union on course to meet its inoculation target.
The EU aims to vaccinate at least 255 million people, or 70% of its adult population, by the end of the summer.
It has faced criticism of a slow rollout amid supply delays from some drugmakers, hiccups in vaccination plans and the suspension of inoculations using the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine due to potential health issues.
The new expected deliveries from Pfizer include 10 million doses originally expected in the third and fourth quarters, the Commission said.
""These accelerated 10 million doses will bring the total doses of BioNTech-Pfizer in quarter two up to over 200 million,"" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, revealing for the first time the volume of doses expected from Pfizer in the April-June quarter.
Pfizer on Tuesday confirmed the EU statement regarding second-quarter supply.
""This is very good news. It gives member states room to manoeuvre and possibly fill gaps in deliveries,"" von der Leyen said.
The additional doses would be moved forward from an option of 100 million doses in a second contract the EU signed in January with Pfizer and BioNTech, the EU statement said.
In total the EU has booked 600 million doses from the two companies in two separate contracts.
It is unclear whether this announcement could lead to changes in the EU's overall delivery forecasts. The Commission said last week it expected 300 million doses in the second quarter from all the vaccine makers it had contracts with.
The bloc in the second quarter expects 55 million doses from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and 35 million from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), according to a delivery schedule published by the Italian government and an internal document on supply forecasts from Germany's health ministry.

AstraZeneca last week announced it aimed to deliver to the 27-nation bloc 70 million doses in the second quarter from its original contractual obligation of 180 million.

Shares of Gland Pharma, which is backed by China-based Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd, surged as much as 9.5% to hit a record high of 2,783.85 rupees. 
India's Hetero already has a deal in place to produce over 100 million doses of the vaccine, which has proven to be 91.6% effective against COVID-19.
Sputnik V, developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute, has been approved in 22 countries, with the RDIF signing supply deals with over 13 countries.
Indian drugmaker Dr.Reddy's Laboratories Ltd has also been holding small clinical studies of Sputnik V domestically. It had sought emergency use approval for the vaccine last month, but India's drug regulator had asked for more data. 
Production is expected to begin in the third quarter at its facilities in Hyderabad, with deliveries estimated in the final quarter of the year, Gland Pharma said in a statement. It did not specify which countries it would supply the doses to.
Gland Pharma also said it would explore more deals for the vaccine.
India, the world's biggest vaccine maker, has so far given emergency use approval to AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc's shot and a homegrown vaccine made by Bharat Biotech. It has donated or sold vaccines to more than three dozen countries, while significantly ramping up its own inoculation program this month.

European Union (EU) governments are considering launching talks with Sputnik V developers as the EU tries to get its vaccination program back on track, EU diplomatic and official sources have told Reuters.

966,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2021 07:05AM ET</span>","'Taper tantrum' worries creeping in, but equity crash not imminent: BofA","LONDON (Reuters) - Investors have nudged their cash allocations higher, suggesting a slight increase in concerns that inflation and ""taper tantrums"" could topple a record rally in financial markets, BofA's March fund manager survey showed on Tuesday.
Unprecedented stimulus measures have sparked worries about inflation, driving U.S. 10-year borrowing costs to more than one-year highs of 1.62%. 
That has dovetailed with speculation that central banks might start withdrawing their support, a combination that triggered market panic in 2013 when investors learned that the U.S. Federal Reserve was scaling back - or ""tapering"" - its quantitative easing programme.
Fund managers surveyed by BofA increased their cash allocation to 4% from 3.8% in February.
A rise above 2% in U.S. 10-year Treasury yield could cause more than a 10% correction in stocks, 43% of them, with $630 billion in assets under management, said. Just over a third said a rise to 2.5% could make bonds attractive relative to stocks.
Though the quickfire bond selloff in recent weeks dented tech stocks, wiping hundreds of billions from the sector's market capitalisation, 'long tech' remained the most crowded trade in the survey.
However, investors had the lowest overweight on the sector since January 2009, just as markets started recovering from the 2008 financial crisis.
Investors typically are willing to pay more for near-term growth when rates rise as cyclicals tend to do well in the early days of economic booms.
Rising rates have also prompted a rush to commodities. Investors are currently their most optimistic on commodities in the survey's near two-decade history.
A 81% jump in U.S. stocks from COVID-19 lows hit in March last year have kicked off bubble worries, but investors in BofA downplayed it. 
Only 15% think U.S. equities are in a bubble, 25% say it's an early-stage bull market and 55% say a late-stage bull market.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Tuesday, in cautious trading after the record levels on the previous session and ahead of a highly anticipated Federal Reserve meeting.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 30 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 60 points, or 0.5%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% and the S&P 500 gained 0.6%, both closing Monday at new record levels. The Nasdaq Composite ended up 1.1%, the relative outperformer on the back of falling bond yields.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq is set to lead the way again Tuesday, with the 10-year Treasury yield trading just below 1.6%, weakening after hitting its highest level in more than a year above 1.64% on Friday. 
The recent jump in bond yields had prompted a rotation out of the highly-leveraged tech names, as their future cash flows begin to look less attractive relative to other assets.
The main focus this week will be on the Federal Reserve, as the central bank kicks off its two-day meeting later Tuesday. The central bank is not expected to change its extremely accommodative monetary policy stance, but speculation has risen in recent days that its guidance could reflect expectations of a first interest rate hike as early as late-2023, instead of 2024 as expected hitherto.
The U.S. vaccination program hit a milestone this week: more Americans have now received at least one dose than have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic began. 
This points towards a relative early reopening of the economy, and a near-term widening of the economic performance gap: Europe is struggling with a surge in Covid-19 cases and a number of countries in the region have also paused the distribution of the AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine.
On the economic data slate, the main release will be February’s retail sales data, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), which is expected to show a slow down from January’s sharp 5.3% gain. Also due are industrial production data for February at 9:15 AM ET, and the NAHB housing market index at 10 AM.
Oil prices edged lower Tuesday ahead of key U.S. crude inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute later in the session.
U.S. stockpiles have been rising as production continues a slow recovery from February’s unexpected cold snap in Texas and the surrounding areas. 
U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $64.62 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.2% to $68.09. Both contracts climbed last week to their highest levels since the start of the pandemic.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,733.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1946.

969,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2021 06:41AM ET</span>","Cannabis entrepreneurs, celebrity investors light up as legalization blooms","By Paul Lienert and Jane Lanhee Lee
DETROIT/OAKLAND, Calf. (Reuters) - Driven by a surge in cannabis use during the COVID-19 pandemic, industry entrepreneurs and investors are gearing up for even greater growth as legalization spreads and the economy reopens.
So far, 36 states and the District of Columbia have approved medical use of marijuana, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Of them,15 states and D.C. have approved recreational use of pot.
Cannabis technology startups, including those enabling home delivery of pot, got a big boost during the pandemic as more Americans partook, igniting investor interest in companies that provide everything from cultivation management tools to compliance and e-commerce software for an industry that still operates in a legal gray zone at the federal level. 
Cannabis entrepreneurs say they have to move quickly and build their brands before full U.S. legalization levels the playing field - a process that many expect to gather steam this year. 
“Why are you going to Weedmaps (for listings of cannabis retailers) if you can go to Yelp? Why do you order through this or that system if you can order through DoorDash or Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats?” asks Steve Allan, chief executive of The Parent Company, which has Jay-Z as chief visionary officer and is looking to consolidate smaller players following its January listing through a special purpose acquisition company. 
TPCO has built its own e-commerce technology that can handle everything from business management to retail sales, said Allan. 
In one of the biggest venture capital deals in the sector to date, Oregon-based e-commerce platform Dutchie on Tuesday announced it raised $200 million in a funding round that values the company at $1.7 billion.
Dutchie’s investors include former Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) CEO Howard Schultz, NBA star Kevin Durant and DoorDash co-founder Stanley Tang. The company's online marketplace connects cannabis dispensaries with consumers, who can order home delivery. 
Reuters has identified more than 90 private and public cannabis tech companies in North America, with total private investment in the first quarter at the highest level in 18 months, according to data compiled by PitchBook and Crunchbase.
All told, investors have poured more than $2.5 billion into cannabis tech startups since 2018.
Public investors are piling in too. Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, that target the broader cannabis industry raised at least $4.3 billion through early 2021, with $1.7 billion of that still waiting to be deployed, according to cannabis researcher BDSA.
That interest comes as shares of publicly traded cannabis companies - many of which are listed in Canada because they are barred from U.S. exchanges - have begun to rebound after a brutal sell-off in 2019. 
“We’re still in the very early innings” of investing, said Harrison Aaron, an investment analyst with Gotham Green Partners, a New York-based private equity firm with a cannabis-centric portfolio.
U.S. legal cannabis sales for both medicinal and recreational use last year jumped 45%, according to BDSA. 
“We don’t necessarily want things to go (fully) legal today because there’s a lot of value in our companies, and we want more time to build,” said Lenore Kopko, managing partner at Gotham Green.
Others believe entry to the cannabis industry may not be quick or easy for many of the big outside players.
“Cannabis legislation, regulations and supply chain flows create complexity that is not built into software made for other industries,” said David Hua, founder and CEO of Meadow, which sells compliance and operating software for cannabis retailers.
CELEBRITIES GALORE
Cannabis startup funding in the sector has been led by a closely knit network of investors that often co-invest with one another. That network includes Liquid 2 Ventures, headed by former NFL quarterback Joe Montana, and Casa Verde Capital, founded by entertainer Snoop Dogg. 
Another of those firms, Beverly Hills-based Arcadian Capital, has invested in more than a dozen cannabis tech startups. Boca Raton-based Phyto Partners has funded 10, many of them as a co-investor with Arcadian.
The network occasionally is joined by other high-profile individual investors. DoorDash’s Tang and Twitch co-founder Justin Kan were among those backing Oakland-based Nabis, a cannabis online marketplace for dispensaries that also has a warehouse, delivery service and online financing for retailers.
There is another draw for investors beyond the immediate business opportunity: data on a brand-new industry.
For Arcadian, the torrent of data that is being generated by cannabis tech startups provides “a great mechanism to learn more about the industry,” said Matthew Nordgren, the company’s founder and managing partner.
Industry boosters say technology developed and incubated by the cannabis industry could open new pathways for retail trade in other sectors.

Socrates Rosenfeld, co-founder and CEO of Jane Technologies, the Santa Cruz creator of an e-commerce platform that has been funded by Arcadian and Gotham Green, called it ""a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a tech company to work in partnership with the operators in this space to build and redefine how tech and analog retail work together.”

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks rose on Tuesday, as investors anticipated the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks meeting this week will keep policies accommodative to help drive a post-pandemic global economic recovery.
European shares extended a rally that began on Wall Street on Monday and continued into Asia, with the pan-region STOXX 600 index up 0.5%. On Monday, the index touched its highest level in more than a year before ending flat. 
Britain's FTSE 100 index rose 0.7%, Germany's DAX 0.6%, France's CAC 40 0.2% and Italy's FTSE MIB index 0.6%. 
E-mini futures for the S&P 500 hit a record high before trading flat on the day.
MSCI's All Country World Index, which tracks stocks across 49 countries, rose 0.2% to its highest levels since Feb 25.
An index of Asia-Pacific share markets excluding Japan gained 0.65%, led by a 0.8% jump in Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index.
Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.5% to just below the 30,000 mark. The broader Topix added 0.65%.
China's blue-chip CSI 300 index climbed 0.87% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.67%.
""The stock markets have kept their spirits up ahead of tomorrow's important Fed announcement,"" said Karl Steiner, chief quantitative strategist at SEB.
On Monday, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both soared on gains in travel stocks as mass vaccinations in the United States and congressional approval of a $1.9 trillion aid bill fueled investor optimism.
Longer-term U.S. Treasury yields slipped further on Tuesday, as the market looked ahead to government debt auctions and the Fed's two-day policy meeting, which will conclude on Wednesday.
The benchmark 10-year yield, which reached a more than one-year high of 1.642% last week, was back at 1.125%.
The earlier surge in yields stemmed from investors speculating that rising inflation expectations could prompt the Federal Open Market Committee to signal it will start raising rates sooner than expected. 
""We think the FOMC will have a hard time expressing concern about asset markets with the S&P at an all-time high on 12 March, despite 10Y U.S. Treasury yields at post-February 2020 highs,"" said analysts Steve Englander and John Davies at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF).
""Focus has been on the FOMC ‘dot plot’ in recent days, but if the FOMC and Fed Chair (Jerome) Powell do not push back against current yield levels, investors are likely to take yields higher as better data arrives.""

(Reuters) - European stocks rose on Tuesday as German carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and online fashion retailer Zalando jumped following upbeat earnings forecasts, while investors awaited the U.S. Federal Reserve's views on a recent pick-up in inflation. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.5%, inching closer to a record peak set last year and tracking an overnight rally on Wall Street on optimism about an eventual economic recovery from the pandemic lows. 
Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) jumped 4.9% after the world's second-largest carmaker said it was confident that cost cuts will help improve profit margins in the coming years, boosting European automakers. 
Zalando rose 4.1% after it forecast 2021 revenue growth above market expectations following a strong start to the year. Its shares touched a three-week high and lifted the wider retail index. 
A gauge of volatility in European stock markets slipped to its lowest level since February 2020.

""The ideal situation for the markets would be the central bank saying, ""Yes, we're concerned about inflation and we're going to step in and prevent inflation going too high,"" said Connor Campbell, financial analyst at spreadbetters SpreadEx.
""Though the issue is going to be that the Fed is completely comfortable with inflation hitting 2% or higher.""

972,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2021 05:31AM ET</span>",How Germany considered rescuing Wirecard days before its doom,"By John O'Donnell and Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The German government examined the possibility of bailing out Wirecard just three days before it collapsed, according to documents seen by Reuters showing that officials were blindsided by the country's biggest post-war fraud scandal.
The payment company filed for insolvency on June 25 last year, owing creditors almost $4 billion, after disclosing a 1.9 billion euro ($2.3 billion) hole in its accounts that its auditor EY said was the result of a sophisticated global fraud.
The documents provide previously unreported details of the ministry's exploration of using pandemic rescue funds to bail out Wirecard shortly before its implosion last summer, and demonstrate that officials misjudged the scandal.
On June 22, just hours after the company revealed the 1.9 billion euros in its accounts probably ""do not exist"", Joerg Kukies, a deputy finance minister, sent a nine-page memo to Finance Minister Olaf Scholz which played down concerns that the company was in imminent peril and outlined a plan to rescue it with funds from state bank KfW.
""A bank run could put Wirecard in liquidity difficulties,"" officials wrote. ""It is not currently expected that Wirecard's creditors ... will feed it to the wolves."" 
The documents also provide previously unreported details about how Wirecard representatives and German officials had worked closely to promote the company's overseas expansion.
The finance ministry, Scholz and the government declined to comment, beyond one official saying the support given to the company abroad was ""within the usual framework of our business diplomacy"". German officials have previously said Wirecard did not receive any special treatment, and Reuters has no independent evidence that it did. 
The trove includes thousands of pages of emails, chat messages and memos provided by German government ministries to a parliamentary inquiry probing the company's collapse. 
The implosion of a company once worth $28 billion, and seen as a national success story, led to German lawmakers accusing the government and regulators of failing to heed investors who had since 2016 alleged accounting regularities at the firm.
Lawmakers from the inquiry will question Scholz and Chancellor Angela Merkel about the government's handling of the scandal next month. 
Scholz - referred to as ""M"" in correspondence among finance ministry staff - is seeking to succeed Merkel as German leader in elections in September when she leaves office. He has responded to the Wirecard scandal by giving regulators more powers to spot and investigate misconduct. 
In June 2020, matters at Wirecard were rapidly spinning out of control. The company announced a delay to its earnings statement, its chief executive resigned and its chief operating officer was suspended. 
On June 22, at 2:48 a.m., the company revealed the 1.9 billion euros were missing from its accounts.
Hours later that same morning, email traffic shows that Scholz's deputy Kukies, who was weighing whether German airline Lufthansa should receive a pandemic bailout from KfW, asked colleagues to also urgently examine whether Wirecard could get funds. 
""An initial assessment is to be included in an M briefing document, which should be with M this evening,"" an aide to Kukies wrote on his behalf. 
In the assessment, a document for M marked ""very urgent"" and ""confidential"", Kukies and his staff, who weren't individually named, outlined to Scholz the importance of Wirecard in processing payments, including for supermarket giant Aldi. 
While acknowledging its problems, they suggested Wirecard's business, which included a bank, was sound and that it was unlikely to go bust immediately.
""The press reports that Wirecard's operating business is doing well despite the coronavirus crisis and despite the mis-steps,"" the document said. It did not elaborate on the mis-steps.
The government dropped the idea of a bailout in the following days, in part because of questions about whether Wirecard's business was sustainable in the long-term, the documents show.
It was ""very unlikely"" that the ministry's external consultants ""would confirm that there is an economically viable business model"", the same document to M said.
'GOVERNMENT STOOD BY WIRECARD'
Danyal Bayaz and Matthias Hauer, two German lawmakers who are part of the inquiry into the scandal, told Reuters that their investigation would examine the finance ministry's exploration of a bailout for Wirecard, as well as the government's lobbying to aid the company's expansion in China.
These episodes, they said, illustrated the government's misguided willingness to support Wirecard and its refusal to take seriously the allegations made by its critics, including short-sellers who published a research report in February 2016 alleging fraud and money-laundering at the company.
Former Wirecard CEO Markus Braun is in jail awaiting trial on fraud charges while German police are conducting an international search  for another former senior executive, Jan Marsalek, whom they accuse of ""fraud in the billions"" and have issued an arrest warrant for.
""The German government stood by Wirecard. Scholz bears political responsibility,"" Bayaz said.
Jens Zimmermann, a lawmaker from Scholz's SPD party, said it was understandable that officials, facing the possible failure of both Lufthansa and Wirecard, were worried about the stability of the financial sector and felt it was responsible to explore all options. 
In terms of lobbying, Wolfgang Schmidt, a close confidant and deputy to Scholz, said in testimony to parliamentarians investigating Wirecard's collapse: ""It is quite normal for the government to regularly champion the economic interests of German companies in other countries."" 
'APPRECIATE YOUR ENDORSEMENT'
Inquiry lawmakers Bayaz and Hauer said they were concerned that government support for Wirecard continued even after red flags were raised about the company.
In February 2019, Germany's financial regulator BaFin told the finance ministry that it had ordered an inquiry into Wirecard's accounting, and in April, BaFin fined Wirecard 1.5 million euros for failing to promptly file financial accounts.
Yet on June 22 2019, Schmidt took a phone call from a U.S.-based consultant for Wirecard, Ulf Gartzke of the corporate advisory firm Spitzberg, according to the documents and Schmidt's testimony to the inquiry in December last year.
    The topic was ""Project Heron"" - Wirecard's plans to take over the payment firm in China, Allscore, which needed approval from Chinese authorities. Gartzke asked Schmidt to approach Chinese officials over Wirecard's plans.
Schmidt said in his testimony that he asked Gartzke to write something for him in English. That same day, Gartzke sent an email to Schmidt attaching a draft letter in English, which was seen by Reuters.
""We would appreciate your endorsement of the above initiative and hope that you can extend your support to Wirecard AG (OTC:WCAGY) in their plans to enter the Chinese market,"" the draft said.
Schmidt said in his testimony that he ""reformulated"" this mail, without elaborating on what that meant, and sent it to a Chinese official. Hauer, the parliamentarian, said he saw the final letter and it was ""nearly identical"". 
Schmidt said this was part of the usual process of helping big companies abroad. Gartzke didn't respond to a request for comment.
China's central bank, foreign ministry and State Council Information Office did not respond to requests for comment.

Wirecard announced an agreement to take over Allscore in November that year, though the deal was not completed before Wirecard's collapse. Allscore could not be reached for comment.

973,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2021 05:20AM ET</span>","Purdue Pharma to use public trusts, Sackler cash to settle opioid litigation","By Maria Chutchian and Mike Spector
(Reuters) - Purdue Pharma LP filed a bankruptcy plan on Monday that would resolve thousands of opioid lawsuits by restructuring the OxyContin maker into an entity that would steer profits to plaintiffs and require the company's Sackler family owners to contribute nearly $4.3 billion to the settlement.
The plan is intended to serve as Purdue’s roadmap out of bankruptcy, which it filed in September 2019 in the face of nearly 3,000 lawsuits accusing the company of fueling the national opioid crisis through deceptive marketing.
The plan, which Purdue says is worth more than $10 billion, sets up trusts that would indirectly control the new entity to distribute money to states, local governments and tribal organizations for opioid abatement programs.
The Sacklers’ contributions would be paid out over nine years.
“With drug overdoses still at record levels, it is past time to put Purdue’s assets to work addressing the crisis,” Purdue board Chairman Steve Miller said in a statement. “We are confident this plan achieves that critical goal.”
The plan also establishes trusts to pay out to private entities and individuals that have brought opioid-related lawsuits against Purdue, such as hospitals, insurance carriers and legal guardians of children born with addiction-related issues.
The various trusts would be funded with an initial cash infusion of $500 million immediately after the company emerges from bankruptcy and another $1 billion generated from the new entity's assets and operations through 2024. The trusts would also receive funding from the Sacklers’ contribution. The company also expects to contribute from insurance policies.
The new entity will be overseen by a board comprising independent managers selected by states and local governments in consultation with Purdue and its unsecured creditors’ committee. The Sacklers will not be part of that selection process.
Purdue said the new entity will not promote opioid products to healthcare providers.
Additionally, the plan would create a publicly available repository for documents related to the government’s investigation into alleged misconduct in the marketing of opioids, which would become available once the plan is approved in bankruptcy court.
Purdue initially had support from about half of the U.S. states and other governmental entities for its proposed settlement. Many other states have opposed Purdue's plan, taking issue with the public trust arrangement and the size of the initial $3 billion contribution from the Sacklers, which they said should be larger.
“The Sacklers became billionaires by causing a national tragedy. Now they’re trying to get away with it,” Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement. “We’re going to keep fighting for the accountability that families all across this country deserve.”
The plan must receive approval from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New York.
The Sacklers have also agreed to pay $225 million to settle a civil investigation from the U.S. Department of Justice. They have not been criminally charged.
“Today marks an important step toward providing help to those who suffer from addiction, and we hope this proposed resolution will signal the beginning of a far-reaching effort to deliver assistance where it is needed,"" members of the Sackler family said in a statement.
Purdue itself struck a deal with the Justice Department to pay $225 million toward a $2 billion criminal forfeiture. The Justice Department agreed to forgo the rest if the company developed a reorganization plant that would establish a public benefit company or similar entity that would dedicate the remaining $1.775 billion to U.S. communities battling the opioid crisis.

The opioid abuse and addiction crisis has claimed nearly 450,000 lives in the United States between 1999 and 2018, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Tuesday, helped by gains from car giant Volkswagen but fresh Covid concerns mounted.
At 3:55 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% higher, the CAC 40 in France was up 0.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.5%.
Global equity markets have posted strong gains over the last few months, as investors expressed confidence in the return to health of the global economy from the pandemic on the back for extraordinary amounts of monetary and fiscal stimulus.
UBS lifted its view on Chinese growth earlier Tuesday, now seeing the world’s second largest economy expanding 9% this year, faster than the earlier forecast of 8.2%.
However, confidence is waning in Europe as fears of another wave of the Covid-19 virus hitting the continent grow. German coronavirus infections are spreading exponentially, up 20% in the last week, an expert at the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said on Tuesday, while the French health ministry reported late Monday that a new coronavirus variant has been found in Brittany.
Additionally, Germany on Monday became the latest country in the region to suspend the use of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine after reports of possible serious side effects, likely slowing the pace of vaccinations in the region, delaying any recovery from the pandemic. 
These worries prompted Deutsche Bank to cut its gross domestic product growth projection for the euro area to 4.6% for 2021, from the 5.6% projected in November. 
In corporate news, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) stock rose 3.7%, climbing to its highest level in the last year, after the world's second-largest carmaker said it was confident that cost cuts will help it improve profit margins in the coming years.
Zalando (DE:ZALG) stock rose 4.9% after the online fashion retailer forecast strong 2021 revenue growth.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) stock rose 2.1% despite the Swiss banking giant flagging the possibility of writedowns following the collapse of its Greensill-linked supply chain finance funds and other dealings with the specialty firm.
Away from Europe, the Federal Reserve starts a two-day policy meeting later Tuesday. The spotlight on the central bank will be even more intense this week as a surge in bond yields and a rebounding U.S. economy has called into question its very loose monetary policies.
Oil prices edged lower Tuesday, with traders banking profits after recent gains ahead of key U.S. crude inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute later in the session.
U.S. stockpiles have been rising as production continues a slow recovery from February’s unexpected cold snap in Texas and the surrounding areas. 
U.S. crude futures traded 1% lower at $64.65 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.9% to $68.23. Both contracts climbed last week to their highest levels since the start of the pandemic.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,730.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1926.

976,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2021 03:55AM ET</span>",Analysis: Moutai hangover highlights risks in China's crowded stock bets,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A collapse in China's blue-chip share prices has raised the ire of investors, angry at the way asset managers have crowded into a handful of large stocks and increased market volatility.
Liquor giant Kweichow Moutai, Asia's fourth-biggest stock and a perennial market darling, has become the poster child of the recent selloff as its steep losses hurt mutual funds heavily invested in its shares.
Its shares have shed a quarter of their value since a Feb. 18 peak as concerns over Beijing's monetary tightening triggered a sharp sell-off in larger stocks. More than 900 stock funds lost at least 20% in net assets over the past month, according to fund distributor eastmoney.com.
GRAPHIC: China's market darlings lost momentum - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/qzjpqlwejvx/China's%20market%20darlings%20lost%20momentum.jpg 
Kevin Zhang, a retail investor, lost one-fifth of his investment in E Fund Blue Chip Selected Mixed Fund in a matter of weeks.
Four distillers - Moutai, Wuliangye, Luzhou Lao Jiao and Jiangsu Yanghe Brewery - account for roughly 40% of the $10 billion fund.
Moutai was among the top 10 portfolio holdings in 576 stock funds at the end of 2020 - over one third of 1,510 tracked by Everbright Securities. Smaller rival Wuliangye is the second-most popular, with 473 funds placing big bets.
After raising record amounts of cash in 2020, Chinese money managers rushed into a cluster of high-flying consumer and healthcare stocks, pushing share prices even higher. 
The sharp fall in markets since mid-February has bruised such funds and laid bare the controversial practice of ""huddling"", wherein mutual funds take on outsized stock and sector exposures as they seek to outperform benchmark indexes and lure more investors.
The China Huddling 50 Index, compiled by Sinolink Securities and tracking 50 fund manager favorites, has outperformed the Shanghai Composite Index by 10 times since 2017.
China's mutual fund industry jumped by a third last year to exceed $3 trillion as Beijing encouraged institutional investment.
But as markets have turned, some investors are losing confidence in mutual funds' ability to do what regulators desire: make rational, long-term decisions that generate value.
""The rapid growth of China's fund industry has not turned the market less volatile. Rather, it has become a source of market volatility,"" writes Yin Zhongli, researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
Ye Qiu, a retail investor on the platform Xueqiu.com, even described institutional investors' huddling as a Ponzi scheme. ""Retails investors are burnt when the bubble bursts,"" Ye posted.
STUFFED 
Fund ""huddling"" is not unique to China. 
U.S. investors' addiction to ""FAANG"" tech giants - namely Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) - pose similar problems. 
What's unusual, however, is the extreme valuations China's huddling has caused, said Yan Xiang, strategist at Guosen Securities.
The median valuation of the top 100 holdings by Chinese stock mutual funds - accounting for 74% of their concentrated portfolio assets – hit a record high of 80-times earnings in January.
That compares with an average price/earnings ratio of 20 for China's more than 4,200 stocks, and 51 for FAANG stocks.
Moutai's current valuation ""is irrational, and unfathomable,"" said Dong Baozhen, a Beijing-based hedge fund manager who bought the stock at around 150 yuan ($23.08) in 2013, and sold it in early 2018 for 700 yuan. 
Moutai shares have tripled since 2018, to as much as 2,627.9 yuan. Valued at $400 billion, it remains Asia's fourth-biggest stock by market cap even after the recent savage sell-off and trades at 57 times historic earnings. 
Huang Yan, vice president of Shanghai See Truth Investment Management reckons huddling has ""created a big bubble,"" and distorted the market by allocating resources to companies like Moutai that don't need the cash.
However, not everyone sees the practice as problematic.

""It's the result of the recent massive fund raising activities,"" said Peter Alexander, founder of fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors. ""Simply a 'high class problem' of having to get large swathes of money to work as quickly as possible.""

BERLIN/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Germany is betting the U.S. administration will take a pragmatic approach to the Nord Stream 2 project to ship Russian gas to Europe and is pushing for the pipeline's completion in defiance of U.S. opposition, officials and diplomats said.
To try to block the $11 billion project, led by Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), successive U.S. administrations have imposed sanctions on some entities and warned other companies involved in the project about the sanctions risk.
President Joe Biden thinks the pipeline under the Baltic Sea to Germany is ""a bad idea for Europe,"" the White House has said. 
Nord Stream 2 will bypass Western ally Ukraine, potentially depriving it of valuable transit fees. It will also increase European energy dependency on Russia and compete with shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas.
Berlin is calculating the best strategy is to present the United States with a done deal in the form of a finished project, diplomats and officials said.
The pipeline is already around 95% built, and could be finished by September, analysts who monitor tracking data say, leaving the Biden administration little time to come up with more measures to thwart it.
""Berlin is trying to buy time and make sure that the construction is finished, because they think that once the pipeline is onstream, things will look differently (to the United States),"" a senior EU diplomat briefed on the issue said. 
Like other officials who spoke to Reuters, the diplomat declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.
Although Washington has publicly said it will keep working against Nord Stream 2, German officials and EU diplomats believe there is room for negotiation.
""Berlin believes there's a willingness in Washington to talk about this and find a solution,"" a second EU diplomat also briefed on German thinking said.
Berlin has yet to begin substantive discussions with the Biden administration on Nord Stream 2, and does not definitively know the U.S. position.
'GERMAN PROBLEM'
    Washington continues to engage the German government at multiple levels to make the sanctions risk clear, a senior U.S. State Department official said. 
While Biden opposes the project, however, he is also attempting to repair relations with Europe. 
    ""We don't see this as something where the U.S. has to come to the table with options. This is a German problem that the Germans actually created,"" the official said.
Germany has no plans to make proposals either.
""We are not presenting a list of offers – nor has the U.S. government demanded anything,"" a senior German government official said.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas is waiting for his first face-to-face meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, possibly at the end of this month if Blinken attends a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels, German diplomats said.
Maas has defended Nord Stream 2 as a private, not a political enterprise and the companies involved have repeatedly said the justification for the link is commercial.
Germany also says the pipeline will give Europe greater security from gas supply disruptions, and that it has protected Kyiv by ensuring Russia continues to export some of its gas via Ukraine.  
But the United States, and some European countries, say the project is part of a Kremlin plan to manipulate European countries and undermine neighbours, such as Ukraine, that seek to withdraw from Moscow's orbit. 
'DIFFICULT INHERITANCE'
Some Biden administration officials, while repeating their opposition to Nord Stream 2, say Washington needs to be pragmatic about what it can realistically do after two previous U.S. administrations failed to stop the pipeline.
""The context here is important too, I mean, it’s a difficult inheritance,"" said one of two State Department officials that spoke to Reuters.
Some senior U.S. officials, recognising that the pipeline is nearly complete, have urged the Biden administration to consider easing pressure on Germany and focus instead on how to leverage Nord Stream 2 in the event of future crises.
“If we can’t stop the pipeline, then how can we make the best of it once it is done,” one of the senior U.S. officials said.
Last month, a former German ambassador to the United States floated the idea of a compromise between Washington and Berlin that would have given the completed pipeline a use as political leverage.
Under the plan, Germany's energy grid regulator could be empowered to stop gas flowing if Russia crossed a line.
Triggers for what the former envoy, Wolfgang Ischinger, called an ""emergency brake"" might include a flare-up in violence between Ukraine and Russia, which annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014, or if Moscow sought to undermine Kyiv's existing gas transit infrastructure.
Designed to ease U.S. concerns, the proposal garnered interest among senior European officials and diplomats outside Germany, and in parts of the German government.

But it did not gain traction with the German government as a whole, because of practical problems implementing it, and because Berlin did not feel a pressing need to offer a compromise to Washington.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up Tuesday morning amid growing optimism about the global economic recovery from COVID-19 and ahead of a two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting starting later in the day. U.S. counterparts rose to record heights during the previous session and U.S. Treasury yields moved downwards.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.70% by 11:20 PM ET (3:20 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.41%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 jumped 1.23%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.39%. The city opened its COVID-19 inoculation program to a further 5.5 million people, including those 30 and above, with registration opening earlier in the day.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.15% and the Shenzhen Component edged up 0.14%.
The S&P 500 Index climbed for a fifth consecutive session, with utilities and real estate leading the week. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). also pushed the Nasdaq 100 Index higher, while contracts on the U.S. benchmarks remained little changed.
Australian ten-year bond yields dropped after benchmark ten-year U.S. Treasury rates also fell from the previous week’s highs.
Investors are now turning their attention to the Fed meeting and await its policy decision, due on Wednesday, where Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is widely expected to reaffirm his no-tightening policy stance. The Fed is also expected to give updated economic and interest rate projections alongside its policy decision.
One beneficiary, should the Fed maintain a hands-off approach to the recent spike in yields, is the reflation trade. With increased bets on faster global economic recovery from COVID-19 already pushing one market gauge of inflation to its highest level since 2008, a renewed climb in yields could drive a rotation from growth to value stocks.
“The stimulus package is a boon for the consumer, investors are expecting the consumer to come out and spend some of that pent-up demand,”  Aviva  (LON:AV) head of U.S. equities Susan Schmidt told Bloomberg.
Small-cap and even tech stocks will both benefit from the recovery. “Right now, in the market, we’re overshooting away from tech and sometimes we can go too far,” Schmidt added.
Other central banks due to hand down their policy decision later in the week are the Bank of England (BOE), whose decision comes Thursday, and the Bank of Japan’s decision comes a day later. BOE is widely expected to keep its current monetary policy unchanged as well.
Also on investors’ minds are a potential U.S. infrastructure spending package and the impact of potentially higher taxes on corporate profits.
On the COVID-19 front, fears of potential side effects have caused more European countries to suspend the rollout of the AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN)/University of Oxford COVID-19 vaccine. The suspensions are further delaying the continent’s inoculation drive."

The state-owned firm has discussed the potential offering with advisers as it looks for new avenues to fund its 5G network development, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private. Deliberations are at an early stage and China Mobile hasn’t decided the size and timeline of the listing, the people said.
A representative for China Mobile didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Shares in China Mobile were up 1.5% in early trading in Hong Kong, after rising as much as 2.4%. They have climbed nearly 20% this year, giving the company a market value of around $139 billion.
The NYSE in January delisted the three major state-owned carriers -- China Mobile, China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) Corp. and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) Hong Kong Ltd. -- to comply with an executive order by former president Donald Trump barring U.S. investments in Chinese firms deemed as having links with the military. The firms are appealing the NYSE’s moves.
China Mobile raised $4.2 billion in an initial public offering in 1997 with its shares listed in both Hong Kong and New York, according to its website. The company had explored a listing on the mainland in 2007 but it didn’t come to fruition in the end.
A revival of the planned domestic share sale by the country’s largest carrier would follow that of China Telecom, which announced last week that it’s planning a second listing in Shanghai. The offering will help China Telecom tap diversified financing channels in both domestic and overseas capital markets, the company has said.

984,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2021 08:35PM ET</span>",Volkswagen takes aim at Tesla with own European gigafactories,"By Christoph Steitz and Jan Schwartz
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) plans to build half a dozen battery cell plants in Europe and expand infrastructure for charging electric vehicles globally, accelerating efforts to overtake Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and speed up mass adoption of battery-powered cars.
The world's No. 2 carmaker, which is in the midst of a major shift towards battery-powered cars, said on Monday it wants to have six battery cell factories operating in Europe by 2030, which it will build alone or with partners.
""Our transformation will be fast, it will be unprecedented,"" Chief Executive Herbert Diess told Volkswagen's Power Day, which also featured the CEOs of BP (NYSE:BP),  Enel  (MI:ENEI) and Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY) in an effort to match some of the buzz of Tesla's Battery Day last September.
""E-mobility has become core business for us,"" he added.
Volkswagen, whose shares rose as much as 3.8%, did not specifically say how much the plan will cost. It said in December that it planned to spend 35 billion euros ($41.7 billion) on e-mobility as a whole by 2025.
The group had been a laggard on electrification until it admitted in 2015 to cheating on U.S. diesel emissions tests and had to deal with new Chinese quotas for electric vehicles. It now has one of the most ambitious programmes in the industry.
Volkswagen said the European factories will have a joint production capacity of up to 240 gigawatt hours (GWh) a year, adding the first 40 GWh would come from Sweden's Northvolt, with production starting in 2023.
As part of the deal, Volkswagen will raise its 20% stake in Northvolt and also take over the Swedish firm's stake in a planned battery cell venture in the German city of Salzgitter, which will form the second factory from 2025.
This will be followed by a factory in Spain, France or Portugal in 2026 and a site in Poland, Slovakia or the Czech Republic by 2027. Two more plants will be set up by 2030.
While the first two factories are already reflected in Volkswagen's financial planning, the group is currently in ""deep discussions"" about how the subsequent plants fitted with financial targets, board member Thomas Schmall said.
CHARGED UP
Volkswagen is also working on a major expansion of charging infrastructure, a lack of which is still seen as a big barrier to the mass adoption of battery-powered cars.
Via existing efforts and partnerships with oil major BP as well as top European utilities Enel and Iberdrola, Volkswagen aims to operate about 18,000 public fast-charging points in Europe by 2025.
This represents a five-fold expansion of the existing fast-charging network, Volkswagen said, adding it would invest 400 million euros in the initiative.
In North America, Volkswagen targets 3,500 fast-charging points by the end of 2021 via its Electrify America unit, while in China, the world's largest car market, the group aims for 17,000 by 2025.
In China, where Volkswagen last year acquired 26.5% of battery maker Guoxuan High-tech Co Ltd, the carmaker now aims to sell more than 2 million electric vehicles a year by the end of the decade.
Shifting to design, Volkswagen unveiled plans to have a new unified prismatic battery cell from 2023, which will support cost cuts generated by the higher level of in-house cell production and could impact its current suppliers.
South Korean battery makers' shares, including in LG Chem, whose unit LG Energy Solution makes batteries for Volkswagen, and SK Innovation, fell as much as 5.8% and 5.3% respectively on Tuesday after the news. 
Electric vehicle makers, including Tesla, are using cylindrical battery cells, which resemble flashlight batteries and are relatively inexpensive and easy to manufacture.
Prismatic cells, which resemble a thin hardcover book, are housed in a rectangular metal case and are more expensive. Pouch cells, another alternative, are thinner and lighter, and resemble a flexible metal mailing envelope.
""On average, we will drive down the cost of battery systems to significantly below 100 euros ($119) per kilowatt hour,"" Schmall said. ""This will finally make e-mobility affordable and the dominant drive technology.""
The cost of battery cells used for electric vehicles has fallen to an average of $110 per kilowatt hour, Benchmark Mineral Intelligence said https://www.reuters.com/article/electric-batteries-costs-idUSL1N2II222 in December.

987,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2021 05:35PM ET</span>",Huawei CFO lawyers seek to add more evidence contesting U.S. extradition,"By Moira Warburton and Sarah Berman
VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's legal team sought to admit more evidence contesting the U.S. government's account of her fraud case in a Canadian court on Monday, promising it was the final attempt days after the judge threw out similar evidence.
Meng, 49, was arrested in December 2018 at Vancouver International Airport on a U.S. warrant for allegedly misleading HBSC about Huawei's business dealings in Iran and causing the bank to violate U.S. sanctions.
She has since been fighting the case from under house arrest in Vancouver and has said she is innocent.
After two years of legal proceedings, Meng's case now enters the final stretch leading up to a decision from Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes in British Columbia's Supreme Court on whether to extradite her, pending approval from the federal minister of justice.
On Monday defence lawyer Frank Addario argued that a sworn statement from a Huawei accountant would show that in its request to extradite Meng, the United States misrepresented the risk HSBC allegedly incurred, proving that the requesting state’s record of the case is ""demonstrably unreliable.""
Canadian prosecutor Robert Frater said the U.S. record of the case does not allege the bank actually lost money, and that the government did not need to show any financial loss occurred to prove the bank was exposed to risk.
In a ruling released on Friday Holmes threw out a similar evidence request, ruling that testimony from bank employees would be more appropriately submitted at trial, not an extradition hearing.
Beginning Wednesday, the court will hear arguments regarding allegations that Canadian and U.S. authorities committed legal missteps during Meng's initial questioning and arrest, which her lawyers say should invalidate her extradition.
Witness testimony on these allegations concluded in December 2020.
Meng's team has previously argued that the extradition should be rejected due to the alleged political interference by then-U.S. President Donald Trump in her case.
Trump told Reuters in December 2018 that he would intervene in the case if it would serve national security interests or help close a trade deal with China.
Canadian prosecutors representing the federal government assert that appropriate processes were followed. They have argued that now that Trump is no longer president his comments are moot, and that their influence is best judged by a politician, not a judge.
The case has caused a frost in relations between Ottawa and Beijing. Shortly after Meng's arrest, China detained two Canadians - Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig - on espionage charges, which Canada has called retaliation.

Hearings are scheduled to finish in May, but the potential for appeals from either side means the case could drag on for years.

(Reuters) - The head of the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Monday the agency will seek input on what companies might report about greenhouse gas emissions and other climate factors, and revisit controversial rules on proxy voting.
The steps and other actions outlined by the acting SEC chair, Allison Herren Lee, fill out some details of how the regulator will review topics taking on increasing importance for investors.
Lee said that climate and other environmental, social and governance factors are ""front and center for the SEC"" as investors have ""embraced sustainability factors and metrics as significant drivers in decision-making, capital allocation, and pricing.""
Flows into sustainable funds reached a record high of $51 billion last year as retail investors paid more attention to policy issues once seen as concerns for government, not business.
Lee and other SEC officials had already said they would review various aspects of companies' sustainability reporting, as has President Joe Biden's nominee to lead the agency, Gary Gensler, who awaits Senate approval.
On Monday, Lee said the agency will now take public comments on what sorts of climate data and metrics investors would like to see. Questions include whether the SEC should collect industry-specific data and how the SEC might build on existing voluntary ESG reporting frameworks, she said in a separate statement on the SEC's website. 
Lee also said the SEC would look at proxy voting rules including revisiting guidance from 2019 that could discourage some investment advisers from voting proxies, and will look at providing more details around its decisions on how proposals reach corporate ballots.

Shareholder proposals on climate change have drawn more support from top fund investors in recent years and prodded changes like new emissions reporting by big energy producers.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record highs on Monday, as investors eyed an economic recovery from the coronavirus and awaited cues from the Federal Reserve this week amid caution over rising borrowing costs.
In a concrete sign that the worst of the damage from the coronavirus pandemic may be over for the airline industry, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) said leisure bookings were rising.
Gains in the major indexes accelerated near the end of the trading session.
The S&P 1500 airlines index jumped over 4% to a one-year high, while other travel-related stocks, including Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) and MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) jumped between 2% and 5%.
Nine of the 11 major S&P sector indexes rose, led by utilities and real estate, each up more than 1%.
It was the Dow's sixth straight record high close in a recent surge fueled by mass vaccinations and congressional approval of a $1.9 trillion aid bill. Expectations of a recovery accelerated demand for stocks expected to outperform as the economy reopens, such as banks, energy, materials companies. 
On Monday, the Russell growth index outperformed the Russell value index in a modest reversal of investors' recent trend away from technology and other high-growth stocks.
""With the vaccine positive news and the stimulus, we think there will continue to be a fair amount of rotation out of the stay-at-home stocks,"" said Greg Bassuk, CEO of AXS Investments. ""We are bullish on financial services and energy coming out of the pandemic.""

At the end of Fed's two-day meeting on Wednesday, policymakers are expected to forecast that the U.S. economy will grow in 2021 at its fastest rate in decades while reiterating their dovish stance for the foreseeable future.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasuries ticked lower to 1.60%, below its 13-month peak of 1.64% on Friday. Wall Street has been roiled in recent weeks by a spike in longer-dated U.S. bond yields due to fears of an increase in inflation.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.53% to end at 32,953.46 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.65% to 3,968.94. 
The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.05% to 13,459.71. It remains down almost 5% from its Feb. 12 record high close.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.5 billion shares, compared with the 14.5 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rose about 2% after the company dubbed Chief Executive Elon Musk ""Technoking of Tesla"" in a formal regulatory filing.
Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co shares slumped 9.1% after a mid-stage trial testing its experimental Alzheimer's drug led to ""mixed"" results, reducing the chances for the drug's accelerated approval, according to analysts.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.78-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.35-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

""From 2Q21, the rise in DRAM prices should accelerate amid a supply shortage while NAND prices should reverse upwards (previously expected in 3Q21).""
The broader tech sector was also pushed higher by a fall in interest rates with just a day to go until the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee kicks off its two-day policy meeting.
The Fed is expected to leave rates and the pace of its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program unchanged on Wednesday, but investors will be closely watching for any clues the central bank is willing to act if rates rise at a disorderly pace.
""[T]he decision for additional action is unlikely in the coming weeks, let alone days. In other words, we do not expect any announcement of further yield curve control or an Operation Twist-style adjustment to policy at this week’s meeting,"" Stifel said in a note.

993,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2021 04:05PM ET</span>",Texas power retailer Griddy files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection,"(Reuters) - Electricity retailer Griddy Energy LLC on Monday became the third Texas power company to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy over enormous bills for electricity during last month's deep freeze.
Frigid temperatures knocked out nearly half of the state's power plants during a cold snap that killed at least 56 and upended its power market. Power prices soared by about 400 times as demand skyrocketed and generators fell offline. 
Griddy owes Texas grid operator, Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), $29 million for power, according to its filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston. The filing lists debts of up to $50 million and assets of less than $10 million. 
Among its top creditors, Griddy owes transmission line operators CenterPoint Energy (NYSE:CNP) and Oncor Electric Delivery Co about $1.2 million apiece, and electronic payments company Stripe Inc more than $1 million. 
Last month, ERCOT revoked Griddy's access to the state's grid for overdue bills and shifted its customers to other utilities. Two other power marketers, Entrust Energy Inc and Power of Texas Holdings, also had their access revoked and customers transferred by ERCOT for nonpayment.
On Friday, ERCOT said it is owed more than $3 billion by grid users that missed payment deadlines. Unpaid bills are reallocated to remaining grid users, threatening a cascade of bankruptcy, officials have said. 
ERCOT bills earlier drove  Just Energy Group  (NYSE:JE) Inc and Brazos Electric Power Cooperative Inc to seek bankruptcy protection. Brazos owned ERCOT $1.8 billion. 
Griddy said it was seeking court authority to release its former customers from their outstanding bills, blaming ERCOT for its financial woes. 
""The actions of ERCOT destroyed our business and caused financial harm to our customers,"" Griddy Chief Executive Officer Michael Fallquist said in a statement. 
ERCOT raised power prices to $9,000 per megawatt hour (MWh) and kept it at that level for five days hoping to induce more generation and battle widespread blackouts. The $9,000 per MWh compares with an average price of $22 per MWh in 2020.

Texas lawmakers and the state's market adviser have said the final 32 hours of that pricing and some fees were errors that should be corrected. On Monday, state senators passed a bill directing ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission to reduce some $5.1 billion in charges.

Investing.com -- Stocks close higher after a largely indecisive Monday. 
Energy and financials slid as European nations including Germany suspended the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine over health concerns, but airlines rallied as we're expected to return to the skies sooner rather than later thanks to the faster pace of vaccines roll outs in the U.S.. 
The Transportation Security Administration said that it screened 1.37 million people on Friday, the highest number of passengers it has seen on a single day since March 15 of last year. Chip stocks rallied as the shortage should lead to higher prices, while other tech stocks were mixed. 
The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee kicks off its two-day policy meeting this week, and is expected to leave rates and the pace of its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program unchanged. 
We'll get some retail and home insight tomorrow, among other economic indicators.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Sales Slump?
Retail sales may decline in February as a result of bad weather across large parts of the country and a lack of stimulus checks. The government support helped drive a 5.3% surge in January, which was the biggest gain in seven months. Economists are calling for a 0.3% dip when the number is reported at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. 
Consensus predicts the NAHB Housing Market Index for March will remain little changed at 83 from 84. Continued momentum in new construction and scarce inventory should offset the recent mortgage rate increases. Among other economic data on top are: business inventories, industrial production and import prices. 
Cybersecurity company Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is due to report results after the close. Its business is likely to benefit from recent high-profile hacks still in the news. It's estimated to post earnings of about 8 cents a share on $250 million in sales for the fourth quarter."
995,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2021 04:00PM ET</span>","Germany, Italy, France suspend AstraZeneca shots amid safety fears, disrupting EU vaccinations","By Thomas Escritt and Stephanie Nebehay
BERLIN/GENEVA (Reuters) - Germany, France and Italy said on Monday they would suspend AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) COVID-19 shots after several countries reported possible serious side-effects, but the World Health Organization 
(WHO) said there was no proven link and people should not panic.
Still, the decision by the European Union's three biggest countries to put inoculations with the AstraZeneca shot on hold threw the already struggling vaccination campaign in the 27-nation EU into disarray.
Denmark and Norway stopped giving the shot last week after reporting isolated cases of bleeding, blood clots and a low platelet count. Iceland and Bulgaria followed suit and Ireland and the Netherlands announced suspensions on Sunday.
Spain will stop using the vaccine for at least 15 days, Cadena Ser radio reported, citing unnamed sources. 
The top WHO scientist reiterated on Monday that there have been no documented deaths linked to COVID-19 vaccines.
""We do not want people to panic,"" Soumya Swaminathan said on a virtual media briefing, adding there has been no association, so far, pinpointed between so-called ""thromboembolic events"" reported in some countries and COVID-19 shots.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said an advisory committee meeting on AstraZeneca would be held on Tuesday. EU medicines regulator EMA will also convene this week to assess the information gathered into whether the AstraZeneca shot contributed to thromboembolic events in those inoculated.
The moves by some of Europe's largest and most populous countries will deepen concerns about the slow rollout of vaccines in the region, which has been plagued by shortages due to problems producing vaccines, including AstraZeneca's.
Germany warned last week it was facing a third wave of infections, Italy is intensifying lockdowns and hospitals in the Paris region are close to being overloaded.
German Health Minister Jens Spahn said that although the risk of blood clots was low, it could not be ruled out.
""This is a professional decision, not a political one,"" Spahn said, adding he was following a recommendation of the Paul Ehrlich Institute, Germany's vaccine regulator.
France said it was suspending the vaccine's use pending an assessment by EMA. 
""The decision taken, in conformity also with our European policy, is to suspend, out of precaution, vaccination with the AZ shot, hoping that we can resume quickly if the EMA’s guidance allows,” French President Emmanuel Macron said.
Italy said its halt was a ""precautionary and temporary measure"" pending EMA's ruling.
""The EMA will meet soon to clarify any doubts so that the AstraZeneca vaccine can be resumed safely in the vaccination campaign as soon as possible,"" said Gianni Rezza, Director General of Prevention at Italy's Ministry of Health.
Austria and Spain have stopped using particular batches and prosecutors in the northern Italian region of Piedmont earlier seized 393,600 doses following the death of a man hours after he was vaccinated. It was the second region to do so after Sicily, where two people had died shortly after having their shots.
The WHO appealed to countries not to suspend vaccinations against a disease that has caused more than 2.7 million deaths worldwide. WHO Director-General Tedros said systems were in place to protect public health.
""This does not necessarily mean these events are linked to COVID-19 vaccination, but it's routine practice to investigate them, and it shows that the surveillance system works and that effective controls are in place,"" he told the media briefing.
The United Kingdom said it had no concerns, while Poland said it thought the benefits outweighed any risks.
The EMA has said that as of March 10, a total of 30 cases of blood clotting had been reported among close to 5 million people vaccinated with the AstraZeneca shot in the European Economic Area, which links 30 European countries.
Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said the decisions by France, Germany and others looked baffling.
""The data we have suggests that numbers of adverse events related to blood clots are the same (and possibly, in fact lower) in vaccinated groups compared to unvaccinated populations,"" he said, adding that halting a vaccination programme had consequences.
""This results in delays in protecting people, and the potential for increased vaccine hesitancy, as a result of people who have seen the headlines and understandably become concerned. There are no signs yet of any data that really justify these decisions.”
A senior German infectious diseases physician, however, said the background incidence of 2-5 thromboses per million per year was significantly lower than the number of 7 out of 1.6 million vaccinated people cited by Germany's health ministry.
""This should be the reason to suspend the vaccination in Germany until all cases, including suspected cases in Germany and Europe, have been completely cleared up,"" said Clemens Wendtner, head of the special unit for highly contagious life threatening infections at the Schwabing Clinic in Munich.
'UNUSUAL' SYMPTOMS
AstraZeneca's shot was among the first and cheapest to be developed and launched at volume since the coronavirus was first identified in central China at the end of 2019, and is set to be the mainstay of vaccination programmes in much of the developing world.
Thailand announced plans on Monday to go ahead with the Anglo-Swedish firm's shot after suspending its use on Friday, but Indonesia said it would wait for the WHO to report.
The WHO said its advisory panel was reviewing reports related to the shot and would release its findings as soon as possible. But it said it was unlikely to change its recommendations, issued last month, for widespread use, including in countries where the South African variant of the virus may reduce its efficacy.
The EMA has also said there was no indication the events were caused by the vaccination and that the number of reported blood clots was no higher than seen in the general population.
But the handful of reported side-effects in Europe have upset vaccination programmes already stumbling over slow rollouts and vaccine scepticism in some countries.
The Netherlands said on Monday it had seen 10 cases of possible noteworthy adverse side-effects from the AstraZeneca shot, hours after putting its vaccination programme on hold following reports of potential side-effects in other countries.
Recent information indicates ""a very special, rarely occurring form of thrombosis, of which some cases appear to have occurred shortly after vaccination. This is of course suspicious and should be investigated,"" said Anke Huckriede, vaccinology professor at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. 
Denmark reported ""highly unusual"" symptoms in a 60-year-old citizen who died from a blood clot after receiving the vaccine, the same phrase used on Saturday by Norway about three people under the age of 50 it said were being treated in hospital.
One of the three health workers hospitalised in Norway after receiving the AstraZeneca shot had died, health authorities said on Monday, but there was no evidence the vaccine was the cause. 
AstraZeneca said earlier it had conducted a review covering more than 17 million people vaccinated in the EU and the UK which had shown no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots.

Long-awaited results from AstraZeneca's 30,000-person U.S. vaccine trial are now being reviewed by independent monitors to determine whether the shot is safe and effective, a top U.S. official said on Monday.

(Reuters) - U.S. airline executives on Monday pointed to concrete signs of a domestic leisure travel recovery as a slowing pandemic drives spring and summer bookings, pushing shares to their highest level since the coronavirus crisis hit the sector a year ago. 
""We certainly are seeing the beginning of what feels like a very large uptick,"" said American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Chief Executive Doug Parker, one of several CEOs speaking at a J.P. Morgan conference.
Ted Christie, CEO of budget carrier  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE), said the recovery appeared to ""have legs.""
Executives cited data showing that U.S. COVID-19 vaccinations are accelerating and have outstripped the number of positive cases, which are on the decline.
As of Sunday, 21% of the U.S. population had received at least one dose of a vaccine.
As a result, people are booking vacations and visits to friends and relatives, helping to slow the pace of expected revenue declines in the first quarter, though business and international travel remain depressed.
Airline shares started dropping dramatically on Feb 21, 2020, as the pandemic spread, reaching a low on May 14 and gradually increasing since then to the current high.
United Airlines expects to halt its cash burn in March, CEO Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said, the first major carrier to say it could hit the industry's milestone. In January, United said an average daily core cash burn of $19 million in the fourth quarter would likely continue in the beginning of 2021.
The positive trend in core cash burn is expected to continue after March, assuming the current bookings trajectory remains in place, Kirby said. Core cash burn excludes debt and severance payments.
Shares of United surged 9% and the Dow Jones U.S. Airlines Index (DJUSAR) climbed more than 4%. 
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is ""cautiously optimistic"" that it can halt its cash burn this spring, CEO Ed Bastian said.
Delta said it will use cash for aircraft purchases in the second quarter and expects its first-quarter revenue decline to be at the low end of its forecast for a 60% to 65% decline from the same quarter in 2019, before the onset of the pandemic.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) estimated lower cash burn in the first quarter and a lower decline in operating revenue for March than previously forecast.
JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) also forecast a slowing pace in its first-quarter revenue drop, projecting a decline of between 61% and 64%, compared with the same period in 2019. It had previously forecast a fall in revenue of 65% to 70%.
American, the most leveraged U.S. airline, said it is not looking to raise any more financing after a $10 billion debt deal last week and expects to have more than $17 billion of liquidity at the end of March.
More than 1.3 million passengers were screened in U.S. airports on Friday and Sunday, according to Transportation Security Administration data, the highest number since the pandemic crushed air travel in 2020.

""I do think we're near the end of the virtual world,"" said United's Kirby.

998,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2021 03:35PM ET</span>","Exclusive: U.S. green light for AstraZeneca vaccine could come in April, independent monitors assessing data - US official","By Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Results of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc's U.S. COVID-19 vaccine trial are being reviewed by independent monitors, and emergency authorization could come in about a month, a top U.S. official said on Monday.
The independent monitors are analyzing data from the 32,000-person U.S. study to determine whether the vaccine is safe and effective. If the results are positive and all goes well, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would review the data and issue the authorization, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), said in an interview.
Collins estimates that the FDA would need about three weeks to analyze the trial data, after which an expert advisory panel will meet and vote on whether to recommend authorization.
""We expect data from our US Phase III trial to be available soon, and we plan to file for emergency use authorization shortly thereafter,"" AstraZeneca spokeswoman Michele Meixell said in a statement.
Independent monitoring boards periodically review data during clinical trials to make sure no safety problems crop up, and can halt studies early if it determines a drug or vaccine is likely to fail or is clearly going to be a success.
The AstraZeneca vaccine, developed with the University of Oxford, has been authorized for use in the European Union and many countries based on separate trial data. U.S. regulators have been waiting for the U.S. data.
Several EU countries have halted administering the AstraZeneca vaccine after reports from Denmark and Norway of possible serious side effects, including bleeding and blood clots.
Asked about those issues, Collins said he has not personally seen the data but has been ""pretty reassured"" by statements from European regulators that the problems could be occurring by chance, and are not related to the vaccine.
With so many people being vaccinated, Collins said, some are bound to experience a blood clot around the same time they receive a vaccine.
""It's not clear at all"" that people who receive the vaccine get blood clots at an increased rate, Collins said, adding ""there may be a bit of an overreaction to something that is unrelated to the vaccine itself.""
A World Health Organization expert said on Monday he sees no association between reports of blood clots and the AstraZeneca vaccine and urged people not to panic.
Asked about the emergence of more contagious viral variants that could evade vaccine protection, Collins said studies so far suggest that currently authorized vaccines from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) will be protective.
""We do not feel that we are in a difficult situation that requires immediate action in the U.S., but we've got to watch this really closely,"" said Collins, a geneticist who has led the NIH since 2009.
COVID-19 vaccine makers have already started work on booster doses of their shots that specifically target a concerning variant first discovered in South Africa. Those would be ready by the end of 2021 or early 2022.
It will not be clear until this summer or fall whether a booster dose is necessary, Collins said.

""I really hope that doesn't happen, but I think we would be foolish not to plan for that just in case, and so planning is happening,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Texas lawmakers on Monday approved a bill to cut about $5.1 billion in disputed electricity and services fees levied on power marketers during a winter freeze that sent the state's power market into financial crisis. 
The cold snap last month spurred a power crisis that pushed up electricity costs by nearly 10 times the usual to about $47 billion. Those costs led three companies to seek bankruptcy and a sparked a battle between lawmakers and the state's power regulator over the handling of the crisis. 
The state's senate overwhelmingly approved a measure directing the Public Utility Commission chairman and state grid operator Electric Reliability Commission of Texas (ERCOT) to correct 32 hours of emergency prices and rollback service fees. If approved by the state's house of representatives, it would go to the governor's desk for his review. 
A PUC spokesman did not immediately reply to a request for comment. PUC Chairman Arthur D'Andrea rejected prior senate requests, saying he did not have the authority to act. 
Senators directed D'Andrea and ERCOT to ""follow the law"" and make requested rate and fee changes by Saturday, said state Senator Bryan Hughes. 
""Those 32 hours resulted in inaccurate and excessive charges to the tune of billions of dollars,"" Hughes said. 
ERCOT improperly held charges at $9,000 per megawatt hour, about 400 times the usual rate, and its rules allow for pricing errors to be corrected within 55 days, the state's market adviser last week testified. 

On Monday, power marketer Griddy Energy LLC became the third Texas power provider to seek protection from creditors from the storm. It owes creditors $10 million to $50 million and has assets of less than $10 million, according to a filing with U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston.

Investing.com – The AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) rollercoaster ride continues, this time with actual reason. Shares rose 25% after the movie theater chain said it is preparing to resume operations at nearly all of its 56 locations in California.
The reopening, set for Friday, is subject to the approval of local authorities, the company said in a filing. AMC has more than 525 locations through the U.S.
AMC has been a favorite of the Robinhood crowd, pushed by retail traders to a three-year high in late January as they sought to stick it to the man. Shares have since fallen about 30%.
The chain is reopening in two locations in Los Angeles today with the remaining 23 outlets in the county set to start showing films from Friday. Theaters have been largely closed over the past year because of the pandemic. But with vaccinations increasing and the $1.9 trillion stimulus hitting bank accounts this week, AMC could be among the post-pandemic winners. 
Last week, Macquarie raised the price target on AMC noting that consumers are eager to return to their local theaters, according to StreetInsider.  "

LANDOVER, Maryland (Reuters) - U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg gave an upbeat assessment about summer travel prospects on Monday as a growing number of Americans are vaccinated against COVID-19.
Touring a UPS facility just outside Washington, Buttigieg got a first-hand look at how it is shipping COVID-19 shots, while some airlines are reporting a rise in leisure bookings as more Americans get vaccinated.
""I'm looking forward to summer travel. Of course, it's got to be based on conditions. We've got to make sure that we're getting folks vaccinated,"" Buttigieg said. 
Wes Wheeler, president of Global Healthcare and Life Sciences at UPS, said the courier has delivered 80 million U.S. vaccine doses and about 110 million worldwide.
""We'll be at 100 million in the United States by the end of this month,"" Wheeler told Reuters. Between UPS and Fedex, the companies will have delivered 200 million doses in the U.S. by the end of March, he added.
Travel demand was hard hit by COVID-19 in 2020 as U.S. air travel fell 60% and the U.S. travel sector shed millions of jobs.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said last week that tens of millions of Americans who have been vaccinated for COVID-19 should not travel, a blow to the airline and travel industries that have been battered by the pandemic.
Buttigieg said people should follow CDC recommendations, but added that he hopes for a ""safe return to travel"" by July 4. 
""The process of easing restrictions, when we're ready to do that, will be a little more complicated than the process of applying them,"" Buttigieg said.
Many Americans are not heeding the CDC advice. The Transportation Security Administration said more than 1.35 million people were screened at U.S. airports Friday, the single busiest air travel day since March 2020.
Buttigieg declined to say when U.S. President Joe Biden's administration will release its infrastructure plans, but noted a Sept. 30 deadline to get surface transportation reauthorized. 
With a $1.9 trillion COVID relief package finally passed, Biden's next big spending push is on the horizon, repairing the nation's ailing bridges, roads and airports and investing billions in new projects like broadband internet.
Biden may sketch the outline of the plan in a joint address to Congress this month and provide details in April, giving lawmakers several months to work on the bill before an August recess, people familiar with the White House plans said.

""We've got a clock on everything we're doing,"" Buttigieg said.

1007,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2021 12:00PM ET</span>",A year since Black Monday 2 and a round trip for markets,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - It's a year since COVID-19 mayhem sent the S&P 500 index reeling 12% for its second-worst day ever, yet the bull market born from that selloff has in the subsequent 12 months added more than $40 trillion to the value of world stocks. 
On March 16, 2020, when the S&P 500 endured its worst one-day fall since the ""Black Monday"" of October 1987, MSCI's global equity index plunged almost 10%, only to rise back thanks to huge central bank support. 
Effects have rippled out to every market sector. Here is a look at markets that day and in the year since:
THE $65 TRILLION ROUND TRIP
As COVID-19 spread around the world between late February and the end of March 2020, triggering unprecedented lockdowns, world stocks saw their market value collapse by $21 trillion. Markets troughed on March 23, then claimed a record high five months later. 
The market capitalisation of the MSCI global index has risen $40 trillion between March 23 and now, making it a $65 trillion round-trip.
Graphic: A $65 trillion round-trip - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/bdwpkmaajpm/Pasted%20image%201615628319888.png
The new bull market has progressed in phases, however. 
During the ""hope"" period, between March and November, healthcare and technology stocks soared at the expense of financials, airlines and others hit by contracting economies and travel bans. The two sectors now comprise 42% of global equity market capitalisation compared with one-third before the pandemic hit. 
Graphic: One year since the worst market cap loss - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/xklvyrzzqpg/Pasted%20image%201615628255160.png
It led to the biggest gap in pricing since the 1990s dotcom bubble between such ""growth"" stocks and the cheaper sectors whose fortunes hinge on economic recovery. 
Graphic: Health and tech make up 42% of world stocks - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/xlbpgxooovq/Pasted%20image%201615627394733.png
But this year as COVID-19 vaccinations kicked off, value has gained ground -- tech shares are flat year-to-date, while the ""old economy"" Dow Jones index has risen 7%. 
BONDS
March 16 saw yields on 10-year Treasuries tumble. The shock came a day later as managers of multi-asset portfolios, scrabbling to make up equity losses, turned to selling their most liquid assets -- government bonds.
At one point on March 17, 10-year U.S. yields jumped over 20 basis points, followed by selloffs in British gilts and German Bunds. It was the moment that shook investors' faith in bonds as portfolio diversifiers.
The drama continued on March 18 when the premium investors demand to hold riskier 10-year Italian bonds relative to Germany spiked over 65 basis points from opening levels. Later that day, the ECB launched an emergency pandemic stimulus package. 
It was a period of intense volatility -- the average daily move between the highest and lowest price on Bund futures was 186 ticks last March, triple February levels and one of the biggest moves on record, according to Refinitiv data.
Graphic: Covid-crisis sparked extraordinary volatility in bonds - https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-MARKETS/nmovarkggpa/chart.png
The average yield on the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) multi-verse bond index meanwhile fell more than 100 bps between a peak in March and a low in August. Since then it has risen around 55 bps to its highest levels in almost a year.
DOLLAR
The $6.6 trillion-a-day currency markets saw some of the most striking moves as the U.S. dollar soared nearly 8% between March 9-20. 
Almost every other currency slumped. While emerging currencies were hit hardest -- the Mexican peso plunged 18% -- even perceived havens such as the yen and Swiss franc plunged 6% to 8% as dollar shortages rippled across global money markets.
The dollar's fortunes turned on March 19 as Fed action eased the shortages and eliminated the dollar's interest rate advantage. By the end of the year, it had fallen 13% from the March peaks.

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2021 11:20AM ET</span>","GM builds pickups without certain modules due to global chip shortage, hurting fuel economy","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said on Monday that due to the global semiconductor chip shortage the U.S. automaker is building certain 2021 light-duty full-size pickup trucks without a fuel management module, hurting those vehicles' fuel economy performance.
The lack of the active fuel management/dynamic fuel management module means affected models, equipped with the 5.3-liter EcoTec3 V8 engine with both six-speed and eight-speed automatic transmission, will have lower fuel economy by one mile per gallon, spokeswoman Michelle Malcho said.
Malcho emphasized all trucks are still being built, something GM has repeatedly stressed it would try to protect as pickups are among GM's most profitable models. She declined to say the volume of vehicles affected.
""By taking this measure, we are better able to meet the strong customer and dealer demand for our full-size trucks as the industry continues to rebound and strengthen,"" Malcho wrote in an email.
The change runs through the 2021 model year, which typically ends in late summer or early fall, she said.
Malcho said it would not have a major impact on the Detroit automaker's U.S. corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) numbers.
""We routinely monitor our fleet for compliance in the U.S. and Canada, and we balance our portfolio in a way that enables us to manage unforeseeable circumstances like this without compromising our overall (greenhouse gas) and fuel economy compliance,"" she said.
GM's fleetwide fuel economy in the 2018 model year was 22.5 miles per gallon and was projected to rise to 22.8 mpg for 2019, according to a report by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
To meet federal CAFE requirements, automakers like GM often use credits from either earlier years where they faced less stringent rules and performed better than the requirements or buy credits from other automakers.
GM said last month the chip shortage could shave up to $2 billion from this year's earnings. It subsequently said it expected global chip supplies to return to normal rates by the second half of the year.
GM's U.S. rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co previously said the shortage could hurt 2021 profits by up to $2.5 billion and said it had curtailed production of its flagship F-150 pickup.
The shortage, which has hit automakers globally, stems from a confluence of factors as carmakers, which shut plants for two months during the COVID-19 pandemic last year, compete with the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip supplies.
Also on Monday, BMW Chief Technology Officer Frank Weber said things will be tough in the short term.
""We hope that this situation is going to improve as we get closer to summer,"" he told reporters. ""But April and May we expect will be very tough. Predictions, I cannot make because really we are working from week to week. So far we have been very successful and we have not lost a single day in production.” 

GM shares were down 2% in midday trading.

GENEVA/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The World Health Organization appealed to countries on Monday not to pause vaccination campaigns after two more European nations and one in Asia joined a handful which have suspended use of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine over safety fears.
Thailand announced plans on Monday to go ahead with the Anglo-Swedish firm's shot but Indonesia said it would wait after Ireland and the Netherlands announced suspensions on Sunday.
Denmark and Norway have reported isolated cases of bleeding, blood clots and a low platelet count after the AstraZeneca vaccine. Iceland and Bulgaria had earlier suspended its use while Austria and Italy have stopped using particular batches.
France, Germany and the United Kingdom say they have no concerns.
The WHO said its advisory panel was reviewing reports related to the shot and would release its findings as soon as possible. But it said it was unlikely to change its recommendations, issued last month, for widespread use, including in countries where the South African variant of the virus may reduce its efficacy.
""As of today, there is no evidence that the incidents are caused by the vaccine and it is important that vaccination campaigns continue so that we can save lives and stem severe disease from the virus,"" WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said.
AstraZeneca's shot was among the first and cheapest to be developed and launched at volume since the coronavirus was first identified in central China at the end of 2019 and is set to be the mainstay of vaccination programmes in much of the developing world. The virus has killed more than 2.7 million people.
Thailand became the first country outside Europe to delay rolling out the vaccine on Friday, when its political leaders were due to have the first shots, but the government said on Monday they would receive the AstraZeneca vaccine on Tuesday.
Indonesia, however, said it would delay administering the shot due to the reports of blood clots among some recipients in Europe and would await a review from the WHO.
The WHO had already said there was no indication the events were caused by the vaccination, a view also expressed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which said the number of reported blood clots was no higher than seen in the general population.
The handful of reported side-effects in Europe have upset vaccination programmes already under pressure over slow rollouts and vaccine scepticism in some countries.
The Netherlands said on Monday it had seen 10 cases of possible noteworthy adverse side-effects from the AstraZeneca vaccine, hours after the government put its vaccination programme on hold following reports of potential side-effects in other countries.
Denmark reported ""highly unusual"" symptoms in a 60-year-old citizen who died from a blood clot after receiving the vaccine, the same phrase used on Saturday by Norway about three people under the age of 50 it said were being treated in hospital.
""It was an unusual course of illness around the death that made the Danish Medicines Agency react,"" the agency said in a statement late on Sunday.
AstraZeneca Plc said earlier it had conducted a review covering more than 17 million people vaccinated in the European Union and the UK which had shown no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots.
POLITICAL ROW
In Germany, the question marks over the vaccine caused a political row, with the leader of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), Markus Soeder, saying the country needed clear guidance from its own experts.
Noting that some other EU countries had stopped using the vaccine, Soeder told a news conference: ""That's why there has to be an extra clear statement in Germany: is the vaccine good or bad?""
The health ministry said the country was continuing to use the vaccine according to EMA guidelines.
The reports of potential safety risks are taken seriously and data is examined constantly, a ministry spokesman told Reuters. Further proceedings would be discussed with the European and the national vaccine regulators this week, he said.
Investigations into potential side-effects are complicated as the history of each case and circumstances surrounding a death or illness are examined. The Austrian authorities have said their review of the AstraZeneca batch will take about two weeks.
The EMA has said that as of March 10, a total of 30 cases of blood clotting had been reported among close to 5 million people vaccinated with the AstraZeneca shot in the European Economic Area, which links 30 European countries.

The WHO said that as of March 12, more than 300 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines had been administered around the world with no cases of death found to have been caused by any of them.

The ministry said the decision followed a recommendation from the Paul Ehrlich Institute, Germany's authority in charge of vaccines.
""Following a recommendation from the Paul Ehrlich Institute, the government is, out of caution, halting the administration of the AstraZeneca vaccine,"" the ministry said in a statement, adding that Health Minister Jens Spahn would provide further details at a news conference at 4 pm local time (1500 GMT).
Several EU countries have called a halt to the AstraZeneca vaccine after reports from Denmark and Norway of possible serious side-effects, including bleeding and blood clots.
Last week, Lothar Wieler, head of Germany's Robert Koch Institute for Infectious Diseases, said there was no evidence that patients who received the vaccine were more likely than patients of a similar age group to suffer blood conditions.

Many millions of people in Britain have so far received the British-Swedish pharma company's vaccine.

(Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc on Monday released a new data center chip aimed at taking away more market share from rival  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC).
The company's ""Milan"" data center processor is faster than Intel's current best data center chips, the company said. Santa Clara, California-based AMD designs the chip but taps Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd to fabricate the chip using TSMC's 7-nanometer chipmaking process.
The use of an outside manufacturing partner has helped AMD capitalize on problems at Intel, which has a different strategy of internally making its own chips and has struggled with delays in its most recent generation of factory technology. The ""Milan"" chip and its predecessor have both outperformed Intel's chips, helping AMD gain market share and land customers such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google.
Intel, however, plans to hit back. Analysts expect it to launch its newest ""Ice Lake"" server chip in the coming weeks, which will be the first one made on Intel's 10-nanometer manufacturing technology that is the performance equivalent of TSMC's 7-nanometer technology used for AMD's ""Milan"" chip.
Regardless of how the two chips stack up in terms of speed once both have been released, AMD is still expected to have some advantages, such as a higher number of computing cores on each chip, which lets the chip juggle more software applications at a time.
Dan McNamara, senior vice president and general manager of AMD's server business unit, said he believes the company can hang on to its lead if it continues to integrate feedback from customers into each new generation of chip.

""We're on our third generation of what we believe is a very solid value proposition and leading CPU for the data center. If we continue that cadence of execution, we think we'll stay competitive,"" he said during a press briefing.

The donation is valued at $1.36 billion, calculated at Coupang's current share price of $51.4.
Ackman, who took home an estimated $1.4 billion last year after having delivered a 70.2% return, has previously supported a scholarship charity and other causes through his foundation.
Coupang, backed by SoftBank Group Corp, was valued at around $109 billion in its market debut on Thursday after it raised around $4.6 billion in the biggest U.S. initial public offering this year.
SoftBank also racked up a roughly $33 billion gain on paper through the public market debut of Coupang.
Founded in 2010 by Korean-American billionaire Bom Suk Kim, Coupang rose to prominence after launching its guaranteed same-day or next-day delivery service in the East Asian country.
""I was a very fortunate day one investor in @Coupang. As a result of its incredible success, 26.5m shares of its stock will benefit humanity as I gave all of the shares to @PershingSqFdn, a DAF, and another non-profit!,"" Ackman tweeted.
The billionaire investor has occasionally taken to Twitter, sending a message when he wants to get the word out to his 288,000 followers. But sometimes they are cryptic one-word answers like ""yes"" or ""done"" when he's asked something about his plans.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc on Monday urged the rejection of shareholder proposals that annual reports be produced about its efforts to address climate change and promote diversity and inclusion.
The proposals were disclosed in Berkshire's annual proxy filing, ahead of the Omaha, Nebraska-based company's scheduled May 1 annual meeting.
Berkshire also said Buffett's compensation in 2020 totaled $380,328, comprising his usual $100,000 salary plus $280,328 for personal and home security.
Though Buffett's salary is low for a chief executive of a major company, his 16.2% stake in Berkshire was worth about $98.2 billion as of Friday.
Vice Chairmen Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, who respectively oversee Berkshire's non-insurance and insurance operations and whose pay Buffett sets, were each awarded $19 million, unchanged from 2019.
Berkshire's dozens of operating businesses include the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy and Geico car insurer, and the smaller Brooks running shoes and Fruit of the Loom clothing.
Citing its decentralized model, Berkshire said the climate proposal from the California Public Employees' Retirement System, Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI) and Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec was unnecessary, and that many businesses' climate decisions already made ""great sense"" for the environment.
The company also cited its business model and Buffett's record of ""opposing efforts, seen or unseen, to suppress diversity or religious inclusion"" in opposing the proposal on diversity from As You Sow, a nonprofit shareholder advocate.
Berkshire said its businesses ""represent dissimilar industries"" operating around the world, and it was ""unreasonable to ask for uniform, quantitative reporting"" to compare them.
Buffett controls 32.1% of Berkshire's voting power, and shareholder proposals he opposes normally fail by big margins.

Berkshire's annual meeting will be in Los Angeles, allowing Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 97, a Californian, to join Buffett in person to answer 3-1/2 hours of shareholder questions.

The NASDAQ Composite was down 0.1%, again underperforming, as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock slipped 1% in response to a tongue-in-cheek filing adding the title of ""TechnoKing"" to CEO Elon Musk and ""Master of Coin"" to his chief financial officer. The move seemed a reaction to Bitcoin - on which Tesla had made a $1.5 billion bet - hitting new highs over the weekend. 
Over the weekend, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen – a former chair of the Federal Reserve – had said she sees any inflationary risks arising from the $1.9 trillion stimulus package as “small” and “manageable”.
However, with $1,400 stimulus checks starting to arrive at U.S. households over the weekend, the prospect of some more asset price inflation in the stock market seems realistic.
Reopening trades continued to be in vogue, after Michigan said it would aim to make all adults eligible for vaccination against Covid-19 by early May, another advance of the timetable as regards bringing herd immunity to the U.S. AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock rose 17% in a literal reopening trade, after it said nearly all of its California movie theaters will reopen this week.
Infection rates in the U.S. have fallen to their lowest since late October, as have the numbers of those in hospital with the coronavirus. President Joe Biden has said he is aiming for a return to normal life by early July. That timetable contrasts increasingly sharply with Europe's, where a new wave of Covid-19 variants is taking hold, threatening to push back reopening even further. The U.S.'s strong relative growth outlook has pushed the dollar higher, along with U.S. bond yields. Banking stocks have been among the chief beneficiaries, and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) stock both hit their highest in over a year in early trading. 
Elsewhere, GenMark Diagnostics  (NASDAQ:GNMK) stock rose 29% and Roche (OTC:RHHBY) ADRs rose 1.3% after the Swiss giant agreed to buy the U.S. molecular diagnostics specialist for $1.6 billion. 
Flutter Entertainment ADRs (OTC:PDYPY) also rose 2.2% to a new all-time high after the London-based company said it is looking at spinning off its FanDuel unit, a nod to the stellar performance of rival DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) since it went public."

Investing.com – Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) shares were trading weaker by 7% in premarket Monday after the company released disappointing data on a candidate drug for treating Alzheimer’s disease.
The share had closed 1.4% up Friday, giving the company a market cap of $199.43 billion.  
The company said the findings from a stage 2 trial revealed the drug helped in slowing decline among people with early symptomatic forms of the disease. However, the results weren't markedly better than for an earlier candidate drug, Solanezumab. 
The company will provide more updates on its ‘TRAILBLAZER’ clinical trial program today."

BOSTON (Reuters) - Financial services firm  Blucora  (NASDAQ:BCOR) Inc is urging shareholders to back its board and block a dissident investor's effort to seat four directors, arguing it has already made key changes that are bearing fruit and that the outsider's plans are ""deeply flawed.""
""Blucora is on the right path to creating long-term value for all stockholders,"" the Dallas-based company's board wrote to shareholders asking them to vote for all of its director candidates instead of the four that activist investor Ancora Holdings Inc proposed. Reuters saw a copy of the letter.
Blucora's directors wrote that they replaced the chief executive and chief financial officers early last year amid concerns about performance, positioned the company's two tax-focused businesses for long-term growth, added four new independent directors in 2020 and 2021, and continued to review alternatives to how the business is currently set up.
In the six months to March 12, Blucora's stock price climbed 73%. Over the past 12 months, the stock price, which gained 52%, bested the index and sector rivals.
""We believe Ancora's proposed path is deeply flawed and would destroy shareholder value,"" the letter said.
A representative for Ancora, which invests $8 billion, was not immediately available for comment.
Two weeks ago, Ancora, which owns a 3% stake in Blucora, a company valued at $837 million, nominated four directors to the board and called on it to consider selling its tax services business. Ancora argued there were few synergies between Blucora's wealth management and registered advisory business, Avantax, and its TaxAct unit.
Blucora said that now was not the right time to sell TaxAct after the pandemic affected last year's tax season and may have an impact on this year's as well.
The company added its board candidates were more experienced than Ancora's nominees, where only the firm's chief executive officer, Frederick DiSanto, has public company experience.

Southwest also forecast lower cash burn in the first quarter on Monday and said operating revenue for March and April was expected to improve as a rise in leisure bookings countered a lag in business travel.
The U.S. airline expects average core cash burn to be about $14 million per day in the first quarter, compared with its previous forecast of about $15 million. 
""The company has continued to experience an improvement in leisure passenger bookings with beach and other nature-inspired destinations continuing to outperform other regions,"" Southwest said in a statement. 
Southwest had cash and short-term investments of about $14.4 billion as of March 11.
JetBlue also forecast a slowing pace in its first-quarter revenue drop, projecting a decline of between 61% and 64%, compared with the same period in 2019. It had previously forecast a 65% to 70% fall in revenue.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) plans to gradually switch the type of battery used in its electric vehicles, three sources with knowledge of the matter said on Monday, moving away from the technology supplied under current deals with South Korea's LG Energy Solution and SK Innovation.
Volkswagen plans to use the prismatic type of battery, increasingly turning to supplies from China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL), South Korea's Money Today online news site reported earlier on Monday, citing unnamed South Korean battery industry sources. 
The German carmaker declined to comment. Volkswagen plans to announce its battery procurement plans at its Power Day event on Monday, Money Today reported. 
South Korea's LG Energy Solution and SK Innovation have been manufacturing pouch-type batteries for Volkswagen, while CATL and Samsung (KS:005930) SDI have supplied it with prismatic ones.
LG Energy Solution, a unit of LG Chem, said it does not comment on market speculation, while SK Innovation declined to comment. 
""It really depends on how fast Volkswagen manages to switch to prismatic type batteries. Currently, there are not enough prismatic battery supplies, and it would take quite a while for Volkswagen to fully adopt them,"" sand Han Sang-won, an analyst at Daishin Securities.
""One of the reasons that Volkswagen has chosen to switch could be to enhance electric vehicles' safety, as prismatic batteries are generally considered to have lower energy density than pouch-type batteries, making them relatively safer,"" Han added. 
Among three types of batteries - prismatic, pouch and cylindrical - prismatic batteries had 49% share in the EV battery market in 2020, while pouch-type batteries had 28%, according to industry tracker SNE Research.

The plan comes at a time that LG Energy Solution and SK Innovation are locked in a legal battle in the United States over allegations of misappropriation of trade secrets related to EV battery technology.

Investing.com – GenMark (NASDAQ:GNMK) shares were up 29% in premarket trading Monday on Roche's (OTC:RHHBY) announcement it will buy the maker of molecular diagnostic tests in a $1.8 billion deal. The covid-19 pandemic has created a demand for tests that can quickly diagnose a disease.
Roche will launch a tender to fully acquire GenMark at $24.05 per share in an all-cash deal. That represents a premium of 43% on GenMark’s undisturbed share price on Feb. 10, before media speculation about a deal began.
GenMark’s molecular diagnostic tests are designed to detect multiple pathogens from a single patient sample. The deal will add to Roche’s portfolio a provider of fast tests for infectious diseases.
The acquisition, approved by boards of both the companies, is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2021, the Swiss drug-maker said.
GenMark's principal operations will continue to be at Carlsbad, California, Roche said."

Investing.com – Shares of airline companies were healthy gainers in Monday’s premarket trading as traders stepped up bets on economic reopening.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) was up over 4%, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) 3% and Delta (NYSE:DAL) over 2%, after reports that Friday's passenger figures for U.S. flights were the highest since March last year. Airlines have been cautious in bringing back capacity so far, but may be tempted to quicken the pace of ramping up if a broadening vaccination campaign restores consumer confidence.
The impending arrival of checks from the latest $1.9 trillion stimulus being given by the Biden administration is also creating a favorable liquidity backdrop, both for flight tickets and for stocks.
Airline stocks have been among the hardest hit by the worldwide lockdowns that shut most parts of the economy and forced people to sit home. American Airlines however mapped out a path to future profitability last week as it sold records amount of debt to repay government aid. "

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Monday, continuing last week’s rally as investors await Wednesday's highly anticipated Federal Reserve meeting.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 105 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 futures traded 6 points, or 0.2%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 25 points, or 0.2%.
Equity markets rose strongly last week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 4%, its best weekly performance since November last year, S&P 500 gaining 2.6% and the Nasdaq Composite gaining 3%. 
Helping the mood has been the expectation of healthy growth going forward, buoyed by extraordinary monetary and fiscal stimulus, particularly after President Joe Biden signed his massive $1.9 trillion Covid relief package into law late last week.
A fly in the ointment has been the recent jump in bond yields on rising inflationary concerns, which has challenged growth stocks in recent weeks to the benefit of the more cyclical sectors.
The yield of the U.S. 10-year Treasury hit its highest level in more than a year on Friday, trading above 1.64%. It currently trades at 1.61%.
This brings this week’s Federal Reserve two-day meeting, its second of the year, firmly into focus. The central bank is not expected to take action on interest rates, but investors will be watching closely for changes to its economic projections as well as any commentary regarding the selloff in the Treasury markets.
Meanwhile the U.S. vaccination program continues to gather pace, with President Biden stating last week the country will have enough vaccines for every adult by the end of May, two months earlier than previously expected.
This points towards a relative early reopening of the economy, with some states such as Texas already lifting mask-wearing and other restrictions. Air traffic data registered more passengers passing through U.S. airports on Friday than any day since March last year.
The news in Europe has been less encouraging, with Covid-19 cases rising again and Italy planning a third national lockdown over the Easter holiday.
In corporate news, GenMark (NASDAQ:GNMK) will be in the spotlight after Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche (SIX:RO) announced it will buy the U.S.-based maker of molecular diagnostic tests in a $1.8 billion deal.
Oil prices climbed Monday, with the international benchmark Brent heading towards $70 a barrel on signs of strong Chinese economic growth, pointing to more demand from the world’s largest importer of oil.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $65.72 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $69.31, not far removed from the 13-month high seen last week.

(Reuters) - European stocks rose on Monday, helped by gains in French food company Danone and betting firm Flutter Entertainment, with optimism about a strong economic rebound calming concerns about quickening inflation. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.6%, inching closer to a record peak set last year, with travel and leisure, automakers and food & beverage sectors among the top gainers.
Danone jumped 4.9% after the company's board ousted chairman and chief executive Emmanuel Faber due to growing pressure from shareholders. Its stock was on course to post its biggest percentage gain in more than four months.
Flutter gained 6.4% to the top of UK's FTSE 100 index after the betting group said it was considering listing a small shareholding of its U.S. FanDuel business.
The STOXX 600 index is less than 2% away from its all-time high, but trading has been volatile on worries that a rise in inflation could pressure central banks to put a lid on easy money, which is vital for economic recovery.
Rising bond yields have weighed on highly valued growth sectors such as technology, while driving gains in economically sensitive pockets in the market, like banks, energy and automakers.
""There's some big rotation going on, and what we're seeing is really a lot of churn with regards to growth and value,"" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com.
""The DAX's record high or STOXX 600's record high, just seems like value parts of the market maybe being under-appreciated.""

PARIS (Reuters) - Danone said on Monday that Emmanuel Faber would step down as chairman and CEO, ejected by the group's board after the Activia yoghurt maker faced growing calls from some shareholders to replace him. 
Faber, an advocate for environmental matters and a more sustainable way of doing business, had come under pressure as sales and margin growth underperformed some rivals in recent years. 
Danone said Faber would be replaced immediately by recently appointed director Gilles Schnepp in the seat of non-executive chairman, while Veronique Penchienati-Bosetta, Chief Executive Officer International, would work with Shane Grant, CEO for North America, as CEO and deputy CEO on an interim basis. 
Shares in the French food group jumped in early trading, and were up 4.2% by 0905 GMT following news of Faber's departure. 
""The immediate priority of the new chairman, together with the board, will be to lead the transition, including the search for a new CEO,"" the group said in a statement, adding that it had appointed an international search agency to support the process.
Faber, who became CEO in 2014 and later took on the chairmanship, had led a push into healthy foods, including through the 2016 acquisition of WhiteWave.
But problems at the world's largest yoghurt-maker, which also makes Evian bottled water, were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which hit sales to the restaurant sector for example.
Danone's third-largest stakeholder Artisan Partners (NYSE:APAM) and activist investor Bluebell Capital have called for Faber to leave, publicly championing Schnepp - a former CEO of electrical firm Legrand named to Danone's board in December - who they said would be a truly independent chairman. 
To try and appease critics, Faber said in early March he would relinquish his role as CEO but stay on as chairman. 
""Gilles Schnepp has shown great leadership in getting the board to take the right decisions,"" Francesco Trapani, Chairman of Bluebell Capital partners, said in a statement. 
""We are fully supportive of him in his next key task to recruit a high calibre CEO able to combine shareholder value creation and Danone's commitments to ESG (environmental, social and governance).""

Recent management changes implemented by Faber and an organisational overhaul had caused divisions among board members, people close to the matter have previously said.

MILAN/TOKYO (Reuters) - World shares inched higher while U.S. bond yields hovered near a 13-month peak on Monday on bets economic growth would accelerate even though investors became wary of the Federal Reserve and other key central bank meetings in the days ahead.
The $1.9 trillion stimulus bill President Joe Biden signed into law last week and the rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations stoked a bullish mood, but the focus was gradually turning to the outlook for monetary policy.
""The Federal Reserve is expected to rigidly stick to its easing plans, despite (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell & Co likely becoming significantly more upbeat on the outlook,"" said AFS analyst Arne Petimezas in Amsterdam.
""However, the risks are towards a hawkish surprise. The $1.9 trillion stimulus has been adopted without much ado and the Biden administration has now set its sight on a big figure infrastructure bill,"" he added.
European shares rose 0.7% in morning trading following gains in Japan .N225, while S&P 500 futures ESc1 rose 0.2%, just below a record high level touched last week.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was up 0.1% by 0847 GMT.
Mainland Chinese shares, however, dropped despite data showing a quickening in industrial output and a rise in retail sales, with bluechip CSI 300 index falling 2.2% on policy tightening worries. 
Surveillance equipment maker Hikvision 002415.SZ lost 3.2% after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission designated the firm, along with four others Chinese companies including Huawei, as posing a threat to national security. 
The U.S. House of Representatives gave final approval last week to the COVID-19 relief bill, giving Biden his first major victory in office. 
""This will provide another shot in the arm for a U.S. economy sprinting out of a deep hole (10 million jobs are still missing at present),"" said Natixis economist Troy Ludtka in New York.
""We see the macro backdrop - stimulus included - as being sufficient to jolt the U.S. economy beyond the 6% growth mark,"" he added in a note.
Investors also suspect the $1.9 trillion package, which amounts to more than 8% of the country's GDP, could stoke inflation - to the detriment of bonds, especially when their yields are so low.
Rising inflation expectations could prompt the Federal Reserve to signal it will start raising rates sooner when it announces its latest economic projections at the end of Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday.
""Following the fiscal stimulus packages it is inevitable that Fed GDP forecasts will be revised up, and some FOMC members might think rates will have to move higher sooner than they anticipated last December,"" wrote economists at ANZ.

Earlier Monday, data showed economic activity in China soared at the start of the new year as the world’s second largest economy recovered from the ravages of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Investors are also expecting strong growth figures out of the U.S. in the months to come, particularly after President Joe Biden signed the $1.9 trillion stimulus package into law last week and with the rollout of Covid-19 vaccinations proceeding at pace.
This positive tone has filtered through to Europe, with travel and leisure, automakers and food & beverage sectors among the top gainers.

1033,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 15, 2021 03:09AM ET</span>","Global Value Rotation Trade Still Has 20% Upside, Citi Team Says","(Bloomberg) -- The global rotation trade into value shares out of growth stocks has about another 20% upside, according to strategists at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).
The outperformance of cheaper stocks over their high-priced peers has closely tracked the rise in 10-year U.S. inflation-protected yields out of deeply negative territory, as investors bet on a strengthening global economy, wrote a team including Robert Buckland on Friday.
A continued move toward zero percent in that real yield benchmark would imply further relative upside for the world’s value shares of 15 to 20 percentage points, they calculated.
The MSCI AC World Value Index already outperformed its growth counterpart by 14 percentage points since the end of October, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Over the same period, the 10-year real yield has risen to minus 0.65% from minus 0.83%.
Negative real rates had been seen as a cornerstone of the growth share rally of recent years, partly because they enable investors to justify higher valuations for them. While the rise in real yields is a signal the U.S. economy is gaining traction -- a positive for investors -- this has triggered a rotation into cheaper cyclical shares, which are seen as more closely exposed to the economic recovery.
The global value gauge is dominated by shares from the financials, health care and industrials sectors, according to MSCI.
The value rotation will likely be capped by the 10-year real yield reaching 0%, a level where the Federal Reserve will likely step in to prevent Treasuries from selling off further, according to Citi.
Rotation Reversal
There are two scenarios which could reverse this trend, the first of which is a failure of the global economy to recover, the strategists suggested. The second: further central bank intervention, perhaps to stabilize disorderly bond markets, could also send real yields back down toward the minus 1% level, the strategists said.
“Value investors should enjoy this rotation while it lasts, but central bank obligations to finance extravagant fiscal policy mean that there is a natural cap on real yields,” the team wrote.

1034,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 15, 2021 03:02AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Mixed; Covid Worries Resurface,"By Peter Nurse
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening in a mixed fashion Monday, as investors digest conflicting signals of strong Chinese growth and fresh Covid-19 worries ahead of a key Federal Reserve meeting.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, while CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.3% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%.
Earlier Monday, data showed economic activity in China soared at the start of the new year as the world’s second largest economy recovered from the ravages of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Industrial production grew 35.1% year-on-year in February and retail sales climbed 33.8% year-on-year in February, although the unemployment rate was at 5.5%, higher than the previously recorded 5.2%.
Investors are also expecting strong growth figures out of the U.S. in the months to come, particularly after President Joe Biden signed the $1.9 trillion stimulus package into law last week and with the rollout of Covid-19 vaccinations proceeding at pace.
However, the mood in Europe is more circumspect. On Friday, the head of Germany’s public health agency warned that a third wave of coronavirus infections has begun, while Italy is set to impose another national lockdown over the Easter weekend.
Additionally, a number of European countries, with Ireland becoming the latest, have suspended the use of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine after reports of serious blood clotting in recipients.
Although both the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organisation have dismissed the concerns, this suspension will undoubtedly add to the delays in rolling out vaccines within the European Union.
The Federal Reserve meets this week, and investors are starting to fret that rising inflation expectations could prompt the U.S. central bank to signal it will start raising rates sooner than originally envisaged.
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood at 1.635%, having risen to as high as 1.642% on Friday, a high last seen in February last year.
The Bank of England and the Bank of Japan also hold rate-setting meetings this week, but the main focus will be on the Fed.
In corporate news, Roche (SIX:RO) will be in the spotlight after the Swiss pharmaceutical giant announced Monday plans to buy GenMarkDiagnostics, a U.S.-based maker of molecular diagnostic tests, in a $1.8 billion deal.
Oil prices climbed Monday, with the international benchmark Brent heading towards $70 a barrel on signs of strong Chinese economic growth, pointing to more demand from the world’s largest importer of oil.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $65.99 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.5% to $69.57, not far removed from the 13-month high seen last week.  
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,723.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1932.

Roche said it will launch a tender offer to fully acquire GenMark at a price of $24.05 per share in an all-cash transaction. The price represented a premium of 43% on GenMark's closing share price on Feb. 10, before media speculation about a deal, Roche said.
California-based GenMark provides molecular diagnostic tests that are designed to detect multiple pathogens from a single patient sample.
""Acquiring GenMark Diagnostics will broaden our molecular diagnostics portfolio to include solutions that can provide lifesaving information quickly to patients and their healthcare providers in the fight against infectious diseases,"" Roche Chief Executive Officer Thomas Schinecker said in a statement.
Roche said the acquisition, which has been approved by the boards of both companies, is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2021. 

Upon deal completion, GenMark's principal operations will continue at the current location in Carlsbad, California, Roche said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed Monday morning. Benchmark Treasuries steadied ahead of a slew of central bank policy decisions in the week ahead, including the U.S. Federal Reserve.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.56% by 11:12 PM ET (3:12 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component Equal Weighted slid 1.70%. Data released earlier in the day said that industrial production grew 35.1% year-on-year in February, above the 30% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the previously recorded 7.3% growth. Retail sales also soared 33.8% year-on-year, against the predicted 32% growth and the previously recorded 4.6% growth.
The unemployment rate was at 5.5%, higher than the previously recorded 5.2%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.43%, even as the city continues to grapple with a fresh COVID-19 outbreak linked to a gym in Sai Ying Pun.  Xiaomi  (OTC:XIACF) Corp.'s (HK:1810) Hong Kong shares surged almost 10% after the U.S. temporarily lifted its ban on the company, while Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.'s (HK:0700) Hong Kong shares saw losses as the company potentially faces increased regulatory supervision.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.26%, while South Korea’s KOSPI edged down 0.13%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.15%.
Ten-year Treasury yields remained around one-year highs as a $1.9 trillion stimulus package was signed into law in the U.S. on Friday and the global COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, with increasing hopes for an economic recovery from COVID-19 keeping inflation risk in the spotlight. Australian and New Zealand ten-year rates also rose on Monday.
Fed Charman Jerome Powell will likely reaffirm his no-tightening policy stance when the central bank hands down its policy decision on Wednesday. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen added that U.S. inflation risks remain subdued despite the Biden administration stimulus. A strong recovery from the COVID-19 recession is reportedly likely to prompt Powell and his colleagues to lift interest rates in 2023, but this increase is not expected to be reflected in their forecasts this week.
“Despite elevated valuations across both equities and credit, it’s very hard not to be positive on risk assets in this environment … yet the change of pace in markets last week maybe also suggests a lot is priced already,” JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management global multi-asset strategist Patrik Schowitz said in a note.
The Fed decision is one of a few due from central banks globally over the course of the week. The Bank of England is widely expected to leave monetary policy unchanged when it hands down its policy decision on Thursday. In Asia, the Bank of Japan hands down its decision on Friday.
On the COVID-19 front, rising concerns about the reported side effects from the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) PLC and the University of Oxford led several countries, including Ireland and the Netherlands, to suspend its use. Elsewhere in Europe, Italy will re-enter lockdown from Monday to curb a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.

Singapore-based Effissimo, which is Toshiba's largest shareholder with a 9.9% stake, is calling for an independent investigation into allegations that shareholders were pressured about how to vote on director nominations ahead of last year's annual general meeting. 
CalPERS and NBIM, the largest U.S. public pension fund and the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, respectively, voted in favour of the independent probe ahead of an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on March 18.

Officials at the company were not immediately available for comment.
Griddy sold power to customers at market rates. When power prices spiked to $9,000 per megawatt hour (MWh) and remained at that lofty level for days during the extreme cold in February, some customers received monthly bills of over $10,000.
That compares with an average price for power of $22 per MWh in 2020 in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates the state's power grid.
""ERCOT took our members and have effectively shut down Griddy,"" the company told customers on its website after ERCOT transferred Griddy's roughly 10,000 customers to others.
In addition to losing its customers, the Texas attorney general is suing Griddy, saying it engaged in deceptive trade practices by issuing excessive bills.
Griddy has said that it urged customers to switch to other providers with a fixed rate before the worst of the storm hit in February.
High gas and power bills from the Texas freeze have already forced two other firms to seek bankruptcy protection -  Just Energy Group  (NYSE:JE) Inc and Brazos Electric Power Cooperative Inc.

The announcement comes as a swathe of companies have vowed in recent times to promote the use of clean, renewable energy, while investors increasingly clamour for accountability to ensure firms disclose, track and meet emissions targets.
The world's fourth-largest iron ore miner said it will incorporate carbon emission targets into its formal remuneration structure, including short and long-term incentives across the company.
Fortescue said it will focus more on green energy and that its unit Fortescue Future Industries will develop green electricity, green hydrogen and green ammonia projects in Australia.
Green hydrogen is a zero-carbon fuel made by electrolysis, using renewable power from wind and solar to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. It is increasingly being touted as a way to decarbonise emissions-intensive heavy industry and transport sectors.

1042,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2021 07:20PM ET</span>",Analysis: A sobering strategy for pandemic times - Japan brewers bank on alcohol-free beer boom,"By Ritsuko Ando
TOKYO (Reuters), - His social life severely curtailed by the coronavirus pandemic, Tadasu Masuda found himself embracing the opportunity to take what in Japan are known as ""liver rest days"" and try out a range of alcohol-free beer brands.
They tasted much better than he expected, and while Masuda is not giving up on regular beer, he's now committed to the occasional break.
""I want to keep drinking these and make sure my liver gets days off,"" said the civil servant who lives in Kobe, western Japan, adding that he has become more health conscious since recently entering middle age.
The pandemic is propelling an unexpected boom in alcohol-free beer that has Asahi Group Holdings forecasting a 20% jump in revenue for non and low alcoholic beer this year after flat sales in 2020. Asahi is also debuting a new ""Beery"" label and has plans to expand its line-up.
Main rival Kirin Holdings, which had a head start in the category, expects its sales volumes in the segment to jump 23% this year after a 10% rise in 2020 and recently revamped one of its main non-alcoholic beers. 
Increased time at home, according to industry executives, has freed Japanese drinkers from social norms where beers with workmates often see a round of the same lager ordered for everyone - a change that has also helped lift sales of spirits and high-proof cocktails.
Non-alcohol beer has also had other factors working for it, including constant reminders on TV and other media to stay healthy during lockdown and a fortuitous overlap with what executives say have been improvements to taste. Alcohol-free beers had often been described as too yeasty, watery or cloying.
The boom has been a rare fillip for a 3.3 trillion yen ($30 billion) industry that has seen demand buckle as Japan's population ages and as wine and other alcoholic drinks have gained in popularity. 
In fact, Japan's beer consumption has more than halved in the past two decades, and the pandemic has exacerbated that pain as restaurants and bars were forced to close early. 
Asahi's overall beer sales, which are dominated by its flagship Super Dry brand, particularly at bars, plunged 16% by value last year. Kirin, which has a bigger range of beer offerings, saw its sales volume fall 5%.
A second state of emergency that was imposed this year remains in place for Tokyo and its surrounding areas, where 30% of Japanese live, until March 21.
BETTER TASTE
Alcohol-free beer has become increasingly available in many countries with Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken (OTC:HEINY) rolling out versions of well-known lagers such as Budweiser and Stella Artois in recent years.
While non-alcoholic beer is estimated to account for just 1% of overall beer sales worldwide, rapid growth is predicted. Its global market could grow to $29 billion in 2026, up 65% from 2019, according to a Global Market Insights forecast in January.
But Japan's pandemic-driven trend has surprised many in the industry as the segment had long failed to gain traction. Sales of non-alcoholic and low-alcohol beer accounted for under 5% of all Japan beer sales in 2019, far behind 20% for Australia and 12% for Germany, according to Euromonitor data.
Like other industry executives, Suntory CEO Takeshi Niinami says brewers have made progress in bringing the taste of non-alcoholic beer closer to regular beer.
To that end, they have been working on reducing artificial aromas and sweeteners used to simulate the flavours created through regular fermentation. Some have also adopted manufacturing methods that allow for a gentler removal of alcohol, thereby preserving the taste of beer. 
""Of course there is the health aspect... but it's only when the flavour improved that people began to really respond,"" he said at a recent event outlining the company's strategy.
Asahi's 0.5%-strength ""Beery"", for example, uses the slower alcohol extraction method and is advertised as having more ""umami and richness"" than other beer alternatives. 
It hits the market late this month, but the advertising campaign has begun in advance of sales - rare treatment for the niche category. Asahi plans to add more low and non-alcohol beer products this year and aims to triple its number of products in the segment by 2025.
Kirin relaunched its ""Green's Free"" no-alcohol beer in late February, marketing it as having higher quality malt and barley as well as Nelson Sauvin hops which are used to give an aromatic kick to craft ales. Suntory too recently updated its ""All Free"" non-alcohol, calorie-free beer with a new recipe. 
Kazuo Matsuyama, who heads marketing for Asahi's domestic beer business, said the declining appeal of regular beer meant it's time to look beyond the company's core clientele of lager-loving men.
""Until now, out of the broader population of 80 million in their 20s to 60s, we were targeting the 20 million people who enjoy drinking daily,"" he said. ""But we now need to look at others.""

The deal was the first major piece of M&A activity in New Zealand this year, which comes amid a push from companies and investors for decarbonisation and a move towards clean, renewable energy.
Powering Australian Renewables (PowAR), a partnership between AGL, investment manager QIC and Australia's sovereign wealth fund, will buy Tilt's Australian business, while 19.9%-shareholder Mercury NZ Ltd will buy its New Zealand business.
The deal will give the consortium access to the New Zealand-based firm's 20 wind farms that are operational or under development.
Tilt shares soared 18.1% to NZ$7.65 by 2146 GMT, but still traded below the consortium's offer price of NZ$7.80 per share, which was a 20.4% premium to Friday's close.
""The board is pleased that, with these new owners, the transition to renewables in Australia and New Zealand will continue to accelerate,"" Tilt Chairman Bruce Harker said.
Infratil Ltd, Tilt's largest shareholder, and Mercury NZ have agreed to vote in favour of the deal, the company said, adding that a meeting to vote on the agreement would likely be held in about four months.
In separate statements, Infratil said it expected to fetch about NZ$1.93 billion from the sale of its 65.5% stake in Tilt, while Mercury NZ said the deal would be immediately accretive and add NZ$50 million to its 2022 earnings.
AGL said it would contribute A$341 million ($264.5 million) to fund its portion of PowAR's deal for Tilt's Australian operations.
""The proposed acquisition by PowAR will provide more renewable energy options in AGL's generation portfolio, further supporting our orderly transition away from coal-fired power and responding to our customers' increasing appetite for cleaner energy,"" AGL Chief Executive Brett Redman said.

(Reuters) - Private equity firm Warburg Pincus has agreed to acquire a minority stake in Edelman Financial Engines, valuing the U.S. investment advisory services provider at $7.3 billion, including debt, the companies told Reuters on Sunday.
The deal represents a 62% increase in the valuation of Edelman Financial Engines since 2018, when buyout firm Hellman & Friedman created it through the merger of two companies. It underscores the growth of the registered investment adviser (RIA) industry as more Americans seek professional help to invest their savings.
Hellman & Friedman will retain a majority stake in Edelman Financial Engines, the companies said. They did not disclose the exact stake that Warburg Pincus was acquiring, but the private equity firm's head of financial services, Michael Martin, said in an interview it represented a ""mid-to-high teens"" percentage equity ownership. 
""We have always liked the business, and we would have liked to have come in when the company was taken private (in 2018). When this opportunity came our way, we were delighted to be able to pursue it,"" Martin said. 
Edelman Financial Engines has more than $260 billion in assets under management and services nearly 1.3 million customers from a network of more than 150 offices across America, according to its website.
The Warburg Pincus investment will support Edelman Financial Engines' goals including an expansion of its 401(k) business, extending its digital platform and boosting its brand to lure in new clients, the company's chief executive, Larry Raffone, said in an interview. He added that the company's customer base will grow significantly as more baby-boomers seek out professional financial advice for their retirement.
""Planners are essential to the client experience but they have to be supported by the very best technology, so we are dramatically investing in our digital platform,"" Raffone said.
Hellman & Friedman acquired a majority stake in Edelman Financial from buyout firm Lee Equity Partners in 2015 in a deal that valued that company at more than $800 million, including debt. In 2018, Hellman & Friedman took private another company, Financial Engines, in a $3 billion deal and merged it with Edelman Financial. The combined company was worth $4.5 billion at the time.
Warburg Pincus owned a stake in Financial Engines but had sold it in the stock market before Hellman & Friedman clinched the acquisition. 
Moelis (NYSE:MC) & Co was lead advisor to Edelman Financial Engines on the transaction, with PJT Partners (NYSE:PJT) and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett also providing respective financial and legal advice. Warburg Pincus was advised by law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.

""At some point, we need to graduate from our one-legged approach of relying solely on Tesla,"" Tsuga, who will step down after nine years as CEO from April 1, told the newspaper in an interview.
""We are entering a different phase and we need to keep an eye on supplying manufacturers other than Tesla.""
The Japanese conglomerate announced in November that Tsuga would step down in April after nine years at the helm and that Yuki Kusumi, the head of its automotive business, would take over.
Under Tsuga's leadership, Panasonic has shifted its focus away from low-margin consumer electronics to batteries, factory machines and components. The company said last month it expects its battery business supplying Tesla to be profitable this fiscal year.

Panasonic has partnered with Tesla in a $5 billion battery ""gigafactory"" near Reno, Nevada.

(Reuters) - British airline Virgin Atlantic, which has been hammered by the COVID-19 pandemic like much of the sector, is set to raise 160 million pounds ($222.75 million) in new financing, a spokeswoman for Richard Branson's airline said in an emailed statement.
""We continue to bolster our balance sheet in anticipation of the lifting of international travel restrictions during the second quarter of 2021"", the spokeswoman said.
""This latest £160 million financing provides further resilience against a slower revenue recovery in 2021"", she said.
The latest financing follows the airline's completion in January of the sale and leaseback of two Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787s as part of a plan to strengthen its balance sheet.
The deal with Griffin Global Asset Management to raise just over $230 million from the two planes was meant to enable Virgin Atlantic to repay a loan taken on as part of its rescue deal last year.
In the latest raise, Branson's Virgin Group is set to provide about 100 million pounds and the remaining 60 million pounds would include deferrals, according to Sky News, which first reported the development.
In November, the company said that its 1.2 billion pound rescue deal secured two months prior meant that the airline can survive even if the travel situation were to worsen.

Virgin cut costs by 335 million pounds last year, CEO Shai Weiss told an airline industry event in November. It had also announced 4,650 job losses during the pandemic, halving its workforce, and shrank its fleet.

The cruise company's full fleet might be sailing by the end of this year but it will take longer to recover to pre-crisis revenues, Donald told the newspaper in an interview.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways's new boss said vaccinated people should be allowed to travel without restriction and non-vaccinated people with a negative COVID-19 test, as he set out his ideas for a travel restart a month before the UK government finalises its plans. 
Holidays will not be allowed until May 17 at the earliest, the government has said, but before that, on April 12, Britain will announce how and when non-essential travel into and out of the country can resume. 
Sean Doyle, appointed BA's chief executive last October, called on Britain to work with other governments to allow vaccines and health apps to open up travel, after a year when minimal flying has left many airlines on life support. 
""I think people who've been vaccinated should be able to travel without restriction. Those who have not been vaccinated should be able to travel with a negative test result,"" he said.
Doyle said the roll-out of vaccines made him optimistic BA would be back flying this summer, but added the recovery depends on what is said on April 12. 
He wants government to give its backing to health apps that can be used to verify a person's negative COVID-19 test results and vaccination status. 
Apps will be key to facilitating travel at scale, the industry has said. Airline staff checking paperwork takes 20 minutes per passenger and is not practical if large numbers of passengers return. 
Britain has rapidly rolled out vaccinations and 44% of the adult population, mostly people over 60, have now had their first shot.
The government has said any return to travel must be fair and not unduly disadvantage those who have not been vaccinated.
Doyle expects Britain to bring in a tiered framework with destinations put into categories depending on risk, and that will determine BA's summer schedule. 
Beyond saying there was ""huge pent up demand"", Doyle declined to forecast how strong the season could be. 
Budget rival Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline, has said it hopes to fly up to 70% of 2019 passenger numbers this summer.
BA has struck a deal with a testing kit provider giving its passengers 33 pound ($46) tests to take abroad.
Travel commentators expect most European airlines to focus on short-haul leisure routes this summer, and Doyle noted France, Greece, Portugal, Cyprus and Spain had all sounded positive about welcoming British holidaymakers. 
But he said BA was also looking further afield. 
""We're already looking at new destinations over the summer that we haven't flown to before, and that could be across both long haul and short haul,"" Doyle said.

1053,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2021 03:15PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Energy shares look for next spark as investors eye recovering economy,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors betting on U.S. energy shares have enjoyed a blistering rally, as the sector leads a move into value and economically sensitive stocks that has gripped the equity market. How much further that run continues could hinge on the success of the economic recovery, supply dynamics in oil markets and whether companies can stay disciplined on spending.
The near doubling in the price of crude has helped make shares of oil and gas companies - for years a losing bet - one of the best performing areas of the market, with outsized gains in the stocks of companies such as oil major  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and Diamondback (NASDAQ:FANG) Energy Inc, which have surged 89% and 231%, respectively, since early November. 
With a gain of over 80% in that time, the S&P 500 energy sector is back to levels last seen in February 2020, when the stock market began its plunge as the COVID-19 outbreak took its toll on the economy. 
“Shares are being bid up because there are expectations for greater demand,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors. ""We need to see the follow-through.""
The outlook for energy shares is at the center of a number of market themes, including how long the economic ""reopening"" trade can last, whether energy and other value stocks can continue outperforming tech and growth shares and if the market is primed for a potential rise in inflation.
With the benchmark S&P 500 nearing the 4,000 level for the first time, the health of the economy, the pace of inflation and a recent rise in bond yields are expected to be hot topics when the U.S. Federal Reserve meets on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
Ample crude supply that weighed on global oil prices and concerns over a push toward “green energy” were among the factors pulling down energy stocks for most of the past decade. Oil prices plummeted in the coronavirus-fueled downturn amid global travel restrictions and shutdowns but roared higher in recent months, buoyed by breakthroughs in vaccines against COVID-19. 
Recent data has shown signs of an economic recovery continuing to gain momentum. The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits dropped to a four-month low last week, while U.S. consumer sentiment improved in early March to its strongest in a year.
Prices for U.S. crude are up 35% year-to-date. 
Investors are watching supply dynamics as another catalyst for crude prices and energy stocks. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies last year cut output substantially as demand collapsed due to the pandemic. The group earlier this month agreed to extend most output cuts into April.
Any efforts by President Joe Biden's administration to regulate U.S. drilling could support prices by keeping supply in check, investors said. “There is more likely to be an aggressive regulatory regime, which would rein in supply, which would be a positive for commodity prices,"" said Burns McKinney, portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group.
Investors said they want to see whether companies are spending on new drilling, which could oversupply the market and eventually weigh on prices, or pay down debt and bolster dividends.
Five international oil majors cut their capital spending by about 20% on average last year to $80 billion and are expected in aggregate to generally maintain that spending level in 2021, according to Jason Gabelman, senior energy equity research analyst at Cowen.
Energy companies “need to maintain their discipline, they need to stick to capital budgets that are constrained and not drill as much and give investors confidence that this is not going to be a short-lived cycle,"" said Christian Ledoux, director of investment research at CAPTRUST.
Setbacks in fighting the virus could undercut the reopening trade and energy shares along with it. Such a scenario risks playing out in Europe, where a more contagious variant of the coronavirus has pushed Italy and France to impose fresh lockdowns. 
Another factor is how quickly travel might rebound to pre-pandemic levels. 

“You may see reopening and people driving more and spending more on commerce, but ... if people are traveling less globally, that is going to result in oil demand not fully recovering to where it was,"" Gabelman said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution suggested that it could build a factory in the U.S. state of Georgia to manufacture batteries for electric vehicles, an official at LG Energy Solution said on Saturday. 
In a letter to U.S. Senator Raphael Warnock, LG Energy Solution CEO Kim Jong-hyun said that ""the company is prepared to do whatever we can help the people and workers of Georgia,"" according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
LG Chem's wholly owned battery division, LG Energy Solution, confirmed that the company had recently sent the letter to the senator, but declined to confirm the details.
Kim also said in the letter that if an outside investor acquires a separate SK Innovation plant in Georgia, LG could partner with it to run the facility, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. 
""(The letter) was intended to clearly address the current situation that has been caused by SK's misappropriation of our trade secrets as well as to alleviate concerns about jobs in Georgia,"" an official at LG Energy Solution said in a statement to Reuters.
An official at SK Innovation rejected the idea of LG taking over its plant. 
""LG's statement regarding acquiring the plant does not make any sense as automakers do not allow contract and suppliers to change in a separate manner. With that being said, it's unreasonable for LG to say it could take over the plant and replace us,"" the official told Reuters.
LG's letter came as Georgia's governor, Brian Kemp, on Friday repeated his request for U.S. President Joe Biden to overturn the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC)'s ruling against SK Innovation to save thousands of jobs in the state directly tied to SK's battery factory.
LG Energy Solution has been in a legal feud with SK Innovation over allegations that SK stole trade secrets. The ITC sided with LG Chem in February and issued a 10-year order prohibiting most U.S. imports of SK lithium-ion batteries.
SK Innovation has lobbied the White House to overturn the decision, which could also be negated if SK and LG reach an independent settlement.

On Thursday, LG announced its plans to invest more than $4.5 billion in its U.S. battery production business over the next four years, including plans to build at least two new plants.

The Defense Department, under the Trump administration in mid-January, added Xiaomi and eight other firms to a list that requires Americans to sell their interests in the firms by a deadline. The restrictions were set to go into effect next week.
Xiaomi in late January filed a complaint in a Washington court seeking to be removed from the list, calling its inclusion ""unlawful and unconstitutional"" and arguing it was not controlled by the People's Liberation Army.
U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras in Washington, D.C., said on Friday that the court ""concludes that defendants have not made the case that the national security interests at stake here are compelling.""
The Defense Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a statement, a Xiaomi spokesperson welcomed the ruling and called the designation of Xiaomi as a Chinese military company ""arbitrary and capricious.""

""Xiaomi plans to continue to request that the court declare the designation unlawful and to permanently remove the designation,"" the spokesperson said.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - The Canadian judge in Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou's U.S. extradition case rejected her request to admit as evidence Huawei employee statements that contradict a U.S. claim she misled bankers about the company's business in Iran, a ruling said on Friday.
But the judge provisionally allowed parts of an expert's report that Meng's team requested be permitted into evidence, subject to further submissions about its relevance, the ruling showed.
Meng, 49, was arrested in December 2018 at Vancouver International Airport on a U.S. warrant for allegedly misleading HBSC about Huawei's business dealings in Iran and causing the bank to violate U.S. sanctions.
She has since been fighting the case from under house arrest in Vancouver and has said she is innocent.
The evidence Meng's team sought to add related to their claim that HSBC knew about Huawei's businesses in Iran, and that Meng did not mislead the bank.
Two affidavits were from Huawei employees who attended the meeting where the United States alleges Meng lied about the company's business connections in Iran.
Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes of British Columbia Supreme Court said that allowing this into evidence ""could do no more than invite credibility findings,"" turning the case into a he-said-she-said.
Holmes also rejected two more Huawei employee affidavits alleging that HSBC employees knew about Huawei's connections to businesses in Iran, stating that they were beyond the ""proper scope"" of an extradition hearing.
""The difficulty Ms. Meng faces is that this body of evidence relates to issues properly within the domain of a trial, not the extradition hearing,"" Holmes wrote.
Holmes did provisionally allow parts of a report by an expert on the application of U.S. sanctions law to financial institutions, stating it could address a potentially misleading aspect of U.S. evidence. But she said that more submissions would be necessary to prove its relevance.
Meng is set to appear in court on Monday as her case enters the final phase of arguments, scheduled to finish in May. 

Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Leaders of the United States, India, Australia and Japan agreed to pool financing, manufacturing and distribution capacity to send 1 billion coronavirus vaccines across Asia by the end of 2022, India's foreign secretary said on Friday.
The so-called ""Quad"" group of four nations want to expand global vaccinations and counter China's growing vaccination diplomacy in Southeast Asia and around the world. India is the world's biggest vaccine maker.
The collaboration was ""most pressing and valuable"", foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla told a news conference in India's capital New Delhi after the four-way virtual summit.
""The four countries have agreed to a plan to pool their financial resources, manufacturing capabilities and capacities, and logistical strengths so as to ramp up the manufacturing and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines in the Indo-Pacific region,"" he said. 
""We believe this will speed up the process of post-pandemic recovery and enable families and businesses to put the COVID-19 crisis behind them.""
India will use its manufacturing capacity to make U.S. vaccines, with financing coming from the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.
Australia will finance training and provide last-mile logistical support for the distribution of vaccines, he added, that will predominantly go to the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia and countries in the Indian Ocean.
The initiative, however, may be hampered by U.S. export restrictions on critical raw materials for India's vaccine supply chain.
Shringla said the issue is a bilateral one with the United States that has been raised by India's ambassador in Washington.
""Consideration is being given to this very important point,"" he said, without elaborating.

The tie-up will not impact the production of vaccines for India's 1.4 billion people, Shringla added.

1061,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 05:53PM ET</span>",U.S. stocks close mixed as Dow notches fifth straight record high,"By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The blue-chip Dow powered to its fifth consecutive record high on Friday and the S&P 500 closed slightly higher as investors bought shares that should benefit from a strong reopening of the U.S. economy, an outlook signaled by rising yields in the bond market.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled after rebounding more than 6% over the past three sessions as the rising bond yields revived inflation worries and dulled the appeal of high-growth technology shares.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their biggest weekly percentage gains since early February after President Joe Biden signed into law on Thursday one of the largest U.S. fiscal stimulus bills and data reinforced convictions the economy was headed to a high-growth recovery.
The recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields has raised fears of a sudden tapering of monetary stimulus and put downward pressure on Wall Street in recent weeks.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year note hit 1.642% on Friday, the highest level since February of last year. [US/]
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co rose 6.82% to lead the Dow and S&P 500 higher. The rising Dow and tumbling Nasdaq reflect an ongoing sell-off in tech as investors buy cyclical and underpriced value stocks that are expected to do well as the economy recovers.
For tech stocks to continue to flourish you need low rates, and in effect slower growth, said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member of hedge fund Great Hill Capital LLC. 
But with the stimulus package the economy is likely to expand 7% to 9% this year and pressure interest rates, he said.
""That's why you're seeing rates rise today because the reopening is happening faster and stronger than anticipated. And that's when value and cyclicals and economically sensitive stocks outperform,"" Hayes said.
The speedy distribution of vaccines and more fiscal aid have spurred concerns of rising inflation despite assurances from the Federal Reserve to maintain an accommodative policy. All eyes will be on the central bank's policy meeting next week for further cues on inflation.
U.S. consumer sentiment improved in early March to its strongest in a year, a survey by the University of Michigan showed on Friday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 293.05 points, or 0.9%, to close at 32,778.64 and the S&P 500 gained 4 points, or 0.10%, to 3,943.34. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 78.81 points, or 0.59%, to end at 13,319.87.
For the week, the S&P rose 2.6%, the Dow added 4.1% and the Nasdaq gained 3.1%. For the Dow it was its biggest weekly gain since November.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.64 billion shares.
The Nasdaq has been particularly hit by the sell-off in recent weeks and confirmed a correction at the start of the week as investors swapped richly valued technology stocks with those of energy, mining and industrial companies that are poised to benefit more from an economic rebound.
Value stocks added about 0.80%, while growth stocks slumped 0.62% in a continuation of a rotation that began late last year.
The high-flying but yield-sensitive group of stocks including of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), which fueled the past's year rally, fell.
Tech, communication services and consumer discretionary indexes, which house these mega-cap stocks, slipped the most among major S&P sectors.
The bank index jumped 1.83%, while financials and industrials clinched new record levels.
Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) Inc fell 8.4% after the cosmetics retailer forecast annual revenue below estimates, as demand for make-up products were under pressure due to extended work-from-home policies.

Chile's LATAM Airlines (OTC:LTMAQ), said on Friday it expects flights in March to fall by 65% compared with March 2019, before the pandemic hit. 
The new guidance shows how badly the second coronavirus wave is affecting airlines in the region, especially in Brazil, which just this week posted a new record for daily deaths. Many countries have shut borders with Brazil while state governors in recent days have imposed ever tighter lockdowns to try to stop the spread. 
Domestic flights in Brazil are a key market for LATAM. 
Its main rival there, Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes, said on Friday it was asking passengers with tickets booked for April to confirm whether they were actually going to take the flight, suggesting they were expecting significant cancellations. 

""With the worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic, Gol is adapting its flight schedules for the month of April,"" the airline said in a statement.""

The second largest U.S. automaker said in January it would comply with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration request and that the recall would cost $610 million. The defect, which leads in rare instances to air bag inflators rupturing and sending potentially deadly metal fragments flying, prompted the largest automotive recall in U.S. history of more than 67 million inflators.

Investing.com – The Dow hit record highs on Friday, as tech cut some losses to close above the lows of the day even as U.S. rates climbed to pre-pandemic levels, while the reflation trade continued to boost cyclical stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.90%, or 293 points, to end at a closing record of 32,778.64, and the S&P 500 rose 0.10% to 3,943.34 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.59%, but had been down about 2%.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield jumped to 13-month highs of 1.642% on bets for a faster pace of inflation as the economy is expected to stage a stronger recovery thanks to another round of stimulus.
“The continuation of massive funding will lead to rising inflationary implications in the longer-run as the economy – eventually – attempts to grow organic legs,” Stifel said in a note. The uptick in inflation through the summer months will ultimately prove modest, reinforcing the “Fed’s nonchalant approach to rising inflation expectations or a backup in rates,” it added.
Tech closed in the red, but well off its session lows despite the uptick in rates that tends to sour the outlook on long-term growth companies that are yet to generate positive cash flows.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were in the red.
Sentiment on Apple was also hurt by signs of weak iPhone demand.  iPhone shipments in February were down 14% according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), citing data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology. ""This is consistent with our view that lengthening replacement cycles are likely to drive lower and lower demand peaks in iPhone redesign years,"" Morgan Stanley said.
Chinese tech stocks were led lower by a 4% fall in  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) on fears of a regulatory crackdown on tech. The Wall Street Journal reported that China’s antitrust regulators are weighing up a record fine for the e-commerce giant.
Cyclicals, which move in tandem with the economy, continued to ride the wave of economic optimism, led by gains in financials and industrials, with the latter boosted by Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT).

1065,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 03:55PM ET</span>","Boeing unveils order for troubled 737 MAX, shares jump","By Rachit Vats and Eric M. Johnson
(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co unveiled a new order for its 737 MAX on Friday, pushing its shares up 6% as it renews efforts to recapture investor confidence following a two-year safety crisis.
The deal to sell 24 of the 737-8 model to a backer of Canadian low-cost carrier Flair Airlines comes after Reuters reported it was poised to win another, much larger deal with Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV). 
Shares in Boeing rose 6.2% to $267.86.
Boeing has been trying to rebuild its image with passengers and airlines following the nearly two-year grounding of the MAX after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people. 
This week marked the second anniversary of the second accident, with a final investigative report expected any day. 
Boeing said Miami-based private equity firm 777 Partners, which has a stake in Flair Airlines, agreed to buy 24 737-8 airplanes with an option to purchase a further 60.
Flair, which was recently relaunched by veterans of European budget giant Wizz Air, is now operating one plane for domestic flights. It said it would lease 13 of the 24 aircraft from 777 Partners starting this year. 
Reuters on Wednesday reported Boeing was on the verge of a deal to sell dozens of 737 MAX 7 jets to Southwest Airlines in potentially its largest 737 MAX order since the jet's safety ban was lifted.
Both deals would provide a much-needed injection of cash for the U.S. planemaker, which ended last year with more than $60 billion in debt and an historic loss of $12 billion.
The coronavirus pandemic has further complicated the MAX's recovery by decimating demand for air travel and new jets.
Ultra low-cost carriers, or ULCCs, are seen as the winners of the COVID-19 crisis as they offer a no-frills experience at low prices.
They are pervasive in Europe's fragmented market, with Hungarian Wizz Air - a key Airbus customer - competing with the likes of Ireland's Ryanair, a top Boeing user like Southwest. 
They have grown more slowly in North America. 
In December, Alaska Airlines agreed in December to buy 23 737 MAX 9 jets and Ryanair ordered 75 jets.
At Southwest, Boeing was fending off a challenge from the newer Airbus A220, building on a position as the airline's exclusive supplier as Airbus struggles to reduce production costs for the Canadian-designed A220, industry sources said.
Analysts have described Southwest as a must-win for Boeing and crucial to its broader recovery.

Analysts caution it faces a list of other challenges, from production of its 787 Dreamliner to the delayed development of its 777X and financial overruns on a U.S. Air Force tanker.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk has been sued by a shareholder who accused him of violating his 2018 settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over his Twitter use.
According to a complaint unsealed late Thursday in Delaware Chancery Court, which also names the electric car company's board as defendants, Musk's ""erratic"" tweets and the failure of Tesla directors to ensure he complied with the SEC settlement have exposed shareholders to billions of dollars of losses.
The complaint highlighted several Musk posts on social media platform Twitter, including his assessment last May 1 that Tesla's stock price was ""too high,"" prompting a more than $13 billion tumble in Tesla's market value.
Chase Gharrity, the plaintiff, said Musk's actions and the directors' inaction have caused ""substantial financial harm,"" and that they should pay damages to Palo Alto, California-based Tesla for breaching their fiduciary duties.
The lawsuit was filed even though Tesla's share price has soared nearly fivefold since Musk's ""too high"" tweet, giving Tesla a valuation well above $600 billion, and the SEC has not publicly accused Musk of recent violations.
""It could pressure the SEC into taking some sort of recourse,"" said Charles Elson, a University of Delaware professor and corporate governance specialist.
Tesla did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment. Gharrity's lawyers, Musk's lawyers in the SEC case, and the SEC did not immediately respond to similar requests.
The SEC settlement followed Musk's August 2018 tweet that he had ""funding secured"" to possibly take Tesla private in a $72 billion transaction. In reality, Musk was not close.
Musk and Tesla each paid $20 million in civil fines, and Tesla lawyers agreed to vet some of Musk's tweets in advance.
The settlement was later amended to clarify when pre-approvals were required, prompted by a unvetted tweet by Musk about Tesla's vehicle production forecast.
Last April, a San Francisco federal judge said Tesla and Musk must face a lawsuit claiming Musk's going-private tweet defrauded shareholders. That case remains pending. 

The case is Gharrity v Musk et al, Delaware Chancery Court, No. 2021-0199.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) President Brad Smith described the attack as “the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen.""
The senior official also noted that most of the nine federal government agencies compromised by the SolarWinds hack have completed an independent review and those that have not will finish one by the end of March.

The hacking, which also hurt 100 private companies, used corrupted SolarWinds code and weaknesses in Microsoft identity-management tools.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawmakers heard testimony on Friday over whether a bill aimed at helping news outlets negotiate with tech platforms was an appropriate way to help the struggling industry, including discussion of whether it should be restricted to smaller news organizations.
Representative David Cicilline, chair of the House Judiciary Committee antitrust panel, said his bill to allow a broad array of news organizations to collectively negotiate with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in hopes of recouping ad revenues would be a ""temporary solution to an urgent problem.""
His bill and a Senate companion were introduced on Wednesday.
Republican Representative Jim Jordan has been critical of the big tech platforms, but also seemed skeptical of the bill. ""Maybe that's the right course, but I got real questions about that,"" he said. 
Representative Val Demings asked for reassurance that smaller publications would genuinely benefit from the legislation. Critics have expressed concern that joint negotiations with the platforms would strengthen the richest, most powerful media outlets and leave struggling smaller publications behind.
But David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance, argued that removing the bigger organizations, like the Wall Street Journal or Washington Post from the legislation, would make it less likely that joint negotiations would succeed.
""The collective action primarily benefits those who don't have a way to assert their value,"" said Chavern. ""Without the big publishers, the small ones have no hope."" 
If it becomes law, the legislation creates a four-year antitrust exemption that would benefit any print, broadcast, or digital news organization with a dedicated editorial staff that publishes at least weekly. At least 25% of their output should be original.

In addition to this measure, Cicilline has said he plans to introduce a series of bills aimed at toughening antitrust laws.

(Reuters) - The largest city-owned utility in Texas on Friday sued the state's grid operator alleging it levied ""excessive"" power prices during a February deep freeze, and seeking to bar the grid from issuing a default that could affect its credit rating.
High prices for emergency fuel and power during a severe cold spell left Texas utilities facing about $47 billion in one-time costs. Those costs have led to two bankruptcies and knocked two other electric providers off the state's power grid because of payment defaults. 
San Antonio's municipal utility, CPS Energy, faces about $1 billion in extraordinary charges for natural gas and electricity during a five day deep freeze last month. CPS Energy has about 820,000 electricity customers. 
""We are fighting to protect our customers from the financial impacts of the systemic failure"" of the state's grid operator,"" said Paula Gold-Williams, chief executive of the city-owned utility.
The lawsuit, filed in a Bexar County court, alleges grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) mismanaged the cold weather crisis, and overcharged for power. It asked the court to prevent ERCOT from declaring it in default and to prevent ERCOT from charging CPS Energy for other grid defaults.
An ERCOT spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Nearly $3.1 billion in power charges to grid users have not been paid so far, ERCOT said on Thursday. 
ERCOT officials hiked power prices by about 400 times the usual rate to $9,000 per megawatt for five days last month in a vain effort to bring in more power. State officials this week called on ERCOT and the utility regulator to cut those charges for high-price power for the 32-hour period after the grid emergency passed.
CPS Energy's lawsuit called ERCOT's handling of the crisis ""one of the largest illegal wealth transfers in the history of Texas."" It brought the complaint ""to protect its customers from excessive and illegitimate power and natural gas costs,"" according to the lawsuit.

Credit rating firms have warned CPS and other Texas municipal and rural cooperative power provider could have their ratings lowered. The state's largest and old cooperative, Brazos Electric Power Cooperative Inc, filed for bankruptcy earlier this month owing $1.8 billion to ERCOT.

1077,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 12:15PM ET</span>","Facebook, Google fight bill that would help U.S. news industry","By Diane Bartz and Helen Coster
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lobbyists for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) threw their weight against new U.S. legislation that seeks to aid struggling news publishers by allowing them to negotiate collectively against the tech companies over revenue sharing and other deals.
U.S. lawmakers introduced the plan in Congress on Wednesday to address a perceived power imbalance between news outlets and the tech giants. Critics accuse the companies of using content to drive traffic and ad revenue to their platforms without fairly compensating the publishers. 
The move adds to pressure on the tech firms, which are facing antitrust lawsuits and the threat of more regulation.
Google, which declined comment on the proposal, launched a website https://blog.google/supportingnews#overview on Thursday asserting it is ""one of the world's biggest financial supporters of journalism"" by virtue of the ad revenue and content licensing fees it provides to media. Google said its search engine sends readers to publishers' websites 24 billion times per month.
Also opposing the bill are two technology industry trade groups that Facebook and Google belong to -- the Computer & Communications Industry Association and NetChoice. 
""Objective news coverage is a public good, but we don't think the way to fund that public good is by constructing a cartel,"" said CCIA President Matt Schruers.
The group opposed a 2019 version of the legislation and views the proposed joint bargaining as a way of restricting competition. 
Carl Szabo of NetChoice said his goal was to kill the bill or at least convince lawmakers to amend it so that it would be restricted to smaller publications, excluding outlets such as the Washington Post or New York Times. 
""I don't think they should be doing this legislation, period,"" he said. ""This legislation allows the Washington Post and New York Times and other big papers to call the shots for the smaller outlets.""
Some industry observers say the proposal could disproportionately benefit private equity firms and hedge funds that have snatched up medium and large newspaper chains. Newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune and the Miami Herald are controlled by the likes of Alden Global Capital and Chatham Asset Management.
The bills come not long after Facebook battled with Australia over how much it should pay news publishers for their content. During the fight, Facebook blacked out Australian news pages and only restored them once the government granted concessions. 
Facebook declined comment on the new U.S. legislation. 
Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who sponsored the bill in the Senate, said the Australia dispute illustrated Facebook's outsized clout and the need to give publishers more leverage. ""We have to have an even playing field and allow people to negotiate,"" she said Thursday in a congressional hearing.
The tech platforms appear to have few friends in Congress, where Democrats have been angered by misinformation online and conservatives argue that their views have been stifled.
Among groups that back the legislation, David Chavern, president and chief executive of the News Media Alliance, sees collective bargaining as a critical way to increase the negotiating power of small and medium-size publishers. 

""There has to be some kind of dispute resolution mechanism"" between platforms and publishers in addition to collective bargaining, said Chavern, adding that his group is flexible about what that could entail.

GENEVA/MILAN/SOFIA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization squarely endorsed AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s coronavirus vaccine on Friday, as Thailand joined a number of smaller European countries in suspending use of the shot because of sporadic reports of blood clots among recipients.
Bulgaria also joined Denmark, Norway and Iceland, which all stopped using the vaccine on Thursday. Austria, Italy, Luxembourg, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia stopped using certain batches.
""Until all doubts are dispelled..., we are halting inoculations with this vaccine,"" Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said.
His health minister, Kostadin Angelov, said a 57-year-old woman had died of heart failure 15 hours after receiving an AstraZeneca shot, but urged those already inoculated to stay calm.
""We do not have any official data that proves a causal connection,"" he said.
That line was reinforced by the WHO, which is keenly aware that AstraZeneca's shot is by far the cheapest and most high-volume launched so far, and set to be the mainstay of vaccination programmes in much of the developing world.
Spokeswoman Margaret Harris said the vaccine was ""excellent"".
""It's very important to understand that, yes, we should continue to be using the AstraZeneca vaccine,"" she told a briefing. ""All that we look at is what we always look at: Any safety signal must be investigated.""
The EU regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), said on Wednesday that there had been 22 reports of embolisms from blood clots among 3 million people who had received the vaccine - no more than in the general population - but Bulgaria said it wanted to see that guidance in written form.
'THIS NEEDS TO BE EXPLAINED'
Experts point to the difficulty of putting risks in perspective for a wider public that may be spooked by negative headlines.
In Sicily, where two people died shortly after being vaccinated, the regional health administrator said 7,000 inoculation appointments had been cancelled as a result.
Silvestro Scotti, a family doctor in Naples and head of the Italian Federation of General Practitioners, said he had been bombarded all day with inquiries from people nervous about getting the AstraZeneca shot.
""The crazy thing is that, even if the correlation between the vaccine and blood clots were proved, it would be a rate of 0.007 out of a thousand,"" he said.
""To give an example: the birth control pill, which is used widely and doesn't worry anyone, has a proven risk rate of 0.6 in a thousand. Even in the worst-case scenario, the risk/benefit ratio for this vaccine is extraordinarily favourable. That needs to be explained to people.""
The WHO's Harris said 268 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from various developers had been administered worldwide without being shown to have caused a single death.
In France, where distrust of vaccination is long-established, only 43% said they trusted the AstraZeneca shot in a Harris Interactive poll conducted on March 11-12, while 55% said they trusted COVID-19 vaccines in general.
Germany has also had to contend with substantial scepticism, to the extent that Health Minister Jens Spahn suggested that the AstraZeneca shot be given to the police force and army, after some health and other frontline workers baulked at receiving it.
However, German authorities' main concern has been lack of supply, rather than lack of acceptance, as social and economic restrictions to limit transmission take their toll.

One doctor administering vaccinations in Berlin said recipients were now asking far fewer questions about the vaccine than two weeks ago.

1081,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 11:30AM ET</span>",China's Ant Group CEO leaves after failed IPO prompts revamp,"By Yingzhi Yang and Sumeet Chatterjee
(Reuters) - China's Ant Group Chief Executive Officer Simon Hu has unexpectedly resigned amid a regulatory-driven overhaul of the financial technology giant's business, the first top management exit since a scuppered $37 billion initial public offering.
Hu, who was named chief executive of the  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding affiliate in 2019, will be replaced by company veteran and Executive Chairman Eric Jing, Ant said in a statement on Friday.
Hu's exit from the company comes as Ant is working on plans to shift to a financial holding company structure following intense regulatory pressure to subject it to rules and capital requirements similar to those for banks.
That pressure abruptly scuttled Ant's IPO last year, which would have been the world's biggest.
Hu resigned for personal reasons, Ant said in a statement, without elaborating.
""Following the board's thorough discussions, we have decided to respect Simon's personal request and support him fully in his new mission,"" Jing said in an internal memo, an excerpt of which was seen by Reuters.
Jing will continue in his current role as chairman, he said.
U.S.-listed shares in billionaire Jack Ma's Alibaba dropped as much as 3.9% in the morning trade on Friday.
Hu's departure is the first major management change since the IPO was scrapped. He was one of the key executives responsible for managing the company's mega dual-listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS
Ma's business empire has been at the centre of a crackdown following an Oct. 24 speech in which he blasted China's regulatory system.
Regulators have since been tightening scrutiny of the country's technology sector, with Alibaba taking much of the heat. The regulator launched an official anti-trust probe into Alibaba in December.
Ma, who is not known for shying away from the limelight, disappeared from the public eye for about three months, prompting frenzied speculation about his whereabouts. He re-emerged in January in a 50-second video appearance.
Ant's financial holding structure is expected to weigh on its valuation, as the fintech firm was valued as a technology firm in its previous fundraising rounds. Typically, valuations are much higher on technology firms than on financial companies.
The change in management also comes days after some Ant staff expressed frustration on social media for not being able to sell the company shares they own after Chinese regulators abruptly halted the company's market debut.
Jing told Ant employees that the company would review its staff incentive programmes and roll out some measures starting from April to help solve their financial problems, according to two people who saw the messages.
The listing in November of Ant, whose businesses include consumer lending and insurance products distribution, would have made some of the company's employees millionaires or billionaires.
Although Ma has stepped down from corporate positions and earnings calls, he retains significant influence over Alibaba and Ant and promotes them globally at business and political events. 
Hu joined Ant in 2005 and has worked in various roles in the group as well as at Alibaba, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile.

Jing has been Ant's executive chairman since 2018 and before that he held various positions at the company including president and chief operating officer, according to his profile on the World Bank website. He joined Alibaba in 2007.

The drivers at a hearing in December had demanded full access to data gathered through the app they were required to use to do their job, saying Uber's algorithms ultimately decided how much money they could earn and how they could do better. 
The district court in Amsterdam, however, in its ruling on Thursday sided with the company, which said it already provided as much information as it could to drivers, and that it could not do more without compromising the privacy of customers. 
The court also disagreed with a complaint made by some of the drivers who said Uber had automatically deactived their account only because its algorithms had indicated they were suspected of fraudulent behaviour.
""Decisions were not based only on automatically generated data,"" the court said. 
It ordered Uber to give drivers more information about the decision to terminate their account, but dismissed claims for financial compensation. 

""This is a crucial decision,"" Uber spokesman Gus Glover said in a statement. ""The Court has confirmed Uber's dispatch system does not equate to automated decision making, and that we provided drivers with the data they are entitled to.""

Investors purchased a net $15.3 billion worth of U.S. equity funds in the week to March 10, compared with just $944 million a week before, data from Refinitiv Lipper showed.
The higher inflows into equities were also helped by tepid U.S. inflation data for February and a bigger-than-expected fall in weekly jobless claims, which pushed the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average to record highs this week.

Among equity funds, energy sector funds enjoyed the biggest inflow at $1.1 billion, boosted by higher energy prices. It was the fifth consecutive weekly inflow.
U.S. growth funds, which house most of the high-flying technology-related stocks, witnessed $4.7 billion worth of outflows, as the category was hit by higher U.S. bond yields.
Higher yields tend to hurt the flow of money into growth sectors, as they lower the present value of future cash flows of growth stocks.
U.S. value funds, on the other hand, which have holdings in cyclical sectors such as banks and energy, attracted an inflow of $6 billion, the highest in at least 2 years.

In fact, these companies stand to get stronger over time, Wall Street analysts say.
Lockdown winners Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST).,  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. have been getting little love from investors amid concerns over their future profitability as pandemic-fueled spending drop, at the same that that business expenditures increase and inflationary pressures mount.
While the S&P 500 advanced 4.5% since the start of the year, shares of Target are up only 1.7%, Walmart fell 8% and Costco is down 13%.
“We thought the Covid-environment beneficiaries would tread water, but it has been much worse,” Simeon Gutman, a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst wrote this week.
Still, Gutman said investors focusing primarily on an expected drop in comparable quarterly sales growth for the companies, may be missing the potential longer-term benefits the retailers stand to reap as the country’s economy normalizes. Moreover, the trio of retailers have embarked on aggressive investment programs.
“These mega cap retailers are reinvesting back into their businesses at high rates, paving the way for future growth,” Gutman wrote.
Costco, Target and Walmart are collectively spending more than $20 billion in their current fiscal years, boning up their businesses, aimed at e-commerce fulfillment capabilities, wages, as well as other improvements in a bid to raise productivity.
Capital expenditures and higher labor costs may eat into profit margins in the short-term. But as Gutman said: “On the other side of ‘recovery’ these mega caps should be even better positioned than before.”
Many on Wall Street agree. Costco has 69% of sell-side analysts covering the stock rating it a buy. That figure rises to 71% for Walmart and to 78% in the case of Target. The average 12-month price targets on their shares indicate upside of roughly 13% to 20% from their recent close.
A fresh round of stimulus checks poised to be delivered to many Americans this month also bodes well for at least Target and Walmart, given they were both beneficiaries of the last round, according to Jennifer Bartashus, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.
Walmart also stands to gain from a part of the Covid-19 relief bill that includes a continuation of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and both Target and Walmart could capture a larger chunk of so-called stimmy checks as shoppers spend on higher-margin discretionary items, Bartashus said.
An expected deceleration in sales and profit growth in coming quarters could still weigh on the companies’ shares and the question of how they will pivot to operate in an macroeconomic environment in flux, still remains.
Target said gross margins will decline from 2019 levels and that it would be better to compare its earnings this fiscal year to that of more normal years. Walmart disappointed investors by saying its 2021 profits would be hurt by slowing sales and reinvestments.
“We understand that Target may appear to be a victim of its own success as it faces difficult comparisons in 2021, but we look at the business on two- and three-year basis, which should remain strong,” Joseph Feldman, an analyst at Telsey Advisory, wrote in a report following the retailer’s earnings report in early March.

Investing.com – A fresh order for 24 planes from its 737 Max catalog kept Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares firm in Friday’s session. They rose 2% on the new order from private investment firm 777 Partners. The contract has a provision for the delivery of another 60 planes.
Miami-based 777 Partners, which has a stake in Canadian ultra-low-cost carrier Flair Airlines, said it plans to lease the 737-8s to its affiliated carriers, according to a Reuters report.
The deal is expected to boost Boeing's position and provide the much-needed support toward a financial recovery after two fatal 737 MAX crashes triggered a 20-month safety ban on the jet.
Ultra low-cost carriers are seen as beneficiaries of the post-Covid-19 return to travel, as they offer no-frills packages at very low prices while charging heavily for extras. ULCCs are very popular in Europe's fragmented but competitive market.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Friday, reverting back to the pattern of tech underperformance after a volatile week in which fears about rising long-term interest rates have refused to go away. 
The yield on the 10-year bond yield was the center of attention again in early dealings, rising to 1.62% after U.S. producer prices rose at their fastest rate in over two years in February. That followed data on consumer inflation earlier this week that suggested prices were still very much under control.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 132 points, or 0.4% at 32,618, a new all-time high. The S&P 500 was down 0.3% but the NASDAQ Composite was down 1.3%, albeit coming off its opening lows. The Nasdaq had risen more than 2.5% on Thursday.
Some of the biggest moves in early trade were by the ADRs of China's tech megacaps, which were the target of a raft of antitrust fines handed out by China's regulators overnight. Although the fines were insignificant in their size, they were seen as a fresh sign of Beijing wanting to exert more control over a sector whose economic importance and financial clout pose a potential challenge to the authority of the Communist Party. 
Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) ADRs fell 7.5%, while Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) ADRs fell 3.6% and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) fell 3.8%, the last of those also being affected by news that Simon Hu, the CEO of Alibaba affiliate Ant Group, had resigned for personal reasons, only a couple of months after regulators derailed the financial services group's planned IPO.
Elsewhere, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) stock fell 11% after it said after the close on Thursday that CEO Mary Dillon will be stepping down in June, to be replaced by company president Dave Kimbell. A pandemic-driven 4.6% decline in sales in the final quarter of the year also hurt.  E-commerce company  Poshmark  (NASDAQ:POSH) stock also fell 18% after its first results as a public company disappointed.
The rise in interest rates continued to support financial stocks, with  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock and  Wells Fargo  & Company (NYSE:WFC) stock both rising to their highest in over a year, while Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock rose 1.8% to its highest since 2009. The market also rewarded those were seen to be meeting their borrowing requirements now before rates rise any further. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), which issued some $10 billion in debt at various maturities earlier this week to repay its government aid, rose 4.4% to a 13-month high. Verizon (NYSE:VZ), which launched a $25 billion debt sale on Thursday to pay for 5G spectrum, rose 1.1%.
However, the rise in rates also continued to punish loss-making startups with a weaker near-term cash flow profile. Roblox (NYSE:RBLX), which went public to much fanfare earlier in the week, fell 4.9%."

LONDON (Reuters) - GFG Alliance head Sanjeev Gupta said on Friday the conglomerate was in talks with administrators of its former financial backer Greensill Capital on a so-called standstill agreement.
A standstill deal would mean GFG could pause its debt payments to Greensill, which filed for insolvency this week, for an agreed period of time. 
In its insolvency filing this week Greensill said that GFG, which is its largest client, warned in February that it would ""collapse into insolvency"" if the supply chain finance firm stopped providing it with working capital. 
""We are also having constructive discussions with Greensill's administrators ... negotiating a formal standstill agreement,"" Gupta said in an internal message to workers made available to Reuters by GFG.
Greensill's administrators at Grant Thornton declined to comment on the standstill discussions.
Such an agreement, Gupta said, ""would put on hold arrangements between the two parties and allow both sides more time to assess and negotiate next steps"".
GFG, an umbrella company for tycoon Gupta's network of steel, aluminium and energy companies, told trade unions this week it had adequate financing to meet its current requirements, but was seeking long-term alternatives.
""On refinancing, we are enthused by the amount of offers that we have received that reflects the strength of our business,"" Gupta said. ""However, given the scale of our operations this process will take some time to organise.""

GFG was asking all its businesses to ""take prudent steps to manage their cash positions carefully"" during the refinancing process, Gupta added.

Investing.com –  Poshmark  (NASDAQ:POSH) shares were down 14% at $51 in Friday’s premarket trading, after releasing disappointing earnings for the final quarter of 2020 late on Thursday.
Its guidance for the ongoing quarter, with an expected revenue around $76.5 million and adjusted EBITDA of around $1.5 million, also did little to cheer investors.
Poshmark, which went public only two months ago and was posting its first results since the IPO, said revenue was $69.3 million for the fourth quarter, up 27% on the year. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected  revenue of $68 million, CNBC said.
Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) grew 28% to $387.2 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $4.2 million, a reversal from the $12.6 million loss in the fourth quarter a year prior.

1094,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 08:30AM ET</span>","More ethnic minority directors on British boards, but fewer CEOs","By Huw Jones and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - More than 80% of Britain's blue chip companies have a director from a minority ethnic group, bringing an end-of-year voluntary target within reach, a committee that surveys diversity on corporate boards said.
However, minority ethnic representation at the summit of the executive ladder remains limited, falling from last year, the government-backed Parker Review Committee said.
Among the FTSE 100 companies, 74 had minority ethnic representation on their boards in November 2020, with a further seven having made appointments since then. This compares with 52 companies in January 2020.
The jump follows a year in which racial inequalities have come under increasing public scrutiny following the killing of George Floyd in the United States that sparked a wave of protests across the world and calls for faster change.
Amid broad calls for action from across society, companies globally have been pushed to ramp up their efforts, and leading institutional investors including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) said they will hold companies to account on the issue.
While welcoming the ""significant progress"" on improving the ethnic diversity of FTSE 100 boards, the committee said that, across the companies that responded to the survey, only five ethnic minority directors occupied a CEO position - down from six in 2020 - and four a CFO role. 
With the target of one director from an ethnic minority background per FTSE 100 company now within reach, it said, the next tier of 250 companies would be surveyed towards the end of the year as they work towards a ""one by 2024"" target.

""We expect more sanctions on Russia, but we don’t think there will be market relevant sanctions at this stage,"" said Jian, adding he expected new curbs over the poisoning of opposition politician Alexei Navalny or the SolarWinds hacking scandal to be targeted at individuals.
Sovereign dollar-bonds issued by the Russian government have been under sanctions since introduction of a ban for U.S. financial institutions to participate in primary issuance over the 2018 poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal in Britain though there have been no limitations to secondary trading.
Earlier in March, the United States imposed sanctions on seven senior Russian officials and 14 entities over Navalny in President Joe Biden's most direct challenge yet to the Kremlin. 
""The next move on sovereign debt would have to be on OFZ, and if there were a move to happen – which is not our base case – we think it would be similar to the current Eurobond sanction,"" said Jian at Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager with more than 1.4 trillion euros ($1.67 trillion) under management.
With Russia not rating very high on its internal ESG rating scale, exposure to its debt would force Amundi to shift exposure elsewhere to achieve its aim of having a higher ESG rating compared to its respective benchmarks, said Jian.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) has again angered the EU by scaling back deliveries of COVID-19 vaccines, but got a boost on Friday when the World Health Organisation dismissed fears that have prompted countries in Europe and Asia to suspend use of the shot.
The European Union has been much slower to start mass vaccination than neighbouring Britain because of a slower approval and purchasing process and repeated supply hold-ups.
EU regulators have dismissed scattered reports of blood clots in people who had received the AstraZeneca vaccine, but on Friday Thailand joined a handful of European countries in suspending use of the shot - the first and cheapest to be developed and launched at volume around the world.
An AstraZeneca document dated March 10, seen by Reuters and shared with EU officials, shows that the Anglo-Swedish drug maker expects to have delivered 30 million doses to the EU by the end of March - 10 million less than it pledged only last month, and only a third of its contractual obligation.
A company spokesman declined to comment, but a person familiar with the situation said there had been difficulties with international supply chains.
Industry executives have warned of manufacturing problems as countries try to protect their own supplies of vaccines, ingredients and the equipment to make, bottle and transport them.
Washington has told Brussels that it will not allow AstraZeneca shots made in the United States to be exported in the near future, Reuters reported on Thursday.
And last week Italy and Brussels blocked a shipment of AstraZeneca vaccines from Italy to Australia, in the first application of a mechanism that allows the EU to refuse export requests from vaccine makers that break EU supply contracts.
The company has acknowledged production problems in the EU, but also said it expected to ship some output to the EU from the United States. 
Its contract pledges ""best reasonable efforts"" to meet a target of 300 million doses for the EU by the end of June.
""NOT GOOD ENOUGH""
Brussels is increasingly frustrated.
""I see efforts, but not 'best efforts'. That's not good enough yet,"" EU industry commissioner Thierry Breton tweeted on Thursday.
Germany said it was talking to Washington about missing shipments of COVID-19 vaccines from the United States, noting that more than 30 countries including the United States were receiving vaccines made in the EU.
The EU programme has also been upset in the last two weeks by the reports of blood clots.
On Thursday, Denmark and non-EU members Norway and Iceland suspended their use of the vaccine. Austria and Italy have stopped using specific batches.
But on Friday the WHO said the vaccine was ""excellent"" and that no causal link had been established to the blood clots.
""It's very important to understand that, yes, we should continue to be using the AstraZeneca vaccine,"" spokeswoman Margaret Harris told a briefing. ""All that we look at is what we always look at: Any safety signal must be investigated.""
AstraZeneca said on Thursday it had found no evidence of increased risk of deep vein thrombosis in more than 10 million recipient records.
And the EU regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), said on Wednesday that the number of clots reported in people who had received the AstraZeneca vaccine was no higher than in the general population.
Bulgaria said it would suspend use of the vaccine until it saw written guidance from the EMA, but German Health Minister Jens Spahn told reporters on Friday that his country was following the EMA guidance.
""Everything we know so far suggests that the benefits of the vaccine, even after every individual case reported, are greater than the risks, and that continues to be the case,"" he said.
Germany, the most populous country in the EU, is due to receive about 6 million doses from AstraZeneca by the end of April, the document seen by Reuters shows, with France getting 4.7 million and Italy 4.4 million.

""We are still in a phase of absolute scarcity,"" Spahn said.

Meanwhile, investors also put $28.7 billion worth of money into safer money market funds, the data showed.
Among equity funds, technology funds faced an outflow for the first time in a year due to the surge in bond yields. Higher yields lower the present value of future cash flows of growth stocks. 
On the other hand, the financial sector attracted an inflow of $3.14 billion, the biggest in eight weeks, as investor ploughed money into cyclical stocks on rising optimism about a global economic recovery.

Other sectors, which rise and fall along with the economic cycles, such as industrials, energy and mining companies, also had inflows in the week.
Among commodity funds, precious metal funds saw net sales of $1.74 billion, the fifth consecutive weekly outflow, signalling investors are looking past safer assets such as gold and willing to take higher risks.

Chief Executive Officer Simon Hu resigned from the company, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, as the company overhauls its business.
Hu resigned for personal reasons, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. Eric Jing, already Ant’s chairman, will become CEO as well effective immediately, the person said. An Ant spokesperson confirmed Hu’s resignation.
Hu, who joined  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. in 2005 after working at China’s second-largest lender China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF), had built a reputation for rolling out new innovations such as using data analytics to offer collateral-free financing services to small businesses and helping Alibaba beat Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). to build Asia’s largest cloud business.
He moved from Alibaba to Ant in November 2018 as President, and took over as CEO in December 2019.
Ant has been at the center of a regulatory crackdown as China taking aim at the push of technology firms into finance. Its $35 billion initial public offering was abruptly suspended in November. China’s central bank subsequently directed the Hangzhou-based firm to turn itself into a financial holding company, a move that would subject it to capital restrictions, the need for fresh licenses and ownership scrutiny. The overhaul could slash the financial juggernaut’s valuation by about 60% from the $280 billion it was pegged at last year, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Francis Chan has estimated.
The resignation comes days after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang pledged at the National People’s Congress to expand oversight of financial technology, stamp out monopolies, and prevent the “unregulated” expansion of capital. All three of the nation’s financial watchdogs have made it their primary goal this year to curb the “reckless” push of technology firms into finance.

1101,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 07:54AM ET</span>",Italy Eyes Return to Lockdown a Year After Pandemic Started,"(Bloomberg) -- The government of Prime Minister Mario Draghi has approved strict new curbs for most of Italy, with the country’s most populous regions facing a lockdown as the coronavirus pandemic worsens.
Draghi’s cabinet approved a decree automatically designating regions as high-risk “red zones” if they have more than 250 weekly cases per 100,000 inhabitants, according to a statement from his office.
The rules will go into effect Monday and combined with measures already triggered by the spread of the virus, they could effectively send a number of regions, including those surrounding Milan and Rome, into lockdown. That would affect as many as two-thirds of Italians.
The measures bring Italy almost full-circle just over a year after it became the first Western country to go into a lockdown. Infections have reached a three-month high since the more contagious U.K. strain appeared in the country amid a sluggish vaccine roll-out.
Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, is seeking to speed up the vaccination campaign to both counter the pandemic and restart an economy that shrank 8.9% last year. The country registered 25,673 new cases Thursday, compared to 22,409 the previous day.
Strictest Controls
As many as 14 of Italy’s 20 regions could now fall under the strictest level of controls. Bars and restaurants in these areas will be closed, as will schools and many stores. Citizens will mostly be confined to their homes. In medium-risk “orange areas,” two adults can visit a private home within their municipality once a day until April 2, according to the draft.
Health Minister Roberto Speranza on Friday evening will issue an order establishing how regions’ risk-level ratings will change, based on the latest data and other parameters.
The new restrictions are due to remain in force until April 6. During the Easter holidays, from April 3 to April 5, all of Italy will be classified a red zone, except for a few areas which are at the minimal contagion-risk level, according to the statement.
The premier has faced objections from two parties in his coalition, the anti-migrant League led by Matteo Salvini and Silvio Berlusconi’s center-right Forza Italia, which have pushed to keep businesses open in at least some areas.
Draghi on Friday afternoon will visit a vaccination center at Rome’s Fiumicino airport, where he’ll give a speech on containment efforts. The administration is targeting inoculations by summer for all Italians who want them. So far, 6.1 million vaccine doses have been administered, with only 3% of the population fully vaccinated.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A World Health Organization expert advisory committee is currently looking at AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine after some countries paused distribution of it, but there is no reason not to use it, a spokeswoman said on Friday.
Health authorities in several countries including Denmark, Norway, Iceland have suspended the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine following reports of the formation of blood clots in some people who have been vaccinated.
Margaret Harris told a briefing that it was an ""excellent vaccine"" and that no causal relationship had been established between the shot and the health problems reported, calling the pause in use ""a precautionary measure"".
""It's very important to understand that, yes, we should continue to be using the AstraZeneca vaccine,"" she said.
The WHO's global advisory committee on vaccine safety is currently reviewing the reports and will revert on its findings, she added, as it does with any safety issues.
""It is very important we are hearing safety signals because if we were not hearing about safety signals that would suggest there is not enough review and vigilance"","" she said.
The AstraZeneca vaccine is the main shot in the early phase of a WHO-led global vaccine sharing scheme COVAX that aims to distribute 2 billion doses this year, ensuring access for poorer countries.
WHO data shows that more than 268 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from various developers have been administered worldwide and no deaths have been found to have been caused by them, Harris said.
The Geneva-based body has given emergency use listing for the Pfizer/BioNTech and versions of the AstraZeneca vaccines -- a step that broadens access to those shots considerably.
Asked about the timing of emergency listings for China's Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech vaccines, she said reviews were now underway and approval would ""probably"" be given this month.

""I don't want to put an exact date on depending on all sorts of issues but we would expect by the end of March,"" she added, saying that it partly depends on how quickly developers provide the requested responses.

However, the bond market has started to flash warning signs about how this package will be financed, with yields starting to spike again. Thursday’s $24 billion auction of 30-year U.S. Treasuries drew solid results, but a sharp reduction in foreign demand.
The yield on the benchmark 10-Year Treasury note stood at 1.60%, just below last week’s one-year high of just over 1.62%.
This abrupt rise in bond yields has put significant pressure on high-growth tech stocks as they reduce the relative value of future profits as well as increasing borrowing costs.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) paid Chief Executive Christian Sewing 7.4 million euros ($8.8 million) in 2020, up 46% from a year earlier, prompting criticism from unions and politicians. 
The bank's bonus pool was up 29% as it rewarded staff for a pandemic-related trading boom, which helped the German lender to eke out a profit after years of losses.
The disclosure in the bank's annual report on Friday came as Deutsche said revenue would be ""marginally lower"" this year. 
In Germany, which is facing an election year and where the public disapproves of high pay, the Verdi labour union called the payouts ""grossly disproportionate"" and politicians were critical.
""It doesn't fit with the times that Deutsche Bank, which has also indirectly benefited from bailouts time and again, is having a coronavirus party,"" Fabio De Masi, a member of Germany's parliament, said in a statement to Reuters.
Last year marked a turnaround for Deutsche and Sewing, who took up his post in 2018, after the bank had faced a series of costly regulatory failings, including over money laundering.
The bank has lost 8.2 billion euros over the last decade.
Its 2020 net profit attributable to shareholders was 113 million euros after a loss of 5.7 billion the year before as a surge in investment banking earnings offset weakness in other businesses.
""In 2020, we made great progress on our transformation into a sustainably profitable bank, and were even more relevant for our clients,"" Sewing said in a statement. 
The bank's management board waived some of their pay in solidarity with those suffering from the impact of the coronavirus crisis, the statement noted.
The rise in the so-called bonus pool for the whole bank to 1.9 billion euros brings it to about the same level as 2018. 
Deutsche has handed out bonuses as workers at the bank's call centres strike over demands for higher wages. Some of those workers earn as little as 12 euros an hour, according to union officials.
Jan Duscheck, who oversees the banking industry at the Verdi trade union, said that it did not add up that top earners get big increases while those at the bottom of the pay scale get next to nothing.
""Such a remuneration policy creates an extremely poor image of the bank and it should be urgently corrected,"" Duscheck said in a statement to Reuters.
Sewing's package puts him among the more highly paid European bank CEOs this year for those that have disclosed pay packages so far. 
At  Barclays  (LON:BARC), CEO Jes Staley was paid 4 million pounds ($5.57 million), down from 5.9 million pounds a year earlier.
Executives at some other banks have also agreed to forgo pay to show support for people affected by the pandemic. 

Santander (MC:SAN)'s executive chairman Ana Botin and chief executive Jose Antonio Alvarez had their total pay reduced by 50% for 2020. Outgoing UniCredit chief executive Jean-Pierre Mustier gave up his variable compensation for 2020 and cut the rest of his pay by a quarter.

1107,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 06:20AM ET</span>",StockBeat: AstraZeneca's New Woes Leave Stock Close to Critical Levels,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- AstraZeneca’s latest spat with the European Union over its Covid-19 vaccine spells trouble for both parties.
Relations between the two have taken a serious turn for the worse this week as Denmark and Austria have both suspended distribution over concerns about possible links to blood clotting problems that have caused at least one death.  
The Danish and Austrian moves, which were followed by Bulgaria, Luxembourg, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia as well as non-EU members Norway, Iceland and Thailand, revive concerns about the drug which has suffered more than its fair share of reputational problems thanks to ill-informed interventions from France’s President Emmanuel Macron and various elements within the German government.
The European Medicines Agency on Thursday repeated that it still considers the drug safe, and that its benefits outweigh the risks.
But Astra has another source of worry. It has already told the EU that it won’t be able to deliver more than half the 180 million doses of vaccine that it has contractually committed to in the second quarter. It had hoped to make good some of its shortfall by exporting vaccine from the U.S., but Reuters reported on Thursday that Washington had blocked such a move.
The report came on the same day that President Joe Biden announced an acceleration in the U.S.’s national vaccination plans.
Astra CEO Pascal Soriot could be forgiven for changing his job title to “Political Football”. His company has already been caught in the middle of a bad-tempered dispute between the U.K., which has rushed through regulatory approval and expedited its distribution in a campaign that appears – so far – to be one of the most successful anywhere in the world. Almost one-third of the U.K. adult population now has some degree of immunity through vaccination, nearly double the rate in the U.S. and streets ahead of France and Germany, where less than 7% have such protection.
To be caught now in a fresh diplomatic row with the U.S. must be particularly galling, especially since AZN’s drug is still awaiting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the positive spin is that the U.S. position implies that it is required for domestic consumption, which implies the FDA will soon give it the green light).
The delays all threaten to stop AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) building market share in what is destined to be a profitable market for the foreseeable future. The company had appeared to have a good position thanks to its policy of pricing this year’s shipments on a no-profit basis, something that mitigated its relatively poor showing on efficacy. Its sales contracts reportedly allow it to raise prices once the pandemic is declared over.
As has been pointed out, the long-term future of AstraZeneca revolves much more around its cancer drugs than its Covid-19 vaccine, but the weakness in the stock is now approaching a critical level, threatening an upward trend line going back to 2017.  That trend is the expression of the galvanizing effect Soriot has had on the company since taking over as CEO.  Any further negative news flow could push the stock below important support levels.
AstraZeneca isn’t the only vaccine maker suffering such weakness.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) have also all lost over 20% from their 2020 highs as their drugs allow investors to seek better returns in beaten-down cyclicals. All the same, Soriot’s magic touch, which made AstraZeneca the most valuable stock in the FTSE 100, seems to have deserted the company."

PARIS (Reuters) - French retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) has been fined 1.75 million euros ($2.1 million) for unfairly pressing suppliers for discounts during annual contract negotiations, the finance ministry said in Friday.
The ruling by the Paris Commerce Court follows a probe by anti-trust authorities into Carrefour's practices during its 2016 negotiations with suppliers, the statement said.
The investigation found that Carrefour had forced suppliers to give discounts as a pre-condition to entering annual price negotiations.
The court ordered Carrefour to stop what it called ""practices that restrict competition"" and requested the provisional execution of the fine.
Carrefour said it had put an end to the incriminated practices since February 2016 and would not appeal.
""The court did not reject the principle of seeking a discount but considered the discount was not sufficiently justified in its application,"" a Carrefour spokeswoman said.

1109,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 05:55AM ET</span>","Get used to enterprise value in climate reporting, says global regulator","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Bone up on enterprise value reporting, a global securities watchdog said on Friday, as regulators wrestle with the complex task of creating common international standards for corporate sustainability disclosures.
Enterprise value reporting measures how climate and other sustainability-related issues can erode a company's total worth.
To stop companies from ""greenwashing"" - or painting a flattering picture of their compliance with sustainability goals - standard-setters want to replace the current patchwork of disclosures with a global approach.
Global consistency would focus on enterprise value creation, said Ashley Alder, chair of IOSCO, an umbrella group whose board includes representatives of securities regulators from, among others, the United States, China, Japan, major European Union states and Britain.
""That's a key new phrase everyone has to get used to,"" Alder, who also heads Hong Kong's securities watchdog, told an Afore Consulting event. ""Things are moving rapidly."" 
The EU's European Securities and Markets Authority chair Steven Maijoor, however cautioned that a complete set of global disclosure standards would not be available in the short to medium term.
Global accounting standards body the IFRS Foundation will set out a blueprint for a separate disclosure standards board in time for the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow in November.
It is expected to focus on disclosures measuring the impact of sustainability issues on a company.
But the EU, which this week began rolling out its own rules on disclosures without waiting for the new board, wants ""double materiality"" or inclusion of a company's impact on the environment as well.
Maijoor said investors wanted double materiality given that over the longer term a company's impact on the environment will affect its value.
""I would hope that in the medium to long term we would move to one set of international standards because that would be to the benefit of investors,"" he said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has set up a team of Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) bankers in Hong Kong to focus on a rush of these blank cheque deals emerging in the Asian region.
The initiative was put in place towards the end of last year - but has not been reported - when SPACs started taking off in Asia following rapid growth in these deals elsewhere, including in the United States. 
A SPAC typically raises money to acquire a private company with the purpose of taking it public, allowing such targets to move more quickly to the public markets than via a traditional initial public offering.
Raghav Maliah, the global vice chairman of Goldman Sachs’ investment banking division, leads the Hong Kong-based team which also consists of Vikram Chavali and Edward Byun.
""We are seeing a great deal of capital markets and M&A activity across the region, including increased SPAC involvement both on the IPO and M&A fronts,"" Maliah told Reuters in an interview.
""SPACs have become an incrementally relevant product for consideration when they think through ways to achieve their goals.""
Chavali, an investment banking managing director, covers technology, media and telecom (TMT) sectors for Goldman Sachs across Asia Pacific ex-Japan.
Byun is an Equity Capital Markets (ECM) managing director specialising in TMT and high growth sectors across the region.Goldman's specialist team contrasts with most other ""bulge bracket"" investment banks operating across Asia, which carry out SPAC work primarily through their ECM businesses.
In Asia, SPAC deal volumes are some way behind those in the United States.
There have been $2.64 billion worth of SPAC deals in Asia so far in 2021, which is already more than $2.46 billion for 2020, based on Dealogic data.
Globally, there have been $79.3 billion worth of SPACs issues since the start of the year, almost eclipsing the $83.3 billion raised in total for 2020, the Dealogic data showed.

 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) is the most active SPAC bookrunner with a 14% share of the market worldwide, ahead of Goldman Sachs at 12% and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) at 9%, based on Dealogic data.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Zurich private bank Rahn+Bodmer will pay $22 million to settle U.S. criminal charges it helped American taxpayers who were exiting accounts at UBS and other Swiss banks and hiding hundreds of millions of dollars in offshore accounts.
The agreement is the latest in the U.S. Department of Justice's long-running pursuit of Swiss banks for helping people evade U.S. taxes, resulting in billions of dollars in settlements, fines and restitution from financial institutions in Switzerland including UBS and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). 
U.S. prosecutors said on Thursday that the Swiss bank admitted wrongdoing including helping clients defraud the Internal Revenue Service and entered a three-year deferred prosecution agreement after being accused of conspiring to help clients evade U.S. taxes and file false tax returns. 
Zurich's oldest private bank, Rahn+Bodmer was founded in 1750 and last year had 13.6 billion Swiss francs ($14.71 billion) of client assets under management. It will cooperate with the Justice Department's crackdown on offshore tax evasion.
Neither Rahn+Bodmer nor its New York-based lawyer responded to requests for comment.
Rahn+Bodmer admitted to having from 2004 to 2012 held undeclared accounts on behalf of approximately 340 U.S. taxpayers who together evaded about $16.4 million of U.S. taxes in that period, the Justice Department said.
Its alleged misconduct included opening accounts under pseudonyms or ""sham"" foundations in Liechtenstein and Panama, and for clients who were exiting UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) and other Swiss banks.
Rahn+Bodmer agreed to pay a $7.4 million fine, forfeit $9.7 million of fees, and make $4.9 million of restitution.
UBS agreed in 2009 to pay a $780 million penalty to settle U.S. charges it helped wealthy U.S. clients evade taxes, and handed over names and data on thousands of client accounts, helping kick off numerous settlements involving other Swiss financial institutions.

The companies included Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), Didi Chuxing, SoftBank and a ByteDance-backed firm, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said in a statement on Friday.
The companies were fined 500,000 yuan ($77,000) each for behaviour that caused market concentration but did not exclude all competition from other companies, SAMR said.
Tencent said in a statement it would actively rectify operations and provide the regulator with timely reports on deals in future.
ByteDance said a joint venture between its affiliated firm and Shanghai Dongfang Newspaper Co Ltd, which were both fined, was never in operation and the JV was disbanded in January.
SoftBank declined to comment. Baidu and Didi did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
China has stepped up scrutiny of its internet giants in recent months, citing concerns over monopolistic behaviour and potential infringement of consumer rights.

The regulator has fined  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Tencent-backed China Literature and other firms for not reporting deals properly for anti-trust reviews. It also fined company involved in an auto-related deal on Thursday.

In an unscheduled trading update, the company famous for its trench coats said comparable store retail sales in the last quarter of its financial year to March 27 were expected to be 28% to 32% higher than the same period last year.
""Since December, we have continued to see a strong rebound and now expect revenue and adjusted operating profit to be ahead of consensus expectations,"" it said.
Shares in Burberry jumped as much as 10% in early deals to the highest level since Jan. 22, 2020. They were trading up 8.3% at 2,153 pence at 0859 GMT.
For the full year, it said it expected group revenue to decline by 10% to 11%, while its adjusted operating margin would to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%.
Analysts on average had expected group revenue at constant exchange rates to fall 13% for the year, according to a consensus compiled by the company in January.
Burberry, which showed its first menswear-focused collection by designer Riccardo Tisci last month, has seen a strong recovery in sales in mainland China and South Korea.
Growth in Asia has in part offset declines in Europe, where regional COVID-19 lockdowns and travel restrictions have shut stores and deterred tourists.
Rival luxury groups have also seen recoveries in the important Chinese market.
Italian fashion house Prada (OTC:PRDSY) and luxury goods group Salvatore Ferragamo said this week that strength in China had boosted sales this year.

Burberry will publish its full-year results on May 13.

(Reuters) - Rising bond yields dragged European stocks lower on Friday, although major bourses were set for weekly gains as stimulus and vaccination programmes spurred hopes of a solid economic recovery. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.5% after a four-session winning streak drove it to pre-pandemic highs a day earlier.
Tame U.S. inflation data and signs from the European Central Bank that it was ready to accelerate money-printing to keep a lid on borrowing costs helped boost risk appetite this week, putting the benchmark STOXX 600 on course for a more than 3% weekly gain.
However, with government bond yields in the United States and Europe rising again on Friday, investors took some money off the table. 
""On one hand, we had the ECB that tried to talk down yields, but at the same time we had the final approval of the big Biden stimulus package that drove U.S. yields somewhat higher again,"" said Bert Colijn, senior euro zone economist at ING. 
""So this maybe an American story that will remain in the driver's seat to a degree, with the ECB as an important counterweight to that.""
U.S. President Joe Biden signed a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill into law on Thursday, with direct deposits from the legislation expected to go to Americans as early as this weekend.
While the stimulus is expected to give a boost to the U.S. economy, it has also raised worries about a spike in inflation that could push central banks to tighten monetary policy.
Tech sector fell the most in Europe, down 1.7%, while automakers and miners also weighed.
Dutch tech investor Prosus (OTC:PROSF), which holds a third of Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), dropped 4.9% as China's market regulator fined 12 companies including Tencent related to deals that demonstrated illegal monopolistic behaviours.
German carmaker Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) declined 2.5% after French rival  Renault  (PA:RENA) sold its entire stake in the company at a discount.
BMW was down 2.2% after saying its operating profit for 2020 fell due to the COVID-19 pandemic, despite a strong second-half rebound in sales.
British luxury group Burberry jumped 8.4% to the top of STOXX 600 after saying it had seen a strong rebound in sales since December.

1117,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 04:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: India is likely to be included in global bond index by October - sources,"By Aftab Ahmed and Swati Bhat
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India is confident of getting included in a global bond index by October but it will not be able to raise funds in the coming financial year as the actual listing could take around 12 months after its inclusion, said two senior sources aware of the discussions. 
Since 2019, India has been working toward getting included in global bond indexes as rising government borrowing has necessitated opening the largely domestic bond market to a broader investor base.
India was hopeful of completing the listing in the upcoming financial year, starting on April 1, as it would help bring down borrowing costs, which have been rising in recent weeks due to a lack of appetite amid high supply, one of the sources said.
The government plans to issue bonds worth $165.24 billion to fund its spending programme in the upcoming fiscal year to revive the pandemic-hit economy from a slump.
    ""The indices will be reviewed in September. We have dealt with most of their concerns, we should be able to resolve the other issues too,"" said one of the sources, referring to an index provider.
""We expect to be included in at least one of the two major indexes in September or October,"" he said.
However, he said the actual listing could take longer and would not be concluded before the end of the fiscal year. 
The finance ministry and the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Last September, J.P. Morgan opted not to include India's government bonds in one of its flagship emerging market indexes after investors cited problems with capital controls, custody and settlement and other operational snags.
    Two other senior officials said India was in the final stages of negotiating with Euroclear for settlement of Indian bonds and that could likely be a precursor for a bond listing as it would allay most investor concerns.
'OPEN UP MORE'
India expects to get approval from major index operators like J.P. Morgan and Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in September as it is planning to move fast on resolving taxation concerns of investors in these passive funds and bond settlement issues by August, the first source said.
Bloomberg and J.P Morgan did not respond to requests for comment.
Several bonds are now part of the ""Fully Accessible Route"" (FAR) and as of January, the outstanding FAR bonds were over $145 billion. The government sets a limit on foreign institutional investors' government securities purchases, but the FAR category introduced in 2020 is free from such limits.
""We have already opened investments through the fully accessible route and securities across the curve are available from five to 30 years. We will definitely open up more securities on a need basis,"" a second source said requesting anonymity.
There have been concerns about outflows if the bond market is fully opened to foreign investors and what is largely thought of as ""hot money"" flows that flood in to chase high yields but can exit just as quickly during times of distress.
Over the last couple of years, however, there has been a shift in the attitude of regulators and the government towards the global bond indexes, which largely have passive fund houses among their investor base, which are known to be longer-term investors.
The government is expecting to be given a 3-4% weightage initially for the first 2-3 years after listing, which is expected to be raised gradually to 10% over five years, the first official said.
India has one of the largest bond markets among emerging-market economies with more than $800 billion in debt stock. Long-held restrictions on foreign buying of its bonds have kept it out of the top benchmarks used by global money managers and an inclusion could be a landmark change.

1122,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 02:05AM ET</span>","Close EU scrutiny of Brexit hubs to continue indefinitely, says regulator","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Close scrutiny of UK financial firms' European Union outposts will continue indefinitely, the bloc's securities watchdog said, as regulators begin a round of new checks on how they are operating. 
Hundreds of trading and investment firms from the City of London have set up shop in the EU to avoid disrupting business with the bloc by relocating staff and assets.
The costly investment was vindicated by an UK-EU trade deal that left UK financial services largely cut off from the continent after Britain left the EU's orbit on Dec. 31.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) had checked the licence applications from new hubs in case national regulators were offering sweeteners.
ESMA Chair Steven Maijoor said the watchdog has now begun reviewing how the licences are working on the ground in a process that will continue indefinitely to ensure sufficient activity and senior staff.
""How you structure your business between the UK and the EU, that will be an ongoing issue. There will be new business models, there will be new questions around how can you organise that,"" Maijoor told Reuters.
""Although it will not be done in the context of Brexit, the UK and EU will continue to be very interconnected markets and so there will be on a continuous basis questions around how do you ensure proper supervisable entities in the EU.""
The close scrutiny will test post-Brexit relations between Britain and the bloc, already strained by clashes over Northern Ireland and COVID-19 vaccines.
Both sides aim to agree a cooperation pact in financial regulation by the end of March, a first step in restoring trust and potential UK market access further down the road.
A former regulator in the Netherlands, Maijoor is due to step down from ESMA after 10 years at the helm, having overseen a watchdog that has steadily increased its powers and reach.
There is no need for a U.S.-style super-regulator but it would be ""very logical"" for ESMA to build on the Brexit checks to become the EU regulatory gateway for market participants from any part of the world that want to operate in the bloc.
""If market participants can choose 27 member states to locate themselves then there is obviously a high risk of regulatory competition,"" Maijoor said.
EU policymakers breathed a sigh of relief when there was no market disorder in January due to severing most of the City's access to the bloc.
Maijoor said assessments by UK and EU regulators of risks to market stability ahead of Brexit had proved to be on the mark. EU curbs on City access led to swathes of euro stock and swaps trading leaving London for the bloc and New York without a hiccup.
Regulators focused on stability, not on avoiding splits in markets, he said.

""With Brexit comes fragmentation, that is what Brexit is about, it's a decision by the UK to leave the EU.""

1123,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 01:21AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's JD.com in talks to purchase stake in brokerage worth $1.5 billion - sources,"By Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc is in talks to buy part or all of a stake in brokerage Sinolink Securities worth at least $1.5 billion, three people said, as the e-commerce major aims to bolster its financial services operations.
A deal to buy the stake from Sinolink's largest shareholder, Yongjin Group, would be the biggest bet in acquisition value terms by Beijing-based JD.com in China's $45 trillion financial market. 
""The valuable brokerage licence is key for tech giants to monetise their huge online traffic and grow into bigger firms, as otherwise they have to direct such traffic to other financial institutions,"" one of the sources said. 
China's 2nd-biggest e-commerce company by revenue started discussions with Yongjin late last year, seeking to buy part or all of its 27% stake, said two of the people with direct knowledge of the matter.
Based on Sinolink's market value of 39 billion yuan ($6 billion) on Thursday, a 27% stake would be worth about 10 billion yuan, Reuters calculations show.
Sinolink shares jumped by their maximum 10% daily limit on Friday afternoon after Reuters reported the discussions, reversing earlier losses.
The potential deal comes as Chinese tech majors are keen to expand into financial services despite a regulatory crackdown on some parts of the sector, sources said. 
JD.com gets the bulk of its revenue from its core e-commerce business and owns only a few small financial licences, mainly offering online services including consumer credit and wealth management products. It has long eyed a foray into the fast-growing brokerage industry which was worth $1.4 trillion as of end-2020, said the same two people. 
Chengdu-based Sinolink was just outside the top 20 biggest brokerages in China by operating revenue in 2019, official data showed. Its business includes stock broking, sponsoring and underwriting equity and debt deals, financial advisory and wealth management. 
China's top two tech giants,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and Tencent, hold stakes in the country's leading investment bank, China International Capital Corp. Alibaba has also invested in large broker Huatai Securities, while Tencent has backed Hong Kong-based online brokerage  Futu Holdings  (NASDAQ:FUTU). 
According to Refinitiv, JD.com has only made two deals in the financial sector so far: its investment in online platform for automotive financing Yixin Capital's $550 million fundraising in 2016, and another investment worth an undisclosed amount in China Taiping Insurance Holdings' financial services unit in 2018. 
The JD.com-Yongjin talks were at an early stage and subject to change, cautioned the sources, who declined to be identified due to confidentially constraints. 
JD.com, Yongjin and Sinolink did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
TIGHTER REGULATION
For privately run Yongjin, the potential deal would satisfy its plan to divest its financial services business to bypass new regulations on financial holdings firms, said the third person.
The new rules require a capital threshold for companies that operate more than two types of financial businesses. Should a company fail to meet the requirement after a one-year grace period, Beijing can force a share sale.
In September, Guolian Securities said it would acquire Sinolink through a share swap and stake purchase from Yongjin, exchange filings showed. The tie-up was later scrapped amid questions over potential insider trading activities.

Founded in 1995 by late entrepreneur Wei Dong and now run by his wife, Chen Jinxia, Yongjin manages more than 400 billion yuan of assets, with 30 billion yuan self-owned, according to its website.

1124,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 01:11AM ET</span>","As vaccine nationalism deepens, governments pay to bring production home","By Caroline Copley, Andreas Rinke and Allison Martell
DESSAU, Germany (Reuters) - In the German town of Dessau, one of the sites of the Bauhaus art school, an institute was set up in 1921 to mass-produce vaccines that later helped strengthen the German Democratic Republic. Exactly 100 years later, the site is gearing up to be a one-stop shop to produce COVID-19 vaccines for Germany's pandemic response.
It's just one example of a rash of efforts by governments across the globe to access fragmented vaccine production, after manufacturing setbacks deprived European Union members of drugs made on their own soil this year. From Australia to Thailand, states planning home-based vaccine plants are starting to reshape the industry.
The German venture has the backing of the regional government, as part of a national effort to secure supplies and add vaccines to Germany's exports. Saxony-Anhalt premier Reiner Haseloff said he believes Germany could become a swing producer of vaccines, in the same way that power companies maintain capacity for times of strong demand.
""Ultimately, this is comparable to the energy industry, where the state also pays to keep power plants in reserve,"" Haseloff told Reuters. 
Unlike the United States, where the government's Operation Warp Speed began funding the expansion and retrofit of pharmaceutical manufacturing sites early in the pandemic, few countries globally have the option to commandeer factories. The German plan is one of more than half a dozen by governments around the world to avert shortages by supporting drug companies' local production. 
Some - including Australia, Brazil, Japan and Thailand - are setting up manufacturing partnerships with Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) PLC. Elsewhere, Italy has pledged state backing for a public-private vaccine production centre, while Austria, Denmark and Israel plan a joint research and development fund and will explore whether to produce their own next-generation vaccines.
India plays a significant role in vaccine production globally, and the United States, Japan and Australia also plan to help finance vaccine production capacity there, a senior U.S. administration official told Reuters.
The moves aim to address a global shortage of doses. With vaccines key to restart economies, some countries have pre-purchase agreements to secure their supply.
2 BILLION DOSES
The vaccine crunch in Europe has shown that states that depend on deliveries from multinationals can be vulnerable. In January, AstraZeneca cut supplies to the bloc by more than half for the first and second quarters, and told Brussels it was not able to divert Belgian-made drugs that were earmarked for the United Kingdom. The cut heightened tensions between London and Brussels and prompted European leaders to set curbs on exports of vaccines made in the EU - starting this month, when Italy blocked exports of AstraZeneca's shot.
Germany is a net importer of all vaccines, with a $720 million trade deficit in this area. Berlin plans to change that, and Germany's former ""Bacterial Institute of the Anhalt Counties"" in Dessau will help. Now a family-owned firm called IDT Biologika, it and AstraZeneca plan to invest more than 100 million euros ($120 million) to expand the plant into a factory for complete vaccines. 
The company says it aims to make between 30 million and 40 million doses a month from the end of 2022, producing the bulk vaccine and also dispensing it into vials, which Chief Executive Juergen Betzing told Reuters would make it one of Europe's biggest manufacturers and add capacity for at least 360 million doses a year from within the EU. 
Germany has not yet reserved the right to purchase any of these vaccines, but the government wants to come up with a plan on measures to support and incentivise long-term vaccine production capacity by May 1, according to a document seen by Reuters. A government source said drug company representatives have told Berlin long-term purchase guarantees would be more important to their investment decisions than aid. 
The IDT plant will also be able to produce vaccines for other companies and, together with a cluster of firms in Saxony-Anhalt, form the heart of a government strategy to make Germany a new centre for vaccine production in Europe. 
Berlin is targeting an annual capacity of 2 billion COVID vaccine doses from IDT and other facilities, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. For comparison, AstraZeneca has stated its ambitions to produce up to 3 billion doses of its vaccine by the end of this year, which would make it the largest COVID-19 vaccine producer globally. 
Berlin's target could prove to be far in excess of the EU's needs for its 450 million people, but it isn't yet clear how often vaccinations will be needed to bolster immunity. 
The COVID pandemic is an unprecedented challenge to inoculate billions. While the drugs are badly needed in the near term, such piecemeal plans reflect the lack of any coherent global strategy to cover vaccination in a pandemic, which the world needs, according to Robert Van Exan, a consultant and former  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) executive. 
""It takes time to build that infrastructure properly, and some thought has to go into it,"" Van Exan said.
LESSONS LEARNED
Previous vaccine disputes between allies have served as a prelude to the COVID-era fight for supplies.
In a flu scare in 1976, the United States blocked vaccine exports, derailing a vaccination plan in Canada. Ottawa learned a lesson: During the H1N1 flu pandemic of 2009, it bought drugs from a local producer, and waited until its outbreak was largely over before then donating extra doses to the World Health Organization.
And then, in the years after the 2009 pandemic, Washington paid hundreds of millions to several companies to build or expand private facilities that could be used to make and package a pandemic vaccine on short notice within the country's borders.
When COVID-19 hit, at least two of those sites became part of Operation Warp Speed, producing vaccines for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), AstraZeneca and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc . Federal officials used the Defense Production Act to put participating companies first in line for supplies made by other U.S. companies, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers directly oversaw some construction projects. When companies struggled to hire enough qualified staff, 16 Department of Defense employees were sent to work in quality control at two manufacturing sites, according to a recent federal report. 
RUBIK'S CUBE
Globally, vaccines are manufactured across drug firms' existing networks and often need to pass through several countries - and even between continents - before they are ready to inject into arms. Within the EU alone, more than 30 plants from Sweden to Spain are involved in the production of COVID-19 vaccines. AstraZeneca says it has manufacturing capacity in 25 sites across 15 countries, in a chain of partnerships that one company executive likens to a Rubik's Cube puzzle.
It's a similar picture for others, including vaccines made by Russia and China, and hitches are common when trying to accelerate production across multiple sites and borders. Switzerland-based Lonza Group AG makes the ingredients for Moderna's vaccine which then go to Spain to be put into vials. J&J's shot is made in the Netherlands and sent to the United States for bottling. Pfizer-BioNTech has contracted factories across a network of 13 sites to meet production needs this year - their supplies to Europe also briefly fell short when a plant had to be re-engineered.
But friction between AstraZeneca and the EU in Brussels has continued to chafe since a supplier to the drugmaker in Seneffe, Belgium ran into difficulty in January. 
AstraZeneca's vaccine production starts with living cells being infected with a modified form of the virus. The cells are grown in tanks, or bioreactors, harvested and purified over about two months. Once the active ingredient is created, water and proteins are added and the liquid is bottled - a stage known as 'fill and finish.' Sometimes, different stages happen at different sites.
Problems at the Belgian plant, combined with AstraZeneca's contractual commitments to supply the United Kingdom, meant that even though the product involved was made a short drive from Brussels, EU citizens were left wanting. 
The German company IDT Biologika now plans to cover all stages of the cycle. Other German vaccine developers BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) and CureVac NV, which are at the forefront of new vaccine technology and have both received government funding, will also be part of Germany's cluster. BioNTech recently brought a new German plant online to produce up to 750 million doses per year and pharma giant  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) will help make CureVac's shot.
The developers of the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V, have also made inquiries about producing it in the region, Saxony-Anhalt premier Haseloff said. Russia's sovereign wealth fund Russia's Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which is promoting Sputnik V internationally, declined to comment. 
AstraZeneca's arrangement with IDT is similar to other deals the company has reached, for instance in Japan and Australia. Arrangements like this also help reduce the risk for companies.
AstraZeneca declined to comment on the deals it has reached, but one of its executives has said in the past the company tried hard to create independent supply chains to enable full access to the vaccine around the world.
MAKING MONEY
Building up vaccine production capacity makes sense given the need to vaccinate the world, potentially repeatedly, against COVID-19, as well as the threat of future pandemics. 
But large manufacturing sites are the most efficient and at some point, extra capacity spread across many countries may not be economical.
Prashant Yadav, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Center for Global Development, said the advantages of scale kick in once you can produce at least 100 million doses per year. 
He believes four or five countries could likely scale up without raising costs, but if many build small operations, ""I think we get to a point where everybody will end up paying a higher price."" 
In Canada, the federal government is building a publicly-owned facility in Montreal that would make about 2 million vaccine doses per month beginning next year, leaving it well below that 100 million annual dose threshold.

Asked if the small size will raise costs, Canada's National Research Council said it is not meant to compete with the private sector: ""The objective of the facility is to respond quickly to future health emergencies.""

1125,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 01:10AM ET</span>",Asian stocks up on dovish ECB as Biden signs stimulus,"By Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Asian shares rose on Friday after U.S. President Joe Biden signed a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill into law, and after a dovish European Central Bank meeting prompted a retreat in bond yields and eased global concerns about rising inflation.
But European shares, which had jumped on Thursday's ECB meeting, looked set to retreat from a one-year peak a day later. Pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures were down 0.03% and both German DAX futures and FTSE futures were down about 0.2% in early deals. 
Biden signed the stimulus legislation ahead of a televised address in which he pledged aggressive action to speed vaccinations and move the country closer to normality by July 4.
The signing of the American Rescue Plan provided a further boost to market sentiment after the European Central Bank said it was ready to accelerate money-printing to keep a lid on borrowing costs, using its 1.85 trillion euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP) more generously over the coming months to stop any unwarranted rise in debt financing costs.
That and a better-than-expected U.S. government bond auction could support a rally in tech stocks and a rotation between growth and value stocks in the next few weeks, said Cliff Zhao, chief strategist at China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) International in Hong Kong.
""But in the second quarter the market still (will be) very volatile, and especially when we look at the U.S. dollar it's much stronger than expectations around the end of last year. So I think the strong U.S. dollar may weigh on some liquidity conditions in the emerging markets,"" he said.
MSCI's broadest gauge index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.53%, supported by tech gains.
Seoul's KOSPI added 1.39%, Taiwan shares were up 0.27% and Australia's ASX 200 gained 0.79%. 
Japan's Nikkei rose 1.58%, and China's blue-chip CSI300 index inched up 0.05% as sagging high-valuation tech and consumer firms capped gains.
U.S. Treasury yields were higher on Friday, with the 10-year yield at 1.5512% after falling to 1.475% overnight, its first foray below 1.5% in a week. 
The German 10-year yield was last at -0.331% after hitting a three-week low of -0.367%.
""There might be some disappointment (the ECB) didn't expand their bond purchase program but that's largely offset by undertakings to accelerate the purchases,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief markets strategist at CMC Markets. 
On Wall Street, easing inflation worries helped support equities. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.58% and the S&P 500 gained 1.04%, both to record highs. The Nasdaq Composite added 2.52%.
Sentiment was also boosted by weekly jobless claims data, which pointed to a recovering U.S. labor market as vaccine rollouts helped lead to economic reopenings.
Analysts largely expect inflation to pick up as vaccine rollouts lead to a reopening, but worries persist that Biden's stimulus package could overheat the economy.
The dollar gained 0.22% against the yen to 108.73 and the euro fell 0.18% on the day to $1.1963. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, rose 0.14% to 91.568.
Oil prices retreated from sharp gains as the dollar firmed, with U.S. crude dipping 0.41% to $65.75 a barrel. Brent crude lost 0.27% to $69.44 per barrel.

Spot gold prices fell 0.22% to $1,717.70 an ounce.

The rules, the first of their kind released publicly by the financial technology giant, comes some four months after China suspended the group's $37 billion plan for a share listing in both Shanghai and Hong Kong.
Chinese regulators have tightened their grip on fintech companies, amid concerns over systemic financial risks brought by the financial empire affiliated to China's e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group.
In response to the intense regulatory pressure, the group has been reining in some of its operations, taking steps to bring its capital requirements in line with those of banks, and revamping itself into a financial holding firm.
In a statement, Ant said its consumer loan platforms should not issue loans to minors, and must prevent small business loans from flowing into stock and property markets.
The group's credit-rating service Zhima Credit will also not be available to financial institutions including micro loan lenders, it said, without elaborating the specific risk of such collaborations.
As a reflection of regulators' tough stance on financial risks, Guo Shuqing, head of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, warned last week that bubble risk was a core issue facing China's property sector.
About Ant's business restructuring, Guo said there were no restrictions on the financial business it develops but that all of its financial activities should be regulated by laws.

Earlier, Ant lowered its borrowing limits for some young users of its Huabei virtual card product. The credit limit reduction is intended to promote more ""rational"" spending habits among users, it has said.

1127,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 10:50PM ET</span>",Analysis: CNOOC needs to double down on drilling and deals in carbon-cutting gas pivot,"By Chen Aizhu and Muyu Xu
SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - A rapid rise in offshore drilling and deepwater gas extraction may seem an unlikely path to lower emissions, but are central planks of Chinese energy major CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) Ltd’s plan to help hit Beijing's climate goals.
While global peers like BP (NYSE:BP), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) have announced cuts in hydrocarbon output and huge renewable energy investments to cut emissions, China's third-largest oil and gas producer plans an ambitious gas-heavy overhaul of its production mix by 2035 as its way of helping meet carbon-cutting goals.
Beijing views natural gas as a vital 'bridge fuel' to displace dirtier coal. The country aims to cap carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and become ""carbon neutral"" by 2060. 
While many western economies are looking to abandon fossil fuels altogether to fight climate change, China must first take an intermediate step of switching out coal for cleaner-burning gas. Twenty times more electricity was generated from coal than from gas in China in 2019, despite a 200% rise in gas-powered electricity since 2010, according to BP.
GRAPHIC: China's goal & gas consumption, carbon dioxide emissions, and electricity generation mix - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/xlbvgxnzepq/ChinaCoalgasElecMix.png 
CNOOC plans to help close that gap by having gas make up half its output portfolio by 2035, up from 21% currently.
Chief Executive Xu Keqiang last month laid out the firm's multi-pronged gas strategy, which includes ramping up deepsea drilling in the South China Sea and Bohai Bay areas, development of onshore unconventional gas resources, and ""actively scouting for premium global assets"". 
The firm produced 20 bcm of gas in 2019 - equivalent to 6% of China's total consumption - including 11 bcm from domestic fields and the rest from operations in North America, Australia and Europe. 
Readul Islam, analyst at Rystad Energy, said CNOOC will need to more than double gas output to about 45 billion cubic metres (bcm) to meet its 2035 goal, which would put CNOOC on par with global gas majors like Brazil's Petrobras and Norway's Equinor provided these two make no major acquisitions between now and 2035. 
But experts say the firm, which has never operated a deepwater project on its own, faces challenges to meet its target and may be better served by acquiring gas assets from abroad.
""CNOOC needs different types of projects to achieve that goal, but the easiest way could be acquisitions of liquefied natural gas (LNG)-linked assets,"" said Bernstein Research's Neil Beveridge, referring to upstream gas investments tied to long-term LNG supply deals.
DIGGING DEEP
CNOOC told Reuters that it will focus over the near term on developing discoveries such as deepwater Lingshui 17-2 in the South China Sea, where first production is due by late June, and large shallower water condensate fields like Bozhong 19-6 in Bohai Bay which is due online in the third quarter.
Coalbed seam gas projects in north China's Qinshui and Ordos basin will contribute an additional 3.5 billion cubic metres of output in 2021, the company added.
GRAPHIC: CNOOC's domestic gas output by region - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/jbyprajxave/CNOOC%20gas%20output.jpg 
""With a better grasp of geological knowledge and advances in drilling technology in recent years, the company will accelerate building a 'mega gas zone' with a trillion cubic meters (of reserves) in the South China Sea,"" said a CNOOC representative. 
""CNOOC has also identified an inventory of exploratory targets to underpin mid-to-long term production growth.""
GOING SOLO 
Analysts say that actually extracting gas profitably from such an array of deposits is much easier said than done.
Developing fields like Lingshui 17-2, 1,500 meters below the water's surface, as its first fully-owned and solo-operated deepsea project will be a major test of CNOOC's operational capabilities. 
CNOOC has previously tied up with Total in deepwater Nigeria and with Exxon (NYSE:XOM) in Brazil, but only as a stakeholder.
GRAPHIC: CNOOC oil & gas reserves - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/yzdpxeoaqvx/CNOOC%20reserve.jpg 
And with seasoned global deepwater players focusing more on lucrative LNG projects elsewhere, it may be hard for CNOOC to draw new partners for its endeavors in China, said Beveridge and Islam. 
Zhang Xianhui, analyst at Wood Mackenzie, expects CNOOC to make more discoveries in Bohai Bay, a traditional oil-rich zone, after recent large finds Bozhong 19-6 and Bozhong 13-2, located some 5,200 meters below the seabed, ""massively upgraded"" the region's gas potential. 
But with capital also required to build large infrastructure needed to operate at these offshore sites, such as the 120-meter tall, 53,000-tonne Deepsea-1 floating production facility recently delivered to the Lingshui project, CNOOC may need to balance between domestic drilling and investing in lower-cost overseas projects.
""Given our forecast of CNOOC's organic portfolio, it seems clear the one-half gas goal will require gas-weighted acquisitions, and perhaps also disposal of mature oil assets,"" said Rystad's Islam, adding that CNOOC could only grow output by one third to about 27 bcm by 2035 based on current discoveries. 
Projects in Australia, East Africa's Mozambique and Russia's Arctic could be on CNOOC's shopping list, analysts said. 
China's share of global gas use may climb even higher if toughening standards on methane emissions - often from leaky pipelines - accelerate cuts to gas use and speedier uptake of renewables in markets like the United States and Canada.

""Getting them in to the office is best way to get them connected to Goldman Sachs,"" Solomon said during the meeting, which was transcribed and shared with Reuters. 
""We understand that until more of us are vaccinated that is going to be a challenge. But based on the current pace of vaccinations, and where we hope to be by the summer, we believe that we are well-positioned and there is a good chance that we can meet that goal.""
Bringing people back, however, presents a range of challenges, even as countries lift many of last year's coronavirus restrictions. 
Less than 20% of people in the United States have received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, leaving many fearful of getting infected at work or on their way to the office. 
Solomon has continued to work from Goldman's Manhattan headquarters throughout most of the pandemic, a move that some employees say has created pressure to also come to the office.
Some say that pressure is reverberating to other regions.
More than a dozen employees from the company's Bengaluru-based technology and data center told Reuters that many of those who had left the city for hometowns across India last year were now being told they should return. 
""They are asking people to come back but still not forcing people,"" said one employee.
""By mid-April, I think the pressure would be too intense to resist. They are like, 'You should try and come back and see if you like the office vibe and then decide for yourself.'"" 
“We continue to work on plans to return our people to office safely, and those plans will vary division by division, country by country, city by city,"" said Goldman spokeswoman Leslie Shribman. ""The safety of our people is our most important priority and we will remain flexible as we monitor evolving government guidelines and the uneven global vaccine rollout.”
CEO Solomon has been clear he thinks working in the office is better for the bank, employees and its customers. 

""Our people do their best when they forge close bonds with their colleagues,"" Solomon said. ""We found the best way is to work together in person on a regular basis.""

1135,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 06:06PM ET</span>",Sacklers boost opioid settlement offer to $4.3 billion: sources,"By Mike Spector
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Members of the Sackler family who own Purdue Pharma LP have offered roughly $4.3 billion to resolve sprawling opioid litigation, up from $3 billion initially proposed in settlement discussions underway in the OxyContin maker's bankruptcy proceedings, four people familiar with the matter said. 
Sackler family members are now willing to contribute $4.275 billion to help settle about 3,000 lawsuits brought by U.S. communities seeking to hold them and Purdue responsible for damage wrought by the opioid epidemic, the sources said. 
Purdue and representatives for the Sacklers declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests.
Details of a far-reaching settlement could be outlined in a Purdue reorganization plan filed in a U.S. bankruptcy court next week. Purdue filed for bankruptcy in 2019 facing on onslaught of opioid litigation. In November, the Stamford, Connecticut-based company pleaded guilty to three felonies arising from its marketing of prescription opioid painkillers.
A previous proposed settlement that Purdue values at more than $10 billion guaranteed $3 billion from the Sacklers over seven years, with additional funds from family members contingent on sales of other international businesses they own. That offer as a practical matter decreased to $2.775 billion after the Sacklers agreed to pay $225 million to settle a Justice Department civil probe. 
Under terms of the latest proposal, the Sacklers could still use proceeds from sales of those businesses to cover the higher $4.275 billion payout, but would need to make good on it regardless. It is not clear how long the Sacklers would take to pay the proposed higher amount, but it would likely be a period of years, the sources said. 
ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS
Settlement negotiations are ongoing and no final agreement, including on how much the Sacklers will pay, has yet been reached among the family members, Purdue and U.S. communities suing over the opioid crisis.
Elsewhere in the settlement negotiations, some litigants have been pushing for Purdue to explore a sale in lieu of a current proposal to dissolve itself and shift assets to a public benefit company or similar entity run on behalf of plaintiffs and no longer controlled by the Sacklers, two people familiar with the matter said.
Attorneys general from two dozen states and Washington, D.C., have opposed that plan because the new entity would continue selling OxyContin, which they view as improperly entangling them with the addictive painkiller.
Purdue in November admitted to defrauding U.S. officials and paying illegal kickbacks to both doctors and an electronic healthcare records vendor, part of widespread criminal misconduct that facilitated improper opioid prescriptions.
The company overall agreed to $8.3 billion in criminal in civil penalties to resolve U.S. Justice Department probes, most of which will go unpaid. A $3.54 billion criminal penalty and $2.8 billion civil penalty are set to be considered alongside trillions of dollars in unsecured claims as part of Purdue's bankruptcy proceedings. 
Purdue agreed to pay $225 million toward a $2 billion criminal forfeiture, with the Justice Department foregoing the rest if the company's bankruptcy reorganization creates a public benefit company or similar entity steering the remaining $1.775 billion to U.S. communities for combating the opioid crisis.
Sackler family members have not been criminally charged. They agreed to pay $225 million to resolve allegations they caused false claims for OxyContin to be made to government healthcare programs such as Medicare. They have denied the allegations. 
The opioid epidemic has claimed the lives of roughly 450,000 people across the United States since 1999 due to overdoses from prescription painkillers and illegal drugs such as heroin and fentanyl, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Purdue's bankruptcy filing halted litigation against the company and its Sackler family owners. Since then, the company has been working toward proposing a reorganization plan that would serve as blueprint for settling the thousands of outstanding lawsuits.
Purdue's proposal to resolve cases in a deal it values at more than $10 billion is largely contingent on future donations of overdose reversal and addiction treatment medications the company has under development.
How much the Sacklers will contribute has long been a key sticking point in negotiations among family members, Purdue and plaintiffs. Many states rejected their initial $3 billion offer as too low. 

In December, two Sackler family members offered apologies when testifying before a congressional panel over the role OxyContin played in the opioid crisis. The family members, both of whom previously served on Purdue’s board, insisted they were assured by management that the company was meeting regulatory and legal requirements as the opioid crisis unfolded.

The bank was first accused of breaching the laws in 2019 by the country's financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC, which led to parallel probes by corporate regulator ASIC and banking regulator Australian Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Regulation Authority (APRA).
In September last year, Westpac was forced to agree to a record A$1.3 billion ($1.01 billion) payment to settle AUSTRAC's claims.

Investing.com – The S&P and Dow hit record highs on Thursday, powered by a rally in tech stocks and another round of stimulus that investors anticipate will find its way to stocks, keeping the liquidity-driven rally alive.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.58%, or 188 points, to a closing record of 32,485.59, the S&P 500 rose 1.44% to close at a record 3,938.23, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.5%.
President Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus bill was signed into law on Thursday. The stimulus package, which includes $1,400 stimulus checks, is expected to add to the well of liquidity that has underpinned the rally since March last year, and exacerbate the trend of too much money chasing too few opportunities.   
""We believe this speaks to the power of liquidity in this environment- which as we have been pointing out for the past several months, remains unprecedented in modern history (in effect too much money chasing too little supply),"" Janney Montgomery Scott said.
While the markets get ready for another wave of stimulus, investors continue the debate of whether money will be best served in value or growth, though some on Wall Street suggest tech will likely steal the show.  
""While it's a 'buckle the seat belt' time for tech stocks, we believe this sell off has created a golden opportunity for investors to own the secular tech winners for the next 3-5 years,"" Wedbush said in a note. The firm outlined FAANG, cloud, cyber security, 5G, and artificial intelligence stocks to lead the charge higher, underpinned by the growing digital transformation trend that is set to pick up speed.

The 10-year yield remained above 1.5%, but some market participants are backing rates to remain in check following auction results for the 10-year note on Wednesday that suggested current rates were attractive enough for buyers.
Given the selloff in bond prices, which trade inversely to yields/rates, over the past month, there were concerns that the market wasn't ready to buy bonds anticipating a further run up ahead, but the auction results ""seem to be put [those fears] to rest for now,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
Semiconductor stocks rose more than 4% adding to gains in the broader tech sector as investors appeared to take advantage of the recent beatdown in chip stocks.
But it wasn't all green in tech as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) fell 7% after its softer guidance offset better-than-expected fourth-quarter results.
During the recent melt-up in rates, intense debate broke out over the catalyst that had pushed yields up at a rapid pace, with some pinning blame on fears over runway inflation, while others suggested the appreciation was sparked by optimism over the economic recovery.
In recent days, fears that inflation would spiral out of control have eased, and data continues to point to an improving economic recovery.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims decreased by 42,000 to 712,000 in the week ended March 6, the lowest since November and above forecasts for decline to 725,000.

1139,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 04:25PM ET</span>",Ethiopian 737 MAX crash families set to obtain key Boeing documents,"By Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - Families of victims of the deadly 2019 Ethiopian Airlines jet crash may obtain as soon as Thursday Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s reports to U.S. regulators that helped keep its 737 MAX flying after a prior disaster with the same jet in Indonesia five months earlier.
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), an independent U.S. government investigative agency, told  Boeing Co  in a letter on Monday it should turn over nearly 2,000 documents to lawyers representing families who want to determine what the company knew about its flight systems after the Indonesian crash on Lion Air.
The agency said international rules mandate the release of the documents after two years from the crash date, even though Ethiopia has yet to produce a final crash report which the agency cited in blocking the documents until now, according to the letter reviewed by Reuters.
Boeing said it plans to produce the investigation-related information to the plaintiffs beginning today following the NTSB guidance that, at the second anniversary of the Ethiopian accident, the restrictions would be lifted.
The plaintiffs lawyers said they expect the papers to show what Boeing executives knew of defects in the flight system of the newly designed aircraft following the Indonesian crash. An automated flight-control system called MCAS has been implicated in both crashes, which together killed 346 people.
The plane continued to fly until the Ethiopian crash prompted a global grounding.
""What we want to see are the documents upon which Boeing resisted the grounding of the airplane and based its assertion to its customers that the airplane was safe,"" plaintiffs' attorney Justin Green told Reuters.
Any evidence showing that Boeing executives were aware of the 737 MAX problems could expose Boeing to huge punitive damages, which are unusual in air transportation accidents because planes rarely fly with a known deadly defect.
Boeing has already provided plaintiffs 112,587 documents encompassing millions of pages, Greene said, but the records under pursuit are believed to be an important part of the case.
BUILDING A CASE
Boeing has said it has implemented changes that ensure accidents like the ones in Indonesia and Ethiopia never happen again, and numerous aviation regulators have re-approved the plane for flight.
The company resolved a 737 MAX criminal probe in January with a $2.5 billion Department of Justice settlement and has mostly settled the Lion Air crash litigation.
It still faces an investor lawsuit in Delaware against its board and around 140 lawsuits by families of the Ethiopian crash.
In the DOJ settlement Boeing admitted that two of its 737 MAX technical pilots, who are still under criminal investigation, had deceived the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) about MCAS.
While the settlement exonerated Boeing's senior managers, legal experts said it bolsters one part of the plaintiffs' punitive claim that Boeing intended to defraud the FAA and succeeded.
However, the experts said punitive damages are rarely awarded in aircraft crash cases, in part because they are difficult to prove. 

Boeing could argue, for example, that the Ethiopian Airlines' pilots were informed after the Lion Air crash about the steps to follow in the event of an MCAS failure, said Kenneth Quinn of International Aviation Law.
Still, Boeing will likely work hard to settle the cases and avoid a jury trial, a path followed by most companies involved in crash lawsuits, according to Gary Kennedy, former general counsel for American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL).
""From the company's perspective, the worst thing is a headline that relives the final moments of someone's life onboard that aircraft,"" said Kennedy, who was with American during litigation stemming from the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks and a separate deadly crash in New York two months later.

1141,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 04:01PM ET</span>",Exclusive: EU told to expect no AstraZeneca vaccines from U.S. in near future - sources,"By Francesco Guarascio and John Chalmers
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Washington has told the European Union that it should not expect to receive AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) COVID-19 vaccines manufactured in the United States any time soon, two EU sources said on Thursday, in a new blow to the bloc's supplies. 
The U.S. message could complicate vaccination plans in the 27-nation EU, which has been grappling since January with delays in deliveries from vaccine makers. 
""The U.S. told us there was no way it would ship AstraZeneca vaccines to the EU,"" said a senior official directly involved in EU-U.S. talks.
AstraZeneca told the EU earlier this year it would cut its supplies in the second quarter by at least half to less than 90 million doses, EU sources told Reuters, after a bigger reduction in the first three months of the year. 
Later, however, AstraZeneca offered to partly plug the gap with vaccines produced outside Europe, including in the United States.
A senior EU diplomat said the European Commission told member states' diplomats at a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday that the bloc should not expect any exports from the United States ""at this point in time"".
""Basically the situation is such that any exports are tricky, but there is a willingness to talk,"" the diplomat said.
AstraZeneca declined to comment.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters the U.S. government had been clear publicly and privately that it would focus first on ensuring Americans were vaccinated, but said direct purchases would be up to countries and companies.
""Our first focus is in ensuring the American people are vaccinated,"" she said. ""Of course any country can purchase vaccines from these manufacturers directly.""
It is not known what is behind the possible move on exports. It is unclear whether AstraZeneca is producing much vaccine in the U.S. or if the U.S. would apply a restrictive measure on trade. AstraZeneca's vaccine has not yet been approved for use in the United States.
The move comes after Austria stopped using a batch of AstraZeneca shots while investigating a death from coagulation disorders and an illness from a pulmonary embolism. 
Asked about vaccine talks with the United States, European Commission spokesman Eric Mamer said on Thursday: ""Whatever the legal situation in the United States, we want to work on the ground with the United States to keep the supply chains open.""
""We're not going to give a blow-by-blow account of the discussions that are taking place with our American partners."" 
But the EU's executive did not reply to specific questions about a possible move on exports from the United States.
The U.S. stance could jeopardise AstraZeneca's attempts to bring deliveries closer to its contractual obligation with the EU of 180 million doses in the second quarter.
U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday the U.S. government will first give Americans COVID-19 vaccines, but any surplus would be shared with the world.
AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccines are produced in the United States in a plant near Baltimore run by Catalent (NYSE:CTLT), which is listed in the EU supply contract with AstraZeneca as a ""back-up supply site"" and has been authorised by the EU drugs regulator as a manufacturer of vaccine ingredients. 
The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, had a call with Biden last week, which was followed this week by a meeting between EU industry commissioner Thierry Breton and White House COVID-19 response coordinator, Jeffrey Zients.
In both talks, vaccines were discussed, according to EU statements issued afterwards.
Talks with the U.S. on vaccines were continuing, with new calls expected this week, one EU official said.
INDIA
AstraZeneca had also told the EU it could provide extra doses to the EU from India, where its vaccines are manufactured by the Serum Institute.
The EU drugs regulators are currently reviewing Serum's manufacturing site, Reuters exclusively reported earlier in March. 
But another EU official said on Thursday the auditing process was ""complicated"" because both the site and the substances used for vaccine production had to be authorised.
The U.S. is also part of the production network for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) vaccines due to be used in the EU, because under the EU-J&J contract shots made in the Netherlands would need to be bottled in the U.S.
The sources made no reference to potential U.S. hurdles on the shipment to the EU of J&J vaccines, but several European diplomats said they were concerned about J&J production.
Reuters exclusively reported on Tuesday that J&J told the EU it was facing supply issues that may complicate plans to deliver 55 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine to the bloc in the second quarter of the year.
J&J plans to begin supplying the EU in April. Its vaccine was recommended earlier on Thursday by Europe's drugs regulator for use in the EU.
In a separate development, health authorities in Denmark, Norway and Iceland said they had suspended the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine shots after reports of the formation of blood clots in some who have been vaccinated.[L1N2L91Q3]

AstraZeneca on Thursday told Reuters in a written statement the safety of its vaccine had been extensively studied in human trials and peer-reviewed data had confirmed the vaccine was generally well tolerated.

CHICAGO/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s chief scientist said the company expects to produce up to 3 billion doses of its COVID-19 vaccine next year, after the European Union approved the one-shot immunization on Thursday.
The company is bringing on three manufacturing plants to produce the key drug substance. It also will have seven plants globally that will handle final production steps and bottling into vials known as fill and finish. 
""All these will function together to deliver the 1 billion by the end of the year,"" Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&J's chief scientific officer, said in an interview. 
""Next year, we can do more than two billion vaccines, and even up to three if we maximize capacity. With Merck on board, we will be north of 2 billion,"" he added, referring to a recent agreement for rival Merck & Co to produce J&J's vaccine.
Stoffels also said he was confident J&J will be able to deliver a planned 55 million doses to the European Union in the second quarter. An EU official told Reuters this week that J&J had flagged possible supply issues that may complicate these plans.
“We trust that we can deliver close to that amount in Q2,"" Stoffels said, adding that final production steps would be the biggest challenge.
""It’s the fill and finish which was the critical part and there we learned we had later access, we started later and had later access to facilities,” he said.
J&J's shot is the fourth to be endorsed for use in the EU after vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc.
Europe is scrambling to get immunization campaigns off the ground after an early supply shortfall from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), since resolved, and more persistent issues with AstraZeneca.
J&J’s vaccine is expected to be used widely around the globe because of its one-shot convenience and logistical advantage of being shipped and stored at normal refrigerator temperatures. Both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines require two doses and must be shipped frozen.
Thursday's approval included authorization in Europe of Maryland-based Emergent Biosolutions (NYSE:EBS) Inc, which is making active drug substance for the vaccine. 
""Emergent is a very critical supplier. It’s important for both the U.S. and Europe and other parts of the world,"" Stoffels said, adding it can deliver enough drug substance for ""up to a billion vaccines a year.""
Stoffels said in the United States, the company was only allowed to seek emergency use authorization for one manufacturing plant to produce drug substance.
Initial U.S. doses are being made at the company's plant in Leiden, the Netherlands. J&J is awaiting U.S. approvals of the Emergent plant for drug substance, and for Catalent (NYSE:CTLT) Inc, a contract manufacturer that will handle fill and finish from a new manufacturing line in Bloomington, Indiana.
Stoffels said as soon as J&J received U.S. authorization for the vaccine, U.S. regulators started reviewing the company's additional production plants. 
He said early ""hiccups"" have been resolved and the company expects to deliver on its promise of 100 million doses before the end of June.
In Europe, Stoffels said the company plans to significantly scale up production of its Leiden plant. Additional capacity will come on board likely over the summer, he added. 
Indian drugmaker Biological E Ltd will handle both drug substance and fill and finish for J&J's vaccine. The company's managing director told Reuters last month that Biological E was looking to contract manufacture roughly 600 million doses ofJ&J's COVID-19 vaccine a year.

Biological E is in the process of installing and validating equipment in the plant, which Stoffels said he expects to be ready in the second half of this year.

Investors appeared to be happy about the stimulus, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average and theS&P 500 to new intraday highs on Thursday while tech stocks also rebounded.
Now the reopening trade is in full force, with travel and leisure stocks like airlines, hotels, restaurants and cruise operators in focus, as well as banks and payments companies that benefit from extra economic activity.
Interest rates didn’t appear to be on a breakout, which eased concerns about tech stocks. 
There is light data due out Friday. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. Ecommerce still the star
Even with economies reopening and people leaving their homes to venture out in public, the ecommerce model seems here to stay. Evidence of that could be seen Thursday, with the public debut of Korea-based  Coupang LLC  (NYSE:CPNG), jumping 50% in its first day. The ecommerce company has backing from China’s SoftBank and priced at $35 a share, raising $4.6 billion. By late afternoon in trading, the company had a market value higher than $90 billion. 
It was the second-largest U.S. listing of an Asian company after Alibaba’s IPO in 2014. 
2. Will stimulus boost consume confidence?
The University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment survey comes out Friday and people will no-doubt be feeling good about the spread of vaccinations and the prospect of extra spending money coming from Uncle Sam. 
Initial and continuing jobless claims, which came out Thursday, were not as bad as feared. Prices in February continued to be muted, indication inflation wasn’t about to run rampant. Consumer sentiment for March is expected to inch up to a reading of 78.5 from 76.8. The number comes out at 10:00 AM ET (1500 GMT).
3. Reopening boosts oil, and producers could benefit
A surge in the price of oil could be good news for the energy sector on Friday, lifting shares of oil majors like  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM),  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) PLC ADR (NYSE:RDSa) as the price per barrel creeps higher toward $70.
Higher oil prices come as producers try to get fully back online after operations were disrupted by last month’s deep freeze in energy-rich Texas. The economic reopening will lift demand for refined products such as gasoline, as vaccinated people take to the roads after months of lockdowns.

1144,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 03:45PM ET</span>","U.S. Postmaster acknowledges 'extreme delays' in some mail, says USPS needs big changes","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told lawmakers on Thursday that there are still ""extreme delays"" in some mail deliveries and that a 10-year strategic plan will revise existing service standards.
The U.S. Postal Service faces a $160 billion projected loss over the next decade and is looking to cut costs as it faces shrinking first-class mail volumes.
DeJoy told a hearing of the House of Representatives Appropriations subcommittee that the reorganization would keep existing six-day delivery and would not close rural or small post offices. But he acknowledged service standards will be relaxed as part of the plan.
The current standards are ""not achievable,"" DeJoy said. ""We cannot go to California from New York in three days without going on planes and we don't own planes.""
Last week, USPS said it was offering early retirement to thousands of non-union employees as it consolidates postal districts in an effort to stem billions in red ink.
""We have a broken business model and changes need to happen,"" DeJoy said. ""Our network is in bad shape ... We need to make some big changes.""
Last month, DeJoy said the U.S. mail system is losing $10 billion a year and urgently needs reform and legislative relief. ""I would suggest that we are on a death spiral,"" DeJoy said.
The USPS faces shrinking volumes of first-class mail, increased costs of employee compensation and benefits, and higher unfunded liabilities. 
USPS reported net losses of $86.7 billion from 2007 through 2020. One reason is 2006 legislation mandating that it pre-fund more than $120 billion in retiree health care and pension liabilities, a requirement labor unions have called an unfair burden not shared by other businesses.

House Oversight and Reform Committee chair Carolyn Maloney has circulated draft legislation to address some USPS financial issues, including eliminating a requirement to pre-fund retiree health benefits and require postal employees to enroll in government-retiree health plan Medicare, for a saving of $40 billion to $50 billion over 10 years.

1145,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 02:46PM ET</span>",Special Report: Insider alleges Eli Lilly blocked her efforts to sound alarms about U.S. drug factory,"By Marisa Taylor and Dan Levine
(Reuters) - On a chilly spring morning in 2019, Amrit Mula arrived in her office at pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co's factory in Branchburg, New Jersey, to find a desk drawer open that she had kept locked. Her files were missing.
Mula was a top human resources officer at what was one of America's largest biotech plants. Over the years, she had been investigating employee complaints about manufacturing problems related to multiple drugs, including the company's blockbuster diabetes medication, Trulicity, according to internal company documents and email correspondence reviewed by Reuters.
Among the most serious allegations: Records had been falsified or destroyed in the wake of manufacturing mistakes. In one case, according to 2018 emails among executives, company-mandated quality assurance documents were missing for Trulicity, which security filings show garnered more than $4 billion in sales in 2019.
Shortly after Mula discovered her files missing that day, her boss told her that Lilly was eliminating her position at the Branchburg plant, where she had worked nearly 15 years, according to a confidential ""demand"" letter from Mula's lawyers to Lilly's attorneys dated Dec. 30, 2019.
The letter, which seeks unspecified damages, portrays Mula as a good-faith whistleblower who repeatedly pressed her superiors to address serious problems at the factory, including staffing shortages, poor training, and record destruction and falsifications. Her inquiries, according to the letter and internal correspondence, were downplayed, ignored and sometimes blocked.
When she persisted, Lilly responded by ""marginalizing, harassing and eventually terminating"" her, according to the demand letter. Mula has not sued her former employer.
Reuters could not independently verify every claim in the letter. However, based on internal correspondence and other company documents reviewed by reporters, Mula repeatedly received complaints and raised concerns about everything from quality control to record-keeping with a host of Lilly managers and executives. Three former factory workers who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said such problems were endemic at Branchburg, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspectors later identified some of the same concerns there.
""I was just doing my job,"" Mula told Reuters, declining to comment further.
The demand letter and supporting documentation offer a rare look inside a Big Pharma company - one of the world's largest - as it struggles with allegations of serious manufacturing violations, which can occur behind the scenes without being promptly investigated and addressed by a company or the FDA.
The pharmaceutical industry has become increasingly reliant on high-priced biologic drugs, like those made at Branchburg, for its profits. Made from living organisms, biologics are difficult and expensive to produce, and batches are particularly prone to microbial contamination.
In a statement, Lilly spokeswoman Kathryn Beiser said the company has ""rigorous"" quality assurance systems in place and welcomes feedback from employees.
Lilly is working closely with the FDA to address concerns about the factory, Beiser said, and the drugmaker voluntarily conducted a retrospective five-year review that found no impact on Branchburg's product quality.
Lilly has ""long-standing policies and procedures that enable – and encourage – individuals to come forward with information about any potential issues or concerns without fear of retribution,"" Beiser said. ""We are continuously strengthening and reinforcing a culture where our employees can be proud of our work, so in turn, doctors and patients can trust Lilly's products have been ethically, properly, and safely manufactured.""
Beiser did not specifically address the issues raised by Mula.
On Tuesday, several days after receiving detailed questions from Reuters, Lilly announced the retirements of two senior vice presidents: Myles O'Neill, who heads Lilly's manufacturing operations, and Melissa Barnes, who is chief ethics and compliance officer.
Beiser said the retirements were ""long planned changes that reflect Lilly's robust succession planning process"" and that the company is grateful for the executives' ""tremendous"" contributions. O'Neill and Barnes did not reply to emails seeking comment.
The internal Lilly documents portray a plant where a worker complained in capital letters about being ""TIRED AND OVERBURDENED""; where substandard chemicals and ingredients were simply discarded and not reported as required; where safety hazards included the risk of electrocution from live wires; and where quality assurance records disappeared or were doctored. In one case, according to a 2018 email among managers, workers sifted through the garbage to find missing manufacturing records.
The FDA requires pharmaceutical companies to closely track such documents, including recording any deviations from mandated procedures. The record-keeping requirements are key to ensuring the quality of drugs, as defects may not be obvious to consumers or physicians, pharmaceutical and regulatory experts told Reuters. The FDA also requires companies to hire enough staff members and properly train them to ensure compliance with regulations.
As associate director of HR and employee relations since 2011, Mula was tasked with investigating workplace issues including manufacturing complaints. In doing so, she repeatedly encountered a lack of cooperation or pushback from her bosses, according to contemporaneous emails, Mula's handwritten meeting notes and excerpts from an internal retaliation complaint she filed with the company in December 2018.
""I submit that (executives') motivation was to discredit and deter me from completing the investigations that were yielding unfavorable results,"" she wrote in the internal complaint, which was excerpted in the February 19, 2019, email to her direct supervisor.
At times, her bosses acted on her recommendations or said they would pass her concerns up the management chain, according to internal correspondence.
But the problems largely remained. Months after Mula left, FDA inspectors cited some of the same lapses she had flagged during her tenure and described in her demand letter. For instance, the inspectors found that on several occasions when serious manufacturing quality problems occurred - including in the case of Trulicity ingredients - ""the firm failed to conduct a detailed investigation,"" according to an August 21, 2020, FDA report.
Overall, the FDA classified its inspectors' findings at the plant as ""Official Action Indicated"" or OAI, the most serious category of violations, according to FDA correspondence and reports reviewed by Reuters. If the problems aren't corrected, an OAI finding can lead to the FDA's prohibiting the sale of drugs made at the facility, drug quality experts told Reuters. The finding is the most serious sanction Lilly has received in about 12 years and is issued in only 7% of U.S. plant inspections, according to FDA records. The agency has not taken further public action.
Even so, the FDA announced last year that an antibody drug made at the Lilly plant called bamlanivimab could be used to treat COVID-19 on an emergency basis. After its inspections at Branchburg, the FDA required an independent lab to test batches of the treatment made there.
The FDA declined to comment, saying it does not usually discuss its dialogue with individual companies. The inspection reports reviewed by Reuters were heavily redacted by the agency to protect the company's trade secrets and financial information.
Three outside experts who reviewed the FDA inspection records for Reuters said such manufacturing violations could erode the potency, purity or safety of drugs. It's crucial to log the processing temperatures and times of drugs and what raw materials are used, said Susan Bain, an assistant professor of regulatory and quality sciences at the University of Southern California who once conducted FDA factory inspections.
Based on her review of the FDA inspection records, she described the quality assurance at the Branchburg plant as ""so wildly out of control it's scary.""
""Ultimately, you don't know what the heck went on,"" Bain added.
RISING DEMAND, SHRINKING STAFF
Lilly's factory in Branchburg sits at an epicenter of U.S. drug manufacturing, with many of the company's competitors close by.
Mula went to work there in 2004, when the plant was owned by ImClone Systems, then embroiled in an insider trading scandal involving celebrity businesswoman Martha Stewart. Four years later, Eli Lilly bought the company and the plant for $6.5 billion.
Ever since, the biologics produced in Branchburg have become increasingly important to Lilly's bottom line. Biologics are not as easily copied by competitors as conventional pharmaceuticals are and therefore can stay profitable longer.
Lilly developed Trulicity as Type-2 diabetes diagnoses exploded worldwide. The widely advertised medicine, introduced in 2014, is prescribed to help lower blood glucose levels and reduce, or avoid, the need for regular insulin injections. Trulicity, which is injected weekly, also may help with weight loss, according to a Lilly promotional website.
After David Ricks became CEO in 2017, he sought to cut costs through a global reduction of about 3,500 employees - roughly 8% of Lilly's staff. Many employees took early retirements, and a top quality control official at the New Jersey plant departed.
Fewer and fewer employees at the Branchburg plant were available to prepare critical ingredients used in manufacturing drugs, three people who worked in the plant told Reuters. In addition, many workers were assigned tasks above their experience and training levels, they said.
Ricks referred Reuters questions to a Lilly spokesperson.
The process of manufacturing biologics is complex and delicate; every step and ingredient is tightly controlled. The drugs start as cells in large vats where they are fed ingredients to help them multiply. Then the batches are purified in a series of containers with substances to make them suitable for human absorption. Workers in sterile areas are required to wear protective gear covering their entire bodies. Even skin cell flaking was cited as a possible source of contamination at Branchburg, according to a 2018 employee complaint.
Critical tasks often required at least two people - one to perform a step and another to verify it was done correctly. In some cases, workers reported they didn't have supervisors to check with on how to properly handle contamination or disposal of unusable materials.
'STOP THIS STUPIDITY'
By 2018, serious complaints from factory workers and allegations of manufacturing violations were piling up on Mula's desk, the internal Lilly records reviewed by Reuters show.
On Aug. 9, an anonymous employee called Lilly's ethics and compliance hot line to report that inadequate staffing and high turnover was a problem at Branchburg, leading to a ""heightened stressful environment because employees are handling multiple jobs at once,"" according to a complaint recorded by the hot line call center.
Around the same period, emails show, Mula was notified that contamination or other errors in at least nine instances led ingredients or other materials to be discarded. According to the emails, Mula suspected in some cases that the items were improperly disposed of or ""dumped"" inside the factory.
Two of the 2018 incidents involved Trulicity, Mula told her supervisor, Richard Ruth, in emails the following February. Altogether, Mula said at least $2 million in materials for various drugs were lost to dumping, according to an email she sent to a human resources superior, Efraim Ortiz, whom she thanked for confirming that number.
Both Ortiz and Ruth declined to comment and referred questions to a company spokesperson.
On Oct. 1, 2018, Mula received the complaint from an unidentified factory employee in all-caps via interoffice mail, beseeching her for help.
""WE ARE TIRED AND OVERBURDENED AND DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE WORKING ON THE FLOOR,"" it said. ""PLEASE SUPPORT US AND STOP THIS STUPIDITY.""
On October 11, Mula asked a quality assurance official in an email if her unit had enough staff. The response: ""No.""
In her statement, Lilly spokeswoman Beiser said the company ensures that the staffing at all its sites is appropriate, and Branchburg has seen only marginal variations in staffing levels over the past six years. She did not disclose specific figures.
Then-plant manager Victor Cruz and other Branchburg executives pledged at times to cooperate with Mula's multiple inquiries, the email correspondence shows. But some of the executives also suggested to Mula that there wasn't a quality problem at the plant, or advised her to let officials in Lilly's dedicated quality unit resolve the matters.
""We would not proceed with executing any manufacturing operation if we did not have the trained staff to perform that operation,"" Liz Gosen, then Branchburg's vice president of manufacturing operations, wrote to Mula in an October 2018 email. ""This would be a violation of our procedures.""
Mula also raised her concerns about staffing in an October meeting with Lilly's vice president of quality, Leanne Hickman, according to emails between the two.
That same day, plant manager Cruz told Ruth he could no longer work with Mula, emails show. Later, Mula heard that Cruz had announced at a company party that she was going to be reassigned or removed, according to the emails.
Two other managers also had filed complaints against Mula, accusing her of badmouthing her superiors and spreading rumors about an interoffice affair, the emails show.
Ruth later acknowledged in emails to Mula that the managers' complaints had been unfounded and were dismissed.
It was ""determined that there was no violation and no further action regarding the allegations that were brought forward against you"" was needed, Ruth wrote in December 2018.
Cruz and Hickman did not respond to requests for comment. Gosen declined to comment.
On Oct. 22, an associate director at the plant emailed Mula and two others to report that records of a Trulicity manufacturing upgrade were missing. Looking for the records entailed ""climbing and sifting through garbage,"" the associate director said.
By then, turbocharged global demand had vaulted Trulicity over three other Lilly drugs - including erectile dysfunction medicine Cialis - to become the company's best seller.
COMING TO A HEAD
The pressure on Mula mounted.
In February 2019 emails, a senior manufacturing executive, Darin Moody, told factory managers that he had to attest to ""material compliance"" with Lilly's ""Red Book"" code of conduct and company policies.
However, Mula emailed Ruth and Nellie Clark, who had replaced Cruz as plant manager, on Feb. 5, saying that she ""cannot with integrity confirm that all (Branchburg) cases have been escalated as appropriate"" by the senior leadership team at the plant.
Mula brought up what she called ""one reckless example"" in January 2019 that had not been investigated: wet mopping around live electrical wires, posing a risk of electrocution.
""The fact that the event didn't result in a fatality is shocking,"" Mula wrote.
Mula told Ruth she was ""excluded"" from a meeting with the plant leaders about the incident.
""I would ask that you permit me to do my job and examine the situation despite anticipated rebuffs from Nellie (Clark) and Efraim (Ortiz),"" she wrote to Ruth.
Initially, plant managers recommended ""verbal"" coaching for the employees involved. Ultimately, Mula successfully pushed for written warnings, the emails show.
In email correspondence that February, Mula told Ruth that the upper-level Branchburg managers were not providing detailed information that she needed to conduct her inquiries.
Clark did not respond to requests for comment.
On Feb. 28, 2019, Ruth emailed Mula some positive news.
Ruth told Mula that she ""sufficiently"" met expectations and would be receiving a bonus. In a later email, he complimented Mula on her work on the electrical wires investigation: ""Well done, Amrit.""
Around the same time, however, plant manager Clark told Mula she was ""displeased"" with Mula's findings of violations and recommendations for discipline, according to Mula's demand letter.
Shortly afterward, according to the letter, Mula met three Lilly scientists who alleged that the company discarded a batch of Trulicity worth $8 million to $10 million after data falsification led to contamination during manufacturing. The letter says Clark responded in a mid-March meeting: ""We don't want to mess with Trulicity."" Clark then threatened to remove Mula from her position at the Branchburg plant, the demand letter alleges.
Reuters could not independently confirm the mass discarding of Trulicity or Clark's comments about the drug or Mula.
On March 28, the day Mula found her files gone, Ruth flew into Branchburg from Lilly's Indianapolis headquarters, according to email and instant messages he sent to Mula at the time. Once there, he told her that her position was being eliminated.
According to a March 28 notification letter Mula received from the company, the job was being eliminated due to a need to reallocate resources ""to compete in a new business environment."" Mula was offered a roughly $96,000 severance and the opportunity to apply for another position, according to the March 28 letter and her demand letter.
ENTER THE FEDS
In November 2019, eight months after Mula's dismissal, FDA inspectors showed up at the plant for a routine inspection.
Among a host of problems cited by the inspectors: The company did not keep proper records to verify that its quality management systems were operating in compliance with FDA regulations - a concern Mula had been raising for more than two years.
The FDA red-flagged the problems with its ""Official Action Indicated"" designation.
On a subsequent inspection that began in July 2020, the FDA discovered signs that Lilly was systematically downplaying significant manufacturing problems, said Peter Calcott, a pharmaceutical consultant and instructor at the extension program of the University of California, Berkeley, among those who reviewed the FDA records for Reuters.
""As a patient, I'm more worried about that,"" Calcott said.
In July 2020, for instance, FDA inspectors found that when the plant's tests of a migraine treatment drug called Emgality showed problems, the plant repeated those tests until it got the results needed to finish the manufacturing process, according to the FDA documents reviewed by Reuters.
During that same inspection, the FDA found that Lilly discarded a batch of drug ingredients that had been used incorrectly in May 2020, without investigating the matter or keeping proper records. It is not possible to tell from the redacted documents which drug was at issue.
The company's vice president of manufacturing, who is not named in the FDA report, told the agency that the workers responsible ""are no longer employed with the firm"" due to ""the severity of the issue,"" the inspectors wrote.

FDA investigators said that the May incident and lack of follow-up investigation was not an ""isolated occurrence,"" as they said Lilly had claimed. They cited three similar instances in 2020 alone and could not determine whether the company had addressed the problems, according to their August inspection report.
In September, a month after the FDA inspection, Lilly drew up internal talking points to brief employees on the agency's findings and remind them how to comply with regulations. Workers were instructed, for instance, not to use informal record-keeping such as ""sticky notes.""
Lilly asserted in the briefing that it had made ""tremendous progress."" If problems arise again, the company advised employees, ""speak up.""

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were higher, pushing broader market to record highs, with easing fears about a disorderly rise in rates also playing a role in the reviving the growth trade.
The 10-year yield remained above 1.5%, but some market participants are backing rates to remain in check following auction results for the 10-year note on Wednesday that suggested current rates were attractive enough for buyers.
Given the selloff in bond prices, which trade inversely to yields/rates, over the past month, there were concerns that the market wasn't ready to buy bonds anticipating a further run up ahead, but the auction results ""seem to be put [those fears] to rest for now,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.

During the recent melt-up in rates, intense debate broke out over the catalyst that had pushed yields up, with some pinning blame on fears over runway inflation, while others suggested the appreciation was sparked by optimism over the economic recovery.
In recent days, fears that inflation would spiral out of control have eased, and data continues to point to an improving economic recovery.

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 02:06PM ET</span>",Pfizer vaccine production on the rise as pandemic hits one-year mark,"By Michael Erman
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) will exceed their original global target for COVID-19 vaccines by as much as 20% this year, producing 2.3 billion to 2.4 billion doses, Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said on Thursday.
The companies also released real-world data from Israel earlier on Thursday showing their vaccine was 94% effective in preventing asymptomatic infections, suggesting it could significantly reduce virus transmission.
""These are stunning numbers that are giving us a clear indication that liberation is coming,"" Bourla said in an interview on the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring COVID-19 a pandemic. ""It is a testament to the power of science, and the power of human ingenuity.""
More than 2.7 million people around the world have died from COVID-19 so far.
Bourla said that by the fourth quarter of this year, Pfizer and BioNTech will reach a 3 billion dose a year production run rate, and should be able to produce that much next year.
The companies will clearly exceed their original target of 2 billion doses in 2021, he said.
Pfizer has said it expects revenue of at least $15 billion from its half of the vaccine sales this year.
Middle-income countries will pay around half the price as high income countries for their doses, and low income countries will get the vaccine at cost, Bourla said. 
Pfizer expects to meet its commitment of supplying 120 million coronavirus vaccine doses to the U.S. government by the end of March. That would require them to deliver another 60 million doses over the next three weeks.
""Those have already been manufactured"" and are currently being tested for quality, he said. 
""Unless a batch (of vaccine) fails, we will be able to provide them. Our track record is that our batches don't fail,"" he said.
Pfizer's German partner BioNTech began developing the vaccine last January and the U.S. drugmaker signed on in early March as the health crisis accelerated. Their vaccine received its first regulatory authorizations in December.
In the United States, the vaccine is authorized for use in people aged 16 or older. Bourla said the company plans to submit data for children aged 12 to 16 very soon.

He said his assumption was that the vaccine should be authorized for that age range by the fall, adding that data on children aged 5 to 11 can be expected by year-end.

1150,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 02:00PM ET</span>","GM says U.S. should extend consumer, investment tax credits to boost electric vehicles","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE:GM) President Mark Reuss said Thursday the U.S. government should extend new investment tax credits for electric vehicle manufacturing and supply chains and expand consumer incentives to electric vehicle purchases, including for used vehicles.
In a LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) post, Reuss also called on U.S. policymakers to invest ""in infrastructure that includes fast-charging stations, particularly in urban areas and along highway corridors.""
In January, GM said it was setting a dramatic goal to sell all its new cars, SUVs and light pickup trucks with zero tailpipe emissions by 2035, a dramatic shift by the largest U.S. automaker away from gasoline and diesel engines.
""2021 is the tipping point toward EVs,"" Reuss said Thursday in his post.
Reuss also called again for the $7,500-EV tax credit to be extended to more vehicles. GM hit the 200,000 cumulative EV vehicle sales threshold in late 2018 and the credit fully expired for all GM EV buyers in April 2020.
GM sold 2.55 million vehicles in the United States last year, but only about 20,000 were EVs, including the Chevy Bolt hatchback. It said in November it was investing $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, up from $20 billion planned before the coronavirus pandemic.
Total U.S. EV sales in 2020 fell to 296,000, down from 331,000 in 2019, according to S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Platts, accounting for 2% of total U.S. vehicle sales.
President Joe Biden has called for 500,000 new charging stations to speed electric vehicle adoption and backs expanding tax credits for consumers and for retool factories to build EVs and components.
During a Washington Post forum Thursday, Reuss said the company was focused on EVs.

""We definitely bet the future on battery electric vehicles - not plug-in hybrid electric vehicles,"" Reuss said. ""We're going all the way. We're going as fast as we can. That's the bet we have.""

(Reuters) - Buyout firm KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc is seeking to raise $12 billion for its flagship global fund that will invest in infrastructure assets such as oil and gas pipelines and renewable energy projects, according to people familiar with the matter. 
The fundraising comes as President Joe Biden has been pushing U.S. lawmakers to back a plan for trillions of dollars in new spending on projects to restore America's crumbling infrastructure.
KKR began raising the fund, KKR Global Infrastructure Investors IV, late last year alongside its other flagship funds, including the North America private equity fund, which is aiming to attract more than $15 billion.
A KKR spokeswoman declined to comment.
Private equity firms tend to raise successor funds that are 10% to 20% larger than their predecessors. But KKR's latest global infrastructure fund would be significantly bigger than KKR Global Infrastructure Investors III, which amassed $7.4 billion from investors in 2018.
The prior funds, KKR Global Infrastructure Investors II and KKR Global Infrastructure Fund, had raised $3.1 billion and $1 billion, respectively. 
KKR's third and second infrastructure funds have generated 0.97 times and 1.49 times respectively of their investors' money as of March 2020, according to the New York City Police Pension Fund.

KKR's Infrastructure funds are managed by Raj Agrawal. Some of their recent investments include Canadian pipeline company Coastal GasLink, Florida-based renewables energy operator Nitrogen Renewables, and Indian power transmission developer IndiGrid Trust.

1154,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 01:20PM ET</span>",Qualcomm struggles to meet chip demand as shortage spreads to phones: sources,"By Stephen Nellis, Josh Horwitz and Hyunjoo Jin
SAN FRANCISCO/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc is struggling to keep up with demand for its processor chips used in smartphones and gadgets, as a chip shortage that first hit the auto industry spreads across the electronics business, industry sources told Reuters. 
Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd, the world's largest smartphone maker, is experiencing a shortage of Qualcomm's application processors, the heart of smartphones, two people at suppliers for the South Korean giant told Reuters.
Demand for Qualcomm's chips has soared in the past months as Android phone makers seek to win over customers abandoning phones produced by Huawei Technologies Co Ltd due to U.S. sanctions. Qualcomm has found it hard to meet this higher-than-expected demand, in part due to a shortage of some subcomponents used in its chips.
One person at a Samsung (KS:005930) supplier said a Qualcomm chip shortage was hitting production of mid- and low-end Samsung models. The second person, at another supplier, said there was a shortage of Qualcomm's new flagship chip, the Snapdragon 888, but did not say whether this was affecting the manufacturing of Samsung's high-end phones.
A Samsung Electronics spokesman declined to comment. A Qualcomm spokesman pointed to public comments by executives on Wednesday in which they reiterated they believe they can hit a fiscal second quarter sales forecast given in February.
Separately, a senior executive at a top contract manufacturer for several major smartphone brands told Reuters it was facing a shortage of a range of components from Qualcomm and would cut handset shipments this year. The executive spoke on condition of anonymity.
Last month, Lu Weibing, a vice president for Chinese handset maker Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF), lamented the chip crunch. ""It's not a shortage, it's an extreme shortage,"" he wrote on Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), China's Twitter-like social network.
A surge in demand for consumer electronics has driven a global chip shortage that has idled car factories. The shortage has so far centered largely on chips made using older technology rather than the advanced phone processors Qualcomm designs. 
But Qualcomm's constraints show how problems in one area of the complex chip supply chain can bleed into others and how fast-changing market dynamics can trip up chip companies that must set mass production plans years in advance.
""We still have our demand basically higher than supply,"" Qualcomm incoming Chief Executive Cristiano Amon told investors during the company's annual meeting on Wednesday.
Qualcomm's flagship application processor, the Snapdragon 888, is still new. Key parts of it come from Samsung Electronics' separate chipmaking division and use a new 5-nanonmeter manufacturing process that is hard to scale up quickly.
A Samsung factory in Texas, which makes some of Qualcomm's radio frequency transceivers, was also forced to halt operations last month due to power shortages caused by winter storms, though it is unclear whether the effects of that stoppage have yet trickled down to smartphone makers.
OLDER TECHNOLOGY 
Qualcomm's entire lineup of application processors contain power management chips made with older technology by companies including China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
""You need a full kit,"" said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with brokerage Bernstein. ""If you can't get them, you can't build whatever it is you want to build. Supply chains are global and very tightly integrated. It's set up for efficiency, but it's less resilient.""
Qualcomm is directing supply of these power management chips towards its highly profitable Snapdragon 888 application processors to match what Samsung's foundries can build, but that is hurting supplies of lower-end Qualcomm application processors, sources said.
China's Xiaomi procures the majority of its chips from Qualcomm and Taiwan's MediaTek Inc.
PANIC BUYING
The chip shortage, which has prompted panic buying, is further squeezing capacity and driving up costs of even the cheapest components of nearly all microchips, industry experts said. 
For instance, a commonly-used microcontroller-unit chip from STMicroelectronics originally priced at $2 now sells for $14, according to Case Engelen, CEO of Titoma, a contract designer and manufacturer.
Simon Wan, co-founder of the Chinese robotic vacuum cleaner brand Roborock, said the company's chip suppliers are asking for larger deposits on chip orders. He's paying to ensure stock.
""Everyone is placing orders like crazy, when in fact they can't even use up all their chips,"" said Wan, who declined to name his chip suppliers.
Smaller companies are hurting more.
Fabien Gaussorgues, who runs an electronics factory in the southern Chinese city of Dongguan, said supply issues have worsened since December.
His company was on track to mass produce a smart-home device designed by an overseas client before the Chinese New Year. But a shortage of key chipsets from Japan's Murata delayed the launch by three weeks, he said, forcing him to eventually use a slightly weaker chipset as a substitute. Murata did not respond to request for comment.
Meanwhile, some of his other clients have delayed projects indefinitely.

""We have seen components where we see a six-week lead time, and then the week after it's ten weeks, and then a week later it's one year,"" he said.

1155,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 01:10PM ET</span>",FedEx CEO to testify as U.S. lawmakers make green infrastructure push,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX)'s chief executive, Frederick Smith, will testify before Congress on Wednesday as U.S. lawmakers begin a fast push for a massive hike in infrastructure spending and drive toward electric vehicles, congressional aides said Thursday.
The previously unreported testimony will come at a hearing before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee titled ""The Business Case for Climate Solutions"" and will also include testimony from PG&E (NYSE:PCG) Corp Senior Vice President Laurie Giammona, the company confirmed. The California-based electric utility has dedicated over $400 million in programs helping customers transition to EVs. 
Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat who chairs the panel, said in an interview that a massive infrastructure bill will create millions of new jobs and reduce carbon emissions and said he expects to have a bill through his committee in May.
""We're trying to make the business case - everybody else is going to go electric - you don't have to believe in climate change,"" DeFazio said.
Last week, FedEx said it planned to become carbon-neutral by 2040 and will invest $2 billion in vehicle electrification, sustainable energy, and carbon sequestration. FedEx also said its entire parcel pickup and delivery fleet will be zero–emission electric vehicles by 2040.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in 2019 pledged to make the largest U.S. e-commerce company net carbon-neutral by 2040 and also to buy tens of thousands of electric delivery vans. A number of automakers and start-up companies are working to develop electric-vehicle pickups and larger delivery vehicles.
Lawmakers will look at private-sector actions addressing climate change, with a focus on surface transportation, aides said. 
A FedEx spokeswoman declined to comment on Smith's testimony.
DeFazio met with Democratic President Joe Biden and House lawmakers last week. Biden made the business case for electric vehicles, or EVs, at the meeting, DeFazio said, and raised General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s goal of ending production of gasoline-powered passenger vehicles by 2035.
""(Biden) talked about the Chinese eating our lunch, the Chinese want to dominate the electric auto market,"" DeFazio said. Biden told lawmakers ""We can't let that happen,"" DeFazio added.
Democrats want to boost electric buses, see thousands of new charging stations installed and want to facilitate the large electric trucks coming to market. DeFazio backed legislation this week to give the U.S. Postal Service $6 billion to make its next generation of delivery vehicles nearly all EVs.
DeFazio says adopting a vehicle miles-traveled fee to pay for infrastructure before a Sept. 30 highway funding deadline is not realistic. He said a gasoline tax hike could still be part of paying for infrastructure improvements.

He said his ""tentative timeline"" is to have an infrastructure bill approved by his committee in May. ""It is going to be green and it is going to be big,"" he said.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Thursday announced a partnership with a lithium metal battery startup to boost the U.S. automaker's battery development, allowing for higher electric vehicle driving range in a smaller package.
The joint development agreement with SolidEnergy Solutions (SES) of Woburn, Massachusetts, will allow GM to cut weight from the vehicle, a key goal for automakers as they push to roll out electric vehicles. GM has said by mid-decade its Ultium battery packs are projected to cost 60% less than today's packs with twice the energy density.
The companies plan to build a manufacturing line at SES to assemble a prototype battery by 2023, said GM, which invested an undisclosed amount in SES in 2015. Terms of the partnership announced Thursday were not disclosed.
Battery cells that use lithium metal in place of conventional graphite have the potential to store more energy, and thus provide more driving range in future electric vehicles (EVs), or similar range in a much smaller and lighter battery pack.
GM executives said the technology being developed with SES will be used in future Ultium-based vehicles, the first of which go on sale this fall with the launch of the GMC Hummer electric pickup truck.
""This is a great opportunity for us to find greater energy in a smaller package that will free up the space inside the vehicle for other technology,"" Kent Helfrich, executive director of GM's global electrification and battery systems, said in an interview.
Last year, GM introduced Ultium as a key pillar in its push to cut battery costs and extend electric driving range. GM is building a $2.3 billion joint-venture Ultium battery plant in Ohio with LG Energy Solution, a unit of LG Chem, and the companies expect to add a second factory, possibly in Tennessee.
The Detroit automaker said in January it was targeting ending the sale of light-duty vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel by 2035. 
GM said last year it was investing $27 billion on electric and self-driving vehicles and plans to launch 30 EVs globally by the end of 2025. 
The initial prototype batteries have completed 150,000 simulated test miles at GM's technical center in Warren, Michigan, the automaker said. Other investors in SES include Chinese automaker and GM partner SAIC Motor, South Korean battery maker SK Innovation and chip tooling maker Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT).

The deal is not exclusive and SES can work with other automakers, Helfrich said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A judge ruled  Barclays  (LON:BARC) will have to pay its own 33 million pound ($46.09 million) legal bill despite winning a case against British businesswoman Amanda Staveley's PCP Capital Group over how the bank negotiated a financial lifeline during the credit crisis in 2008.
Judge David Waksman said on Thursday he made ""no order as to costs"", meaning both sides will pay their own legal costs. PCP had been potentially liable for both sides' expenses under England's ""loser pays"" laws. 
Waksman in February had found Barclays guilty of “serious deceit” over the deal which offered Barclays a lifeline during the crisis, but denied Staveley damages and dismissed her claim.
Staveley incurred costs of nearly 20 million pounds in fighting the case, court documents showed. 
The civil case revolved around how Barclays secured billions of pounds from Qatar and Abu Dhabi-backed investors 13 years ago, allowing it to secure its independence - and the jobs of its bosses - by avoiding a state bailout.
PCP, which led a 3.25 billion pound, Abu Dhabi-backed investment into the bank, alleged it was induced to fund Barclays on much worse terms than Qatar - despite assurances it would get the same deal.
While Waksman said Barclays had deceived Staveley, he ultimately ruled in February that PCP had not proven its case on causation and loss, meaning the overall case failed.
“We welcome the Judge’s decision, which justly ensures that PCP is not liable to pay Barclays any of its costs of the litigation,"" Khaled Khatoun, a lawyer representing Staveley, said on Thursday.

1158,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 12:16PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Prada's CEO sees 2021 sales growing to 2.9-3.1 billion euros,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian fashion group Prada (OTC:PRDSY) expects revenues to grow to 2.9-3.1 billion euros this year after a pandemic-driven fall to 2.42 billion euros in 2020, CEO Patrizio Bertelli told Reuters. 
Bertelli said the company planned to remain independent and remained focused on internal growth while not excluding brand acquisitions, should opportunities arise. 
In 2019, revenues totalled 3.23 billion euros ($3.86 billion), so Italy's largest luxury group could be approaching pre-pandemic levels as early as the current year if it hits the top of its range. 
Consulting firm Bain forecast in November that the luxury sector would take until late 2022/early 2023 to recover to 2019 levels after the shock of the pandemic. . 
Obviously this year's performance will depend a lot on the development of the COVID-19 outbreak and related restrictions, Bertelli said in a Zoom call from his office in the group's manufacturing headquarters in Tuscany.
""The range for this year will swing between 2.9 and 3.1 billion in revenues,"" he said. 
Another key aspect, he added, is to understand when people will start travelling again.
""This will be the big driver of recovery for me. It is true that local consumption in China is doing very well, but there is also a need for people to travel again. 
If travel starts up again, we will certainly also see an improvement in sales,"" he added.
Prada's sales and profits rebounded at the end of last year, partly due to a strong performance in China and elsewhere in Asia, and the positive trend carried on into 2021. 
Bertelli reiterated that he does not intend to sell smaller brands such as Church's formal shoes and rubber-studded loafers Car Shoe, but he could instead be ""a buyer"". 
""We are focused right now on our own development, we think there is great room for growth and don't want to dissipate our energies on things that are not really great opportunities.""
""But we are open if we really find an opportunity, not a small to medium sized brand, but a large one or even a medium-small one but with great potential for growth.""
The Bertelli-Prada family, which controls 80% of the Hong-King listed fashion group, has never thought of selling and never will.
""This is impossible, even for the future the independence of the group is not in question,"" said Bertelli, who has previously said the company will eventually pass to his son Lorenzo.
With his wife Miuccia Prada, who took over as creative director, Bertelli transformed the historic Milan-based leather goods brand into a modern fashion group in the late 1970s.
Big international development followed in the 1990s and it was listed in Hong Kong in 2011.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow indexes hit all-time highs on Thursday as worries about rising inflation subsided, while a bigger-than-expected fall in weekly jobless claims reinforced expectations of a labor market recovery.
Mega-cap stocks Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc gained between 2.2% and 3.6%, recouping losses from a recent pullback and helping the benchmark S&P 500 surpass its Feb. 16 peak of 3,950.43.
The blue-chip Dow hit an all-time high for the fourth straight session, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is now about 5% below its Feb. 12 record close after slumping as much as 12% from that level last week.
Fewer than expected Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week as an improving public health environment allows more segments of the economy to reopen.
""The drop in jobless claims is another win for the week, and a solid sign that we're making some strides toward pre-pandemic life,"" said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E*TRADE Financial.
The benchmark Treasury yields were at 1.53% but below 1.6% ahead of an auction of U.S. 30-year debt later in the day. A weak seven-year auction in late February fueled inflation concerns and sent yields higher.
""The markets appear to have mostly adjusted (to higher yields). However, we still need to see how the market digests the 30-year auction today,"" Eric Merlis, head of global markets trading at Citizens, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.
The Dow on Wednesday logged a record closing high for the first time in two weeks as tepid inflation numbers allayed fears that the economy is running too hot while a sweeping $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill received a final nod from Congress.
Financial and industrials lagged on Thursday after outperforming other major S&P sectors this year as they are seen benefiting from a reopening economy. Tech and consumer discretionary, the two stay-at-home beneficiaries which had recently taken a beating, jumped 2.6% and 1.8%.
At 11:36 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 354.47 points, or 1.10%, to 32,651.49, the S&P 500 gained 56.13 points, or 1.44%, to 3,954.94 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 325.20 points, or 2.49%, to 13,393.58.
Wall Street's fear gauge hit a two-week low at 21.65 points.
Bumble Inc jumped about 14% after it reported a bigger-than-estimated rise in fourth-quarter revenue and said it expected pent-up demand from people who had been avoiding dating in person due to the pandemic.
A so-called ""meme"" stock AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc gained 5% as the cinema chain said the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines and the release of major movies would boost sales this year.
 Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) slumped 7% as the business software maker's cloud division reported quarterly revenue that missed analysts' estimates on increased competition from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corp.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3.7-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.6-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P 500 posted 68 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 369 new highs and 18 new lows.

PARIS (Reuters) - Paris and Brussels have agreed on the broad principles of a deal to restructure power group EDF (PA:EDF), two French government sources said on Thursday, adding that France hoped an agreement would be sealed in the coming weeks.
Talks about an overhaul of the indebted state-controlled company are expected to come to a head by the end of March, two union sources and another person familiar with the discussions told Reuters on Wednesday, with the government sources confirming France is now hopeful for a favourable outcome. 
""We've passed some important milestones, we are in agreement on a number of broad principles and now discussions around the details are underway,"" one of the sources told journalists ahead of government meetings with EDF unions on Thursday and Friday. 
EDF shares were up 11.8% by 1536 GMT.
The restructuring, dubbed ""Project Hercules"", is seen by EDF as key to boosting its revenues and investment plans and covering its costs. 
But France and the European Commission have been wrangling for months over the extent to which the nuclear power unit and various divisions at EDF need to be kept separate, in order to avoid creating a structure in which all its business would benefit from a form of state aid. 
The deal would involve resetting the price at which EDF sells on nuclear power to third party distributors. The parties had not yet fixed the price, but had agreed on the parameters that would be used to set it, the French government sources said. 
EDF declined to comment. The Commission said in a statement that it had ongoing contacts with the French government on the nuclear energy reform, but could not ""prejudge the timing or outcome of these contacts."" 
MAKE-OR-BREAK BY MARCH
EDF and the French state are working on a scenario under which the group's business units would be ring-fenced into three separate groups. 
Activities such as renewable energy could be opened up to investors, while the nuclear arm could be fully nationalised. In its current form EDF is 83.7% owned by the government. 
Brussels had pushed for a stricter separation, sources close to the talks said previously, prompting EDF boss Jean-Bernard Levy to warn that the European Commission wanted a full break-up of the company, which France rejects. 
Negotiations are now centered on issues such as how support functions could be shared across the business units, the French government sources said. 
One of the union sources briefed on the discussions told Reuters that a ""conclusive"" meeting was planned for the end of March.

Investing.com – Shares of Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR) jumped 32% Thursday after the company said data showed its therapy, VIR-7831, had been found to be highly effective in the treatment of Covid-19 patients.
Vir developed the treatment jointly with GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK). The stock bounce brings Vir to a market value of almost $6 billion.
The two companies are working together to develop existing and identify new anti-viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventive options for Covid-19.
Convinced of the treatment’s “profound efficacy” in reducing hospitalization and risk of death in early treatment of adults affected by the coronavirus, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee has asked the company to stop enrollment for the phase-3 trial.
The IDMC recommendation was based on an interim analysis of data from 583 patients enrolled in the trial, which demonstrated an 85% reduction in hospitalization or death in patients receiving the monotherapy compared to placebo, the primary endpoint of the trial.
VIR-7831 is an investigational compound, not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or any other regulatory authority. Its current development pipeline consists of product candidates targeting Covid-19, hepatitis B virus, influenza A and human immunodeficiency virus.

The state's power grid operator raised power prices sharply during a February freeze that pushed two power companies into bankruptcy. Others have warned of potential bankruptcies. Top officials this week called on the Public Utility Commission (PUC) of Texas to immediately reduce about $16 billion in power prices.
Any repricing would trigger lawsuits that the commission would lose, PUC Chairman Arthur D'Andrea bluntly told lawmakers at a hearing in Austin. Commodity contracts used to hedge power have closed and any repricing ""will have consequences"" for the state's power, agriculture and other markets, he said.
""If I do it, I get sued and lose right away,"" he told a state committee. The legislature could attempt to change the pricing by passing a bill, but it also would face lawsuits and could lose, he added. 
The state independent market adviser has recommended a pricing of the final 32 hours of the five-day emergency and called for some service fees to be cut, citing grid rules. Emergency charges amounted to $16 billion for power and about $1.5 billion for service fees tied to the power price.
The state's governor, lieutenant governor and 28 of 32 state senators this week also called on the PUC and grid operator to ""correct"" the final 32 hours of power pricing, citing the recommendation and impact on utilities. 
""These corrections are squarely within your authority, whether by your own action or an order to ERCOT,"" the senators told D'Andrea in a letter on Tuesday, referring to the state grid operator by its acronym. 
""I disagree"" with the senators' call, D'Andrea said. He has continually ruled out a power price rollback, arguing ""it is impossible to unscramble"" insisting the decision to raise prices during the cold snap was known to all grid users. 
D'Andrea pushed back against the market monitor's estimate of the power overcharges, telling lawmakers the amount was much smaller, about $3.2 billion. 

Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE), which handles Texas power trades, last week closed contracts that covered billions of dollars in state power trades and has no authority to reopen settled contracts. ICE has deferred settling four contracts tied to the service fees that are much smaller in value, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Investing.com -- Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) shares fell 9% on Thursday after its February quarter earnings and 1% to 3% sales growth projection disappointed investors.
Oracle also stayed silent on rumors it had invested in Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD), another drag on the stock. 
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) downgraded it to hold from buy, citing a ""lower growth profile"" compared to peers.
The company’s financial year runs March through February. In the recently concluded quarter, revenue at the business software maker rose 3%, in line with analysts’ estimates. On a constant currency basis, sales were flat, missing the company’s projections.  
For the ongoing quarter ending May, Oracle said profit, excluding some items, would be $1.28 to $1.32 a share. Analysts, on average, estimated $1.28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue will increase 5% to 7% in U.S. dollars, which would top analysts’ projections for 4% growth. Excluding currency fluctuations, the sales increase would be 1% to 3%, Oracle said.
According to Seeking Alpha, SocGen analyst Richard Nguyen doesn't ""anticipate a sharp acceleration in Oracle's revenue growth trajectory over FY22-23E ""despite a ""favorable"" product cycle.
The world’s second-largest software maker faced strong competition for cloud services from rivals, such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Revenue from cloud services and license support increased 5%, to $7.25 billion, narrowly falling short of analysts’ estimates, Bloomberg said.
Oracle is trading at a ""deep discount"" relative to its U.S. peers, which SocGen sees as justified ""given its lower growth profile,"" according to Seeking Alpha.

1164,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 11:06AM ET</span>","Denmark, Norway temporarily suspend AstraZeneca COVID shots after blood clot reports","By Nikolaj Skydsgaard and Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Health authorities in Denmark and Norway said on Thursday they had temporarily suspended the use of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine shots after reports of the formation of blood clots in some who have been vaccinated.
The move comes after Austria stopped using a batch of AstraZeneca shots while investigating a death from coagulation disorders and an illness from a pulmonary embolism.
Danish health authorities said the country's decision to suspend the shots for two weeks came after a 60-year old woman in Denmark, who was given an AstraZeneca shot from the same batch that was used in Austria, formed a blood clot and died. 
Danish authorities said they had responded ""to reports of possible serious side effects, both from Denmark and other European countries."" 
""It is currently not possible to conclude whether there is a link. We are acting early, it needs to be thoroughly investigated,"" Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said on Twitter. 
The vaccine would be suspended for 14 days in Denmark. 
""This is a cautionary decision,"" Geir Bukholm, director of infection prevention and control at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI), told a news conference.
FHI did not say how long the suspension would last.
""We ... await information to see if there is a link between the vaccination and this case with a blood clot,"" Bukholm said.
Also on Thursday, Italy said it would suspend use of an AstraZeneca batch that was different to the one used in Austria.
Some health experts said there was little evidence to suggest the AstraZeneca vaccine should not be administered and that the cases of blood clots corresponded with the rate of such cases in the general population. 
""This is a super-cautious approach based on some isolated reports in Europe,"" Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, told Reuters.
""The problem with spontaneous reports of suspected adverse reactions to a vaccine are the enormous difficulty of distinguishing a causal effect from a coincidence,"" he said, adding that the COVID-19 disease was very strongly associated with blood clotting.
AstraZeneca on Thursday told Reuters in a written statement the safety of its vaccine had been extensively studied in human trials and peer-reviewed data had confirmed the vaccine was generally well tolerated. 
The drugmaker said earlier this week its shots were subject to strict and rigorous quality controls and that there had been ""no confirmed serious adverse events associated with the vaccine"". It said it was in contact with Austrian authorities and would fully support their investigation. 
The European Union's drug regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), said on Wednesday there was no evidence so far linking AstraZeneca to the two cases in Austria. 
It said the number of thromboembolic events - marked by the formation of blood clots - in people who have received the AstraZeneca vaccine is no higher than that seen in the general population, with 22 cases of such events being reported among the 3 million people who have received it as of March 9.
EMA was not immediately available for comment on Thursday.
Four other countries - Estonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Latvia - have stopped inoculations from the batch while investigations continue, the EMA said.
The batch of 1 million doses went to 17 EU countries. 
Swedish authorities said they did not find sufficient evidence to stop vaccination with AstraZeneca's vaccine. Sweden has found two cases of ""thromboembolic events"" in connection with AstraZeneca's vaccine and about ten for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
""We see no reason to revise our recommendation,"" Veronica Arthurson, head of drug safety at the Swedish Medical Products Agency, told a news conference. ""There is nothing to indicate that the vaccine causes this type of blood clots.""
Spain on Thursday said it had not registered any cases of blood clots related to AstraZeneca's vaccine so far and would continue administering the shots.

The California-based company's stock was up 12% in premarket trade, after rising more than 20% earlier in the day, also boosting the value of the shares held by founder David Baszucki - known to Roblox users as his avatar ""builderman"" - to $4.6 billion.
Wood's ARK Next Generation Internet exchange-traded fund (ETF) said it had bought more than 500,000 shares of Roblox, weighting it at 0.47% of the fund and adding to the strongest opening ever for a direct stock market listing.
""Roblox's blockbuster debut mirrors other gaming and broader tech IPOs that have gone live in the last six months, with high levels of demand on the secondary market after the company lists,"" John Patrick Lee, ETF Product Manager at VanEck, said.
Wood, a long-time Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) bull, has a massive online following and is a popular topic of discussion among the social-media savvy herd of small-time traders on the Reddit forums behind disproportionate surges in beaten-down stocks of some companies.
Message volumes on Roblox on trading-focused social media site Stocktwits soared more than nine-fold on Thursday, with more than 80% of users' messages reflecting positive sentiment toward the scrip, data showed.
ARK Invest on Wednesday also sold a little over 67,000 Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shares from the ARKW ETF, amounting to about 0.3% of the ETF's assets.
Roblox was founded in 2004 by Baszucki and Erik Cassel, although its journey began in 1989 when Baszucki and Cassel programmed a 2D simulated physics lab Knowledge Revolution that would later lay the groundwork for the company.
After the sale of Knowledge Revolution in 1998, the duo began work on Roblox. Cassel died in 2013 after battling cancer for three years.
Baszucki joined the tech billionaire's club after the site was valued at nearly $30 billion in a funding deal late last year. His stake was valued at $4.58 billion on Wednesday, according to Reuters calculations.
Usage and spending on Roblox has surged as kids stuck at home in the COVID-19 pandemic spent more time on the platform, fuelling an 85% year-on-year jump in daily active users in 2020 and a surge in monthly in-app sales.

An average 37.1 million people globally log on to Roblox daily to connect with friends and play popular games like ""Jailbreak"" and ""Speed Run 4"".

ARRANMORE, Ireland (Reuters) - The army pilots landed their helicopter on the tiny Irish island of Arranmore just before lunch on Thursday and handed over their precious cargo of COVID-19 vaccines to Dr. Kevin Quinn and his grinning daughter Aoife.
The arrival of first batch of shots last month was a ""joyous occasion"", Quinn said. Thursday's delivery of second doses was even more momentous - he reckons he will now be able to fully vaccinate around half the population in the next few days.
With fewer than 500 residents, the remote island off the northwestern tip of Ireland is one of the hardest places to reach in a vaccination programme that, like in the rest of the European Union, has been hampered by supply problems.
The two army pilots took one hour and 40 minutes to fly in from the Casement Aerodrome military air base on the outskirts of Dublin. Aoife, who works as a nurse on Arranmore, helped her father and the crew carry the frozen boxes of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) shots to his car, parked down a lane.
""We're privileged to get the second doses so soon and grateful of the recognition of the unique need of isolated communities,"" Quinn said after seeing the helicopter arrive.
""The mood was incredible after the first vaccine, a lovely joyous occasion and one of the best days I've had in general practice.""
Ireland has administered 536,000 vaccines among its population of 4.9 million to healthcare workers, care home residents and the most elderly. Just over 154,000 or 3% of the population have received the second of their two doses.
Army helicopters have also been deployed to drop vaccines to the Aran Islands off the west coast of Ireland.
Two Naval Ships docked in Dublin and Galway were used for temporary testing early in the pandemic, before officers ran a testing centre at the national  Aviva  (LON:AV) Stadium, with others redeployed to assist with contact tracing.
Personnel are now setting up and managing mass vaccination centres around the country and will soon be involved in the running of quarantine hotels.
For the people of Arranmore, half of whom are above the age of 60, some normality is at last on the horizon. The island is one of a small number of areas where the majority are fluent in native Irish and many use it as their working language.

""With an elderly population and a diaspora that mostly live in Dublin, Glasgow or America, it's been extremely difficult,"" said Quinn. ""Hopefully this summer will be better than last.""

(Reuters) - Shares of Coupang, South Korea's largest e-commerce company, were set to open up to 43% above their offer price on Thursday, after the company raised $4.6 billion in the biggest U.S. initial public offering this year.
At 10:13 a.m. ET, the stock was set to open at a range between $45 and $50, giving the company a valuation of around $86 billion at the top end of the range.
Coupang said in a statement that it had priced 130 million shares sold in the IPO at $35 per share, higher than the marketing range $32-$34 per share, giving Seoul-headquartered e-commerce giant, which is backed by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, a market value of $60 billion.
Founded in 2010 by Korean-American billionaire Bom Suk Kim, Coupang rose to prominence after launching its guaranteed same-day or next-day delivery service in the East Asian country. SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund owns 35.1% of Coupang.
Achieving a $60 billion valuation would add to good news for the Vision Fund, which is bouncing back from an annual loss in March. Last month, it announced record quarterly profit.
Coupang operates an online marketplace sells everything from fresh groceries to toys, as well as food delivery app Coupang Eats. 
""We're laser focused on our home market,"" Kim said in an interview, ""We're going to invest in 50,000 more jobs and billions of dollars more in not only the infrastructure, but the unique end to end technology that powers all of those services.""
In 2020, Coupang's net sales jumped 91% year-on-year to $11 billion. Net losses narrowed to $567.6 million from $770.2 million posted in the prior year.
Coupang's successful share offering comes as the U.S. IPO market is at its strongest in more than two decades and investors are flocking to buy shares in technology companies that have benefited during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The IPO is the biggest in the United States this year, surpassing the $2.15 billion raised by dating app Bumble Inc. It also marks a jump in Coupang's valuation, which was pegged at $9 billion in a fundraising round in 2018, according to Pitchbook.
Analysts in South Korea said the strong response to Coupang's offering was a result of its market-leader position in the country at a time when, like many other e-commerce firms, its sales have grown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Considering the high level of valuation inherent in the pricing, the market is giving a generous assessment of the company's achieving the top spot in market share,"" said Park Sang-joon, analyst at Kiwoom Securities. 
Coupang was the top-ranked South Korean e-commerce firm in 2020 with 19.2% market share, according to Euromonitor, compared to Naver Corp's 13.6% and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) Korea's 12.8%. It was the 10th largest e-commerce firm in the world, based on retail value excluding sales tax.
The company's shares will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday under the symbol ""CPNG.""

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Allen & Co, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) are the lead underwriters for the offering.

(Reuters) -  British American Tobacco  (NYSE:BTI) said on Thursday it will buy a nearly 20% stake in Canada-based cannabis producer Organigram for about 126 million pounds ($175.8 million) as it seeks to expand beyond its main tobacco business.
Organigram grows cannabis and makes cannabis-derived products in Canada, where marijuana was legalised in 2018.
Big tobacco and liquor companies in North America have already made large investments in the nascent industry, with cannabis seen as a less harmful alternative to cigarettes.
With top Democratic lawmakers in the United States also promising to decriminalise marijuana use, analysts and experts predict record investment in the industry this year.
The deal will give BAT (LON:BATS) access to R&D technologies, product innovation and cannabis expertise, it said in a statement, with an initial focus on natural remedy cannabidiol (CBD). 
""This move takes us into a new space and we are not ruling out any product innovation,"" David O'Reilly (NASDAQ:ORLY), director of Scientific Research at BAT, told Reuters. 
Organigram Chief Executive Greg Engel said the companies will jointly develop new products for cannabis delivery, both oral and vapour based, and will be able to commercialise any products developed under their own brands. 
Both BAT and Organigram will contribute scientists, researchers, and product developers, BAT said. It will become Organigram's largest shareholder and can appoint two directors to its board.
NATURAL FIT
""We view this move as a strong positive. Cannabis overall provides a natural fit for tobacco and a big incremental growth opportunity,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Owen Bennett wrote in an note.
BAT has expertise in operating in a regulated environment and experience of growing a crop similar to hemp CBD, Bennett said, adding that the timing of the deal before Organigram's possible entry into the United States is also a big positive. 
Bennett estimates U.S. CBD market sales of over $16 billion by 2025.
Organigram's U.S.-listed shares surged around 30% to $3.75 in morning trading on the Nasdaq. BAT's London-listed shares were up slightly. 
BAT's investment comes two days after the Lucky Strike maker laid out environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets, including switching more people to less harmful products.
The group aims to achieve at least 5 billion pounds in revenue from sales of e-cigarettes, tobacco heating and oral nicotine products in 2025. 
Elsewhere in the industry, Marlboro maker Altria (NYSE:MO) has invested in pot producer  Cronos  Group (NASDAQ:CRON) Inc, while Corona beer-maker Constellation Brands Inc (NYSE:STZ) has a stake in  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC), the largest cannabis company globally by market value.

1170,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 10:27AM ET</span>",Wall Street Is Rethinking the Treasury Threat to Big Tech Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- Don’t fear Treasury yields killing off the stock market’s golden goose just yet.
As the Nasdaq 100 Index recovers from a $1.5 trillion rout, there’s good reason to think technology shares can defy machinations in U.S. bonds.
Studies from  Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). show the world’s biggest equity sector has a fickle relationship with Treasuries, if it has one at all. Quant powerhouse AQR Capital Management has found little evidence that yields drive how expensive megacaps trade relative to their cheaper counterparts.
And of course, secular economic trends have been powering the likes of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). for years now -- when benchmark rates were far higher than current levels.
All that makes the Treasury-stock link more complex than it seems.
Put another way, while the recent Treasury selloff has pummeled Big Tech, that doesn’t mean bonds are a natural foe for a sector hitched to secular trends from 5G to automation.
“Many tech companies will continue to benefit for many years from very strong themes that will result in outsized earnings growth,” said Terry Ewing, head of equities at Mediolanum International Funds, which oversees about $54 billion. “The dilemma for portfolio managers running a balanced mandate is that actually the de-rating we’ve seen in growth stocks has put them at a much more attractive level.”
Ewing’s funds began offloading a handful of tech stocks for cyclical names from the third quarter, just as rising expectations for an economic re-opening pushed yields higher in the world’s biggest bond market.
As the U.S. yield curve steepened last month, $1.5 trillion of value was wiped off tech shares, while assets deemed less sensitive to duration risk like value stocks -- banks, oil drillers and commodity producers -- surged.
The Nasdaq 100 jumped nearly 2% on Thursday morning in New York, as 10-year Treasury yields traded little changed around 1.5%.
Quant Perspective
From the perspective of quants who dissect equities by their factors, there are a few ways to explain the last month’s rotation.
Technology companies are typically dubbed growth stocks thanks to their strong expected profit expansion, often far into the future. That’s in contrast to value shares, which trade with lower multiples due to their riskier businesses.
When rates fall, economic growth is typically muted. That makes a company like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). look like a a safer bet since it’s riding the secular trend of streaming rather than ups and downs of the business cycle. Meanwhile the likes of  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)., tied to oil demand, look riskier.
In the post-crisis era of monetary easing, that’s how the valuation dynamic played out: Netflix’s long-term earnings were discounted at lower rates -- making it more expensive.
Now, opposing forces are in play. Rising yields are making the near-term cash flows of cheaper equities like Exxon Mobil more attractive.
“Sooner or later we will see pretty decent economic growth,” said Georg Elsaesser, a quant portfolio manager at Invesco. “I would be more than surprised if that wouldn’t be favorable for high-risk factors like value.”
Yet all these relationships are volatile -- and have far less explanatory power than commonly asserted.
Interest-rate changes only explain 19% of the returns posted by the growth factor versus value since 2018, Goldman Sachs strategists wrote in a note last month. That compares with 54% for cyclicals versus defensive.
In other words, industry-specific trends, not bonds, seem to be driving this tech-heavy part of the market.
Similarly Deutsche Bank’s quants find a zero beta, or sensitivity, between bonds and tech since 2015. In contrast, financials and energy had the most positive links with yields, and utilities and real estate the most negative.
According to Andreas Farmakas, a quantitative strategist at Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn), this shows how the tech sector and Treasuries lack a direct and consistent link. In fact, these stocks in the past often rose with rates, with the latter seen as a sign of economic strength that could benefit corporate earnings.
That’s not to say there isn’t reason to fret recent co-movements.
“Given the ties between technology, the overbought Covid trade and ultimately equity indices -- they take up a large chunk –- the correlation flipped,” Farmakas said.
In other words, bonds have lately turned from friend to foe -- and that’s why quants like Invesco’s Elsaesser are so reluctant to time markets.
For its part, AQR last year called the link between interest rates and value -- which involves a bet against growth -- “suspect” since it varies greatly depending on the period, the markets and measurements studied.
All this suggests that once the initial reflation frenzy settles, there’s no reason to fear bond yields will necessarily doom the tech trade. In fact Ewing at Mediolanum is eyeing some bargains in the months ahead.
“Somewhere along the second-half of this year going into next year it’ll be prudent for investors to start considering moving to higher-quality names rather than cyclical recovery,” he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are piling into Europe's energy-and-financials-heavy stock markets, yet dividend expectations remain far gloomier than in the United States, with payouts seen well below pre-pandemic levels for years to come.
European markets are benefiting from investors rotating into ""reflation"" oriented sectors and cheaply-priced ""value"" plays, many of which are good at returning cash to shareholders.
Indeed, many companies, including Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF),  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) have restored dividends as markets stabilised and regulators eased the curbs imposed at the height of the pandemic.
But dividend expectations remain downbeat. Financial data provider IHS Markit forecasts European dividends will be 10% below 2019 levels next year. But it expects U.S. payouts back at pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021. 
Refinitive I/B/E/S estimates peg European dividends at $269 billion in the next 12 months, compared with the $310 billion paid in the year to March 2020. U.S. companies, meanwhile, are seen paying out $510 billion in the next 12 months, approaching the year-ago record of $524 billion. 
Graphic: Divi race: Europe plays catch up as U.S. aims record - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/jbyprajwnve/Pasted%20image%201615457196399.png
""Dividends are always caught in the middle,"" said Grace Peters, investment strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
""People are either chasing strong value stocks or longer-term growth stocks. This is typical early in the economic cycle ... we'll see more interest in dividends in the latter part of the cycle.""
Companies' payouts to shareholders globally plunged more than 10% on an underlying basis in 2020, but European dividends - not counting Britain - fell by a quarter, Janus Henderson's Global Dividend Index shows.
Derivatives pricing is even more pessimistic than that of analysts. Dividend futures, which allow investors to take a position on future payouts, show European dividends as far out as 2028 at 10% below pre-pandemic levels.

Some analysts dismiss such futures pricing as overly conservative, possibly because of thin liquidity. They note futures see U.S. dividends flat to slightly lower at current levels even out to 2030.
""Markets tend to get very gloomy on the dividend outlook. For two-three years after the 2009 financial crisis, futures were implying continued cuts in dividends,"" said Kiran Ganesh, head of multi asset at UBS Global Wealth Management.

(Reuters) - Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc, the world's largest manager of alternative assets such as private equity and real estate, is seeking to raise $4 billion for a fund to invest in various asset classes, according to people familiar with the matter.
It is the fourth such fund to be raised by the New York-based firm. Dubbed Blackstone Tactical Opportunities Fund IV, it will have a mandate to invest in assets that typically fall outside the scope of Blackstone's other funds, from timber and mines to oil tankers and satellites. It can also invest in companies, either through their equity or their debt. 
Blackstone has marketed its predecessor funds in this category as offering ""well-protected downside and low correlation to public markets"".
The fund could finalize its first commitments from investors by June, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.
A Blackstone spokesman declined to comment.
Blackstone's previous Tactical Opportunities investments include dating app Bumble Inc, cybersecurity firm FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) Inc, life sciences firm Cryoport Inc, and telecoms infrastructure company Phoenix Tower International.
Blackstone raised $4.09 billion for Tactical Opportunities Fund III in 2019. Its Tactical Opportunities Fund II and inaugural Tactical Opportunities Fund, which raised $6.7 billion and $5.6 billion respectively, had both returned 1.3 times of its investors' money as of June 2020, according to the California Public Employees' Retirement System.

Blackstone's Tactical Opportunities funds have $30 billion in assets under management across 142 investments, according to its website. The unit is run by David Blitzer, a Blackstone senior managing director and an investor in sports teams such as New Jersey Devils of the U.S. hockey league, the National Basketball Association's Philadelphia 76ers, and English soccer club Crystal Palace.

The Beijing-based company posted revenue of 745.8 billion yuan ($114.97 billion) for the year, beating analysts' estimate of 740.81 billion yuan.
In a pandemic-struck year, during which retail sales fell 3.9% in China, JD.com's strategy of ramping up its in-house delivery network enabled faster deliveries.
The company has also been working to expand into price-sensitive lower-tier cities through its shopping platform Jingxi in a bid to stave off stiff competition from rivals like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) that are equally popular.
As a result, JD.com raked in 110 million new active customer accounts during the year. Meanwhile, Jack Ma's Alibaba added about 68 million active buyers in the same period.
U.S.-listed shares of the company, which have been volatile as China looks to tighten scrutiny on its tech giants, were up 3% at $91.98 in early trading.
The world's second-largest economy has vowed to strengthen oversight of its big tech firms, which rank among the world's largest and most valuable, citing concerns they have built market power that stifles competition, misused consumer data and violated consumer rights.
The long-term impact of this on JD.com's business, though unclear, remains a threat. In late December, regulators fined the company, along with Alibaba and other e-commerce sites, 500,000 yuan for engaging in irregular pricing.
The company's net revenue rose 31.4% to 224.3 billion yuan in the quarter ended Dec. 31, beating analysts' estimate of 219.73 billion yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Thursday as fresh data from the labor market bolstered hopes that the economy is coming out of a Covid-19-induced hibernation.
The Labor Department said initial jobless claims fell to their lowest level since the start of the pandemic last week - albeit the absolute level of 712,000 remains close to unimaginable for the time before Covid. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 144 points, or 0.5%, at a new record high of 32,441 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite was outperforming again with a rise of 1.6%.
The data ""strongly suggest that any temporary job losses triggered by last month’s huge winter storm have been more than offset by a decline in the underlying trend,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics in emailed comments. ""This, in turn, has been triggered by the gradual re-opening now underway across the country.""
Shepherdson said he expects the weekly initial claims figure to fall to below 500,000 by Memorial Day.
Gains were consistently spread around the tech-themed megacaps which had slid increasingly sharply as the market began to push long-term interest rates higher over recent months. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was up 1.4%, amid news that it had begun production of the iPhone 12 in India, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock was up 1.4%, helped by a report suggesting that EU antitrust regulators are struggling to make their most recent antitrust charges against the e-commerce giant stick.
The ‘gamma squeeze’ on GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock appeared to ease a little, although the stock still swung from a premarket loss to a gain of 2.1% in early trading. The second spike has caused most pain not for short-selling hedge funds, who largely closed out their positions during January’s squeeze, but rather options brokers having to cover themselves in the cash market, having sold a welter of call options in recent days.
Among the few losers in early trade was Oracle stock (NYSE:ORCL), which fell 8.7% after a quarterly update that disappointed on more than one level after the close on Thursday. Not only did the software maker’s revenue guidance fall short of expectations, but it also failed to confirm that it had transferred some of its cash balances into Bitcoin."

Investing.com –  Bumble  Inc (NASDAQ:BMBL) shares jumped more than 10% in Thursday’s premarket trading as the company’s beat expectations for the December quarter earnings, its first report since going public last month. To add to the euphoria, its earnings forecast for the ongoing quarter and this year surpassed most expectations.
Bumble is the owner of the dating app of the same name that allows women to make the first move. The shares still traded up 8% after the U.S. market open.
In the fourth quarter, revenue rose 31%, to $165.6 million, beating Bloomberg’s average analyst estimate of $163.3 million. Total paying users increased 32%, to 2.7 million, with an average revenue per user of $20.02, nearly unchanged from last year.
On the bottom line, Bumble reported a net loss of $26.1 million compared with earnings of $17.2 million a year earlier.
The Austin-based company forecast revenue between $163 million and $165 million in the current period. Wall Street was forecasting $163 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For the whole year, Bumble sees sales of $716 million to $726 million, which Bloomberg said is ahead of expectations.
India, Mexico, and Germany are markets where use of the Bumble app is growing, Bloomberg quoted its CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd as saying. Herd, at 31, was the youngest woman to take a large company public in the U.S. as CEO."

(Reuters) - The European Union's drugs regulator on Thursday approved Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s single dose COVID-19 vaccine, as the bloc seeks to speed up a stuttering inoculation campaign and boost its supplies. 
The COVID-19 shot is the fourth to be endorsed for use in the EU after vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca-Oxford University and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), and is recommended for those over 18 years of age, the European Medicines agency (EMA) said. It's the first single-dose shot.
The United States, Canada and Bahrain have also approved the shot. South Africa is carrying out an expedited review.
""With this latest positive opinion, authorities across the European Union will have another option to combat the pandemic and protect the lives and health of their citizens,"" EMA's Executive Director Emer Cooke said.
Final approval by the European Commission is expected soon. EU conditional marketing authorisation allows a treatment to be sold for a year without full data on its efficacy and side-effects being available.
The region is having difficulty taming a spike cases driven by a more contagious variant of the coronavirus, with countries including Italy and France imposing fresh lockdowns.
J&J chief scientific officer Paul Stoffels described it as a ""landmark moment"" for the U.S. drugmaker and the world as governments struggle to control the pandemic which has crushed economies and killed more than 2.7 million.
The shot, called COVID Vaccine Janssen after the J&J unit that developed it, will help bulk up EU vaccine supplies after a faltering rollout due to delivery delays from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN).
J&J has agreed to deliver at least 200 million doses to the EU this year, including 55 million in the second quarter, with the first shipments expected next month.
Exact volumes are not clear though and the U.S. drugmaker has told the European Union it is facing supply issues that may complicate plans to deliver the second quarter doses in full.
The news came as Norway and Denmark temporarily suspended the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine after reports of the formation of blood clots in some who have been vaccinated. 
TRIAL DATA
In J&J's 44,000-person global trial, the vaccine was found to be 66% effective at preventing moderate-to-severe COVID-19 four weeks after inoculation. It was 100% effective in preventing hospitalization and death due to the virus.
In its statement on Thursday, the EMA said the vaccine was found to be 67% effective two weeks after inoculation.
The side effects were usually mild or moderate and cleared within a couple of days after vaccination, it said. The most common ones were pain at the injection site, headache, tiredness, muscle pain and nausea.
Though many rival shots have reported a higher protection rate, J&J's vaccine could help boost thin EU supplies and simplify inoculation campaigns because it does not require a second dose or need to be shipped frozen.
Direct comparison between headline numbers reported by different drugmakers is difficult because their trials had different goals, and J&J's study was conducted while new, more contagious variants of the virus were circulating.

Its vaccine delivers immunity-building proteins through a weakened version of a common cold virus, similar to AstraZeneca's shot. J&J has also used the technology in its EU-approved Ebola vaccine.

Investing.com – Technology shares were broadly higher in premarket trading Thursday, with the all FAANG stocks being up 1.5% to 2% each.
Futures of all the broader indices also pointed to a gap up at the opening as fears over higher inflation and long-term interest rates receded.
FAANG is the acronym for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (the ‘G’ referring to Google, Alphabet’s core). These growth stocks usually move in tandem even though their businesses are disparate.
Growth stocks like the tech shares are back in favor with investors as liquidity gets sloshed around, inflation remains low and the upside in crude prices looks capped.
Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet were all up 1.5%-1.6% with Apple being the leader with gains of 1.8%. At one point, the stock was up 2.5% after closing nearly 1% lower Wednesday.
Apple on Thursday issued a statement saying it had started manufacturing the iPhone 12 in India, a move that will not only help its sales in one of the world's biggest potential markets, but also offer it an insurance policy against any fresh tension between the U.S. and China, where the iPhone is currently produced. While the company did not name its contractor in India, a Reuters report said it was Taiwan-based Foxconn.
Apple has bet big on India since 2017 when it began to assemble iPhones there with the help of Wistron, another Taiwanese supplier.
Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron have together committed close to $900 million over 5 years to make iPhones in India, lured by the ‘Atmanirbhar’ (self-reliance) scheme of Narendra Modi government, which incentivizes local production.

In contrast to the epic short-squeeze in January, the current spike appears to be driven by both retail investors and hedge funds looking to squeeze the price of the underlying share by heavy purchases of options. which force the brokers who have sold call options on the underlying stock to hedge themselves by buying in the cash market. Such 'gamma squeezes' then allow the initial buyer of the call option to sell it at a profit.
GameStop stock has more than doubled in the last week and its current price is some four times what some long-term bulls see as fair value. The last week's movement has taken place as the company appointed Ryan Cohen, the founder of Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) and now a major investor in GameStop, to head a committee pushing the development of its online sales.

1183,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 07:25AM ET</span>","Insurers, reinsurers prepare for battle over UK COVID-19 business payments","By Carolyn Cohn and Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - Top insurance companies, ordered by Britain's highest court to pay thousands of small businesses millions of pounds in claims for COVID-19 disruption, are facing a battle with reinsurers over who should foot the bill, industry sources said.
Bars, beauty parlours, nightclubs and other small companies in January won the right to business interruption insurance payments after senior judges ruled many insurance policies should cover losses caused by lockdowns in a test case brought by Britain's market watchdog.
But senior insurance executives said the judgment, which affects 60 insurers, has not helped to clarify whether insurers or their reinsurers -- companies which provide financial protection to the industry -- are on the hook for payments.
""We're left to fight it out,"" one senior insurance executive told Reuters.
""We'd expect reinsurers to take their share, but there's always a bit of pushback - that's how (reinsurers) are programmed.""
Britain's handling of this case and any subsequent wrangling with reinsurers is being watched by investors around the world, where disputes between insurers and businesses over pandemic- related claims have in many cases yet to be resolved.
In the United States, for example, pandemic-hit businesses have filed nearly 1,500 individual lawsuits. Insurers have won a large chunk of cases so far. 
Steve McGill, CEO of insurance broker McGill and Partners, said interpreting the wording of these complex policies often boils down to how insurers and reinsurers view ""shades of grey"".
The Association of British Insurers said insurers are paying two billion pounds ($2.79 billion) for undisputed business interruption claims in 2020. But they could face billions more in claims after the Supreme Court judgment, industry sources said.
Some reinsurance contract clauses will limit the amount insurers can claw back from reinsurers, investment management firm Tangency Capital said in a recent investor letter, meaning that ""business interruption losses will primarily be borne by insurers."" 
TAIL RISK?
The British case revolved around leading insurers such as Hiscox, RSA, QBE, Argenta, Arch and MS Amlin.
Big reinsurers include Munich Re, Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) and syndicates in the Lloyd's of London market. 
Hiscox has already raised its 2020 estimate for pandemic-related business interruption by $48 million net of reinsurance, bringing total claims to nearly $190 million.
RSA has said that after applying catastrophe reinsurance protection, it estimates the Supreme Court judgment would cost it about 85 million pounds -- before applying a further group-wide aggregate reinsurance programme. Chief Executive Stephen Hester told Reuters last month that the company was not in any dispute with reinsurers. 
MS Amlin, Argenta, Hiscox and QBE declined to comment. Arch did not respond to a request for comment.
Reinsurer Munich Re said it would not question valid claims, while Lloyd's welcomed clarity for policyholders. Swiss Re declined to comment.
But investors remain concerned about potential disputes with reinsurers, said Colm Kelly, co-head of European insurance equity research at UBS.
""...investors have asked the question – is there a tail risk, however small, that some reinsurers may contest payments?"" he told Reuters. He also said: ""There are small reinsurers operating in Europe that could have a solvency event if they had to cover claims of that size and nature.""
Under European Union solvency rules, insurers have to maintain certain levels of capital. 
DAMAGES
In the meantime, insurers have started to make payments or settlement offers. While one East London cafe said it had been offered just 13 pounds, other businesses are expecting tens of thousands in pay-outs.
Businesses have had to wait for 10 months for many insurance claims to be declared valid -- piling on debts that have threatened their futures.
Ralph Fearnhead, legal director at law firm Mishcon de Reya, which represented some policyholders in the UK case, said subsequent claims for damages due to late payment of insurance could dwarf the size of an original claim if businesses had to make staff redundant or went into liquidation. And reinsurers are likely to question such claims.
""Where it's a failure of an insurer to act in reasonable time, it's hard to see that reinsurers would willingly pick up additional damages,"" he said.
Disputes may not lead to further open court appearances, as disagreements between insurers and reinsurers are often settled in private arbitration hearings.
These types of hearings are already taking place in the so-called event cancellation market, after global sporting and music events and conferences were cancelled due to the pandemic.

LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) has enough funding to weather the crisis in the aviation industry caused by the pandemic, its chief executive said on Thursday, after the engine maker plunged to a record 4 billion pound ($5.6 billion) underlying loss for 2020.
The British company said its cash burn should halve this year, and turn positive in the second half as vaccinations kick in and travellers return to the skies. 
""The worst is now well behind us,"" CEO Warren East said. 
But even if that proves optimistic, Rolls is well placed to cope with more turmoil after a drive to cut costs and raise funds, he added. 
""We have our cash burn under control ... We have ample liquidity to get through this crisis as long as it lasts,"" East told reporters.
Rolls' model of charging airlines for the number of hours its engines fly meant much of its income dried up last year when travel stopped, forcing it to ask shareholders for cash and take on 5.3 billion pounds of new debt. 
Its civil aerospace arm, whose engines power Airbus A350 and Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 jets, accounts for just over half of group revenue in a normal year.
Last year's cash burn of 4.2 billion pounds was in line with analysts' expectations, and Rolls guided that would reduce this year to 2 billion pounds.
The company axed 15% of staff in 2020, and earmarked 2 billion pounds of assets for sale to repair its balance sheet. 
HISTORIC LOSS
Rolls, founded in 1906 and one of the last vestiges of Britain's once mighty manufacturing industry, posted an underlying pretax loss of 4 billion pounds for 2020, worse than analyst expectations for a 3.1 billion pound loss and its biggest ever on an underlying basis.
Rolls shares were up 2.6% to 116 pence at 1050 GMT. They have lost 41% since the start of the pandemic around a year ago, but have gained 22% in the last month on travel recovery hopes. 
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Sandy Morris said Rolls had ""much to do"", but the ""fix"" was feasible. ""The possibility of reaching modest net debt by end 2023 is alive,"" he said. 
Rolls' cash flow improvement this year depends on airlines flying 55% of 2019 levels during 2021. Its assumption is for more travel later this year as vaccine programmes progress. 
The sale of Rolls' Spain-based ITP unit, expected to be its biggest disposal, is progressing well and there are ongoing conversations with a number of potential buyers, it said. 
""We're open to approaches from any party with a credible offering at the moment. That includes being open, by the way, to discussions with potential Spanish investors or partners,"" East said. 
Industry sources say the sale has sparked tensions with Germany’s MTU Aero Engines (OTC:MTUAY), a partner of U.S. engine maker Pratt & Whitney. MTU said last month it not been invited to bid. Rolls declined to comment.
Part of Rolls' asset sale plan ran into problems this week when Norway suspended the 150 million euro sale of Rolls' Norwegian unit, Bergen Engines, on security grounds.

LONDON (Reuters) - BMW said on Thursday that it was back on a profitable track in 2021 after recovering from shutdowns and a serious dent to sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the first half of last year. 
The premium German carmaker said it would have five fully-electric models available this year, as it races alongside the rest of the industry to roll out new zero-emission models in the face of tightening CO2 emissions targets in Europe and China.
Plant shutdowns in the first half of 2020 to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus led many in the industry to expect a disastrous year, but a market rebound spurred by China helped the industry recover faster than expected.
""Our performance in the second half of the year demonstrated just how strong the BMW Group is ... we soon overcame the impact of weeks of plant closures and nationwide lockdowns,"" Chief Executive Oliver Zipse said. ""We are starting 2021 revitalised and with a favourable tailwind.""
BMW sales in China rose 7.4% in 2020 versus 2019, mostly offsetting declines in other regions.
Chinese consumers also helped propel BMW's rival  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) to a full-year pre-tax profit. 
Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY)'s 2020 profit fell less than expected, again with a push from Chinese drivers eager to snap up premium Audi vehicles.
BMW said that, with the exception of the second quarter, it remained profitable throughout 2020. 
Investments in electrification, self-driving technology and connectivity meant that research and development costs remained high at 5.7 billion euros ($6.8 billion), though more than 4% below the nearly 6 billion euros the company spent in 2019. 
The company cut its other capital expenditures by more than 30% during the year.
The premium carmaker posted a full-year 2020 pre-tax profit of 5.2 billion euros ($6.22 billion), down nearly 27% from 7.2 billion euros in the prior year. 
BMW ended the year with free cash flow of 3.4 billion euros, up from 2.6 billion euros in 2019 despite widespread lockdowns.

The carmaker's pre-tax margin for the automotive segment fell to 5.3% from 6.8%.

At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 85 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 23 points, or 0.6%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 205 points, or 1.6%.
The House of Representatives passed the $1.9 trillion Covid relief plan on Wednesday, putting $1,400 in the pockets of people earning less than $80,000 and providing relief for airlines and restaurants among other hard-hit industries. The bill will be sent back to President Joe Biden to be signed into law, probably on Friday.
This helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average to close up 1.5%, at a new all time high, while the S&P 500 index added 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index missed out on Wednesday’s rally, but is expected to catch up with hefty gains Thursday. 
Helping the growth sector has been a reduction in Treasury yields, with the benchmark 10-Year now yielding less than 1.50%, a substantial drop from the 1.62% level seen last week. This followed the release of benign CPI data Wednesday, as well as the $38 billion auction of 10-year Treasury notes proceeding smoothly.
Thursday sees a $24 billion 30-year bond auction, as well as another read on the health of the labor market in the form of the weekly jobless claims data for last week.
In further positive news, President Biden said he will double the U.S. order of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, bringing the country’s supply to enough for 500 million people. This comes after nearly a quarter of U.S. adults have received at least one vaccine shot.
In the corporate sector, attention remains on GameStop (NYSE:GME) as the electronic games retailer’s stock continues its wild ride. Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) will also be in the spotlight, after the online gaming platform saw strong demand for its stock on its debut after a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange.
Oil prices rose Thursday, as the latest data from the Energy Information Administration showed that domestic gasoline supplies slid last week, by almost 12 million barrels, to the lowest in about four months, while demand rose to the highest since November.
Gains were tempered by crude inventories rising by 13.8 million barrels.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% higher at $65.12 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.1% to $68.65.  
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,729.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1959.

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) on Thursday announced Andrew Mackenzie, a former BHP CEO and BP (NYSE:BP) veteran, as its next chairman who will help lead the energy company through a major shift away from oil and gas to low-carbon energy.
Mackenzie will succeed Charles Holliday who will step down on May 18 after serving six years in the role.
Mackenzie, who left BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) last year after serving as CEO of the mining group from 2013 to 2019, joined Shell's board in October 2020. 
Before that he worked at Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) for three years following a 22-year career in BP, where he held senior roles in oil and gas exploration, research and development and chemicals.
Mackenzie, a British national born in 1956, will take over as the Anglo-Dutch company undergoes a major overhaul focused on low-carbon businesses and power trading and reducing its greenhouse emissions by mid-century.
He will also likely lead in the coming years the search for a successor to CEO Ben van Beurden, who has been in office since 2014. 
His appointment follows a year which due to the pandemic prompted Shell to cut its dividend for the first time since World War II.
""I look forward to working with Ben van Beurden and the Board to profitably accelerate Shell's transition into a net-zero emissions energy business that continues to generate substantial value for shareholders, customers and communities alike,"" Mackenzie said.
Adam Matthews, director of ethics and engagement at the Church of England who co-led climate talks between Shell and a large group of investors known as Climate Action 100+, said Mackenzie joins Shell at the start of an ""absolutely crucial"" decade.
""This transition decade will challenge the foundations of all oil and gas companies and Shell has started to detail its plan,"" Matthews, who had engaged with Mackenzie on climate issues during his time at BHP, told Reuters in a statement.

""The pressure to progress an ambitious plan for the company and retain the confidence of the owners will ultimately be one of the major determinants of his success in the role,"" Matthews said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Ryanair, Easyjet and other low-cost airlines have written to the European Union asking that its plan to force carriers to use a certain share of sustainable fuels apply to all flights, not just short-haul ones.
The European Commission is drawing up targets for airlines to use a minimum share of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), to curb the sector's planet-warming CO2 emissions. In December Brussels shelved a draft 5% target for 2030 for being too low.
A group of budget airlines, which do not compete in long-haul markets, and environmental groups wrote to the Commission on Wednesday, asking that any SAF quotas apply not only to flights inside Europe, but also long-haul trips to and from the continent.
""Excluding long-haul flights from the SAFs mandate would mean the very area of our sector that most needs to decarbonise would not be covered at all by this legislation,"" said the letter to the EU's climate and transport policy chiefs. 
Its signatories included Easyjet, Ryanair, Wizz Air, Jet2 and the non-governmental organisation Transport & Environment.
They cited data from air traffic management group Eurocontrol, which said the 6% of flights from European airports that travelled more than 4,000 km accounted for half of the total CO2 emissions from flights leaving Europe.
""There is no logic in excluding long-haul flights from SAF usage obligations as this is their only possible way to decarbonise,"" Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
T&E Executive Director William Todts said long-haul flights currently ""escape regulation of their pollution despite causing the bulk of emissions"".
The signatories said SAFs are the only near-term option to curb long-haul flights' emissions - while for short-haul, SAFs are a temporary solution, before technologies such as hydrogen-fuelled aircraft become available in the 2030s.
The move may be opposed by traditional carriers, if it imposes costs on them not faced by foreign rivals.

""Since sustainable aviation fuels will remain more expensive than fossil fuels for the foreseeable future, some rules are needed that go beyond the EU and apply internationally,"" a Lufthansa spokesman said. ""Only then can a level playing field be ensured in global aviation.""

1191,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 06:35AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Forward Health valued at over $1 billion in latest funding from SoftBank, others - source","By Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) - Forward Health has raised $225 million from investors led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, in a late-stage funding round that values the healthcare startup at more than $1 billion.
Forward uses biometric body scans, genetic testing and blood tests to assess what diseases a patient is likely to develop later in life and then uses that information to set customers up with health plans to help prevent those diseases.
For instance, if tests show a person is at higher risk of developing heart disease, Forward Health will offer a custom-tailored program that the patient and doctor can use to help prevent specific heart diseases.
The Series D funding round also includes investments from Khosla Ventures, Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff and Canadian pop singer The Weeknd, the company said on Thursday.
Forward did not comment on its valuation, but according to a person familiar with the matter, the latest round will make it a so-called ""unicorn"" - implying a valuation of $1 billion or more.
By providing predictive and preventive primary care services, Forward is among a slew of healthcare tech ventures that have benefited from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in sky-high demand for remote health services.
""The pandemic is spurring people to care about their health in a way that you just hadn't seen before. And then it's incumbent upon us to meet people where they are,"" Forward's founder and CEO Adrian Aoun told Reuters.
According to Aoun, who co-founded the firm and launched it in 2016, the idea for the startup came after his brother suffered a heart attack.
The firm has operations in 11 U.S. cities including New York, Chicago and Miami, according to its website. It also offers a mobile app to monitor COVID-19 symptoms at home.
Existing backers of San Francisco-based Forward Health include venture capital fund First Round Capital, former Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) boss Eric Schmidt and actor Ashton Kutcher.
Prior to this round, Forward raised about $164 million in funding and was valued at $453 million during its last financing round in February 2019, according to data platform PitchBook.
Forward said it plans to use the fresh funds to reach more cities in the United States as well as introduce new programs focused on heart health, cancer detection, COVID-19, stress, anxiety and weight management.
""I had looked at dozens of what I call digital health or technology-enabled new healthcare companies and Foward really stood out, largely because of their underlying technology and long term vision,"" said Jeff Housenbold, Managing Partner at SoftBank's Vision Fund.

1192,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 06:08AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Rolls-Royce's Long, Slow Bounce","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- How high can a stock go just on relief that bankruptcy has been avoided?
It’s a question that has different answers depending on who you ask, which stock you’re talking about and, in the case of some well-known meme stocks, how heavily it’s been shorted.
British industrial blue-blood Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) effectively avoided bankruptcy last year, with a massive recapitalization that included both new borrowing and equity. It’s planning to return to a net cash position with asset sales over the next year.
But the stock still languishes. At 116 pence, even after another 2.7% rise on the back of its annual results published Thursday, it’s down over 50% from its level at the start of February last year.
This looks odd, given the prevailing narrative of economic reopenings and a global recovery, and not explainable just by the dilution carried out through last year's rights issue. A quarter of the company’s business comes from the defense sector, which has not really been hit by the pandemic, and which has a thoroughly positive outlook (the company sees $7 billion in possible revenues from new U.S. projects alone).
Over half the business, though, is its civil aviation operations, where it earns most of its money on maintenance and repair of its aircraft engines. These payments in turn depend on how much the aircraft fitted with them actually fly.
The gloomy news here is that the international travel market is still not confident of a real rebound in 2021. Lufthansa, a large customer, revised its expected flying capacity downward for the year when it reported earnings last week.  
In Europe in particular, the latest Covid-19 infection figures suggest that new and more infectious variants of the virus are spreading fast, taking advantage of lamentable shortcomings in the EU’s vaccination procurement and its member states’ distribution programs.
So it was conspicuous that Rolls Royce (LON:RR) stuck to its previous forecasts on Thursday in saying that it expects large engine flying hours to increase to 55% of 2019 levels this year, from 43% last year, with an acceleration in the second half of 2021. For 2022, it expects that metric to rise to 80%, a level that – if sustained – will generate free cash flow of 750 million pounds ($1.05 billion) a year.
“The worst is now well behind us,” CEO Trevor East told an analyst call on Thursday, which seems a fair enough claim. But Rolls’ civil aviation business is disproportionately exposed to the wide-bodied aircraft that ply the long-haul routes, which are set for a slower recovery than the short-haul segment. Rolls itself said it expects new deliveries – the source of future maintenance contracts - to stay at the current depressed levels “for the next few years.”  
With 9 billion pounds in available liquidity, the worst case scenario should easily be avoided now. But any further delays to the recovery will force it to draw more of those credit facilities and ensure that more of its future returns accrue to bondholders than shareholders. The stock remains cheap for a reason."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Hugo Boss expects its business will continue to suffer in the first quarter but forecast a gradual recovery from April as people buy new clothes when they emerge from lockdowns.
Although the German fashion house said on Thursday it would continue to push more casual styles, helped by a new partnership with actor Chris Hemsworth, it noted pent-up demand for smart clothes seen in China after lockdowns were lifted there.
Hugo Boss had already made the shift toward casual clothing even before customers switched suits and ties for tracksuits when lockdowns forced them to work from home. 
Formalwear only accounted for 25% of sales in 2020, down from 35% in 2019, acting Chief Executive Yves Mueller said.
""There is a desire in the population in many countries to go out again, to shop again,"" he told reporters, adding that Hugo Boss was responding to the trend for more comfortable clothes by using more stretchy materials, even in its suits.
About 30% of stores were still closed globally in the first quarter, but Hugo Boss hopes for a gradual recovery from the second quarter as vaccinations pick up and lockdowns are eased.
Mike Ashley-led Frasers said in January it had increased its Hugo Boss stake to 15.2%, part of the British businessman's drive to take the sportswear retailer upmarket. 
Mueller said he was not aware that Hugo Boss, which expects sales and operating profit in 2021 to be ""well above"" the level of 2020, could be a takeover target. 
Hugo Boss shares were down 2.3% at 0916 GMT, making them one of the biggest fallers on the German mid-cap index after it reported a 29% slump in fourth-quarter sales to 583 million euros ($695 million). It still managed to record a positive operating profit of 13 million euros as it cut costs.
Hugo Boss said its business continued to recover in the U.S. market and Asia/Pacific, with China recording strong double-digit growth. Rival Burberry has also seen a strong bounce back in demand in China and South Korea.
Online sales at Hugo Boss grew fast, up 49% in 2020 to more than 200 million euros as the brand expanded ecommerce to 32 more markets. Mueller expects online sales above 300 million euros in 2021 and 400 million euros in 2022.

1194,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 05:41AM ET</span>","From Black Forest to Cologne, German towns fear Greensill losses","By Tom Sims and Patricia Uhlig
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bad Duerrheim, a town of 13,400 people on the fringes of the Black Forest, is one of many across Germany united by a shared anxiety, the possibility of losing millions of euros invested with Greensill Bank.
The obscure Bremen-based private bank's owner Greensill Capital entered insolvency this week after losing insurance coverage for its debt repackaging business.
Greensill Bank, meanwhile, was locked down by Germany's financial watchdog last week with a warning of an imminent risk that its debt would become unmanageable and a statement calling some of its financial accounts into question. Greensill Capital said that the bank always sought external legal and audit advice before booking any new asset.
""We have to find out what happened,"" Alexander Stengelin, a Bad Duerrheim official told Reuters.
German towns have turned to alternative investments such as those offered by Greensill Bank as European Central Bank efforts to prop up the wider economy have resulted in so-called negative interest rates, with fees charged for savings.
Cologne, famed for its cathedral and perfume, and Wiesbaden, which is close to Germany's financial capital Frankfurt, both say they consulted brokers on where to park their cash. 
The two, along with at least a dozen others, say they opted for Greensill to avoid fees charged by other banks and encouraged by its once healthy credit rating.
The municipalities now fear their cash, largely invested at Greensill Bank in time deposits with short maturities of several months, may be lost for good as they are classed as institutional investors and therefore are not covered by a deposit protection scheme for individuals.
Greensill Bank states this on its website but some cities are nevertheless calling on the federal government to step in to cover any losses they may incur. A Greensill spokesman declined to comment.
Town officials are now consulting with others in the same position and hope to convene a video call on how to proceed.
OTHERS AT FAULT?
With much of Germany still in lockdown and a COVID-19 vaccine rollout proceeding slowly, the timing of the Greensill Bank crisis is difficult for cash-strapped municipalities.
As more cities and the state of Thuringia, famous for its sausages, have disclosed that they are Greensill Bank customers, the extent of the potential damage has become clear.
Monheim am Rhein disclosed it parked 38 million euros in funds with Greensill Bank, nearly 1,000 euros per resident.
Its mayor Daniel Zimmermann said he was in touch with 19 municipalities who together hold 200 million euros ($238 million) in investments with the bank.
An emergency meeting in Monheim on Tuesday discussed the fallout, and whether internal mistakes were made or whether brokers who helped make the investments should bear some of the blame.
""We don't want to shun responsibility, but others may be at fault,"" Zimmermann told Reuters.
Zimmermann said that two of the brokers it used -- CC Gesellschaft für Geld- und Devisenhandel mbH and Witt GmbH & Co. KG -- were also used by other towns.
CC deals exclusively in helping municipalities park cash, its owner Christian Steier said when contacted by Reuters.
He declined to comment on specific customers but said that communication on such transactions was usually straightforward.
""It's like an order. It's a simple product. A lot of it is via email and impersonal,"" he said.
Witt did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters.
Two other brokers Zimmermann said were used by Monheim did not respond to written questions seeking comment.
Wiesbaden has 20 million euros with Greensill Bank, which it used in the past without problems, city official Axel Imholz said, adding that it had used brokers for the transaction.
Imholz did not reveal the names of the brokers but said Wiesbaden is investigating why Greensill Bank was recommended.
For Bad Duerrheim, which says it has 2 million euros with the bank, Stengelin said that the town felt comfortable that two brokers independently recommended Greensill Bank.
And while it had been reassured by the fact that the money would be close to home in a bank in Germany rather than offshore, it was not now hopeful of recovering its cash.
""We expect the worst, but hope for the best,"" he said.

1195,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 05:30AM ET</span>",UK's Morrisons sees halving of profit as 'badge of honour' in COVID year,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - British supermarket group Morrisons said a halving of annual profit due largely to costs incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic was a ""badge of honour"" as the priority in 2020-21 had been feeding the nation.
The group said on Thursday it made profit before tax and exceptional items of 201 million pounds ($280 million) in the year to Jan. 31, prior to a business rates payment of 230 million pounds, down from 408 million pounds in 2019-20.
""I personally wear a halving of profits as a badge of honour,"" Chief Executive David Potts told reporters.
""The British people have had access to food because the supermarket workers, not just Morrisons, were asked by government to be key workers and required to stay open, unlike pretty much the rest of society. Frankly we could have made no profit and it would have been a result,"" he said.
Morrisons, Britain's fourth biggest grocer after market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDD), Sainsbury's and Asda, said that while its like-for-like sales rose 8.6% over the year, it incurred direct pandemic costs of 290 million pounds.
That reflected the cost of hiring tens of thousands of additional workers, staff sick pay and in-store measures to deal with the pandemic.
Morrisons also lost revenue from in-store cafes, which were forced to close, while demand for fuel has been subdued.
In the group's new financial year costs and cash flow comparatives ease, but those for sales get much harder.
It forecast 2021/22 profit before tax and exceptionals including business rates paid to be higher than the 431 million pounds profit achieved in 2020/21, excluding the waived rates relief.
Morrisons also expects strong free cash flow and a significant reduction in net debt.
Shares in Morrisons, which was last week relegated from the FTSE 100 index of top UK firms, were down 0.8% at 0918 GMT, valuing the business at 4.2 billion pounds.
The group is expanding its relationship with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Its ‘Morrisons on Amazon’ service is now available in about 50 towns and cities, and accounts for over 10% of sales in the majority of stores where the service is offered.
There has been persistent speculation that Amazon could emerge as a possible bidder.
""We don't ever comment on matters related to mergers and acquisition,"" said Potts.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks rose to their highest in just over a week on Thursday after a report on U.S. consumer prices calmed investor nerves about inflation and lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a record close.
European stocks climbed, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index reaching a one-year peak and up 0.3% on the day. Britain's FTSE 100 index rose 0.14%, France's CAC 40 0.2%, and Italy's FTSEMIB 1%. Germany's DAX traded flat. 
MSCI's All Country World Index, which tracks stocks across 49 countries, rose to its highest in just over a week, up 0.5% on the day.
Earlier in Asia, an index of regional stocks excluding Japan rose 1.7%, led by a 2.3% surge in South Korea's Kospi, and was on track for its first three-day advance in three weeks.
China's Shanghai Composite rallied 1.9%, helped by local lending data. Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.5%. 
E-mini futures for the U.S. S&P 500 index gained to their highest in two weeks, up 0.7%. 
Relative calm in the Treasuries market also helped risk sentiment, with the benchmark yield settling around 1.5% after shooting to a one-year high above 1.6% last week as investors worried about the U.S. economic recovery running too hot.
""If we look at history, we see that when yields have gone up, after a while equity markets have generally been okay,"" said Justin Onuekwusi, portfolio manager at Legal & General Investment Management. ""The only time you really see both equities and bonds sell off is in periods when there is a significant inflation scare."" 
At this point with unemployment still so high, it is hard to see inflation becoming a problem, Onuekwusi said. Higher yields could be read as showing ""that we are actually getting out of the quagmire we have been in.""
""And there is a natural yield cap -- central banks will step in when rates move too quickly. They are differentiating between levels of yield and speed at which yields move.""
The European Central Bank sets its policy on Thursday and is likely to signal faster money printing to keep a lid on borrowing costs but stop short of adding firepower to its already aggressive pandemic-fighting package.
The U.S. Labor Department said its consumer price index rose 0.4% in February, in line with expectations, after a 0.3% increase in January. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy components, edged up 0.1%, just shy of the 0.2% estimate.
Analysts largely expect inflation to pick up as vaccine rollouts lead to a reopening of the economy, but worries persist that additional stimulus in the form of a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package set to be signed by U.S. President Joe Biden could overheat the economy.
Investors will now eye an auction of 30-year debt on Thursday, seeking to cover massive shorts. A weak seven-year auction in late February helped fuel inflation concerns and sent yields higher.
""Rises in U.S. bond yields appear to have subsided a bit after the 10-year yield has reached 1.5%, even though many investors remain cautious before the Fed's policy meeting,"" said Naoya Oshikubo, senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Asset Management.
""The Fed has ratcheted up its rhetoric on bond yields lately. The reality is, the economy is in a K-shaped recovery, with the service sector still in difficult conditions and the Fed would probably not want to let real interest rates rise.""
The dollar remained weaker following the economic data. The dollar index fell to its lowest in a week, 91.547.
The euro, on the other hand, rose to its highest in a week, at $1.19685. The safe-haven yen traded flat at 108.425 per dollar. 
Oil prices resumed their climb following two days of declines, after the Energy Information Administration reported a storage grew more than expected. 

U.S. crude futures rose 1.3% to $65.25 per barrel. Brent crude futures rose 1.1% to $68.68 per barrel.

During a short period in late January and early February, London-based IG saw an “unprecedented spike in new client demand,” which was largely in response to “heightened news flow relating to certain listed U.S. stocks,” it said in a statement on Thursday.
The comments are the latest example of how the frenzy of interest in heavily-shorted stocks like  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME). by traders stuck at home during the pandemic has upended the retail trading market across the world.
For IG, stock trading is just a small part of the business, accounting for only 6% of its 230 million pounds ($321 million) of revenue in the three months to Feb. 28. The company’s core business is in contract-for-differences, or CFDs, which allow traders to speculate on market movements without owning the underlying securities. IG and a number of peers imposed restrictions on CFDs tied to a certain stocks due to the Reddit-fueled volatility.
IG shares (LON:IGG) were up 4.8% to 850 pence at 9:26 a.m. in London, extending a 12-month rise to about 33% as the retail trading boom continues. IG added 23,900 new over-the-counter leveraged clients in the quarter, up 81% year-on-year.

The group, which operates 42 John Lewis shops, permanently closed eight stores last July impacting 1,300 jobs, as it grappled with the fallout from the pandemic. 
""Hard as it is, there is no getting away from the fact that some areas can no longer profitably sustain a John Lewis store,"" the company said, adding that it was in talks with landlords, with final decisions expected by the end of March.
Chairman Sharon White described the situation as ""the greatest scale of change in the Partnership's 156-year history.""
John Lewis shops are now held on its balance sheet at almost half the value they were before write downs this year and last, it added.
The employee-owned group, which also owns the Waitrose supermarket chain, said the outlook is uniquely uncertain as the country charts its exit from the latest lockdown, adding that ""no one has a crystal ball to predict the strength and pace of the recovery - or the future course of the virus"".
It reported a pretax loss of 517 million pounds ($721 million) for the year ended Jan. 30, compared with a profit of 146 million pounds, hurt by exceptional costs of 648 million pounds from the write down in the value of John Lewis shops along with restructuring and redundancy costs.
However, it posted a profit, excluding those items, of 131 million pounds, compared with 61 million pounds last year.
The company plans to invest 800 million pounds this year for its turnaround and expects liquidity, debt ratio and profit before exceptionals to worsen in 2021 and 2022 and then improve in later years.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.3%, up for a fourth straight session as Wall Street stocks rallied overnight on tame inflation data and as the U.S. Congress approved one of the largest economic stimulus measures in history. 
Technology, mining and retail sectors were the top gainers in Europe, rising between 1.2% and 2%.
Banks fell the most, with UK-based lender HSBC's shares falling 3.9%.
""Fears regarding higher inflation and policy tightening have been reduced and the consequence is a continued recovery in sentiment,"" said Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management.
Euro zone stocks gained 0.4% to trade at their highest level in over 13 years ahead of the ECB meeting where policymakers will be keen to calm markets by signalling faster money printing to keep a lid on borrowing costs and recommit to rock-bottom rates until well into a recovery.
The policy decision is due at 1245 GMT, followed by ECB chief Christine Lagarde's news conference at 1330 GMT.
""Lagarde will have to convince markets that the central bank remains strongly committed to securing favorable financing conditions and how she communicates this will be particularly important for financial markets,"" Unicredit (MI:CRDI) analysts said in a note.
European stock markets are on course to record strong weekly gains on hopes that massive stimulus measures and vaccination programmes will spur a recovery in global economy, while calmer bond markets boosted appetite for riskier assets like equities.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Air submitted its final restructuring offer to creditors on Thursday in what the budget airline said was a major step in its plan to slash debt and reduce its fleet to survive the coronavirus pandemic.
If approved by enough creditors and Ireland's High Court, the so-called scheme of arrangement will enable Norwegian to raise new capital and emerge from bankruptcy protection in Ireland and Norway.
""This is an important milestone in the process of securing Norwegian's future,"" Chief Executive Jacob Schram said in a statement.
Financed largely by debt, Norwegian had grown rapidly to become a major carrier by the time of the COVID-19 outbreak, serving routes across Europe and flying to North and South America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East.
As announced last year, the survival plan puts a definitive end to Norwegian's long-haul business, leaving a slimmed-down airline focusing on Nordic and European routes.
""It is hoped that the Irish High Court will make their final decision within the next couple of weeks,"" Chief Financial Officer Geir Karlsen said, adding that a separate court process in Norway should be resolved soon after.
""If everything goes according to plan, we will be able to carry out the capital raise in May,"" he said.
The updated proposal followed an outline first given by Norwegian in January to cut its fleet to 53 jets from 140 before the pandemic and slash its debt to 20 billion Norwegian crowns ($2.4 billion) from 56 billion.
As part of the plan, the airline must raise 4 billion to 5 billion crowns from new shares and hybrid capital, of which Norway's government has said it is willing to contribute 1.5 billion.
New investors will receive approximately 70% of the post-restructuring share capital, creditors will get about 25% and current shareholders approximately 5%.
Norwegian shares were down 1.8% by 0926 GMT, underperforming a 0.1% rise in Oslo's benchmark index.
Creditors with unsecured claims will receive about 5% of the original amount owed in the form of cash and a new debt obligation, which will be convertible on certain terms into shares in the restructured company, Norwegian said.
Thursday's move was made possible by recent progress in court proceedings. Some jet lessors have struck voluntary pacts to end contracts while the Dublin court approved the forced repudiation of others.
Norwegian also recently agreed to end a contract for 88 new planes from aircraft maker Airbus though a dispute over 97 Boeing (NYSE:BA) jets remains unresolved in separate U.S. court proceedings.
Creditors will be able to have their say in meetings scheduled for March 18-20 after which consent will be sought from Ireland's High Court, Norwegian said.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged largely higher Thursday, boosted by the final approval of the massive U.S. Covid-19 stimulus package ahead of the European Central Bank's policy meeting.
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded flat, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.2%.
The U.S. House of Representatives gave its final approval to the Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package on Wednesday, meaning one of the largest economic stimulus measures in U.S. history only needs the president’s signature to become a reality.
This stimulus deal is expected to give the U.S. economy, the world’s driver, a significant boost during the second half of the year. It's also expected to give a fresh boost to stocks, with surveys showing that a good chunk of the $1,400 checks being sent to households will find their way into financial markets.
Attention in Europe now turns to the latest meeting of the ECB, with the central bank due to hand down its policy decision at 7:45 AM ET (1245 GMT).
“The ECB will be pressed to clarify what it means by preserving favorable financing conditions and its thoughts about the recent increase in bond yields,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note. “Mere words are unlikely to stop long bond yields from rising further.”
The ECB did in fact quicken the pace of bond purchases two weeks ago as the volatility in bond markets took off, but that was masked by the fact that it also had big redemptions from a bond-buying program from a decade ago.
In corporate news, Nokia (NYSE:NOK) stock rose 1.3% after the Finnish telecom company signed a deal with Samsung (KS:005930) to license patents covering its innovations in video standards.
Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) stock rose 2.1% after the aircraft engine-maker stuck to its forecast that cash flow will turn positive in the second half of this year as travel picks up. However, its 4 billion pound ($5.6 billion) loss in 2020 was wider than the company's own guidance.
Generali (MI:GASI) stock rose 1.7%, continuing a string of post-pandemic highs, after the Italian insurer posted a record operating profit for 2020 despite the impact of the Covid pandemic.
On the flip side,  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) stock dropped 2.6% after the German fashion house reported a drop in currency-adjusted sales of 26% in the fourth quarter as its stores were again closed due to the pandemic.
Oil prices rose Thursday, as the latest data from the Energy Information Administration showed that domestic gasoline supplies slid last week, by almost 12 million barrels, to the lowest in about four months, while demand rose to the highest since November. Gains were tempered by crude inventories rising by 13.8 million barrels.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% higher at $65.13 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1% to $68.58.  
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.9% to $1,737.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1966.

1202,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 03:26AM ET</span>",Queue to quaff? Pandemic poses problems for Sweden's state booze monopoly,"By Colm Fulton
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - On a chilly Saturday in central Stockholm, around 150 people queue on a street, squinting into the low sun, checking their watches and hoping to make it into Systembolaget - Sweden's state alcohol monopoly - before it shuts at 3 p.m. 
""This is the last chance to buy alcohol before Monday,"" says musician Calle Lehman as he stands in the ever-expanding line. ""The big Saturday afternoon queue is a bit of a tradition.""
Yet this custom, and Systembolaget's monopoly, is being put to the test by online retailers offering Swedes an alternative to standing in a long queue during a deadly pandemic.
Wine retailer and rating app Vivino, which has 50 million users globally, says Sweden has become one of its top 20 markets worldwide over the past year, for example.
Winefinder.se said its turnover is up 50% in the first two months of 2021 compared with the same period last year, as the monthly rate it gained new customers spiked by 200%. 
""COVID has changed customer behaviour and opened a lot of people's eyes to other choices online,"" said Magnus Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), CEO of Winefinder.se.
After centuries of concern about rampant alcohol consumption and several unpopular attempts to ration booze, Systembolaget was established in 1955 as the only retailer in Sweden that can sell tipple stronger than 3.5%.
Yet, there are only 83 Systembolaget stores in Stockholm, or one for every 12,000 of the city's roughly 1 million inhabitants - hence the queues snaking along its streets.
Until the 1990s, shoppers were required to wait at a kiosk while attendants fetched requested items, as it was thought that eye-contact would shame people into reduced orders.
But today Swedes can freely wander the shop's featureless interior and fill their own shopping baskets. More recently, some are even choosing to do this online, and unwatched, in their own home.
A 2007 ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) said Swedes could import alcohol from companies elsewhere in the European Union. This paved the way for online players like Vivino, which is Danish, to sell wine into Sweden.
Previous challengers of Systembolaget's monopoly include the North Korean embassy in Stockholm, which in the 1970s set up a short-lived bootleg operation. The black market plot was uncovered and some North Korean diplomats expelled, but the monopoly's latest rivals are proving harder to contain. 
A LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP
Systembolaget has turned to the Swedish courts for help, gaining some initial success. 
In October, a court ruled that Danish website Winefinder.se broke the law by infringing on Systembolaget's retail monopoly. However, Winefinder.se continues to trade as it appeals the decision. 
Systembolaget has also taken Vivino to court, saying the app's marketing techniques breach the country's strict alcohol advertising laws. 
Vivino builds a taste profile for each of its users. Open the app and you might see: ""A personalised selection of wines you didn't know you wanted.""
Systembolaget says this contravenes rules that prohibit ""intrusive"" marketing of alcohol, something that Vivino denies.
""Our attorneys look carefully at laws and we make sure to follow regulations wherever we are,"" said Vivino's founder Heini Zachariassen, adding that it is the app's users who endorse individual wines by rating them.
This concerns Systembolaget because it is banned from advertising its goods, which has made it difficult to promote the website it launched in 2000, or the home-delivery service that it began on a large scale in 2019 and expanded last year, but only covers about two-thirds of the country.
""Systembolaget's purpose is to limit the harmful effects of alcohol in society,"" the monopoly told Reuters. 
Its website is as sober and restrained as the non-descript shelving in its stores, and uptake has been small, with online sales only making up around 2% of total sales last year, although such sales rose 42% compared with 2019.
Systembolaget does have an Instagram page, though, mainly featuring wholesome images of foods that might pair well with certain wines, beers or spirits mostly absent from the photos.
Around 75% of Swedes say they are happy with Systembolaget, according to pollster MedieAkademin. But Fanny Hedenmo, among those queuing on Saturday, described it as a love-hate relationship, particularly when it came to the monopoly's opening hours, which see its stores close at 7 p.m. on weekdays.
""We Swedes are tolerant of this type of governance, though that could change fast, particularly if online shopping becomes the norm,"" the 28-year-old said.

""Realising with horror that it's 6:50 on a Friday night and sprinting to the nearest Systembolaget ... that's just a part of life here.""

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening marginally higher Thursday, boosted by the final approval of the U.S. Covid-19 stimulus package, but with moves likely to be modest amid caution ahead of the European Central Bank's policy meeting later.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.3% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%.
European markets received a positive handover from Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average benchmark posting a record close, after the House of Representatives gave its final approval to the Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion Covid relief package, one of the largest economic stimulus measures in U.S. history.
This stimulus package is expected to give the U.S. economy a significant boost during the second half of the year. Fears that it could lead to inflation, prompting the Federal Reserve to rein in its expansive monetary policies sooner than originally envisaged, were assuaged somewhat on Wednesday when consumer price inflation data released came in weaker than expected.
Attention in Europe will now turn to the latest meeting of the European Central Bank, as it’s due to hand down its policy decision at 7:45 AM ET (1245 GMT).

1207,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 01:10AM ET</span>",Analysis: Riding GameStop's resurgent rally - 'not for the faint of heart',"By Krystal Hu and Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Joe Youngblood, who works in digital marketing in Dallas, Texas, bought his first share of GameStop (NYSE:GME) at $98 in early February and found his investment cut in half in a matter of days. After a wild ride, he is now up more than 200% and expects the video game retailer to initiate a much-awaited turnaround of its business.
""I am kicking myself for not buying more when it dropped below $50,"" said Youngblood. “After research I believe GameStop has a good chance to pull it off.”
The latest resurgence in GameStop shares has reinvigorated true believers. Still, many analysts point to the rally in beaten-down “meme stocks” championed in forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets as evidence for speculative excess in stimulus-fueled markets.
“I think this is a cult stock,” said Michael Pachter, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. “The rally is because of demand from the Reddit Raiders, and it’s not clear it will be sustainable as the stock rises to ever higher levels.”
GameStop shares closed on Wednesday up 7% at $265 after hitting a session peak of $348.50, which was 800% above last month’s low. Among the factors driving the stock are bets on improving fundamentals and hopes for another short squeeze like the one in late January, which drove prices as high as $483. Many GameStop investors also hope Americans will plow money from their coming stimulus checks into the stock. 
Some expect GameStop to take advantage of the new rally by launching a share offering to pay down debt. Its earnings report, scheduled for March 23, could clear the way.
GameStop did not reply to a request for comment on its stock price.
ICE (NYSE:ICE) CREAM 
Analysts who cover GameStop have a median price target of $12.50 on the stock. Wednesday's closing price was 21 times higher than that. 
GameStop bulls say the fundamental picture is changing. Many cheered moves to tap Ryan Cohen, a shareholder and co-founder of online pet products retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) Inc , to spearhead a committee guiding GameStop’s transition to e-commerce.
Hopeful investors have interpreted Cohen's cryptic tweets, including a picture of an ice cream cone, as signs he is pushing the retail chain away from its brick-and-mortar model. Still, Pachter said even the most successful transition would not justify such a stratospheric stock price. 
For the quarter ended Oct. 31, GameStop reported https://investor.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-third-quarter-results-positive-start-fourth a net loss of $18.8 million and a loss per share of 29 cents. To justify a trading price of $235, it would need to earn between $10 and $12 a share annually on a sustainable basis, Pachter said. He expects the company to earn $1 a share for the fiscal year ending in January 2022.
“We don’t know what Ryan Cohen proposes to change, but those numbers sound unattainable in the short term,” he said. 
Other analysts were slightly more optimistic.
“Before, when the stock rallied there was really no legitimate, fundamental reason,” said David Keller, chief market strategist at Stockcharts.com, a technical analysis and charting platform targeted at retail investors. “Now all of a sudden this feels more like a growth stock."" 
Some GameStop bulls believe improving fundamentals and a climbing stock price will put bearish investors into another ""short squeeze,"" forcing them to unwind bets against the company. When this happened in January, GameStop surged by 1,600%. It pared most of those gains in February. 
Analysts said a short squeeze is likely accelerating the latest rally. Investors short GameStop shares have incurred over $1.3 billion in losses over the last couple of days.
But the number of GameStop shares sold short has dropped since early January to its lowest level in at least three years, according to S3 Partners.
""The stock can go up from just buyers but it likely won't go up quite as quickly,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.
That did not stop Eric Diaz, an operations manager in Tampa, Florida, who added more GameStop shares at $100 apiece to the 10 he has been holding since January. After the most recent runup, Diaz said he sold all but two of his GameStop shares.

""This isn't really a rational investment,"" he said. ""Not for the faint of heart.""

1208,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 11:15PM ET</span>",HSBC toughens stance on fossil fuel funding after shareholder heat,"By Lawrence White and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC will phase out its support for the coal industry in the developed world by 2030 and in the developing world by 2040, the bank said on Thursday, bowing to investor pressure to toughen its stance on fossil fuel financing.
Investors managing some $2.4 trillion in assets who earlier this year filed a resolution that would bind the bank to make stronger commitments, have withdrawn the motion in a sign they have reached a compromise with Europe's biggest bank.
The new goals from HSBC also include short and medium-term targets on aligning its financing with the goals of the landmark Paris agreement on climate change.
HSBC's announcement reinforces how the world's biggest financial firms are bowing to mounting public and political pressure to join the battle against climate change, by reducing their funding of fossil fuel companies and encouraging clients in other sectors to cut emissions.
As a result, campaign group ShareAction has withdrawn its motion to be voted on at HSBC's annual shareholder meeting on May 28, and the lender will instead submit its own resolution with the backing of ShareAction and its co-filers, a group of 15 major investors including Amundi  ""Today’s announcement shows that robust shareholder engagement can deliver concrete results and sets an important precedent for the banking industry,"" said Jeanne Martin, senior campaign manager at ShareAction. HSBC's new commitments go further than those made last October when the bank set out an 'ambition' to get to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, a goal criticised by campaigners for not directly addressing HSBC’s lending to fossil fuel firms. ShareAction said it had won a significant concession from the bank in that HSBC now explicitly states the expansion of coal-fired power is incompatible with the goals of the Paris agreement, where in the past it had been more equivocal on the need for clients to divest coal assets.  HSBC will report on its progress annually, it said on Thursday, starting this year. 
ShareAction targeted  Barclays  (LON:BARC) with a similar motion last May, which was defeated but garnered 24% of votes cast.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up Thursday morning, continuing to rebound from two-week lows after weaker-than-expected inflation data calmed inflation worries and boosted the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a record close.
China’s Shanghai Composite gained 1.77% by 10:28 PM ET (3:28 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component jumped 2.46%, over speculation of further steps to tackle a selloff. The National People’s Congress will also conclude later in the day, where delegates will approve an overhaul in Hong Kong’s Legislative Council election system and a measure designed to reduce China’s technological dependence on the U.S.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 1.61%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.62% and South Korea’s KOSPI rose 2.10%. In Australia, the ASX 200 edge down 0.17%, while
Consumer price inflation data released on Wednesday disappointed expectations but eased concerns about the U.S. economy overheating and further stalled a climb in bond yields.
The data said that core consumer prices rose 0.1% month-on-month in February, down from the 0.2% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but unchanged from the 0.1% growth recorded in January. Prices rose 1.3% year-on-year, slowing down slightly from the forecast 1.4% growth, and the 1.4% growth recorded in January.
Investors also cheered progress on the U.S.’ massive $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The House of Representatives gave its final approval to the bill, with President Joe Biden expected to sign it into law before Sunday when current enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire.
Ten-year Treasury yields dropped below their recent one-year highs. The U.S. government will auction 30-year Treasuries later in the day after Wednesday's auction of ten-year Treasuries met with sufficient demand.
Some investors expressed caution on high-priced growth stocks, the biggest victim of rising yields. Meanwhile, optimism over the recovery from COVID-19 thanks to the stimulus package’s progress boosted cyclical shares.
“It’s not inconsistent to have high yields with stocks going up if growth expectations are the driver and not inflation … I feel all the indications that we are getting from the central banks is exactly that, that this is good news,” UBS Wealth Management senior vice president Angela Mwanza told Bloomberg.
Other investors remained positive overall.
“The reflation trade is back on. We saw bonds and stocks rallying together and a slight easing in the U.S. dollar, which also indicates improving sentiment,” CMC Markets chief markets strategist Michael McCarthy told Reuters.
Across the Atlantic, the European Central Bank (ECB) will hand down its policy decision later in the day. It remains to be seen how the central bank will address the possible impact of higher benchmark rates on Europe’s recovery from COVID-19.
The Federal Reserve is preparing its own policy decision, which it will hand down on Mar. 17."

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean battery maker SK Innovation Co Ltd said on Thursday it will not accept any proposal by rival LG Energy Solution to resolve a U.S. legal feud that would cripple SK's business in that country. 
SK Innovation and LG Chem's wholly-owned battery division LG Energy Solution have been locked in a dispute over claims SK misappropriated trade secrets related to electric vehicle battery technology. 
The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) last month sided with LG, issuing a limited 10-year exclusion order prohibiting imports into the United States of SK's lithium-ion batteries. That ruling would become invalid if the two companies agree a settlement.
SK has received proposed terms, including financial reparations, from LG for a settlement, a person familiar with the situation told Reuters. 
SK declined to comment on specific offers, but said in a statement it would ""closely review the competitor's terms of demand in the future, however, those terms will not be acceptable if they lead us to think there is no point in continuing our battery business in the United States or reduce our business competitiveness.""
The ITC ruling against SK, which supplies electric car batteries to Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Hyundai Motor Co among others, can also be overturned by U.S. President Joe Biden.
The U.S. Transportation Department said earlier this month it would analyse the impact of the ruling on Biden's green transportation goals. SK has warned it would be forced to halt construction of a $2.6 billion battery plant in Georgia if Biden does not use a 60-day presidential review period to overturn the decision.
The ITC ruling allowed some exemptions, permitting SK to import components for domestic production of batteries for Ford's EV F-150 program for four years, and for Volkswagen America’s MEB electric vehicle line for two years.

SK currently has an annual capacity of about 40 gigawatt-hours of batteries with plans to ramp that up to about 125 gigawatt-hours of batteries in 2025.

1211,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 07:30PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Texas power regulator, under pressure to roll back storm prices, huddles with Wall Street","By Gary McWilliams
HOUSTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas huddled with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) utility analysts on Tuesday as pressure mounted on him to reverse about $16 billion in emergency power pricing that would hurt power plant operators.
The meeting came two days before PUC Chairman Arthur D'Andrea was due to rule on rescinding billions of dollars in charges levied on electricity marketers. If he reverses those charges, it would help retail marketers and hurt traders and power generators that stand to collect the money. 
The state's power grid operator raised power prices sharply during a February freeze to induce more power during a blackout. However, prices were left at about 450 times their usual level long after the emergency passed, moves that benefited traders and generators. 
Bank of America has market analysis and power and gas trading arms deeply tied to the Texas crisis. Securities analysts on the call with D'Andrea give investors advice in whether to purchase securities in publicly traded utilities that could lose from any repricing. 
D'Andrea was not available for comment. PUC spokesman Andrew Barlow rejected any conflict of interest in the meeting, saying it was routine and did not reveal confidential information. The call was ""a rehash of previously openly discussed information,"" he said. 
Barlow said he had no transcript of the call, and Bank of America also declined to make a recording or a transcript of the call available. 
On Friday, D'Andrea, as the sole PUC commissioner, will consider clawing back power price that hit $9,000 per megawatt hour, about $16 billion in all, and another $1.5 billion in fees tied to those prices. The commission rescheduled its hearing for a day to attend legislative hearings.
Citing grid rules, a state market adviser has recommended the pricing and related fees to be cut. Top state officials this week also called on the PUC and grid operator to ""correct"" the pricing and rescind about $16 billion in charges. 
Previously, D'Andrea rejected a rollback, arguing ""it is impossible to unscramble the egg,"" insisting the decision to raise prices during the cold snap was known to all grid users. 
The need to settle electricity trades that same day on the Intercontinental Exchange Inc (NYSE:ICE), ruled out any change, D'Andrea said last week. Since that decision, the governor, lieutenant governor and 28 of 31 Texas state senators have demanded a rollback. 
""These corrections are squarely within your authority, whether by your own action or an order to ERCOT,"" the senators told D'Andrea in a letter on Tuesday. 
ICE this week indefinitely delayed settling trades for ancillary services contracts tied to grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). The exchange has closed its much larger, systemwide contracts and has no authority to reopen settled contracts, said people familiar with the matter. 

In a note on Wednesday, analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith wrote since D'Andrea's rejection of repricing ""recent days have seen greater uncertainty reemerge,"" citing the governor and lieutenant governor's comments.

Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, are shell companies which raise funds to acquire a private entity with the aim of taking it public, allowing such companies to sidestep a traditional IPO to enter public markets.
The SEC said a celebrity endorsement of a SPAC does not necessarily make it a safe bet for investors. Celebrities, like others, can be enticed into a risky investment, but they may be better able to sustain the risk of losses, the securities regulator added.
""It is never a good idea to invest in a SPAC just because someone famous sponsors or invests in it or says it is a good investment,"" the SEC said. (https:// 
The recent SPAC frenzy has attracted the attention of a number of mainstream celebrity figures such as rap star Jay-Z, tennis legend Serena Williams (NYSE:WMB) and National Basketball Association Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal who have either sponsored their own blank-check firms or joined the boards of other SPACs.

Oracle said it expects fourth-quarter revenue to increase between 1% and 3% on a constant currency basis, the midpoint of which implies a revenue of $10.65 billion, according to Reuters calculations. Analysts had expected current-quarter revenue of $10.84 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Oracle's shares fell 6.5% to $67.44 in extended trading on Wednesday.
With the shift to remote work, many businesses were pushed to shift operations to the cloud resulting in an increase in demand for offerings by Oracle, Microsoft's Azure and Amazon Web Services.
Revenue from Oracle's cloud services and licenses support unit, its largest by revenue, rose 5% to $7.25 billion in the reported quarter, compared with analysts' estimates of $7.27 billion.
""We are opening new regions as fast as we can to support our rapidly growing multi-billion dollar infrastructure business,"" Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison said.
To compete with cloud services provided by Amazon and Microsoft, Oracle has been setting up more data centers.
""Some say Oracle is 'turning into a cloud giant', but their growth is still pretty small. Despite some notable progress, Oracle's Q3 revenue grew by just 3%. And that's with some notable cloud-driven progress,"" said Third Bridge analyst Scott Kessler.
The company's revenue rose 3% to $10.09 billion for the third quarter ended Feb. 28, edging past analysts' estimates of $10.07 billion.

On an adjusted basis, Oracle earned $1.16 per share, beating estimates of $1.11.

1214,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 06:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Boeing nears 737 MAX order from Southwest worth billions - sources,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is close to a multibillion-dollar deal to sell dozens of its 737 MAX 7 jets to Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, in potentially the company's largest 737 MAX order since the aircraft's safety ban was lifted, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
If confirmed, the deal would head off a partial defection to Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) by one of Boeing's largest customers and provide Boeing much-needed support after the nearly two-year grounding of the 737 MAX family, following fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.
The order would include dozens of firm orders and potentially significant options, the sources said.
U.S. carrier Southwest said it does not comment on fleet decisions and has nothing to announce. Boeing declined comment.
The proposed deal follows speculation of a faceoff between the smallest member of Boeing's MAX family and the A220 from Airbus. 
Each 737 MAX 7 carries a list price of roughly $100 million, though such jets usually sell for less than half their official value with typical market discounts, according to aircraft industry sources. 
The exact terms of any deal and the timing of a possible announcement were not clear.
Boeing shares gained 6.4% to close at $245.34 on Wednesday. Southwest shares dipped 0.7% to close at $58.51.
The potential Southwest deal comes after Alaska Airlines agreed in December to buy 23 737 MAX 9 jets following a lifeline order from European budget airline Ryanair for 75 of the narrowbodies.
Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly said in November that the company wanted to make a decision soon about refreshing its aging 737-700 jets with 143 seats and was debating between the Boeing 737 MAX-7, which has yet to be certified, or the A220, which would mean a shift away from its all-Boeing fleet for the first time.
Speaking at an Aero Club of Washington virtual luncheon on Wednesday, Kelly said Southwest remained in negotiations with Boeing and reiterated the advantages to having a single fleet type, while acknowledging that the A220 is ""a great plane.""
Any deal for the MAX is not meant to increase Southwest's overall fleet size. It has parked dozens of planes while weathering the COVID-19 crisis.
The MAX 7 is the smallest of the four-member MAX family, with space for 153 seats in a two-class configuration and a range of 3,850 nautical miles.
Boeing's overall order backlog stood at 4,041 aircraft as of end-February.

March 10 marks the second anniversary of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX crash, which occurred five months after a similar disaster on a Lion Air flight. All together, 346 people died.

AMC's shares have more than doubled in the last 12 months, with the recent surge coming as a result of being one of the so-called ""stonks"" - a term used to describe stocks with convoluted prospects that are popular with retail traders on online forums.
The health crisis devastated the film industry last year, forcing AMC and its rivals to raise new capital to stay afloat, but analysts polled by Refinitiv expect AMC's revenue to more than double this year.
""For all the talk of the steps we at AMC have taken to bolster our position, the real salvation of our company will be because of vaccination,"" Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron told analysts.
The cinema chain's move to implement COVID-19 safety protocols encouraged more than eight million customers to return to its theaters during the fourth quarter, AMC said.
AMC added several major releases that were delayed would hit AMC's big screens May onwards, with films such as ""Godzilla vs. Kong"", ""Top Gun: Maverick"", ""Black Widow"" and ""F9"" expected to boost sales in the coming months.
The cinema chain in recent weeks reopened many theaters, with about 90% of its U.S. theaters open as of Friday. It expects its European theaters to reopen in time for major releases.
""Our focus is no longer on survival, but now has turned instead to directing a surge in movie-going and on the recovery of AMC,"" Aron said.

AMC's fourth-quarter revenue slumped 88.8% to $162.5 million, beating estimates of $142.4 million, according to Refinitiv IBES. Excluding items, AMC lost $3.15 per share, smaller than expectations for a loss of $3.16 per share.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - GameStop (NYSE:GME) ended 7.3% higher on Wednesday after wild gyrations in the resurgent rally that has vaulted shares of the video game retailer and other so-called meme stocks closer to the peaks of late January. 
Shares of GameStop closed at $265 following turbulent trading that saw them rise by as much as 41% to a peak of $348.50, a move some analysts said was accelerated by bearish investors unwinding bets against the stock. 
The rally put the company’s market capitalization at $18.48 billion, making it the biggest listing on the S&P 600 index of small-cap stocks. At their session high, GameStop shares were up 800% from last month's low but still 28% below their late January peak. 
Traders exchanged almost $20 billion worth of GameStop shares, making it the Wall Street session's second most-traded company after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and ahead of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Other stocks popular with retail investors in forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets also enjoyed outsized gains. Headphone maker Koss Corp soared more than 100% at one point and cinema operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) jumped nearly 19% before erasing gains.
The moves drew cheers on WallStreetBets and other online forums and eyerolls from other market participants.
""You just have wild speculation .. They're guessing,"" said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York. ""I wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole right now."" 
Investors short GameStop shares have incurred over $1.3 billion in losses over the last couple of days, forcing some to abandon their positions and buy back the stock in a phenomenon known as a short squeeze, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.
Shorts have covered some 3 million shares over the last seven days, worth $742 million, the firm’s data showed. 
""As GameStop keeps going up, we are going to continue to see short-covering as more shorts reach their maximum pain threshold and are forced out of their trades,"" Dusaniwsky said.
GameStop retains a legion of devout followers after a social media frenzy in January triggered a massive rally in which its shares surged more than 1,600%. 
That spike triggered a short squeeze that shook hedge funds such as Melvin Capital.
But fuel for further short squeezes may be running out: About 20.5% of GameStop's share float is sold short, the lowest in at least three years, according to S3 data. 
Market strategists have also said tens of billions of dollars from stimulus checks sent to Americans through U.S. President Joe Biden's coronavirus relief package could find their way into the stock market, including into the ""meme stocks"" promoted by retail traders online.
GameStop bulls also hope for a profit boost from the transition to e-commerce for the video game retailer, led by shareholder and Chewy (NYSE:CHWY).com co-founder Ryan Cohen, who is on the company's board. The company has said it would report earnings on March 23. 
Denizens of WallStreetBets exhorted one another to hold on for more gains, while others lamented selling too early. 
""Makes (me) physically sick I sold all 39 shares of GME at $120 at a loss cause I thought it wasn’t happening again,"" Reddit user TheKingTodo wrote. 

Separately, on Wednesday, shares of U.S. gaming company Roblox Corp RBLX.N closed up 54.4% in its New York Stock Exchange trading debut on Wednesday, valuing the company at $45.2 billion.

The partnership, which will begin with the NHL's 2021-22 season, is highlighted by exclusive coverage of the Stanley Cup Final on ABC in four of the seven years of the agreement.
Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed but was widely reported to be worth between $2 billion and $2.5 billion.
In total, there will be 100 exclusive regular-season games per season across ESPN's networks and streaming platforms.
Additionally, the NHL's out-of-market streaming package, with more than 1,000 games, will be available for fans to stream only as part of an ESPN+ subscription.
""I believe it is fair to say we were both satisfied with the arrangement that we reached and when I had this approved by the NHL owners on Monday unanimously, they were satisfied,"" NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman told a media call to discuss the deal. ""We think we have become more valuable over time.""
Bettman described the deal, which includes digital, highlight and international rights, as ""groundbreaking"" and one that would allow the league to benefit from the power, reach and influence of Disney.
""This is a win, win, win,"" said Bettman. ""A win for ESPN and the Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), a win for the NHL and most importantly a win for fans.""
The deal ""puts us on the cutting edge of content distribution,"" he added.
The NHL's current 10-year, estimated $2 billion broadcast deal with NBC expires at the end of the 2020-21 season.
Like other North American sports leagues, the NHL has endured a difficult stretch that has seen a drop in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic that has kept fans out of arenas.
A league heavily dependent on gate revenues, Bettman said last year as it was forced into quarantine bubbles in Toronto and Edmonton to complete the season that it would have been cheaper to shut doors and not play.
Under the new agreement, ESPN and ABC will have exclusive live coverage of one Conference Final series and half of all first-round and second-round playoff games in each season of the deal.
Throughout the regular season, 25 games from the NHL schedule will be carried live, exclusively on ABC or ESPN.
The deal will also see 75 national regular-season games per season produced by ESPN that will be streamed exclusively on both ESPN+ and Hulu.
ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said that while the deal reinforced its commitment to its core linear networks, the streaming component was the key.

""Streaming is at the heart of this deal and this is a reflection of its role as a critical part of our future,"" Pitaro said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Prominent attorneys Kenneth Feinberg and Camille Biros have been named to oversee a $500 million victim compensation fund for the relatives of 346 people killed in two fatal Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes, a spokeswoman for Feinberg confirmed on Wednesday, the second anniversary of the second crash.
The fund is part of a $2.5 billion Justice Department settlement reached in January with  Boeing Co  after prosecutors charged the company with fraud over the certification of the 737 MAX following a Lion Air crash on Oct. 29, 2019 and an Ethiopian Airlines disaster on March 10, 2019.
Boeing said it looked ""forward to working with Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros to ensure the prompt distribution of these funds.”
The Justice Department (DOJ) declined to comment. 
The settlement allowed Boeing to avoid criminal prosecution but did not impact civil litigation against the planemaker by victims' relatives that continues.
Feinberg and Biros have administered many compensation funds including for victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, General Motors (NYSE:GM) ignition switch crashes and numerous school shootings.
In July 2019, Boeing named Feinberg and Biros to oversee the distribution of a separate $50 million to the families of those killed in the crashes.
Under the Justice Department agreement, Boeing was required to propose three candidates to administer the fund.
In this role, they will make recommendations about payments but the Justice Department will make final decisions on all payments.
While Boeing has mostly settled Lion Air lawsuits, it still face more than 100 lawsuits in Chicago federal court by families of the Ethiopian crash asking why the MAX continued flying after the first disaster. 
Some relatives were commemorating the second anniversary on Wednesday with protests and vigils in Washington, and Toronto, where they have asked regulators to reconsider their decision to let the 737 MAX fly again after a nearly two-year safety ban.
The DOJ settlement includes a fine of $243.6 million and compensation to airlines of $1.77 billion over fraud conspiracy charges related to the plane’s flawed design.
Chris Moore, who lost his daughter in the Ethiopian crash, noted that the fine is only 10% of the total settlement, or the cost of about two 737 MAX planes.
""If this isn’t a slap in the face for us – I don’t know what is. It definitely is only a slap on their wrist,"" he said.
The Justice Department said in January, ""Boeing’s employees chose the path of profit over candor by concealing material information from the FAA concerning the operation of its 737 Max airplane and engaging in an effort to cover up their deception.""
Some lawmakers say the government did not go far enough, while Boeing says it has taken numerous steps to overhaul its safety culture.
""The DOJ settlement was pathetic,"" said House Transportation Committee chairman Peter DeFazio in an interview Wednesday, who faulted the settlement's focus on a couple employees and not the board or executive team. ""I think they're still way-too Wall Street dominated.""
Congress ordered a major overhaul of how the FAA certifies new airplanes in December and directed an independent review of Boeing's safety culture.

Last month, Boeing agreed to pay $6.6 million to the Federal Aviation Administration as part of a settlement over quality and safety-oversight lapses going back years.

Investing.com – The Dow closed at a record high Wednesday, as investors continued to back value stocks on optimism that the $1.9 trillion fiscal package will spur a stronger reopening and economic recovery. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.46%, or 464 points, to close at record of 32,297.02, and the S&P 500 rose 0.61% and theNasdaq Composite closed flat, giving up its intraday gains.
President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package was passed the final vote in the House on Wednesday, and will now be sent to the White House to be signed into law.
""President Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion fiscal package appears to be on track for approval by March 14, with much of the spending scheduled for this year and targeted toward consumers,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said.  ""We believe disbursements will supercharge an economic recovery already supported by an accelerated reopening and solid consumer finances — putting growth on track for its strongest rate in over 35 years,"" it added.
A sea of green washed over cyclical corners of the market, such as financials and energy, which tend to move in tandem with the economy. 
Energy stocks were also boosted by rising oil prices as investors shrugged off a jump in weekly U.S. crude stockpiles for the second-straight week.
Crude inventories rose 13.8 million barrels last week, compared with economists' forecasts for a build of 816,000 barrels. The large build was attributed to a fall in crude inputs needed to make fuel products like gasoline as refineries in Texas make a slow return to operations following weather-related disruptions.
The faster pace of growth is expected to trigger an uptick in inflation, but many including the Federal Reserve have suggested any spike in price pressures will likely be transitory.  
The Labor Department said on Wednesday its Consumer Price index  rose 0.4% last month, in-line with economists' estimates. The latest data eased investor fears that inflation is set to spiral out of control and push U.S. rates up at a disorderly pace, muddying demand for the long-duration growth stocks that have longer paybacks.
""Despite inventory shortages, commodity price pressures and supply bottlenecks, inflation continues to be very tame,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Tech stocks ended lower, struggling to hold onto intraday gains following a 4% rally a day earlier, as semiconductor stocks slipped on a report pointing to signs of softer Apple iPhone demand.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reportedly plans to cut iPhone production by 20% during the first half of the year, Niukkei Asian Review reported, citing sources. Most of the cut in production was targeted at the iPhone 12 Mini.
Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), each down more than 4%, were among the biggest decliners in semis.

1223,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 03:45PM ET</span>","Facebook asks court to dismiss U.S. government, states antitrust cases","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) asked a federal court on Wednesday to dismiss major antitrust cases filed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and nearly every U.S. state, saying they failed to show the company had a monopoly or harmed consumers. 
""By a one-vote margin, in the fraught environment of relentless criticism of Facebook for matters entirely unrelated to antitrust concerns, the agency decided to bring a case against Facebook,"" Facebook said in responding to the FTC complaint.
""None of the harms typically alleged in antitrust actions is alleged here,"" it said.
In lawsuits filed in December, the FTC and states asked the court to force the social media giant to sell two prized assets, its messaging app WhatsApp and photo-sharing app Instagram. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in the District of Columbia will hear the cases.
The FTC and states accused Facebook of breaking antitrust law to keep smaller competitors at bay and snapping up social media rivals, like Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion.
All told, the federal government and states filed five lawsuits against Facebook and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google last year following bipartisan outrage over use and misuse of social media clout both in the economy and in the political sphere. 
In its response to the FTC lawsuit, Facebook argued that the government failed to show that Facebook had a monopoly in a clearly defined market or that it had hurt consumers. 
The company also dismissed emails cited in the FTC lawsuit written by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other executives expressing worry about the competitive threat posed by Instagram and WhatsApp.
""Lacking facts to establish either unlawful conduct or harm to consumers, the FTC attempts to bolster its claims with a grab-bag of selectively quoted internal emails and messages from Facebook executives, which are offered to show that Facebook was concerned about competitive threats from Instagram and WhatsApp – but also many, many other firms,"" Facebook said in its response.
Separately, in the lawsuit brought by dozens of states and territories, Facebook argued that the state case should be dismissed because the states failed to show that they were harmed by Facebook and because they waited more than four years.
New York Attorney General Letitia James said that Facebook was ""wrong on the law and wrong on our complaint.""
""We are confident in our case, which is why almost every state in this nation has joined our bipartisan lawsuit to end Facebook's illegal conduct,"" she said in a statement.
The FTC had no comment regarding Facebook's response.

The states and FTC have until April 7 to formally respond to the court.

1224,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 03:39PM ET</span>","GameStop, Reopening Trade, DraftKings: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Stocks surged as President Joe Biden inched closer to signing his $1.9 trillion stimulus into law, an event that is now expected Friday.
Already, signs that inflation remained in check in February lifted stocks on Wednesday. The much-watched 10-year U.S. Treasury slipped as core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose slightly less than expected.
Investors have been nervous that the reopening of the economy plus the federal relief money might spark higher inflation, and that caused a big rise in government bond yields in the last few weeks that slammed technology stocks. Those fears have eased somewhat.
Now the guesswork begins on which sectors and stocks could benefit the most from the extra spending by individuals intended by the $1,400 stimulus checks. 
It’s a light day for data, aside from the weekly jobless claims expected out Thursday morning. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Robinhood meme-stocks continue to draw interest
The retail trading frenzy inspired by members of a Reddit forum who have been goading each other to trade certain stocks over Robinhood continues to have teeth.  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) shares soared another 19% on Wednesday then fell into the red, then recovered in volatile trading after in a rally that has already doubled the company's market value.
Among other ""meme"" stocks, Koss Corporation (NASDAQ:KOSS) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC)also traded wildly. AMC is set to report fourth quarter earnings after the market close, and analysts are hoping to hear executives talk about the outlook post-pandemic.
2. Stimulus trade on as investors hunt for the next winner
The $1.9 trillion stimulus not only puts $1,400 in the pockets of people earning less than $80,000, it sets aside relief for airlines and restaurants among other hard-hit industries. That could be a boost for stocks like United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL), Southwest Airlines Company (NYSE:LUV) and Darden Restaurants Inc (NYSE:DRI), as the reopening trade picks up steam. Banks are also trading higher. Tame inflation signs benefit banks, but the added stimulus could be good for their credit card, auto and home lending operations, too.
Retailers such as  Kohls Corp  (NYSE:KSS) and Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) could also benefit from the extra consumer spending intended by the stimulus bill. Next up, the possibility of infrastructure projects boosting construction and materials stocks.
3. DraftKings a winner in sports betting legalization movement
Online and mobile gaming and sports betting is picking up momentum as more states consider legalizing the activity. That has put fire under shares of DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG), which rose another 13% on Wednesday after a slew of analysts raised their price targets. 
Also helping the shares: Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) acquired more than 900,000 shares of DraftKings, a bullish sign. And Norway’s sovereign wealth fund has also reportedly been a buyer.

Investing.com – The Dow jumped to fresh record highs Wednesday, led by value stocks and ongoing optimism for a stronger recovery with another wave of fiscal stimulus, while tech stocks gave up gains even as U.S. rates fell on signs that inflation remains tame.
The {169|Dow Jones Industrial Average}} rose 1.53%, or 488 points, and had hit intraday record of 32,330.64, and the S&P 500 rose 0.71% and theNasdaq Composite was flat after trading about 1% higher.
The Labor Department said on Wednesday its Consumer Price index  rose 0.4% last month, in-line with economists' estimates. The latest data eased investor fears that inflation is set to spiral out of control and push U.S. rates up at a disorderly pace, muddying demand for the long-duration growth stocks that have longer paybacks.
""Despite inventory shortages, commodity price pressures and supply bottlenecks, inflation continues to be very tame,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Tech stocks, however, struggled to hold onto intraday gains following a 4% rally a day earlier, as semiconductor stocks slipped on a report pointing to signs of softer Apple iPhone demand.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reportedly plans to cut iPhone production by 20% during the first half of the year, Niukkei Asian Review reported, citing sources. Most of the cut in production was targeted at the iPhone 12 Mini.
Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), each down more than 4%, were among the biggest decliners in semis.
The cyclicals sector of the market, such as financials and energy, which tend to move in tandem with the economy, continue to attract investment dollars as investors bet on a stronger economic recovery amid a boost from another round of stimulus.
President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package was passed the final vote in the House on Wednesday, and will now be sent to the White House to be signed into law.
Energy stocks were also boosted by rising oil prices as investors shrugged off a jump in weekly U.S. crude stockpiles for the second-straight week.
Crude inventories rose 13.8 million barrels last week, compared with economists' forecasts for a build of 816,000 barrels. The large build was attributed to a fall in crude inputs needed to make fuel products like gasoline as refineries in Texas make a slow return to operations following weather-related disruptions.
In other news, Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) made its public market debut at a price $64.50 a share, well above its reference price of $45. The shares were last trading at $69, up 54%.
GameStop (NYSE:GME), meanwhile, was involved in yo-yo action, swinging to a more than 40% loss before recovering losses to trade above the flatline.   "
1226,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 03:15PM ET</span>","Senate committee votes in favor of Biden pick to lead SEC, split on CFPB nominee","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday voted in favor of President Joe Biden's pick to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission, but was tied when it came to approving his nominee to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
With a 14-10 vote, Gary Gensler's nomination moved out of the committee with a favorable recommendation to a full Senate vote. The committee was split 12-12 on Rohit Chopra, Biden's pick to be director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB.
Both nominees had been broadly expected to be confirmed to their spots. Chopra was unanimously confirmed in 2018 to be a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission. Still, both faced scrutiny during their nomination hearing last week from Republican lawmakers, who have said both may be divisive if confirmed. 
Progressives see both financial regulators as key to advancing policy directives around climate change and racial justice. The CFPB has been a political lightning rod since it was created following the 2009 financial crisis, beloved by Democrats as a guardian of ordinary Americans but reviled by Republicans as too powerful and unaccountable. 
On Wednesday, Republican Senator Pat Toomey from Pennsylvania cited Chopra's previous work at CFPB as a reason for voting against him. 

Chopra is still likely to be considered in a full vote. Earlier this year, Democratic and Republican leaders reached an agreement on power-sharing in light of the split Senate, which Democrats narrowly control.

The move follows similar commitments by rivals Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank.

""While the failure to act is not an option, the sole answer cannot be an abrupt and disruptive change to individual industries that threaten the livelihoods of communities we serve.""
BMO's Global Asset Management unit will also aim to have only net zero assets under advisement by 2050, it said. The bank also said it is creating a climate institute to find solutions to climate change. 
Richard Brooks, climate finance director of advocacy group Stand.Earth, said BMO ""is just following the pack"" with a climate announcement that ""misses the most important point: the need to end financing of the worst carbon emitters - fossil fuel companies.""
“You can't take leadership action on climate by continuing to fund the expansion of coal and tar sands projects,” he said in a statement.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's fortune reached $100 billion on Wednesday, as investors drove the stock price for his company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc to a record level.
Buffett's net worth, as measured by Forbes magazine, comes almost entirely from owning about one-sixth of Berkshire, a roughly $600 billion company.
Berkshire's stock price has surged higher in March, with its Class A shares surpassing $400,000 on Wednesday.
That came after the Omaha, Nebraska-based company on Feb. 27 said fourth-quarter operating results improved despite the coronavirus pandemic, while gains in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other stocks fueled a $35.8 billion overall profit.
The 90-year-old Buffett's net worth would be higher had he not in 2006 begun donating his Berkshire shares to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and four family charities.
Buffett had previously owned nearly one-third of Berkshire, and his donations have totaled more than $37 billion when they were made.
Berkshire was a failing textile company when Buffett took control in 1965. It now owns more than 90 businesses such as the Geico car insurer and BNSF railroad, and ended last year with $281.2 billion of stocks.
One of the world's most celebrated investors, Buffett was once the world's richest person but has been bypassed by several executives whose companies' stock prices have risen faster.
Before this year, Berkshire's stock had trailed the Standard & Poor's 500 including dividends over the prior decade.
The stock has outperformed in 2021, and some analysts raised their price targets this month.

Forbes said Buffett ranks fifth on its list of the world's richest people, after Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Jeff Bezos, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Elon Musk, LVMH Moet Hennessy's Bernard Arnault and his family, and the philanthropist and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates.

Roblox, a free platform that offers games created by its users - the bulk of whom are under the age of 13, who receive a commission of about 24% on all the Robux, an in-game virtual currency, spent in their game.
During the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns, activity on the platform has grown, with the number of hours that players spend on the app more than doubling to 30.6 billion.
Daily active users rose 85% in 2020 to 32.6 million that faster than the 48% growth seen in 2019. Daily paying users to 490,000 in 2020, up 166%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Labor said on Wednesday it will not enforce two rules finalized in the last days of the Trump administration that curb investments based on environmental and social factors and shareholder voting in corporate meetings. 
The rules cover trillions of dollars in retirement accounts. Investors and their advocates criticized the business-friendly measures as misguided as they have pushed companies on corporate ballots to address issues ranging from systemic racism to climate change. More money is also flowing to managers that use environmental and social factors to select securities.
Trump administration officials had said the rules focused investment managers on retirees' financial interests and ""material"" risks to returns, rather than possible political issues.
President Joe Biden has said government agencies should review regulations that do not protect the environment, bringing the rules under scrutiny.
Reuters first reported that the Labor Department was expected to not enforce the rules.
The Labor Department said it has heard from stakeholders that the rules created confusion and had a ""chilling effect"" on asset managers using environmental, social and governance factors to help guide investment decisions.
The Labor Department plans to revisit the rules. 

The Trump administration rules created a perception that asset managers could run afoul of U.S. regulations if they exercised ordinary shareholder rights - like voting proxies - or if they included environmental, social and governance factors in analyzing investments, said Ali Khawar, principal deputy assistant secretary for the Employee Benefits Security Administration.

1234,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 01:51PM ET</span>",AerCap to buy GE's aircraft leasing unit in $30 billion deal,"By Shreyasee Raj and Conor Humphries
(Reuters) - The world's two largest aircraft leasing companies are combining to create a new financing giant after Ireland's AerCap finalised a deal worth more than $30 billion to buy the leasing business of  General Electric  (NYSE:GE).
The two companies, which tied the knot on Wednesday after days of speculation surrounding a takeover of GE's leasing arm GECAS, together control more than 2,000 jets, dwarfing rivals.
The tie-up creates easily the largest buyer of jetliners built by planemakers Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) and will reshape a global air finance industry that has attracted a flood of capital in recent years as investors look for higher returns.
Shares in both New York-listed companies fell about 6% on Wednesday as AerCap prepared to issue new stock to help finance the transaction and GE disappointed expectations of some investors that it would raise its cash outlook.
The deal comes as the independence of several leasing firms has been brought into question by the coronavirus crisis and could trigger further consolidation, analysts say.
It is the latest move by GE Chief Executive Larry Culp to reduce debt and focus the conglomerate on its industrial core of power, renewable energy, aviation and healthcare.
In a phone interview, Culp said the deal would help GE become better capitalised in line with peers and ""significantly"" derisk its balance sheet, opening up an array of capital allocation options including higher dividends, share buybacks.
""We're not declaring victory today, but this is an important step in our transformation,"" he told Reuters. 
Culp took the reins of the conglomerate in 2018, months after the 129-year-old company dropped out of Wall Street's blue-chip index following years of dwindling profits.
AerCap Chief Executive Aengus Kelly said the Dublin-based company had acquired its rival for an ""attractive"" discount to its book value in its second defining transaction in almost a decade, after purchasing U.S.-based ILFC in 2014.
Both deals saw AerCap pounce on solid business rivals whose owners were suffering due to a wider financial crisis. In both cases, the owners took up offers of stakes in the larger AerCap in return for ceding control, betting on an industry recovery.
STAKE TO BE 'MONETISED' OVER TIME
""This is not about scale or getting bigger for the sake of it,"" Kelly told analysts.
The deal to buy GECAS, or GE Capital Aviation Services, includes about $24 billion in cash and $1 billion paid in AerCap notes or cash. It includes 111 million new shares, giving GE a stake of 46% in the AerCap-controlled company. 
Culp said the stake would be monetised ""overtime"" as the aviation industry recovers.
The deal values GECAS at just over $31 billion based on closing AerCap share prices on Tuesday. 
GE said it planned to reduce debt by about $30 billion this year using transaction proceeds and existing cash, but announced a $3 billion writedown in connection with the deal.
The deal, which includes the transfer of about 300 helicopters, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Citi and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) have provided AerCap with $24 billion of committed financing for the transaction.
AerCap said the deal would raise its debt to 3.0 times equity but this adjusted ratio would return ""rapidly"" to a targeted level of 2.7.
Analysts have said the scale of the combined entity, controlling about three times the number of aircraft as its nearest competitor, Dublin-based Avolon, could force AerCap to offload aircraft to meet anti-trust requirements. 
The new group will have a mainly Airbus fleet but Kelly expressed support for the troubled Boeing 737 MAX, recently restored to service after an almost two-year safety grounding.
""I wouldn't bet against Boeing,"" he said.. 
Analysts have said the deal would give the combined group greater bargaining power when buying jets.

Boeing declined comment on the merger. Airbus said it would maintain the good relations it has had with AerCap and GECAS.

Investing.com - Banking and financial shares were up in Wednesday’s trading as data showed that inflation remained tame last month. 
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) shares were up 3%.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) shares rose 2.6%, while those of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) rose 2.2%. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) shares gained 1.3%.   
The consumer price index rose 0.4% in February, in line with expectations. It had risen 0.3% in January.
Concerns over higher inflation, a possibility given the unprecedented printing of money by the U.S. Federal Reserve, just like other central banks all over the world, have driven bond yields higher last few weeks.
The Treasury Department has printed roughly $3.6 trillion of new government debt in the past year to shore up the economy that was roiled by the Covid-19 pandemic, CNBC said in a report.
The $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package, expected to get the House Democrats’ approval on Wednesday, will add more money in the hands of individuals qualified by income. Investors expect these people to line up at retail stores, restaurants and entertainment parks to spend their  stimulus checks. Fear that this increased spending will stoke inflation is keeping investors nervous.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Lufthansa is planning to launch an asset disposal programme as early as summer with the sale of its 1 billion euro ($1.19 billion) Airplus unit as the German carrier seeks to raise cash to emerge from a government bailout, people close to the matter said. 
Lufthansa is working with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on the divestiture of the business travel expenses manager, the sources said, adding that the summer timing of the auction will depend on bookings picking up after lockdown restrictions ease.
Lufthansa declined to comment while Goldman Sachs was not immediately available for comment.
Chief Financial Officer Remco Steenbergen said last week that Lufthansa will evaluate strategic options for Airplus and the international business of its caterer LSG once it is able to realise the full value of these businesses. 
Lufthansa is also considering a listing or stake sale of maintenance unit Lufthansa Technik, Steenbergen said, adding that a such deal would be complex as it would need to ensure Lufthansa's continued access to know-how and intellectual property and not have negative repercussions on relationships with customers.
The coronavirus pandemic led Lufthansa to report a record 6.7 billion euro loss for 2020 last week and the carrier said it will operate at 40-50% of pre-crisis capacity this year, lowering its earlier 40-60% ambition.
Summer travel will nonetheless pick up swiftly whenever restrictions are eased, Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said, and Lufthansa stands ready to restore 70% of its schedule ""in the short term"".
However, Lufthansa expects recovery in business trips to occur slower than in leisure travel, as many companies have learned during the pandemic that video conferences can replace a lot of face-to-face meetings.
Lufthansa received a government-backed 9 billion euro rescue last June. To avoid drawing on some of the costly bailout money, Lufthansa is aiming to reap funds from asset sales instead. 
Lufthansa is still burning through 10 million euros a day as lockdowns and travel restrictions weigh on its business.
Airplus in 2020 posted an adjusted loss before interest and taxes of 146 million euros as bookings were wiped out in the pandemic, compared to a year-earlier profit of 2 million euros.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States plans to double its order of the single-shot Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) coronavirus vaccine, procuring an additional 100 million doses, a White House official said on Wednesday.
President Joe Biden will direct the Department of Health and Human Services to secure the additional supply, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Biden is likely to highlight the issue at a meeting with the chief executives of J&J and Merck & Co later on Wednesday. Merck has agreed to partner with J&J to produce its vaccine.
The United States has already paid over $1 billion for 100 million doses from J&J and had an option to purchase an additional 200 million doses.
Biden has sought to speed up the vaccination process since taking office on Jan. 20. The pandemic has killed more than 528,000 people in the United States alone. 
J&J’s manufacturing has been slower than hoped, and it was not expected to be able to deliver any vaccine doses this week. It is expected to resume shipments later in March.
The company indicated that another vaccine purchase by the U.S. administration had not been finalized.
""Last August, Johnson & Johnson signed an agreement with the U.S. government to deliver 100 million doses of our COVID vaccine, and we are on track to meet that commitment,"" spokesman Jake Sargent said.
""The U.S. Government has the option to purchase additional doses under a subsequent agreement. We look forward to any future discussions with the U.S. Government and to participating in the event at the White House later today,"" he added.
J&J has come up short on its shipments to the United States this month, promising to deliver only 20 million of the 37 million doses it had originally promised to have ready by now. 
Merck will help with the final manufacturing steps called fill and finish - expected to be up and running in May - and the production of the vaccine itself. J&J, which has committed to producing 1 billion doses this year, also said it is continuing to seek more manufacturing partners.
The United States approved the Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc vaccines in December, and those companies have been working to increase their production since then.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna have committed to supplying the country with 120 million doses and 100 million doses, respectively, by the end of March. They have agreed to supply 300 million doses each by the end of July. 

As of Tuesday morning, more than 123 million doses of coronavirus vaccines had been distributed in the United States and 93.7 million shots had been administered, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

1240,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 11:21AM ET</span>","Prada bags sales boost from China rebound, online shift","(Reuters) - Italian fashion group Prada (OTC:PRDSY)'s sales and profits rebounded at the end of last year from a first-half slump due to the coronavirus pandemic, boosted by a strong performance in China and elsewhere in Asia, and the positive trend has carried on into 2021.
Luxury fashion companies have been hit hard by the impact of the crisis on tourism and travel, but an improving backdrop in China, one of the world's biggest luxury markets, has helped some companies to bounce back. 
Milan-based Prada, famous for its luxury bags and clothes, also benefited from a surge in online sales. 
The pandemic has accelerated the luxury goods industry's move towards digital sales. Prada's e-commerce sales more than tripled in 2020 versus 2019 levels, the Hong Kong-listed company said. 
Last year, Prada launched e-commerce in new key markets and revamped the Prada website. 
""We are just at the beginning of our growth trajectory and there is still a huge potential to unlock,"" said marketing head Lorenzo Bertelli, son of Prada's founders Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli, who are co-CEOs.
CEO Patrizio Bertelli said: ""We have 130 stores that are still closed due to the pandemic and group's performance in early 2021 is quite good anyway. That give us confidence to face the upcoming rebound, as soon as the most critical phase of the pandemic will end.""
The first months of 2021 have seen a slight growth in sales compared with the early part of 2020 and are up from 2019 levels, CFO Alessandra Cozzani said conference call after the group's results were published on Wednesday.
CEO Bertelli said Prada had responded quickly to market changes, strengthening the relationship with local customers whose consumption in the second half of the year almost fully offset the absence of tourists. 
""All of these initiatives led to a full recovery in the second half to pre-pandemic profitability levels,"" he said in a statement.
The recovery in retail sales, which account for around 90% of Prada's total, was driven in the second half by mainland China (+52%), Taiwan (+61%), Korea (+22%) and also by the Americas (+4%). Japan and Europe suffered from the lack of tourists and prolonged lockdowns. 
Full-year revenues fell by 24% to 2.42 billion euros ($2.9 billion) thanks to an improvement in the second half after a 40% slump in the first six months.
Lockdown measures to stem the spread of coronavirus led to around 18% of the group's store network being closed on average during the year and the restrictions also hit tourism. 
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) totalled 20 million euros in the full-year, following a 216 million euro EBIT in the second half, broadly in line with the same period of 2019, after a 196 million euros operating loss in the first six months.
Analysts had expected revenues at 2.44 billion euros and an EBIT of 13.8 million, based on a Refinitiv analyst consensus.
Analysts did not expected any dividends, but Prada's board decided on a 0.035 euros per share payment after skipping any dividend payout last year.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 11:20AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse shaken by aftershocks of Greensill insolvency,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Makiko Yamazaki
ZURICH/TOKYO (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) faces questions from regulators and insurers as it grapples with the fall-out from the collapse of $10 billion worth of supply chain finance funds linked to Greensill Capital.
The Swiss bank has hired external firms to help with their inquiries in the wake of Greensill Capital's insolvency, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The head of Credit Suisse's European asset management arm, which sold the Greensill-linked funds to investors, along with two colleagues have temporarily stood aside, the bank said in a memo. Credit Suisse is also taking steps to recover a $140 million loan made to a Greensill company in Australia
Credit Suisse was a key source of funding for the speciality finance firm, selling securities created by Greensill to investors via its asset management arm.
The supply chain financier began to unravel last week after losing insurance coverage for its debt repackaging business, prompting Credit Suisse to freeze funds linked to it.
Switzerland's second largest bank has hired the external firms in order to expedite the process of returning liquidation proceeds from the funds to investors, the source told Reuters.
Credit Suisse has so far made $3.05 billion worth of payments to investors. It has said further liquidation proceeds will be paid out ""as soon as practicable"".
There are questions over the insurance contracts that underpinned Greensill's securities, which were meant to protect investors in the event of a default. 
Japanese insurer Tokio Marine, which provided $4.6 billion of coverage to Greensill credit notes, said that it was investigating the validity of those policies which it inherited when it bought Insurance Australia Group in 2019.
A source familiar with the situation said the policies were directly linked to the $10 billion in funds frozen by Credit Suisse.
In a note to investors on Tuesday, Credit Suisse said it had not been informed of any insurance cancellation ""until very recently,"" and that existing policies from Insurance Australia had remained unchanged.
Credit Suisse declined comment on the Tokio Marine probe.
If Greensill's lending practices did not meet standards laid out in the insurance contract or were inconsistent with normal accounting rules, then an insurer would have grounds to challenge whether coverage applied, supply chain experts have said.
Greensill declined to comment.
""We have concerns about the validity of all Greensill policies and are conducting an investigation,"" Tokio Marine spokesman Tetsuya Hirano said.
Hirano said that the $4.6 billion worth of coverage attributed to Tokio Marine Holdings in court filings did not reflect the likely loss. He declined to comment further.
In Germany, where Greensill runs a bank, financial regulator BaFin has filed a criminal complaint with prosecutors in Bremen, where the lender is based. The precise details of the complaint are not known.
BLOW FOR CEO
The funds' troubles are a blow for Credit Suisse boss Thomas Gottstein, who became chief executive in the aftermath of a spy scandal and just as the coronavirus crisis struck.
The asset management unit behind the Greensill strategy was hit by a large impairment charge on a hedge fund investment in the fourth quarter.
Credit Suisse said in a memo sent to employees on Wednesday that Michel Degen, head of asset management in Switzerland and the EMEA region, was temporarily stepping aside along with managers Luc Mathys and Lukas Haas.
Reuters could not immediately reach Degen, Mathys or Haas for comment. According to their LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profiles, Mathys ran fixed income at the division and Haas worked in credit risk management. Haas was listed as the fund manager for some of the Greensill funds according to various fund websites.
Meanwhile in Australia, two people familiar with the matter said that Credit Suisse had appointed receivers to recover a bridging loan of about $140 million made to a Greensill company.
Credit Suisse was advising Greensill on a potential IPO last year and had lent it the $140 million on expectations the loan be repaid when it listed, one of the people said. Credit Suisse declined to comment and Greensill did not respond to requests for comment.
APOLLO TALKS DERAILED
Greensill was in talks to sell a chunk of its operating business to Athene Holding (NYSE:ATH) - an annuity seller which recently merged with Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) - but those talks have been derailed after one of the firm's key technology partners secured a $6 billion credit facility from a pool of banks led by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), one source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Taulia, a San Francisco-based financial technology company that had worked closely with Greensill, expressed concern that the Apollo deal would have affected its own business model, which is based on using multiple banks for financing, two separate sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In a statement, Taulia confirmed it had held conversations with Apollo over their plans to purchase parts of Greensill, adding Taulia wanted to continue giving clients ""flexibility in the source of funding for early payments.""

JPMorgan, an investor in and strategic partner of Taulia, came to its rescue providing $3.8 billion of an overall $6 billion credit lifeline and reducing the need for an emergency deal with Apollo, the first source said. Other banks including UniCredit, which has a commercial partnership with Taulia, are expected to commit capital and top up the U.S. firm's credit facility, this source said. UniCredit declined to comment.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German sportswear company Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) aims to double its e-commerce sales by 2025 and make its products more sustainable as part of a five-year plan to lift profitability closer to that of rival  Nike  (NYSE:NKE).
Adidas is targeting online sales of up to 9 billion euros ($10.7 billion) a year by 2025 with an operating profit margin of 12-14%, up from the 11.3% achieved in 2019 before the coronavirus crisis knocked sales and profitability.
The company has reopened 95% of its stores after coronavirus lockdowns, it said on Wednesday, as it forecast a 2021 sales growth rate in the mid-to-high teens, rising to as much as 30% in greater China, the rest of Asia and Latin America.
Adidas shares were up 3.2% by 1250 GMT, the biggest gain on the German blue-chip index.
While the sporting goods industry has suffered from store closures during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has managed to sell more online as more people have taken up running, hiking and yoga during lockdowns.
Nike, the world's biggest sportswear brand, has said people have logged on to its workout and store apps en masse, driving significantly higher online sales over the past year.
Adidas will invest more than 1 billion euros in its digital transformation by 2025, including making its supply chain more agile to better deliver online orders quickly. 
CEO Kasper Rorsted said e-commerce would account for more than 40% of the industry's sales by 2025, with online growing three times faster than offline. Adidas has already attracted more than 150 million members to its online programme.
It will also spend 1 billion euros more in 2025 compared to 2021 on the brand, including on marketing and sponsorship as it launches sports-inspired lifestyle products, alongside its existing performance and Originals fashion categories. 
Like rivals Puma and Nike, Adidas will put a bigger focus on the women's market, announcing a partnership with Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON), which has seen a surge of subscribers during the pandemic for its on-demand workout programmes on exercise bikes.
It aims to make nine out of 10 products more sustainable by 2025, using more recycled and biodegradable materials, with its Stan Smith tennis shoe leading the way with a version made of mushroom-based leather substitute set to launch later in 2021.
Rorsted said more than 70% of consumers say sustainability is an important consideration when making a purchase.
With greater China set to be its fastest growth market, Adidas will now manage the region separately from the rest of Asia.
Net income from continuing operations is projected to rise to 1.25-1.45 billion euros in 2021, up from 429 million euros in 2020 but still below the 1.9 billion euros in 2019.
Adidas expects a hit of about 250 million euros to operating profit from costs to make its struggling Reebok brand a standalone company as it prepares to sell or spin-off the business, with a third of that in 2022 but none in 2023.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped on Wednesday with the Dow hitting a record high, as data showed underlying consumer prices remained tepid in February, easing concerns about a spike in inflation.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield slipped from its session highs as data showed core consumer prices index, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, rose less than expected last month.
Focus is on an auction of U.S. 10-year and 30-year debt later in the day for clues to where yields in the recently volatile market may be headed.
""Expectations for near-term inflation to rise is going to remain due to the huge public borrowings, but the tame inflation data that has come today would definitely drive some optimism among investors,"" said Arthur Weise, chief investment officer at Kingsland Growth Advisors in New York.
Accelerated vaccine rollouts and a new hefty round of fiscal stimulus on the horizon have raised bets on higher inflation, triggering a sharp rise in Treasury yields that knocked off the tech-heavy Nasdaq about 7% from its Feb. 12 record closing high.
The United States plans to double its order of the single-shot Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) coronavirus vaccine, procuring an additional 100 million doses, a White House official said on Wednesday.
The Nasdaq extended gains after logging its best one-day percentage jump in four months on Tuesday, helped by a near 20% jump in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's shares as investors picked up momentum stocks that had recently taken a beating due to higher yields.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Tesla extended gains by 0.8% and 4% from the previous session, while economy-linked industrial and financial stocks jumped more than 1% each.
The chunk of a $1.9 trillion relief aid, which is on track to be signed into law later this week, is poised to end up in the stock market and could provide a boost for GameStop (NYSE:GME) and other stocks popular among retail investors active in online social media forums.
Shares of GameStop jumped another 19%, setting the videogame retailer on track for its longest streak of daily gains in six months and extending a rally that has already doubled the company's market value.
Among other ""meme"" stocks, Koss Corp and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) climbed 52% and 14%.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4.2-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 4.1-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The soups and snacks maker, which benefited from rising demand for its ready-to-eat or quick-fix meals during the pandemic, said its plant in Texas, where it makes Prego pasta sauces, was closed for two weeks in December.
An increasing number of COVID-19 cases also led to fewer staff operating its plant during winter, a key period for the soup maker when consumers seek comfort food.
""We crossed the double-digit line on absenteeism, which was really the highest we had seen,"" Chief Executive Officer Mark Clouse told analysts, adding that it led to delayed shipments.
""It really did reduce a little bit of our firepower as we had expected to be able to get in front of consumption and ship a bit ahead of it."" 
The company forecast sales to fall 3.5% to 2.5% in fiscal 2021, following a year when demand surged as consumers stockpiled on soups and snacks before the pandemic-induced lockdowns. A gradual reopening of restaurants and the rollout of vaccines could reduce consumers' reliance on packaged food. 
J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said the forecast would be a let down to some investors, considering the food-at-home category has performed better than anticipated in general.
Campbell expects adjusted annual earnings between $3.03 and $3.11 per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of $3.03 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Second-quarter sales rose 5.4% to $2.28 billion, but fell below expectations of $2.30 billion. 

Shares of Campbell were down about 2% in early trading.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission should set a date to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars across the European Union to align the transport sector with climate goals, nine member countries said on Wednesday.
Led by Denmark and the Netherlands, the countries have written to the European Commission, the bloc's executive, calling for ambitious EU policies to tackle the quarter of EU greenhouse gases that come from transport.
This must include a phase-out date for the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in the EU, to support the shift to zero-emission vehicles, the countries said. 
""We have to accelerate the green transition of road transport and as legislators send clear signals to car manufacturers and consumers across the EU,"" said Danish climate minister Dan Jorgensen.
The other countries joining the push were Austria, Belgium, Greece, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Malta.
The European Commission will propose tougher CO2 standards for new cars in Europe as part of a package of policies in June aimed at delivering its goal to cut net EU greenhouse gas emissions at least 55% by 2030, from 1990 levels, and steer the bloc towards climate neutrality by 2050.
The current CO2 standards need a ""significant strengthening"", and the EU must also bolster charging and refuelling infrastructure for zero-emission vehicles, the countries said.
EU legislation should also be amended to allow countries to take national action to phase out new petrol and diesel cars, they said.
Many carmakers have already laid out a timetable to switch to all-electric car line-ups. Within the last month, Swedish carmaker Volvo said it would become fully electric by 2030, and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said all its cars sold in Europe would be electric by the same date.
The UK government has pledged to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in 2030.

Sales of electric and plug-in hybrid cars in the EU almost trebled to over 1 million vehicles in 2020, accounting for more than 10% of overall sales.

Investing.com - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares rose 5% in early trade Wednesday, its second consecutive day of gains. The renewed investor interest in the electric vehicle maker, coming after a 40% correction in the stock, got further impetus from New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu’s 'buy' rating on the stock Tuesday.
Ferragu’s $900 price target was around 50% higher than Monday's closing price and sent Tesla soaring about 19% on Tuesday. The stock currently trades around $688.
Tesla’s spectacular run that began in 2020 was abruptly halted last month with its announcement that it had invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. Investors weren’t amused and dumped the company’s stock, just as they did with the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has touched new lifetime highs since.
Other positive news also added to the favorable sentiment for Tesla shares. Business newspaper Globes has reported that the company will this month deliver the first Tesla 3 cars to Israeli customers, though just 120 initially.
Concerns over reports of hacking at its China factory were also short-lived. The company, founded by Elon Musk, said the incident, reported on Tuesday, was restricted to a supplier's production site in the country’s Henan province and that its Shanghai factory and showrooms were unaffected.
A small group of hackers earlier this week viewed live and archived surveillance footage from hundreds of businesses by gaining administrative access to cameras supplied by Verkada, one of the hackers told Reuters on Tuesday.
Verkada acknowledged an intrusion, saying it had disabled all internal administrator accounts to prevent unauthorized access.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Wednesday with the rebound in technology stocks continuing against the backdrop of fresh U.S. inflation figures that were free of negative surprises.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 307 points, or 1.0%. at 32,140 points, but the Nasdaq Composite, home to the greatest concentration of tech stocks, was outperforming for a second straight day with a rise of 1.2%.  The S&P 500 was up 0.8%.
Earlier, February data for consumer inflation had showed prices rising largely in line with expectations, with the headline annual rate rising to 1.7% as expected, and the core CPI slightly weaker than forecast: core prices rose 0.1% on the month, leaving the annual rate to fall to 1.3% from 1.4% in January.  Despite some caveats about the reliability of the CPI data in a year of extraordinary shifts in consumer spending patterns, the figures suggest that inflationary pressures are not rising at any particularly alarming rate in the U.S. economy. 
U.S. 10-Year bond yields were steady after the auction, showing no signs of unease ahead of a massive $38 billion auction of 10-year Treasury notes later in the day. The auction is one of three this week that will raise money for the massive spending plans contained in the $1.9 trillion stimulus package, which is expected to receive its final vote of approval from the House of Representatives later in the day, before being signed into law next week by President Joe Biden.
The market was eagerly anticipating the first trades in Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) stock, which made its market debut on Wednesday through a direct listing, having set a reference price of $45 a share on Tuesday. That values the pre-teen focused gaming platform company at $30 billion, some 25% more than Snap (NYSE:SNAP) at the time of its initial public offering. 
The short-squeeze on various stocks that have been the focus of retail investors congregating on social media chatboards returned to frenzied levels again, with GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock rising another 18% and movie theater operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) rising 13.5%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, which had traded below $540 last week, broke back above $700 with a 4% gain, before easing off a little. 
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) stock and AerCap (NYSE:AER) stock both suffered a 'buy-the-rumor-sell-the-fact' relapse after the two companies confirmed a deal that will see GE transfer its GECAS aircraft leasing operation to AerCap for $24 billion in cash and a 46% stake in AerCap."

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) grappled with the fall-out of Greensill Capital's insolvency on Wednesday, as the head of its European asset management division temporarily stepped aside and it appointed receivers to recover a $140 million loan in Australia.
The Swiss bank was a key source of funding for the speciality finance firm, selling $10 billion worth of securities created by Greensill to investors via its asset management arm.
Greensill began to unravel last week after losing insurance coverage for its debt repackaging business, prompting Credit Suisse to freeze its Greensill-linked funds.
Three Credit Suisse employees, including the head of its European asset management division, who helped oversee the Greensill funds have temporarily stood aside.
Japanese insurer Tokio Marine Holdings Inc, which provided $4.6 billion of coverage to Greensill credit notes, said on Wednesday that it was investigating the validity of those policies.
Tokio Marine's exposure to Greensill comes via a company it bought from Insurance Australia Group in 2019.
A source familiar with the situation said the policies were directly linked to the $10 billion worth of funds frozen by Credit Suisse.
In a note to investors on Tuesday, Credit Suisse said it had not been informed of any insurance cancellation ""until very recently,"" and that existing policies from Insurance Australia had remained unchanged.
Credit Suisse declined comment on the probe by Tokio Marine.
If Greensill's lending practices did not meet standards laid out in the insurance contract or were inconsistent with normal accounting rules, then an insurer would have grounds to challenge whether coverage applied, supply chain experts have said.
Greensill declined to comment.
""We have concerns about the validity of all Greensill policies and are conducting an investigation,"" Tokio Marine spokesman Tetsuya Hirano said.
Hirano said that the $4.6 billion worth of coverage attributed to Tokio Marine Holdings in court filings did not reflect the likely loss. He declined to comment further.
Credit Suisse is in the process of liquidating its Greensill funds and has so far made $3.05 billion worth of payments to investors. It has said further liquidation proceeds will be paid out ""as soon as practicable"".
A BLOW FOR THE CEO
The funds' troubles are a blow for chief executive Thomas Gottstein, who took the helm in the aftermath of a spy scandal and just as the coronavirus crisis struck. The asset management unit behind the Greensill strategy was hit by a large impairment charge on a hedge fund investment in the fourth quarter.
Credit Suisse said in a memo sent to employees on Wednesday that Michel Degen, head of asset management in Switzerland and the EMEA region, was temporarily stepping aside along with managers Luc Mathys and Lukas Haas.
Reuters could not immediately reach Degen, Mathys or Haas for comment. According to their LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profiles, Mathys ran fixed income at the division and Haas worked in credit risk management. Haas was listed as the fund manager for some of the Greensill funds according to various fund websites.
Meanwhile in Australia, two people familiar with the matter said that Credit Suisse had appointed receivers to recover a bridging loan of about $140 million made to a Greensill company.
Receivers from McGrathNicol have been appointed to attempt to recover the loan from Greensill Capital Pty Ltd after it filed for insolvency protection in London and in Australia on Monday, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
McGrathNicol and Credit Suisse both declined to comment, while Greensill did not return calls seeking comment.
Credit Suisse was advising Greensill on a potential IPO last year and had lent it the $140 million on expectations the loan be repaid when it listed, one of the people said.
Greensill, which is still registered in its founder Lex Greensill's hometown city of Bundaberg in Queensland Australia, said in court documents it would be unable to repay the loan.

It also said that it faced ""defaults"" by its key customer, GFG Alliance, which is controlled by Sanjeev Gupta. The Indian-British steel magnate has said GFG is operationally strong.

Investing.com -  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) shares fell 2.5%, to $45.77, in premarket trading on Wednesday after warning that net sales would fall this year as Covid-19 vaccinations spread and customers return to restaurants rather than pantry stocking.
Second quarter revenue of $2.28 billion fell short of expectations. Analysts tracked by Investing.com forecast sales of $2.3 billion.
Campbell sales surged last year as Covid-19 stay-at-home orders forced consumers to stock up on snacks and soups more than usual. But that might not continue at the same pace this year. The company projects revenue to fall between 2.5% and 3.5%.
The New Jersey-based company’s adjusted earnings per share of 84 cents did top the 83 cent per share estimate for the second quarter.  
Packaged foods makers like Campbell benefited immensely from rising demand for their ready-to-eat or ready-to-cook meals as restaurants mostly remained shut to in-person dining last year.
The maker of Goldfish crackers and Cape Cod potato chips expects annual earnings growth as its cost-saving measures pay off. It sees EPS rising by 3% to 5% for the full year 2021.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Campbell achieved just over $20 million in savings under its multi-year cost savings program, inclusive of Snyder’s-Lance synergies, bringing total program-to-date savings to approximately $760 million. A company filing said it remains on track to deliver annualized savings of $850 million by the end of fiscal 2022.

The entertainment giant’s new freedom to reopen its California parks in April after a winter closed due to the Covid-19 shutdown has also supported the stock in recent sessions.

Streaming has thrived in the last year, while Disney's main sources of cash - movie theaters, cruises and theme parks - have all been badly hit by the pandemic.
Chapek said it would take a few weeks to call back 10,000 furloughed employees to its two theme parks at Disneyland Resort in Anaheim and train them in new virus safety procedures.

The Boston-based company said it expects to generate $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion in free cash flow this year, with an adjusted earnings of $0.15 to $0.25 per share, reaffirming the guidance it provided in January.
All industrial businesses except non-gas power are projected to book higher cash flow in 2021.
Free-cash flow is closely watched by investors as a sign of the health of GE's operations and ability to pay down debt.
""We are on a positive trajectory in 2021 as momentum builds across our businesses and we transform to a more focused, simpler, and stronger industrial company,"" said Chief Executive Larry Culp.
GE shares are up 31% this year, compared with a 3% advance for the benchmark S&P 500, and have gained about 160% since their May low. They were up 2.3% at $14.32 in pre-market trade.
The gains are being driven by hopes that the worst is over for the company as a recovery in air travel would boost its aviation business, usually its most profitable and most cash-generative segment.
GE said the deal for the aircraft-leasing business, known as GE Capital Aviation Services, or GECAS, is expected to help reduce debt by $30 billion.

It also announced a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-8.

The merger will give the combined lessor and financier better footing to negotiate with the likes of Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus.
GE shares were down 2.0% at $13.74. They had hit their highest level in nearly three years when news broke at the weekend that it was close to a deal.
The deal gives GE 46% ownership of the merged company. Once completed, GE aims to use the proceeds, along with its existing cash resources, to reduce debt by approximately by $30 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) - British 10-year index-linked bonds attracted record demand at a government auction on Wednesday, adding to signs of concern that inflation might rise faster than expected.
Investors submitted 2.832 billion pounds ($3.93 billion) of bids for the 800 million pounds on offer of an index-linked bond maturing in August 2031.
That gave a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.54, the highest for any index-linked bonds since such auctions began in 1998.
Inflation worries have played a big role in the sell-off of U.S. Treasuries this year, with a knock-on impact for conventional gilts, which suffered their biggest monthly drop since October 2016 in February.
British index-linked bonds pay a return linked to the retail prices index of inflation, and the 2031 bond sold with a real yield of -2.595%, giving investors an annual return 2.595 percentage points below the prevailing rate of RPI.
Annual RPI was 1.6% in January, and the 10-year index-linked gilts price in an average RPI rate of just under 3.4%, their highest since late 2019 and up from just over 3.0% at the start of the year.
The Bank of England targets the consumer prices index measure of inflation, which currently stands at 0.7% but which the BoE and most economists expect to rise close to its 2% target by the end of the year if not sooner.
""Outright commodity price rises and base effects should push up meaningfully on the energy inflation component of the CPI in the coming months,"" Nomura economists wrote in a note to clients.
BoE Chief Economist Andy Haldane warned against complacency last month, likening inflation to a tiger on the prowl.
Wednesday's auction was Britain's penultimate sale of inflation-linked bonds this financial year, when the United Kingdom Debt Management Office is on course to sell more than 33 billion pounds of index-linked debt, 7% of its total issuance.
During the 12 months starting in April, the DMO plans to sell a similar volume.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank strategists are raising their estimates for U.S. corporate profitability this year following surprisingly strong fourth-quarter earnings and growing optimism about an economic rebound.
The sharp earnings growth will bolster the case for equity gains this year, they said.
Based on results from nearly all of the S&P 500 companies as of Friday, earnings rose 4.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020 from the year-ago period, defying analysts' expectations for a 10.3% decline, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities' chief U.S. equity strategist, Jonathan Golub, recently hiked his 2021 earnings per share target to $185 from $175 following upbeat fourth-quarter results, citing an expected sharp acceleration in the economy. 
If earnings are rising faster than prices, price-to-earnings multiples could contract modestly, he said.
""I'm predicting stocks are meaningfully cheaper between now and the end of the year, which is a very nice setup not only for this year but for next year,"" Golub said.
Some investors have been concerned that the benchmark S&P 500 is up more than 70% from its March 2020 bottom, with much of the gains being driven by investor optimism over the expected rebound in earnings and the economy.
The S&P 500 is trading close to 22 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, according to Refinitiv. That price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) is well above the 15 long-term average.
Concerns about valuations were partly behind a recent sell-off that left the Nasdaq on Monday more than 10% below its Feb. 12 record close, confirming a correction in the index. Technology and other areas of the market that had outperformed due to the coronavirus pandemic led the recent declines.
OUTLOOK FOR TECH
David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer for DWS, said while valuations are a concern for the overall market, he's ""not panicked about the outlook for tech.
""To think that technology is not going to benefit from a stronger economy and a reopening of businesses is actually ignoring the history we've had the last few years,"" he said.
DWS has hiked its 2021 and 2022 EPS forecasts.
Wall Street's ""bottom up"" consensus EPS forecast for 2021, based on estimates from analysts who cover individual companies, has also increased since the start of the year. It was at $174 as of Friday, up from $167 on Dec. 31, based on Refinitiv's data.
S&P 500 company earnings are expected to rise by 23.9% in 2021 after falling 12% in 2020, based on Refinitiv data as of Friday.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has raised its S&P 500 2021 EPS forecast to $181 from $178 after the fourth-quarter reports.
The new forecast, its strategists wrote, reflects ""higher sales and profit margins that should overcome input cost pressures due to high operating leverage.""
S&P 500 companies begin reporting on the first quarter in mid-April, with year-over-year earnings expected to grow 22% in the quarter, based on Refinitiv's data.

""First quarter's probably going to be better than people thought it was a month ago,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.

(Reuters) - Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co said on Wednesday that its combination antibody therapy to fight COVID-19 reduced the risk of hospitalization and death by 87% in a study of more than 750 high-risk COVID-19 patients. 
It is the second large, late-stage study to show that combination therapy of two antibodies, bamlanivimab and etesevimab, is effective at treating mild to moderate cases of COVID-19. 
The previous study, which published data in January, used a higher dose of the drugs and reduced risk of hospitalization by 70%. 
""I expect this data to continue to drive more utilization"" of the antibodies,"" said Daniel Skovronsky, chief scientific officer at Eli Lilly. 
""We have few other diseases where we have drugs that can offer this magnitude of benefit.""
U.S. regulators authorized the combination therapy in February for use in COVID-19 patients 12 and over with a high risk of developing serious complications. European regulators greenlighted its use in March. 
The United States agreed in February to purchase a minimum of 100,000 doses of the combination treatment. 
Regulators authorized bamlanivimab alone for use against COVID-19 last year and the U.S. government agreed to purchase nearly 1.5 million doses. 
Skovronsky said the combination therapy has the benefit of offering greater protection against new strains of COVID-19. 
A variant of COVID-19 originally discovered in Britain has infected patients in most U.S. states and is expected to become the country's dominant strain. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi)
""We are quite confident this combo covers all of the variants in the U.S.,"" Skovronsky said, adding Lilly is studying an additional treatment for new COVID strains first identified in South Africa and Brazil, which have not become widespread in the United States. 

Skovronsky said that Lilly is prepared to manufacture 1 million doses of the combination therapy in the coming months and is in active talks to supply governments around the world with the treatment.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Wednesday, with tech stocks struggling to hold on Tuesday’s strong gains ahead of key inflation data.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 70 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 35 points, or 0.3%.
The Nasdaq Composite closed sharply higher Tuesday, up 3.7%, with large tech stocks back in favor following a correction of over 10% in the last three weeks in the wake of a jump in Treasury yields. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended only 0.1% higher, while the S&P 500 rose 1.4%.
However, investors remain on edge amid uncertainty over whether this reprieve in growth stocks has staying power, or is merely a relief rally that will soon peter out.
Key to which direction these stocks move is likely to be fluctuations in U.S. Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-year yield traded around 1.56%, below Friday’s 1.62% peak, after Tuesday's auction of $58 billion in U.S. 3-year notes was well received.
There are further government debt auctions this week, including a mammoth $38 billion sale of 10-year notes at 1 PM ET. In addition, Wednesday will see the release of consumer price data for February, at 08:35 AM ET (1330 GMT), which is expected to show a slight acceleration in the overall inflation.
Some investors see a real risk of an overheated U.S. economy and higher inflation, particularly on the back of the Biden’s administration proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus plan, which could be passed by the House of Representatives later Wednesday.
In the corporate sector, attention is likely to be on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) after the electric car manufacturer jumped 20% on Tuesday, while GameStop (NYSE:GME) continues to be in demand as activist investor Ryan Cohen shakes up its online operations. 
Also in the spotlight will be  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) after the conglomerate announced a deal to combine its jet-leasing business with rival AerCap in a deal valued at $30 billion. 
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday, ahead of the release of official crude inventories from the Energy Information Administration later in the session.
U.S. oil stocks rose by 12.8 million barrels in the week to March 5, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute, released Tuesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $64.28 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.2% to $67.78.

In a development reminiscent of lurches in U.S. video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME)'s stock price in January, the regulator said it had detected non-market pricing on Friday in shares in MRSK Yuga, a Rosseti portfolio company.

Tinkoff said it had received the instruction and would restrict access for 39 clients. Sberbank said it does not disclose information on client operations. BCS and Aton declined to comment. The other brokers did not immediately respond.
It was the first time the central bank had publicly announced it was taking preventative measures, such as blocking brokerage accounts, to stop violations to the law on market manipulation.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) has told the Indian government it wants to produce its coronavirus vaccine locally if assured of faster regulatory clearance and freedom on pricing and exports, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The U.S. company pulled an application last month seeking emergency approval for its product in India after the drug regulator declined its request to skip a small local safety trial. That has kept its vaccine, developed with Germany's BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), out of one of the world's biggest drug markets.
Pfizer was the first company to apply for emergency use authorisation in India, proposing to import doses from its U.S. and European facilities instead of producing locally.
""U.S. companies want to produce vaccines in India under joint ventures,"" said one of the sources, citing Pfizer and fellow U.S. drugmaker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc.
""They want faster approvals for clinical trials and emergency authorisation use. They fear the government will introduce price control policies.""
Another source confirmed Pfizer was interested in manufacturing in India but Reuters could not find a second confirmation on Moderna.
The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. India's health ministry directed Reuters to the foreign ministry, which did not immediately respond to emailed queries.
While withdrawing its application in early February, Pfizer said it would again seek emergency use approval to launch its COVID-19 vaccine in India, potentially a market of 1.35 billion people, and would provide more data as it becomes available. 
On the government's demand to manufacture in India, the company earlier told Reuters: ""Once the pandemic supply phase is over and we enter a phase of regular supplies, Pfizer will evaluate all additional opportunities available.""
A Indian official told Reuters in January the government had held discussions with Pfizer and Moderna - both of which have reported more than 90% efficacy for their vaccines - to make the shots in India given its large pharmaceuticals capacity. 
The Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine maker, is already bulk-manufacturing the Oxford University/AstraZeneca product and plans to start producing the  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc shot from next month. 
India's government has not allowed it to sell on the higher-priced private market, however, and is also controlling exports. Pfizer and Moderna, whose shots are more expensive than the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) one being used in India's immunisation campaign, are not comfortable with strict price and export restrictions, one of the sources said.
This week, Reuters reported that leaders of the Quad alliance - Australia, Japan, India and the United States - plan to announce financing agreements to increase India's vaccine manufacturing capacity at their first meeting on Friday. 

The initiative will mainly involve production of the Novavax and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) shots for supplying to regions including Southeast Asia, where their common rival China is making gains.

The Anglo-Dutch company, which made its breakthrough in the U.S. last June with the acquisition of GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), doubled down on its strategy of spending big to grab market share as it reported its full-year results on Tuesday, convinced that it can fend off competition from the likes of Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats and Amazon-backed Deliveroo.
“The Company will continue to invest to drive further growth and market share gain, in line with the fourth quarter of 2020,” it said in a statement to the Stock Exchange.
The rest of the statement made it clear that it sees this as a necessity, rather than a preference.
“Only clear market leadership positions will lead to sufficient scale, high order density, and network effects which enable healthy Delivery margins in the long-run,” it added.
Coming a day after market sentiment dramatically improved towards loss-making companies with big ambitions in reinventing their sectors, the results were received more indulgently than they might otherwise have been: Just Eat Takeaway stock in Amsterdam rose 2.9% by late morning on the continent, making it one of the better performers in the sector, and in the region.
In fairness, the results had plenty to like: revenue growth was at the top end of expectations up 54% on the year, while the company’s preferred measure of basic underlying earnings rose 18% to 256 million euros, with margin improvements in three of its four biggest markets, Canada, Germany and the Netherlands.
The company’s delivery business, which is a relatively new addition to its core services, grew particularly strongly, thanks to the pandemic. Delivery orders more than doubled, and growth accelerated into the year end, up 163% year-on-year as Europe and North America ordered a fresh round of lockdowns.
The company said that deliveries, which now account for 26% of total orders (up from 18% in 2019), are bringing in more than they cost, but gave no further details.
However, the signs are that the growing share of delivery is going to put huge pressure on profitability, at least in the near term. Plowing money into its U.K. delivery business depressed the EBITDA margin to 30% from 42%. In Canada, where the business is 100% delivery, the EBITDA margin is only 11%. And this in a year when the business model enjoyed a unique tailwind from lockdowns.
Then there are the other costs of gaining scale. The company’s net loss widened to 151 million euros from 115 million the previous year due largely to over 100 million in costs arising from the merger of the U.K. business Just Eat with the Dutch business Takeaway, and then from the subsequent GrubHub takeover. The latter is expected to complete in June. The quest for scale is likely to require more acquisitions and generate more such costs.
As long as the market is rewarding growth over profitability, this shouldn’t matter too much. And, having fallen some 30% from its October peak, the stock is as due a bounce as any battered startup. All the same, the next nine months are set to be a stern test."
1265,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 05:55AM ET</span>",Inditex looks post-lockdown with 'optimistic' spring range,"By Victoria Waldersee
MADRID (Reuters) - Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) forecast healthy sales as soon as lockdowns are lifted, after the coronavirus crisis knocked its net profit to 1.1 billion euros ($1.31 billion) in 2020, a drop of 70% on the previous year.
Inditex said on Wednesday that it hoped that nearly all of its 6,829 shops worldwide would reopen by mid-April, with around 15% still closed due to COVID-19 restrictions as of March 8.
""As soon as the stores reopen, the level of sales becomes very healthy,"" Chairman Pablo Isla said on a conference call.
Zara's website shows a new collection rife with knitwear, bodysuits and baggy shirts for women and casual vests and jeans for men, suited to the continued working-from-home lifestyle. 
The spring collection was ""strong"" and ""bright"", Isla said, adding: ""It's full of bright colours, very optimistic.""
Excluding its five significant markets with stores still closed, Germany, Brazil, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Inditex said like-for-like sales in the first week of March grew 2%.
The impact of lockdowns was clear in the fourth quarter when net profit fell 53% to 435 million euros on sales of 6.3 billion euros, a steeper drop than the 26% in the third quarter, as restrictions came back into force across much of Europe.
Strong online sales, up 77% from the previous year, partly cushioned the company's performance, coupled with tight inventory management which Inditex said had enabled it serve customers from in-store stock.
Nevertheless, total sales for the year were down 28% to 20.4 billion euros, with a 25% drop in the fourth quarter at Inditex, which is the owner of eight brands including Massimo Dutti and Bershka as well as its flagship Zara. 
Although the results were worse than expected by analysts polled by Refinitiv, who expected a quarterly net profit of 602 million euros and full-year net profit of 1.3 billion, the Spanish retailer outperformed competitor H&M.
The Swedish clothing company, which is due to report December-January sales next week, posted an 88% profit drop in its results in January.
Inditex shares were down 0.72% at 1036 GMT.
'FULL OF BRIGHT COLOURS'
Clothing sales at Inditex's brands, as well as at H&M and Next, began to register a slow recovery by autumn last year from record lows when the COVID-19 pandemic first struck, boosted by online shopping and a quick rebound in China.
But in the United States and Europe, a return to pre-COVID sales has been frustrated by lockdowns extending well into 2021 and slow vaccine rollouts in many countries.
Some 30% of its stores were closed on Jan. 31, when Inditex's fiscal year ended, and 52% were under restrictions. 
Inditex said it had rolled out its radio frequency technology, attached as a chip to the alarm on clothing to keep track of stock, across all its brands this year, keeping inventory down 9% on the year despite rocky sales.
The company returned to its ordinary dividend policy of a 60% payout and bonus dividends to be paid in May and November 2021 after postponing its payment last year.
Inditex has so far closed 751 of the 1,200 stores it plans to shut by the end of the year in favour of flagship locations from which it can serve both online and in-person customers. 
Isla said it does not foresee closing a 'relevant' number of additional stores once these closures are completed.

The stock traded at $285.50 as of 4:43 a.m. in New York compared with Tuesday’s close of $246.90. Shares in other stocks favored by day traders, including AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc., retailer Express Inc. and headphone maker Koss Corp. also rose in premarket trading.
GameStop is back on the radar of retail investors as Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) Inc. founder and activist investor Ryan Cohen continues to shake up operations at the video-game retailer. The Grapevine, Texas-based company said Monday Cohen would lead a new committee focused on its digital transformation.
“It looks like the second wave of bullish speculation has clearly kicked off,” Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote, said by email. “Given the massive volatility in this stock, the risk is huge as the rally in the GME stock price is boosted by expectations of future growth, and is not based on concrete results for now.”
Retail investors’ Reddit-driven surge has kept its shares afloat despite the broader market’s recent volatility and tech selloff. Even so, GameStop remains far from its Jan. 28 intraday record of $483.
The frenzy has drawn U.S. regulators to consider adding rules for everything from options trading to short-selling. In letters to Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said they’re reviewing potential rules to fix regulatory gaps.

1268,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 05:21AM ET</span>","Analysis: With $1,400 stimulus checks set to hit bank balances, stocks could benefit","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A chunk of President Joe Biden's coronavirus relief package is poised to end up in the stock market and could provide a boost for GameStop (NYSE:GME) and other stocks embraced by individual investors active in online social media forums.
The relief package, which is on track to be signed into law later this week, is set to provide $400 billion in direct payments of $1,400 per person, helping individuals earning less than $80,000 annually and couples making less than $160,000. The government should be able to start delivering checks almost immediately once Congress finalizes the bill and Biden signs it.
“I do think that you will find a lot of that stimulus money will end up in the market, and I think if anything it’s a bullish catalyst,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW).
A  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) survey of 430 retail investors last month found that on average they plan to put 37% of any stimulus checks directly into equities.
At that rate, the amount from the latest package that could go into stocks ranges from $25 billion, if only traders with online accounts spend money on stocks, to as much as $150 billion, if all stimulus recipients spend their checks in the market in the same proportion, according to Deutsche Bank strategist Parag Thatte.
U.S. equity funds have been seeing near-record inflows of about $15 billion a month, ""so incremental flows stemming from stimulus payments can be sizable, especially if deployed quickly,"" Thatte said in an email.
Despite a recent pullback in stocks, including a 10% correction in the tech-heavy Nasdaq, the benchmark S&P 500 is near record highs and has climbed more than 70% from lows during the throes of the pandemic in March 2020. 
If stimulus payments do flow into the stock market, they could end up disproportionately going to GameStop or other stocks favored by retail investors active on social media platforms.
Frederick said that younger adults tend to be on the lower end of income brackets, and therefore more likely to be eligible to receive stimulus payments, and that younger investors are more inclined to invest in so-called ""meme stocks.""
Shares of GameStop were soaring to start the week, following news about the video game chain's e-commerce strategy, while other stocks favored by retail investors on forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets also were rallying.
There was some evidence of stimulus excitement among investors on social media platforms. On the popular WallStreetBets forum, an account called ""IwantSpaceX"" posted: ""Lets get our Stimmy checks IN!""
The stimulus payments could add fuel to interest from individual investors that has already been rising, with the COVID-19 pandemic leaving Americans with more time in front of their computers or on their smartphones.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists recently raised their 2021 net equity demand estimate from households from $100 billion to $350 billion, reflecting ""faster economic growth and higher interest rates than we had assumed previously, additional stimulus payments to individuals, and increased retail activity in early 2021.""
""We expect Households will be the largest source of equity demand this year,"" Goldman strategists said in a note.
Brokerage TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) saw nearly 1.76 million retail accounts opened during January through September of 2020, a record amount for the company for the first nine months of a year.

“People have time, people have interest and now they are actually starting to understand what it is they are investing in,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. ""You have really started to see an interest from the individual investor in a way that we have never seen before.""

1269,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 05:10AM ET</span>","Stocks rise after wild tech reboot, yields inch higher","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - World share markets inched higher on Wednesday after a stunning reboot in U.S. tech stocks, while the dollar and benchmark government yields both ticked up ahead of a key U.S. Treasury auction and inflation reading later.
But gains were subdued after Tuesday's 20% surge in electric car doyen Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), 4% jump in the Nasdaq and biggest one-day gain for global heavyweights Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in well over a month. 
Asia had bounced back from a two-month low as China's markets shrugged off their recent central bank policy tightening worries and Europe was helped early on by a new all-time high for Germany's DAX. 
The dollar and bond yields ticked up too. Traders were focused on the U.S. bond auction and inflation data later, as well as Thursday's European Central Bank meeting where it is expected to respond to the recent jump in borrowing costs. 
Mikhail Zverev, head of global equities at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors, said Tuesday's wild moves in big U.S. tech underscored how volatile markets, which are increasingly dominated by super-sized passive funds, are likely to be this year as the world tries to reset after the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The winds are blowing harder now. The world isn't a more dangerous place, a mild increase in interest rates is not a cataclysmic event... but there is now the big-herd mentality with a greater propensity for rotations,"" he said.
""They are moving more frequently, they are moving faster and they are leaving a trail of inefficiency,"" leaving markets vulnerable to big swings, he added.
Gains in Asian stocks overnight came after Chinese shares had fallen to their lowest levels since mid-December the previous day on the prospect of tighter policy and a slowing economic recovery.
News that a $1.9 trillion U.S. coronavirus relief package was nearing final approval had sparked a global spike in bond yields on Monday. That had pushed the Nasdaq more than 10% below its Feb. 12 closing high, confirming a correction for the index.
The yield on benchmark 10-year notes was at 1.540%, having peaked at 1.626% on Friday, after Tuesday's auction of $58 billion in U.S. 3-year notes was well received.
Yet, many market investors remained on edge, with the next tests of investor appetite for government debt due later this week in the form of 10-year and 30-year auctions.
""Although the bond market has steadied a bit, pressures will remain,"" said Naokazu Koshimizu, senior rates strategist at Nomura Securities.
""It has priced in future normalisation of the Fed's monetary policy, the Fed's policy becoming eventually neutral. But it has not yet priced in the chance of its policy becoming tighter.""
INFLATION PALPATIONS
Some investors see a real risk of an overheated U.S. economy and higher inflation on the back of the planned government spending boom. 
U.S. consumer price data due at 1330 GMT is expected to show a slight acceleration in the overall inflation in February, with analysts expecting further gains in coming months due to base effects from a severe economic downturn in early 2020.
The speedier rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in some countries and the planned U.S. stimulus package helped underpin a brighter global economic outlook, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said on Tuesday, as it raised its 2021 growth forecast.
In foreign exchange markets, the dollar was supported by expectations of faster U.S. economic recovery.
The euro eased as much 0.25% to $1.1871, not far from Tuesday's 3 1/2-month low of $1.18355. The yen changed hands at 108.70 per dollar, having hit a nine-month low of 109.235 set the previous day.
The Australian dollar shed 0.6% at one point to $0.7672 as well after the country's top central banker rebuffed market chatter about early rate increases. 
Oil prices, which have surged 30% since the start of the year, steadied meanwhile as concerns over a supply disruption in Saudi Arabia eased. 
Brent crude futures recovered from an overnight wobble to sit at $67.45 per barrel while U.S. crude futures hovered at $64.18 a barrel, after hitting a near 2 1/2-year high of $67.98 on Monday.
Precious metal gold eased 0.1% to $1,714.55 per ounce after rising more than 2% on Tuesday. 

""There's an element of corrective price action after a very spirited gold rebound,"" DailyFX currency strategist Ilya Spivak said.

1270,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 05:05AM ET</span>",Column: Dizzying rotations and inflation rapids,"By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - Whether we get an entrenched spiral or just an ephemeral price burst, a Spring of hair-raising inflation anxiety is proving notoriously hard for markets to price.
Spooked by a backup in long-term borrowing rates over the past month, which the Federal Reserve appears relaxed about despite protests from other central banks, investors have engaged in another dizzying and somewhat confusing rotation of stocks, sectors, regions and currencies this month. 
It's seen another swoon in expensive lockdown stars of the tech sector in favour of beaten down 'value' stocks in the energy, banking, industrials and even retail and travel sectors, as vaccine rollouts and monster U.S. government stimulus spur bets on a rapid and steep economic recovery.
Monday's price action was extraordinary. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended down 2.4% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained almost 1%. Euro zone stocks ended 2.5% higher, but emerging market equities skidded 2.3%.
Both the Nasdaq and MSCI's main emerging market stock index recorded technical 10% corrections from February peaks. 
The picture was more confusing as emerging markets had been seen in the 'value' camp until recently - but only as long as U.S. bond yields and the dollar kept falling. 
As those two pivotal bellwethers have backed up sharply, emerging clouds have gathered again and the sector now apes Big Tech instead.
Whether all this turns out to be a few days of scattergun trading or endures now hinges on a withering few months of heavily distorted inflation statistics - the bond market pricing around them and central bank reaction function as they emerge. 
As has been the case for most of the pandemic shock, 'duration', or interest rate sensitivity, is driving everything - stocks, bonds, regions and commodities. 
The 'long duration' quality of tech and 'growth' stocks, for example, stems from how current valuations of firms with expected cashflows far into the future are disproportionately affected by shifts in the discount rates used - typically bond yields. 
A flooring of global bond yields to near zero as COVID-19 shut the world economy last year was one key catalyst of the tech-led surge back to record highs and beyond by August.
But it also hinged on those low discount rates persisting for years. And that's where the looming inflation scare - however temporary - is upsetting the apple cart. 
Right now, markets can't yet decide comfortably whether the Fed and other central banks will remain as calm as they currently claim they will be about the coming inflation 'hump'.
Thanks mainly to base effects from a doubling of oil prices from last year's Spring shock, rebounding food and commodity prices, sales tax changes and supply bottlenecks as economies reopen, headline inflation rates could double from here to more than 3% this year before subsiding.
Forecasts show headline U.S. annual consumer prices already accelerating to pre-pandemic levels of 1.8% in February from 1.4% the previous month - and that's before many of the key base effects kick in from March and through the Spring.
INFLATION SURPRISE
Bond markets take some of that with a pinch of salt. Even if pricing sustained inflation as high as 2.50% on a 5-year view, inflation pricing subsides again to 2.20% over 10 years and 2.15% over a 30-year horizon.
For all the disruption this seems to be causing, these are hardly scary numbers historically, and 'core' rates stripping out all the noise will likely be closer to 2% all year.
Not only is that in line with official forecasts, the Fed is actually targetting 2-3% inflation for the period so it has some chance of meeting its 2% average inflation target over time.
Market unease is partly because 10-year Treasury yields of 1.6% still leave inflation-adjusted 'real' rates deeply negative over that horizon - to the tune of 0.65%. 
And that's even as the world's biggest economy is set to exceed pre-pandemic output projections as soon as this year, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) forecasts on Tuesday.
The other reason may be that investors are sceptical of forecasts.
""U.S. inflation releases this Spring will present a key test for market stability even if the consensus expects an acceleration in price pressures,"" wrote JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) strategist John Normand, adding that the rare periods since 2000 that inflation exceeded forecasts was during episodes when it was rising.
""Inflation forecasters are too conservative on the way up and on the way down,"" he said.
If so, it's not hard to see 10-year Treasury yields climbing another 50 basis points before really changing the picture a great deal. And that would certainly underline the ongoing duration wobble in equities as well as long-dated debt, which saw 30-year bond prices drop 8% over the past month.
The risk of an inflation accident also looks responsible for peculiarly aggressive Fed rate rise pricing too - where futures now show a quarter-point hike by the end of 2022 and two more during 2023. 
That's even as the Fed signals policy stasis until 2023 and current 3-year Treasury yields covering that time horizon still only yield 0.32%. What's more, the yield curve between 5 years and 30 years has slipped again to its flattest since January.
Something may have to give. Governments, not to mention antsy investors, hope the OECD version of events is correct. 

""Transitory factors that push up headline inflation do not warrant changes in the policy stance,"" its interim world economic report said.

(Reuters) - Europe's main index hovered near pre-pandemic highs on Wednesday, as a rise in shares of Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) after an upbeat sales forecast and gains in telecoms stocks outweighed losses in mining and travel sectors. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index edged 0.2% higher after a rally in technology stocks on Tuesday pushed the benchmark to its highest level since February 2020.
Miners, retailers, and travel and leisure companies led the declines in Europe, while telecoms jumped 1.0%.
German sportswear maker  Adidas AG  (DE:ADSGN) jumped 3.4% after it forecast a strong rebound in sales in 2021, particularly in China, the rest of Asia and Latin America following fourth-quarter results. 
European markets recorded a strong start to March, with the German DAX hitting an all-time high as investors snapped up so-called cyclical stocks like banks and oil firms on hopes of a strong economic rebound from the coronavirus crisis. 
However, trading has been volatile in recent weeks as government bond yields rose on concerns that central banks could begin tightening monetary policy as global economy recovers, raising borrowing costs.
""For the time being, these big intraday and day-by-day moves are probably to be expected until we see what inflation does genuinely look like after the recovery takes hold,"" said Edward Park, chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald.
Feeding into worries about fast price rises, data showed China's factory gate prices rose at the fastest pace since November 2018 in February.
""The question there is whether Chinese factories start passing on the increase in prices to global customers. You could have inflation being stoked from China, and coming on to the rest of the world,"" Park said.
Wall Street futures held steady ahead of key U.S. inflation data due at 1330 GMT and debt auctions that could help gauge the bond market's trajectory.

Just Eat Takeaway.com rose 1.8% after the food-ordering company said it expected further growth in 2021.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged largely higher Wednesday, helped by strong French economic data while investors digest a number of corporate releases.
At 4 AM ET (0900 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.5%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.1%, with mining stocks suffering from further weakness in base metals prices after the announcement of new anti-pollution policies in China.
French industrial production rose 3.3% on the month in January, a hefty jump from December’s fall of 0.7%. This will be music to the ears of the members of the European Central Bank, ahead of its monetary policy meeting on Thursday, particularly after Eurozone quarterly GDP was revised lower in the fourth quarter on Tuesday under the influence of lockdowns.
Although there are hopes that these lockdowns will be eased soon, the region will in all likelihood register a technical recession when the first quarter's GDP figures are released. This may put pressure on the ECB to increase its bond purchases, not least to head off the effects of a global rise in long-term interest rates..
In corporate news, Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) stock rose 3% after the German sportswear maker predicted a strong rebound in sales in 2021, particularly in China, although its operating profit will be trimmed by costs associated with divesting the Reebok brand.
Just Eat Takeaway (AS:TKWY) stock rose 2.4% after the food delivery company said it expected further growth in 2021, noting that orders were up 88% in the key U.K. market in the first two months of the year.
On the flip side,  Inditex  (MC:ITX) stock fell 1.7% after the Spanish fashion group, and owner of Zara, reported a 70% fall in 2020 net profit as the Covid-inspired global lockdowns kept many of its shops shut.
 Geberit  (SIX:GEBN) stock fell 1.5% after the Swiss company declined to give an outlook for 2021, citing uncertainties surrounding the pandemic. It still posted its highest ever free cash flow and proposed hiking its dividend.
Elsewhere, the U.S. House of Representatives is likely to pass the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill later Wednesday, allowing President Joe Biden to sign it into law by the weekend.
Oil prices were largely unchanged Wednesday, as traders wait for the official U.S. crude stocks from the Energy Information Administration are expected later Wednesday. Crude inventories rose by 12.8 million barrels in the week to March 5, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute.  
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $64.09 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract was flat at $67.52.  
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,711.30/oz, while EUR/USD traded unchanged at 1.1898.

A deal, which could also include the liquid egg white brand Egg Beaters and sausage product brand Odom's Tennessee Pride, could be valued at around $700 million, the people said. 
Any agreement, however, is likely weeks away and Conagra could end up keeping the business or selling it to someone else, the people told the financial newspaper.
Food companies are looking to reshape their portfolios as a pandemic-driven surge in at-home eating gives a boost to companies' balance sheets and revives sales of slower-growth brands, which they will use as tools to fetch better-than-normal valuations,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts wrote in a note in December. 
Conagra, in particular, might consider divesting some of its $1.0 billion in refrigerated brands due to its lack of scale in the refrigerated section and also because it wants to take advantage of a $680 million tax asset to offset capital gains that expires in 2021, the brokerage had said.
Hebrew National has been one of Conagra's top performing brands during the pandemic and has generated ""strong"" organic sales growth over the past two quarters.
Credit Suisse estimates that the brand brings in $200 million in sales annually, while Egg Beaters generates $45 million.
If a deal goes through, it will mark Chicago-based Conagra's third deal in the past six months. In September, the nearly $18 billion company sold its HK Anderson food business to UTZ Quality Foods LLC, and in December, it sold its Peter Pan peanut butter business to  Post Holdings  (NYSE:POST).

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Lego returned to double digit growth last year, as families locked down by the coronavirus stayed home to build models together, the Danish toymaker's CEO said.
Chief Executive Niels B. Christiansen said years of investment had paid off just in time for the pandemic, with an improved online sales system and new sets to build from plastic bricks, such as robots that can be programmed on a smartphone.
""COVID has accelerated trends that were already in motion. More people shopped online,"" he said. ""We've seen more families at home building together.""
Lego has been searching for years for a formula to revive a decade-long double digit growth streak that came to an end in 2017. That year the family-owned firm hit the reset button, bringing in Christiansen as CEO.
Sales last year grew 13% to 43.7 billion Danish crowns ($6.98 billion), up from 6% growth in 2019, while operating profit rose 19% to 12.9 billion crowns, Lego said in a statement. 
""For the past two years we've made large-scale investments in initiatives designed to support long-term growth,"" Christiansen said.
""In 2020, we began to see the benefits of these, especially in e-commerce and product innovation."" 
Lego would hire ""several hundred"" employees to boost digitalisation further in 2021, Christiansen told Reuters. 
He declined to say how much online sales grew last year, but said the number of visitors on Lego.com doubled to more than a quarter billion in a year.
Rival toy maker Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), behind the Barbie brand, in February reported 2% annual net sales growth for 2020, while Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS), the maker of Monopoly, saw net revenue decline 8% for the year.
Christiansen said Lego gained around 1 percentage point of market share globally, picking up in most of its markets. 
The firm also increased its number of physical stores by 134, including 91 new outlets in China, its biggest growth market. The company expects to open 120 stores in 2021, 80 of those in China.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Wednesday, struggling to maintain the momentum seen on Wall Street overnight amid worries of a slowing economic recovery.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.3% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.8%.
On Tuesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 3.7% to post its best day on Wall Street since November, as investors poured back into popular growth names after a recent pullback. 
However, this surge has failed to translate into any serious gains in Asia, with Chinese shares marginally higher after they had fallen to their lowest levels since mid-December the previous day, while in Europe the tone is one of caution ahead of Thursday’s meeting of the European Central Bank.
Eurozone quarterly GDP was revised down to -0.7% in the fourth quarter on Tuesday from the preliminary reading of -0.6% despite stronger growth from Germany, as the lockdowns across the euro area weighed on growth.
Although there are hopes that these lockdowns will be eased soon, the region will in all likelihood register a technical recession when the first quarter GDP figures are released. This puts pressure on the ECB, particularly with European bond yields edging higher, potentially resulting in tightening financial conditions.
Adding to concerns is a diplomatic spat between the U.K. and the European Union after Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, claimed the U.K. had banned all Covid-19 vaccine exports, something vehemently denied by the British government.
EU leaders have been under pressure over the slow rollout of Covid-19 vaccines on the continent, compared with the UK, where a third of the adult population have now received their first dose.
Elsewhere, the U.S. House of Representatives is likely to pass the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill later Wednesday, allowing President Joe Biden to sign it into law by the weekend.
In corporate news, German sportswear maker Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) has predicted a strong rebound in sales in 2021, particularly in China, although its operating profit will be trimmed by costs associated with divesting the Reebok brand.
Earnings also come from the likes of fashion group  Inditex  (MC:ITX), sanitary products manufacturer  Geberit  (SIX:GEBN), security services group  G4S  (CSE:G4S) and construction group Balfour Beatty (OTC:BAFYY). 
Oil prices weakened Wednesday, falling back from recent highs after an industry report showed a jump in U.S. oil stocks last week.
Crude inventories rose by 12.8 million barrels in the week to March 5, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute. Official figures from the Energy Information Administration are expected later Wednesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 1% lower at $63.36 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.1% to $66.77.  
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,712.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1875.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Wednesday it will exempt business people working to secure supply of auto chips from two-week COVID-19 quarantine requirements and prioritise the vaccination of people key to auto chip procurement.
The move comes as South Korea tries to limit the damage from a chip shortage that has plagued global automakers and forced production cuts worldwide, including at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors (NYSE:GM). Germany and the United States have also ramped up efforts to resolve the shortage.
South Korea's leading automaker Hyundai Motor has so far kept factories running, but a Hyundai union official told Reuters on Tuesday that overtime production of less-popular models had stopped and production schedules were changing from week to week.
Although the domestic auto industry's situation was good compared to international rivals, ""concerns about future production disruptions have increased"", the government said in a statement.
Chip production capacity could not be increased quickly, with 98% of auto chips used by South Korean automakers coming from abroad, it added.
To help deal with the shortage, Koreans and foreigners involved in auto chip imports or production would no longer have to quarantine for two weeks on arrival in the country from abroad, starting April.
COVID-19 vaccinations would be available for people departing for essential purposes such as purchasing and procuring auto chips.

The government also said it would speed up performance evaluations of auto chip components and modules developed by domestic companies.

LONDON (Reuters) - The world's biggest asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) told clients on Wednesday that 17% of the 2 trillion euros ($2.4 trillion) in assets it manages covered by new EU environmental, social and governance rules are classed as sustainable.
However, 70% of the funds launched or repositioned in Europe this year should meet the new threshold, it told clients in a memo seen by Reuters, part of its drive to be a regional market leader in sustainable finance.
“Our ambition is to move more money into sustainable products than any other asset manager in Europe,” Thomas Fekete, head of BlackRock Sustainable Investing for EMEA, told Reuters.
The European Union's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), the first part of which goes live today, aims to harmonise standards and increase transparency in the growing market for sustainable financial products.
By forcing investors to be clear about how they assess environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues such as corporate carbon emissions, policymakers hope to stamp out 'greenwashing', where lofty sustainability claims are not backed up by action.
BlackRock, which manages around $8.7 trillion globally, said SFDR would boost demand for sustainable products in Europe, as more investors look to capture the opportunity created by the global transition to a low-carbon economy.
""We welcome SFDR as a catalyst for accelerating sustainability in Europe,"" said Christian Hyldahl, BlackRock's co-head of continental Europe.
Funds will need to be classed as either Article 9, 8 or 6 - fully focused on sustainable objectives; fully or partly focused on environmental, social or sustainability issues; or not focused on sustainability.
BlackRock said some 332 billion euros' worth of the assets that fall under the scope of SFDR - including both retail funds and bespoke mandates for larger clients - would be classed as either article 8 or 9 on day one.
In a sign of growing client demand for sustainable finance, those funds took in 74% of actively managed flows and 38% of index-tracking flows in 2020, or nearly 70 billion euros, the memo said. 
While the bulk of its assets - much of which are held via vanilla exchange-traded funds - are not classed as sustainable, BlackRock said it was reviewing its flagship European fund ranges and hoped to provide sustainable alternatives for clients.
Over time, it hoped to ""provide a transition opportunity"" for more than 50% of the assets currently held in the mainstream funds.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up Wednesday morning, continuing gains made during the previous session after Nasdaq 100 recorded its biggest gains since November 2020.
China’s Shanghai Composite jumped 0.80% by 10:11 PM ET (3:11 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.63%. Inflation data released earlier in the day showed that February’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) grew 0.6% month-on-month while contracting 0.2% year-on-year. February’s Producer Price Index grew 1.7% year-on-year.
The focus on China continued after shares slumped on Tuesday, with state efforts to curb losses unsuccessful and the benchmark Shanghai Composite index standing on the brink of a correction. Investors also digested the prospect of tighter policy and slowing economic recovery.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.73%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.28% and South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.31%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.21%.
Nasdaq 100’s climb upwards cut the earlier rotation into value shares, after the U.S. House of Representatives voted to take up a $1.9 trillion stimulus package bill on Tuesday and COVID-19 vaccine rollouts continue.
The vote clears the way for the chamber to consider the bill on Wednesday, where it is expected to pass. With the Senate already passing the bill earlier in the week, the bill is expected to become law by the end of the week.
Treasury yields continued to be a point of focus, as they hovered below recent peaks after the first batch of auctions earlier in the week went smoothly. This pullback in yields allowed risk-takers to turn back towards growth stocks, which have recently taken a hit due to valuation concerns.
Yields have been climbing along with economic growth expectations, New York Life Investment portfolio strategist Lauren Goodwin told Bloomberg. That backdrop still favors cyclicals over defensive assets and “supports equities over bonds, and a weaker U.S. dollar,” she added.
An upcoming auction of ten and 30-year bonds will test investor appetite for the safest debt after February’s poorly bid seven-year auction drove yields higher and adversely impacted risk assets globally.
In Australia, bond yields also continued a move downward after Reserve Bank of Australia governor Philip Lowe suggested earlier in the day that markets may be getting ahead of themselves by pricing in an earlier interest-rate increase.
In Europe, the European Central Bank will hand down its monetary policy on Thursday. The U.S. also releases its core CPI for February later in the day.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Swiss bank  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) has appointed receivers to recover a bridging loan of about $140 million made to a Greensill company in Australia, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Receivers from McGrathNicol have been appointed to attempt to recover the loan from Greensill Capital Pty Ltd after it filed for insolvency protection in London and in Australia on Monday, the people said. The sources did not want to be named as they were not authorised to comment publicly. 
Representatives for Credit Suisse and McGrathNicol declined to comment. Greensill representatives did not return calls seeking comment.
Greensill began to unravel last week when a key insurer stopped providing credit insurance on $4.1 billion of debt in portfolios it had created for clients, including Credit Suisse.
Credit Suisse was also advising Greensill on a potential IPO last year and had lent it the $140 million on expectations the loan be repaid when the company listed, one of the people said. 
Greensill said in court documents earlier this week that it was facing ""defaults"" from its key customer, the GFG Alliance, which is controlled by Indian-British steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta.
Greensill, whose major operations are in the U.K. but is still registered in its founder Lex Greensill's hometown city of Bundaberg in Queensland Australia, also said it would be unable to repay the loan to Credit Suisse.
Grant Thornton, appointed administrator of Greensill, has agreed in principle to sell Greensill's intellectual property and technology for processing client payments to U.S. private equity group Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc. for $60 million, the court filing said.

Bloomberg News on Wednesday, however, reported the talks had paused, citing unnamed sources.

(Reuters) - Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc surged nearly 20% on Tuesday, rebounding from a deep selloff with its largest daily gain in a year after data showed an increase in China sales and an analyst raised his rating on the stock.
The jump, which added over $100 billion to Tesla's market capitalization, stopped a five-day streak of losses for the company in a Nasdaq slump in which investors spooked by rising interest rates have abandoned growth stocks with heady valuations.
New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu raised his Tesla rating to ""buy"" from ""neutral,"" and upped his target price to $900 from $578. 
Tesla's stock ended at $673.58 after its strongest daily rise since February 2020. The stock remains down more than 20% from its January record high. 
Traders exchanged nearly $43 billion worth of Tesla shares, more than any other stock and almost triple the second most-traded company, which was Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), according to Refinitiv data. 
""As much as the market severely corrected the recent excesses of optimism reflected in Tesla’s valuation, our recent work strengthened our confidence about the solid outlook for the company in the next two years,"" Ferragu wrote in a client note.
Tesla sold 18,318 China-made vehicles in February, up from 15,484 in January, Chinese auto industry body CPCA said.
Cathie Wood, whose $25 billion ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund is the largest actively managed ETF tracked by Lipper, said on a webcast that she saw the recent stock market selloff as a buying opportunity, the Financial Times reported. https://www.ft.com/content/e254c060-a0ac-41e9-a403-065f104a0ad2 Tesla is the largest holding of ARK Innovation, which is popular with retail investors. The ARK Innovation fund was up 10% on Tuesday. 
Tesla's stock remains up about 70% over the past six months. Thirteen analysts have neutral ratings on Tesla, while 12 recommend buying and 10 recommend selling, according to Refinitiv.

Tuesday's Tesla rally accompanied a 3.7% jump in the Nasdaq, as U.S. bond yields retreated and investors picked up battered technology stocks. Tesla was the biggest contributor to the 1.4% gain in the S&P 500, which it joined in December.

(Reuters) -  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) on Tuesday outlined a plan to expand oil and gas production through 2025, but without spending significantly more, and pledged to limit the pace of growth of its carbon emissions.
Falling energy demand due to pandemic-driven lockdowns sent the industry into a tailspin in 2020 and led Chevron to a $5.54 billion annual loss, its first since 2016.
Investors have been pressuring Chevron and other oil companies to hold spending flat and reduce emissions that contribute to climate change. Competitors Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), BP (NYSE:BP) Plc and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) have vowed to hold output flat or allow it to decline to meet climate or financial goals.
Chief Executive Officer Michael Wirth told analysts in a presentation on Tuesday that Chevron can achieve its output and carbon goals regardless of oil price fluctuations. 
""We're not betting on higher prices to bail us out,"" he said in an apparent dig at Exxon and others counting on oil's rebound to cover dividends and debt repayments. By 2025, Chevron can more than double its return on capital employed, a measure of how efficiently a company invests, to more than 10%. 
Still, some analysts were unimpressed with the climate and emissions goals, viewing them as too modest. Shares dipped a fraction from a one-year high to $109.50. 
A forecast of $25 billion in free cash flow through 2025 after dividends and project outlays is ""underwhelming,"" said Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. 
The carbon intensity goals ""lag the industry average"" and ""focus on its controllable elements"" rather than building new business lines,"" that could contribute to profits, he added.
The goal of investing about 2% of overall project spending on lower carbon emissions, indicates Chevron is not pivoting its underlying operations, said Pavel Molchanov, analyst at Raymond James.
Other oil majors have outlined plans to invest in renewable energy and carbon capture and storage.
Still, Chevron said through 2025 it would fix annual capital outlays at around $14 billion and increase oil and gas output by about 3.5% on a compound annual basis. 
It plans to beef up investments through 2025 in the Permian basin of Texas and New Mexico, the top U.S. shale field, as costs of a major expansion in Kazakhstan decrease.
Overall, it aims to boost output to around 3.5 million barrels of oil and gas per day (mbpd) by 2025, from about 2.98 mbpd last year. Permian production could reach 1 million barrels per day.
Chevron will be the largest player in the Permian basin with a ""wide margin on production volumes over ExxonMobil, roughly 40% greater,"" said Peter McNally, analyst at Third Bridge.
Its climate focus includes a 35% reduction in its carbon emissions rate per unit of production by 2028. Routine flaring of natural gas, a contributor to climate warming, will halt by 2030, officials said. 
The intensity target is less ambitious than rivals that look to reduce absolute emissions of carbon gases. Releases overall can increase if production rises, and Chevron failed to set a net zero emissions target like European and some U.S. peers.
Chevron is on a ""pathway toward net zero"" emissions, Wirth said on Tuesday, but added that technology breakthroughs, carbon markets and policy changes are needed. 
""We'll make more specific commitments as time unfolds,"" he said.

Chevron, which acquired  Noble Energy  (NASDAQ:NBL) during last year's market lows, raised to $600 million its expected cost savings from the deal, helping lower operating expenses 10% this year compared with 2019.

1289,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 05:50PM ET</span>",Three U.S. lawmakers call on USPS to freeze Oshkosh vehicle contract,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three U.S. House lawmakers introduced legislation on Tuesday calling on the U.S. Postal Service to freeze Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) Corp's $482 million contract that would finalize production of the next-generation postal vehicles until the deal can be reviewed.
Representative Marcy Kaptur, the chair of an appropriations subcommittee, and fellow Democrats Jared Huffman and Tim Ryan urged a halt pending an investigation into whether there was any political influence in awarding the contract and if it is consistent with President Joe Biden's executive order to electrify the federal fleet.
Last month, the USPS rejected a bid from Ohio-based Workhorse Group for an all-electric delivery fleet. Oshkosh did not immediately comment. Workhorse, whose shares rose 5.5% on Tuesday, declined to comment.
Huffman separately introduced legislation on Monday cosponsored by 18 other House Democrats to provide $6 billion to the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to buy tens of thousands of additional electric delivery vehicles and charging stations.
""Why would you put us back on that treadmill? You are going to have built these vehicles for obsolescence,"" Huffman told Reuters on Tuesday. ""They will be the last vehicles running on fossil fuels on the road. It's insane.""
Huffman said he has been unable to view USPS's contract with Oshkosh for the delivery vehicles.
Huffman's bill would require at least 75% of the new fleet be electric or zero-emission vehicles.
Last month, the USPS said it was committed to having electric vehicles make up 10% of its next-generation fleet as part of its multibillion-dollar plan to retire its 30-year-old delivery vehicles. USPS said it could boost that percentage if it received billions of dollars in government assistance.
""With the right level of support, the majority of the Postal Service’s fleet can be electric by the end of the decade,"" USPS said on Monday.

In January, Biden vowed to replace the U.S. government’s fleet of roughly 650,000 vehicles with electric models.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq gaining about 4% to recoup heavy losses from the previous session as U.S. bond yields retreated and investors scooped up battered technology stocks.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc jumped the most in almost a year, while Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) posted the biggest single-day gains in five weeks. The tech stars suffered sharp losses in recent weeks as rising yields raised concerns over their high valuations.
The Nasdaq posted its biggest single-day rise since Nov. 4. The Dow set a record intraday high but pulled back from earlier gains at the close. 
News that a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package was nearing final approval sparked a spike in yields on Monday, pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq to end more than 10% below its Feb. 12 closing high, confirming a correction for the index.
U.S. 10-year Treasury note yields eased to as low as 1.523% after hovering near 13-month highs of 1.613% on Monday. Longer-dated yields have jumped over the last month as investors price in a faster rebound and higher inflation that expected at the start of the year.
The market is adjusting to the new level in interest rates, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York. 
Companies whose products and services are in demand when the economy is doing well, known as cyclicals, and small-cap stocks will outperform this year, she said. Tech will end the year higher but not be the leader as it was in the past year's rally.
""Today the 10-year is down a bit, and that takes pressure off valuations, so tech is performing well,"" Hooper said. ""The market is just about getting comfortable at this level of rates.""
Rising rates disproportionately hurt high-growth tech companies because they are valued on earnings expected years into the future rather than profits earned in the short term.
""Potential headwind for the market is (when) interest rates rise further from this point over the short period ... since they have risen too fast in too little time,"" said Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 30.3 points, or 0.10%, to 31,832.74, the S&P 500 gained 54.09 points, or 1.42%, to 3,875.44 and the Nasdaq Composite added 464.66 points, or 3.69%, to 13,073.83.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.88 billion shares, compared to the 15.25 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
The rise in Treasury yields has accelerated a rotation from ""stay-at-home"" winners to stocks primed to benefit from the economy's reopening, setting the blue-chip Dow on pace to end at a record high on Tuesday.
While the Russell 2000 growth index jumped 3.3% on Tuesday, compared to a 0.1% rise in Russell 2000 value index, it has sharply underperformed its value counterpart since the start of the month.
Shares of Tesla rebounded 19.6% from a deep sell-off that pushed shares down 37% from its peak in January to Monday. It was the largest percentage gainer on both the S&P and the Nasdaq 100.
The global economic outlook has brightened as vaccine rollouts gain speed and the United States launches a massive new stimulus package, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development said, hiking its 2021 growth forecasts.
The Democrat-controlled U.S. House of Representatives will take up the relief bill on Wednesday, with the chamber's expected approval leading to President Joe Biden's signing the legislation into law later this week.
The bank index fell 1.7% after vaulting to a new 14-year peak. Economy-linked financials, materials and industrials hovered near record highs.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) also rallied 26.9%, building on Monday's gain of over 40% on the video retailer's e-commerce strategy and speculation that small investors will pour stimulus checks into markets.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.78-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.83-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 240 new highs and 17 new lows.

The Nasdaq Composite jumped 3.7%. The {169|Dow Jones Industrial Average}} rose 0.10%, or 30 points, though had hit a intraday record of 32,150.32, and the S&P 500 rose 1.36%, 
Mega-cap tech stocks were back in favor following an 11% correction in three weeks as U.S. rates fell after the bond prices, which trade inversely to yields, hit oversold levels.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com were sharply higher.
The upswing in tech stocks has sparked debate about whether the reprieve in growth stocks has staying power, or is merely a relief rally that will soon peter out. From a technical perspective, the rally in tech has more to go, according to Janney's Technical Strategist and Associate Director of Research at Janney Montgomery Scott. ""For now, the liquidity-fueled BTD [buy the dip] remains in place- and we would expect more follow-through on this tech rally over the short-run.""
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which was down about 40% since its recent selloff, was up more than 19%, riding fresh investor appetite for growth stocks and signs the electric vehicle maker is winning market share China.
""Early this morning the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) released its February numbers which showed a snapback in demand for Tesla in this key region,"" Wedbush said in a note. ""For February, Tesla delivered 18.3k vehicles during the month which were up 18% from January and appear to be on a strong trajectory into March in our opinion,"" it added. 
Beyond tech, consumer discretionary stocks were sharply higher as investors bet on wave of consumer spending to come as U.S. households’ bank accounts will get another boost from the $1.9 trillion fiscal relief bill expected to signed into law before mid-March.
Cyclical stocks, which have assumed the leadership role in the broader market, gave up gains, with financials, industrials and energy trading lower.
Energy was the biggest decliner as oil prices continued to retreat following a 22% rally in February. Still, the pullback in oil prices is expected to be temporary on a snapback in fuel demand as the economy reopens.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+ streaming service has signed up more than 100 million paying subscribers around the world in its first 16 months, Chief Executive Bob Chapek said at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday.
Chapek also said Disney hopes to reopen its California theme parks to limited attendance in late April. The parks were closed a year ago due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
California officials set guidelines that would allow for theme parks in the state to reopen as soon as April 1. Chapek said it would take a few weeks to call back 10,000 furloughed employees to its two theme parks at Disneyland Resort in Anaheim and train them in new virus safety procedures.
In addition, Disney might be able to resume some cruise ship operations in the fall, Chapek said.
Disney was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic as theme parks and movie theaters were forced to shut down, but it has impressed Wall Street with the growth of Disney+, which debuted in November 2019. 
The company is hoping for a comeback at cinemas this year. It currently is holding firm to plans to release Marvel movie ""Black Widow"" in movie theaters on May 7, Chapek said.
Asked if he might replace Kathleen Kennedy, president of ""Star Wars"" studio Lucasfilm, Chapek said he looked forward to her running that unit ""for many years to come."" Some fans disliked the storylines of recent ""Star Wars"" movies and have argued for a new leader.
The company also aims to reinstate dividend payments, which were suspended during the pandemic, ""at some point"" in the future, Chapek said. 
Chapek and nine others were re-elected to the company's board of directors, according to preliminary vote tallies announced at the meeting, which was held online. They include Executive Chairman Bob Iger, who previously said he will retire from Disney at the end of 2021.
In an advisory vote, 68% of ballots cast supported Disney executives' compensation. 

The company's shares, which hit a record high of $203 on Monday, were down 2.9% at $196.04 on Tuesday afternoon.

Investing.com -- Tech roared back to dominate the market action on Tuesday -- welcome back those investors who like to buy the dip.
NASDAQ Composite traded more than 4% higher and momentum stocks were in high demand. Among the day’s winners were Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA),  Peloton Interactive Inc  (NASDAQ:PTON), and  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME).
Interest rates that had been pressuring tech giants took a breather on Tuesday as optimism about the $1.9 trillion stimulus lifted everything from tech to retail.
The price of both Crude Oil WTI Futures and Brent Oil Futures crude oil pulled back more than 1% each as demand concerns eased. Industry data on last week’s oil stockpiles is due out after the market close, while the government’s own weekly reading comes out Wednesday morning. 
Expectations are for a crude inventory build of 816,000 barrels after the massive 21 million barrel build the previous week.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Tesla takes back some of its losses
Tesla was the best performing stock in the S&P 500 on Tuesday, jumping 20% as it retraced some of the declines it has seen in recent trading sessions. New Street put a buy rating on the stock with a $900 price target, adding an optimistic view to a stock that was already on the rebound.
Still, Tesla faces challenges, including an admission that its level-2 autonomous driving software really doesn’t allow for autonomous driving. But at least its $1.5 billion investment in bitcoin last month is on an upswing.
2. Bitcoin also retraces decline
Speaking of Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency climbed on Tuesday as Nasdaq rebounded and the momentum trade went back on. Investors in crypto have pushed bitcoin above $54,000 and it surged 5% during the day to regain its $1 trillion market value. As more mainstream companies like Tesla embrace bitcoin as an inflation hedge, expect the price to remain elevated.
At the same time, the traditional store of value, Gold Futures regained 2% in afternoon trading, above $1,700 an ounce, after being pressured in recent days. 
3. Chip makers are back
Semiconductors are rebounding after chip shortages forced manufacturers like car makers slow production. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SMH)is up 6% on Tuesday. Of its three biggest holdings, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) was up 2.3%, while NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped 7%. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) shares were up more than 4%.

1296,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 02:45PM ET</span>",Exclusive: LG hopes to make new battery cells for Tesla in 2023 in U.S. or Europe - sources,"By Hyunjoo Jin
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - LG Energy Solution aims to build advanced battery cells for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc electric vehicles in 2023 and is considering potential production sites in the United States and Europe, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
Tesla has not yet agreed to a deal that would expand LG's role in its supply chain beyond China, one of the sources said.
Last week, the Korean battery maker told Korean reporters it plans to build a U.S. factory where it would make battery cells for EVs and energy storage systems, to cater to U.S. and global customers as well as startups. It did not identify potential customers then, but one of the sources said it was hoping Tesla would buy the batteries. 
In September, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk announced an ambitious plan to develop new cells in-house, prompting suppliers like LG and Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) to embrace the unproven technology or face risks of losing a major customer for the longer term. 
The Korean supplier, a unit of LG Chem, has made samples for the so-called 4680 large-format cylindrical cells, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. It faces technological hurdles and the challenge of scaling up production, people familiar with the matter said.
""LG plans to produce 4680 cells at its new U.S. factory. They plan to build a new 4680 cell line to supply Tesla's Giga Berlin in Europe,"" one of the sources said, adding Spain is one of candidate for the European plant. 
One of the sources said LG has never mass produced such large-format cylindrical cells, although increasing battery capacity is the correct call. ""Tesla is a major customer, and LG can take risks,"" another source said. 
He said LG has not yet secured orders from Tesla for the 4680 cells, still under development. For now, Tesla is sharply boosting orders for 2170 cells used in the Model 3 and Model Y vehicles made in China, the source said. 
LG declined to comment, and Tesla officials could not be reached for comment.
Tesla's September plan to develop the new 4680 battery cells is meant to reduce production costs, improve battery performance and increase driving range. This would help with Tesla's push to boost electric vehicle production significantly around the world.
Tesla is running a pilot factory for the new battery cells in California, and preparing to build those cells at newer plants in Texas and Germany.
Musk said recently Tesla is in talks with battery suppliers about developing 4680 batteries. He said Tesla will use the current cells for at least a few years, but will ""retire"" those cells over time. 
LG currently supplies smaller cells to Tesla in China, as does Chinese battery maker CATL. Panasonic has partnered with Tesla in a $5 billion battery ""gigafactory"" near Reno, Nevada.
LG currently has a $2.3 billion joint venture with General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) in Lordstown, Ohio, to make pouch-type electric vehicle batteries for future GM electric vehicles.
GM said separately it is considering building a second U.S. battery factory with LG.
The unusually candid comments from LG and GM came after another Korean battery supplier, SK Innovation, hopes the White House would overturn a recent U.S. trade ruling favoring LG, saying it threatens to disrupt battery supplies to Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p). 
Tesla rival Lucid Motors, which has a multi-year supply deal with LG Chem, and is considering whether to make its own cells in house, said it is interested in different cell formats, Chief Executive Officer Peter Rawlinson earlier told Reuters. 
Panasonic plans to start a test line for 4680 cells in Japan in the business year beginning April 1, according to a person familiar with the matter. The two companies have not said if they plan to collaborate on production of the 4680 cells.

Tesla may need to push out the timeframe for mass production, or work with partners at its newer plants in order to get cell production up and running quickly, said Caspar Rawles, an analyst at researcher Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

1301,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 01:05PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Salesforce's Taylor emerges as CEO candidate - sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) is grooming its chief operating officer Bret Taylor for a chief executive position to support the U.S. business software conglomerate's co-founder Marc Benioff, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. 
The sources said Taylor's potential promotion is not imminent and could happen in the coming months. 
Salesforce's previous co-chief executive, Keith Block, stepped down last year, leaving Benioff without a formal co-pilot at a time when the San Francisco-based company is battling  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) in the booming business software market.
Competition intensified after work-from-home arrangements surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, driving corporate demand for technology tools to collaborate and process data.
While Benioff accepted a co-CEO arrangement with Block, he may relinquish his CEO title for an executive chairman role when Taylor is promoted, the sources said. There is apprehension about opting for co-CEOs again given the challenges of delineating responsibilities for these roles, one of the sources added. 
A co-creator of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google Maps, Taylor is a Stanford University-trained engineer credited with devising  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)'s ""like"" button as the social media giant's chief technology officer. 
No decision has been made, the sources said. The preparations are a recognition of Taylor's contributions to the company, they added.
Colleagues described Taylor as an unassuming executive focused on developing new products. He was a key driving force behind Salesforce's biggest acquisition, its $27.7 billion takeover of workspace messaging platform Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) Inc, as well as deals for software companies Tableau and Mulesoft, one of the sources said.
The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Salesforce declined to comment. Taylor did not immediately respond to request for comment. 
Since joining Salesforce five years ago after the company acquired his start-up Quip for $750 million, Taylor has helped tackle thorny technical and product issues, integrating its various sales, marketing, e-commerce and customer service tools that run on different back-end databases. 
For example, Taylor spearheaded a system dubbed ""Customer 360"" with various software tools that allow clients to track their own customers.
""He's Parker 2.0,"" said one of the sources, referring to co-founder and director Parker Harris, who led Salesforce's early technology and product development and is still involved in strategic planning.
Taylor served as Salesforce's product chief before becoming chief operating officer in 2019. One of his biggest challenges will be to weave Slack into Salesforce's other cloud applications to compete with Microsoft's messaging service Teams, the sources said. 
Block became Salesforce's first and only co-CEO to date in 2018. He stepped down 18 months later but remained an advisor to Benioff. A former Oracle sales executive, Block helped Salesforce land several $100-million-plus contracts.
Benioff, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $8.5 billion, has expanded his reach beyond Salesforce in recent years, acquiring Time Magazine and supporting philanthropic efforts aimed at improving the San Francisco Bay Area. 

During the pandemic he has also spent more time working from Hawaii, where he has maintained a home for decades, the sources said.

Investing.com - The SPDR® S&P Retail ETF (NYSE:XRT) jumped more than 4%, breaching the $90 level on hopes the proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus will boost consumer spending. 
The retailer-focused fund, the largest in its category, has total assets of $620 million and carries a 12-month yield of 0.8%, according to Morningstar.    
The stimulus, being pushed by President Joe Biden's administration, is expected to become a law next week. Once signed, it will send $1,400 checks to those qualified by income. Investors see the beneficiaries spending a part of the money at retail stores.
Shares of retailers were up too. (NASDAQ:COST) was up 1.9% at $317.50, giving the (NYSE:WMT) rival a market cap of $140.54 billion. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer itself was up 1.3% at $129. The Sam Walton-founded company has a market cap of $366.81 billion.
The stocks were up as the broader market hummed, too. Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1% and S&P 500 2% as tech stocks and (NASDAQ:TSLA) rebounded with a vengeance on easing concerns over yields. XBR/USD trended lower, down 1% at just around $68 a barrel and below its recent peak of $71.38.

It became the second Texas electricity company to take the step in the face of extraordinary electricity charges during the cold snap.
Last week, Texas' largest and oldest electric power cooperative, Brazos Electric Power Cooperative Inc, filed for bankruptcy protection in Houston, citing a disputed $1.8 billion debt to the state's grid operator.
Just Energy said on Tuesday it expects to receive a loan that would enable it to pay the state's grid operator more than $250 million for power. It would be unable to cover the bill without the loan.
Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the grid operator, said on Tuesday it expects $2.48 billion in payment for power provided during the week-long freeze. Just Energy does not appear on the list of companies ERCOT said were behind on payments as of March 3.
Just Energy in February raised doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern, saying increased demand for electricity and rolling blackouts in Texas forced it to balance power supply at very high clearing prices.
Electricity prices in Texas soared last month as utilities scrambled to meet a surge in heating demand during the historic winter storm.
Canada's Innergex Renewable Energy and Algonquin Power & Utilities (NYSE:AQN) Corp, operating in the area, have also said they expected losses related to wind farms.
Just Energy said all services to customers across the Ontario-based company's North American operations will continue without interruption and there will be no impact on customers' bills or daily operations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday approved  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn)'s $1.5 billion settlement to resolve a U.S. government probe into the German automaker's use of undisclosed software that allowed excess diesel pollution to be emitted by 250,000 of its vehicles in the United States.
The settlement with the U.S. Justice Department and California Air Resources Board, which was announced in September, includes an $875 million civil penalty levied under the Clean Air Act, $70 million in additional penalties and $546 million to fix the polluting vehicles and offset excess emissions, court papers show.
U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan called the California settlement fair, reasonable and in the public interest, and noted settlement talks lasted for more than three years.
As part of the settlement, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) will pay California $285.6 million.
The German company has separately agreed to a $700 million settlement with diesel vehicle owners. That settlement has won preliminary approval and is likely to get final approval this summer, said Steve Berman, a lawyer for the owners. 
In December, the Justice Department said the settlement ensured Daimler would ""repair around 250,000 vehicles at no cost to consumers"" and fully address excess air pollution.""
Diesel vehicles have come under scrutiny in the United States since Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) admitted in 2015 to installing secret software on 580,000 U.S. vehicles that allowed them to emit excess emissions.
In 2019, Daimler agreed to pay a 870 million-euro ($1.03 billion) fine in Germany for violating diesel emissions regulations.
Both Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Daimler halted sales of U.S. passenger diesel vehicles.
Fiat Chrysler, which is now part of Stellantis NV, reached an $800 million settlement in 2019 to resolve claims by regulators and owners that it used illegal software that produced false results on diesel-emissions tests.

Stellantis said last week in a securities filing that it remains in talks to resolve an ongoing U.S. Justice Department criminal probe, and previously set aside 200 million euros ($238 million) to address the issue.

GameStop shares were up 23.5% to $239.80 in early trading, a day after the company entrusted leadership of its online sales efforts to board member and major shareholder Ryan Cohen, co-founder of online pet retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) Inc. 
The resurgent rally lifted other stocks favored by retail investors on forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets. Market watchers have cited the U.S. Senate’s passage of a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill including $1,400 direct payments to Americans as one catalyst.
Once the aid bill is finalized and signed into law, the U.S. government should be able to start delivering $1,400 checks quickly, tax experts said.
Since January, GameStop shares have had several wild swings, one of the hottest meme stocks followed on social media.
Shares of AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) another popular bet among retail investors, were recently up around 5%, headphone maker Koss Corp climbed 1% and Blackberry (TSX:BB) Ltd rose by around 2%.
Cohen, a major shareholder who has pushed Gametop’s move away from its brick-and-mortar model, joined the board in January shortly before a social media frenzy drove a meteoric rise in which GameStop shares surged more than 1,600%.
The flurry of buying drove hedge funds that had bet against the stock to unwind their short positions, a situation known as a “short squeeze.” GameStop pared most of those gains the following month.
Some analysts believe another short squeeze may be adding to the recent gains. Short interest in GameStop was valued at $2.58 billion, or 24.3% of the stock’s float on Tuesday, compared to $1.80 billion, 32.6% in late February, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners. 
The number of shares sold short has dropped by about 25% since February 26 to 13.3 million shares, data from S3 Partners showed.

An agreement between Zillow and the NAR resulted in Zillow making it harder for buyers to find homes for sale that are not associated with the NAR and Multiple Listing Services, according to the lawsuit, which was brought by Real Estate Exchange Inc, or REX.
Multiple Listing Services are databases of properties for sale in given regions used by members of the NAR and other realty professionals.
Zillow said that it intended to ""vigorously defend"" itself against the lawsuit. ""(We) believe the claims are without merit,"" a Zillow spokesperson said.
The NAR did not immediately responded to a request for comment.
The lawsuit said that REX had successfully shown homes on Zillow's website until shortly after the online company struck the deal with the NAR last year to join the organization.
Zillow also said that it would use MLS data feeds for its website but gave no details, the lawsuit said.
""Without any significant warning, Zillow unveiled its newly designed web display in mid-January 2021. The new web display creates a separate page, concealed behind the primary results, where REX homes are now funneled,"" the lawsuit said.
Zillow website users are shown MLS listings as a default while REX homes are behind an ""other listings"" tab, the lawsuit said.
The change in the website has meant that REX homes are getting many fewer viewings on Zillow, with fewer resulting sales, the lawsuit said.
REX asked the court to order Zillow to stop categorizing REX homes under ""other listings,"" and to pay damages and attorney fees.

The access to vaccines is expected to help a recovery in air travel, benefiting planemakers especially Boeing, which is relying on deliveries of the 737 MAX for a financial turnaround after the jet's grounding due to two fatal crashes.
Boeing said it booked 82 new orders in February, taking its gross total for the year so far to 86 planes.
Customers also converted or cancelled around 50 orders last month, but the company's orders net of cancellations still came to 31 jets last month, back in positive territory for the first time since November 2019.
The February orders include 25 737 MAX jets for United Airlines announced earlier in March, 14 737 MAX aircraft for unidentified customers and 27 KC-46 tankers for the U.S. Air Force announced in January.
Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) also ordered 11 777X jets as part of a conversion deal announced last month that includes the cancellation of 19 of its 787-10 jetliners.

1312,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 10:18AM ET</span>",Value Investing Gains $100 Billion and Wipes Out Pandemic Losses,"(Bloomberg) -- The left-for-dead value trade has roared back to life to wipe out all its pandemic losses, with its revival reshaping the $2 trillion world of factor investing.
The strategy that bets on low-priced stocks and against expensive counterparts has surged back to levels last seen before the onset of the once-in-a-century outbreak, a long-short index from Bloomberg shows.
As the market braces for $1.9 trillion in fresh U.S. stimulus and an economic rebound spurred by falling virus cases, a deluge of cash has rushed back into cyclical shares whose valuations were flattened by the 2020 doom and gloom.
“Value crushed it for the right reasons,” Evercore ISI strategists led by Dennis DeBusschere wrote in a note.
Exchange-traded funds following the systematic investing style have drawn new money for 10 straight weeks, with inflows and the market rally fueling a $100 billion jump in assets since the start of November.
These products are on course for their best-ever quarter for new cash and are just $5 billion away from overtaking their nemesis -- the growth factor -- in assets.
Put another way: A famously misfiring trade for the last decade now looks set to overtake one of the hottest strategies of the bull market.
Regime Change
Value strategies bet on stocks typically at the mercy of the business cycle like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co. That’s in contrast to growth trades, which are tied to companies seen providing reliable profits over the long haul such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.
Now, economic optimism is dragging down havens like bonds, and rising yields are making the near-term cash flows of value equities ever-more attractive.
“The higher that yields go, the more pressure is on that rotation,” Saxo Bank strategist Eleanor Creagh wrote in a note.
With this regime change, investors are abandoning old favorites like growth at a historic pace to scoop up cyclical laggards. In a sign of the strength of the market rotation, a strategy betting that recent winners will keep winning -- momentum -- is suffering one of its biggest-ever losses versus value, according to MSCI global indexes.
Value’s rebound is still minor relative to its underperformance since the global financial crisis. Its price-to-book gap with growth remains more than twice the 25- or 10-year average and not far from the peak that preceded the burst of the dot-com bubble.
While steadfast fans see that valuation gap as a sign the recovery has further to go, to the skeptics that have triumphed for the past decade it’s a reminder that the factor’s woes run deep.
Regardless, those who held onto the strategy through the Covid agony are getting some relief. Take Cliff Asness, the AQR Capital Management co-founder who argued in favor of boosting value bets in late 2019.
He wrote in a paper released last week that it’s misleading to assume value has been dead in recent years based on poor historical returns. Since weak performance has been partly driven by the factor getting cheaper, there’s reason to keep the faith, the quant manager wrote.
That’s as long as one doesn’t think valuations will keep falling, of course.

After its remarkable rebound, the investing style was taking a backseat in Tuesday trading. Instead, battered U.S. tech stocks looked poised for a bounce after losing $1.5 trillion in less than a month.
But with capital spending recovering, the rally in cyclical shares has room to run even as the rotation takes a breather, according to Evercore.
“The macro backdrop still favors value and price volatility, but the pace of returns should slow,” the team lead by DeBusschere wrote.

1315,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 09:56AM ET</span>",Analysis: Air leasing mega-merger would rebuild ruined Irish empire,"By Tim Hepher, Laurence Frost and Conor Humphries
PARIS (Reuters) - A tie-up between leasing giants AerCap and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) unit GECAS would reshape global air finance and reunite entities torn apart in one of Ireland's most spectacular corporate collapses three decades ago.
Dublin-based AerCap has confirmed talks with GECAS to combine the leasing industry's two largest aircraft portfolios in Ireland's biggest ever corporate acquisition.
""It creates a leasing colossus with 2,000 aircraft under one brand,"" said independent industry adviser Bertrand Grabowski.
A deal would reconcile estranged branches of the collapsed leasing empire of the late Irish leasing baron Tony Ryan, which rose to dizzying heights in the 1980s only to be laid low by over-expansion in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War.
In a schism whose reverberations rumbled through the sector for decades, Ryan's empire was split between U.S.-based GE Capital, which took over prime assets worth $1.3 billion to form GECAS, and a rump eventually acquired by Dutch-based AerCap.
The split is set to be reversed with AerCap, now based in Dublin and already the world's largest lessor, ready to regain the dominance once occupied by Ryan's Guinness Peat Aviation.
In between, leasing has evolved from the freewheeling risk-taking of Ryan - who later made a second fortune with Ryanair - to a disciplined asset class, basking in recognition from investors looking for solid returns backed by air travel.
For airlines, the sideshow became so attractive that some strayed beyond the business of transporting passengers to compete with their own lessors. They speculatively ordered extra planes to rent out, before stumbling when markets headed lower.
Most tellingly, as AerCap and GECAS fine-tuned their possible mega-transaction last week, budget carrier Norwegian Air quietly folded its own leasing experiment by cancelling a related order for Airbus jets.
It is not the first time AerCap has taken control of a major competitor under Aengus Kelly, the candid and tenacious CEO who started as an accountant at what was left of GPA.
In 2013, he agreed to buy International Lease Finance Corp, founded by Ryan's arch rival and fellow leasing pioneer Steven Udvar-Hazy, after it was weakened by the financial crisis.
Much of today's leasing industry is run from Dublin by GPA veterans. Many lost small fortunes during the company's downfall and built their reputations on cautious decision-making. 
But experts say risks remain in aircraft leasing, which depends on constant access to competitive funding and staying on the right side of a sometimes brutal industry cycle.
TIMING CONCERN
""AerCap are doubling down here; it's a gutsy move and I sense them thinking 'we're too big to fail,' but a few banks have thought the same,"" said a senior industry executive.
Another said the new group, representing one-fifth of the world's leased fleet, would require tough cost cutting.
For AerCap, the crisis delivers a chance to bulk up in an industry that rewards scale, though much will depend on the price it pays for assets and the risk of future writedowns.
For GE, the move would complete an exit from direct involvement in aircraft finance and leave it focusing on GE Aviation, whose jet engines tend to hold their value for longer than airframes.
GECAS has been in focus for years. In 2019, Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) worked on an offer worth up to $40 billion. 
The Wall Street Journal, which first reported talks with AerCap, pegged the new deal's value closer to $30 billion, highlighting the current plight of the airline industry.
""In terms of asset value, it's probably not the best moment for the seller, but it does take advantage of the fact there's a lot of liquidity,"" Grabowski said.
A new entity combining a fifth of all leased jets could help meet new competition from China, one industry executive said.
It would also remove an umbilical cord between GE and GECAS, a captive in-house financier for its engines. GECAS has already started diversifying into jets powered by Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY).
Questions remain over reactions of airlines and planemakers.
Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) have relied on a strong leasing industry to keep deliveries flowing during the pandemic, but now face a more powerful buyer.
Regulators could also take a chunk out of the new venture by forcing it to sell planes in a weak market.
Merging the top two players could speed consolidation at the next tier down, with HNA-controlled Avolon sitting in a distant second place and already said to be itching for a move.
The deal may also send a chill through smaller players that flocked to the industry in the past few years looking for promising yields but are ill-equipped to deal with a downturn. 

AerCap's Kelly has described such leasing industry small-fry as ""tourist capital.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Tuesday, with technology stocks finally bouncing back on bargain hunting after days of heavy selling.
The pressure on tech stocks was lifted by a rebound in bonds, which likewise regained their footing after fears of looming inflation drove yields to their highest in over a year. Foreign investors in particular have used the dip as an entry point for two U.S. asset classes with sustained global appeal, albeit for different reasons.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Nasdaq Composite was up 318 points, or 2.5%, at 12,927 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 205 points, or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.3%.
The mood toward tech stocks was lifted, among other things, by renewed buying in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, after brokerage New Street raised its 12-month target price to $900. As a result, the average street forecast for the stock has risen to some $600, above its spot price. That's the first time in a year that consensus forecasts for what is arguably the most heroically valued stock in the market have implied any upside. 
Tesla stock rose 8.6%, while other tech megacaps that have slid alarmingly in recent days also rebounded: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock both rose 3.6% while Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock rose 6.5%. Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) stock rose 5.7%, brushing off any concern about the transfer of nearly half of founder and CEO Eric Yuan's stake in the company to trusts with unnamed beneficiaries. 
Sentiment toward Tesla was also helped by another couple of barnstorming TV interviews late on Monday by fund manager and Tesla bull Cathie Wood, whose ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) also opened up 6.4%. The fund has lost some 30% since the middle of February.
Other factors also helped to sustain confidence in a U.S. economic rebound this year, with the Paris-based OECD saying that the $1.9 trillion stimulus package - which is due to be voted on for a second time by the House of Representatives later Tuesday, should raise global gross domestic product growth by a full percentage point this year. Additionally, a new study reportedly determined that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is effective against the Brazilian strain of Covid-19, as well as against the original and the B117 'U.K.' variant.
A rare decliner was  Stitch Fix  (NASDAQ:SFIX), which fell 27% to a three-month low after a disappointing sales update covering the holiday season."

Investing.com - Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares jumped more than 9% in early trading Tuesday, breaking their five-day losing streak on an optimistic analyst note that puts a price target at $900.
New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu also put a 'buy' on the stock. His $900 price target is almost 50% higher than its current trading level of $614. It is the first time since last March that the Street's average price target is higher than Tesla's actual stock price, but just barely. 
Tesla shares had been on a bull run that catapulted founder Elon Musk to the top of the world's richest people, but the company's announcement last month that it had invested $1.5 billion in (Bitcoin) put an end to that run up. 
After peaking around $900 billion, Tesla's market cap dropped more than 40%, and then there was more bad news. Last month, a parts shortage forced the company to halt production at a California plant.
Recent developments point out to challenging times for the automobile market disruptor. Tesla recently admitted to California's Department of Motor Vehicles that its City Streets autonomous driving software will not be fully self-driving.
Also, Japan's  Honda  Motor Co Ltd ADR (NYSE:HMC) beat Tesla to market, introducing a limited edition level-3 autonomous sedan in its home market. The level-3 autonomous technology liberates the driver from constantly monitoring the system though it requires them to take over when alerted by the machine.

1320,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 08:25AM ET</span>",EU prepares to turn the screw on asset managers over greenwashing,"By Simon Jessop and Kate Abnett
LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - For money managers and advisers keen to market their sustainable investing credentials to European clients, going green is about to get a lot tougher.
Under a suite of new EU finance rules due to be rolled out in stages, beginning on March 10, firms including fund houses, insurers and pension funds that provide financial products or services in the European Union will have to begin disclosing how sustainable they really are.
The new EU legislation, called the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), aims to help drive 1 trillion euros ($1.19 trillion) into green investments over the next decade, iron out the patchy climate-related information currently provided by financial market participants, and give firms with genuinely sustainable products an edge.
""The crucial point is that this covers any entity or financial product,"" said Lucien Firth, a partner at law firm Simmons & Simmons. ""It doesn't matter if you market all of your products as sustainable or none of them – it covers all of them.""
The SFDR rules should make it harder for market participants to talk up environmental credentials without following through with action, so-called 'greenwashing', and could also determine how big a slice firms can win of the fast-growing market for products with a focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. 
Demand to invest in ESG funds jumped last year, driving assets under management up 29% in the fourth quarter from the prior quarter to nearly $1.7 trillion, according to asset management industry tracker Morningstar.
""Those that already have a good offering in place are going to stand to benefit,"" said Alexandra Mihailescu Cichon, executive vice president of sales and marketing at ESG data firm RepRisk.
DISCLOSURES
Set to roll out in several stages over the next two years, SFDR contains reporting obligations at both the company and product level, although investment managers say regulators' last-minute release of final details of some of the rules is hindering their preparations. 
From this week, all funds must disclose in their pre-contractual information how they factor sustainability risks into their investment decisions. 
Additionally, those funds promoting environmental or social characteristics, or sustainability objectives, must explain both in their marketing and on their websites the objectives and how they plan to meet them. 
Firms must also give an assessment of the main negative impacts their investments will have on the environment and society, or explain why they have not done so. From June, firms with more than 500 staff will be required to report the impacts. 
""Any sustainability-related claim by a financial product must be well justified,"" a European Commission spokesperson said. National financial market authorities will enforce potential penalties for non-compliance.
Andy Pettit, director of EMEA policy research at Morningstar, said the rules would ""go a long way on the greenwashing front... (it will be) much easier to compare different products.""
Within funds, greenwashing could include one that is marketed as 'sustainable', but which includes lots of companies with high carbon emissions. The lack of a firm definition of greenwashing means it is often in the eye of the beholder.
    From March 10, funds will also begin deciding whether to label themselves as an Article 9, 8 or 6 fund - fully focussed on sustainable objectives; fully or partly focussed on environmental, social issues or sustainability issues; or not focussed on sustainability, respectively - with a hard deadline to do so by the end of 2021.
Article 8 or 9 funds will eventually have to make additional disclosures about what their sustainable objectives are, and from next year report on them against a set of granular sustainability criteria. 
Disclosures at a company level will also expand to include data specified by the EU, such as CO2 emissions and water usage across an investment firm's entire investment portfolio.
Mike Everett, governance and stewardship director at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said his team had analysed all the company's products, updated pre-contractual documentation, secured regulatory approval and notified clients of the changes.
The company would also publish additional company-level descriptions of its ESG process and policies and details of how the fund managers consider adverse impacts in the investment process.
""These developments require significant effort and management, but are necessary in order to meet the requirements of the regulation,"" Everett said.
ILL PREPARED
Many other firms, however, have yet to get to grips with the rules, according to fund servicing firm Apex Group, which pointed to a recent client webinar where just 17% of the audience said they felt fully prepared to meet the rules.
While EU regulators have yet to confirm some of the data that asset managers will need to provide to back up their sustainability claims, there is also concern that some data does not even exist. 
Under the EU's current Non Financial Reporting Directive, for example, smaller companies do not have to provide the same level of data as larger companies on factors such as carbon emissions and boardroom diversity - which could make it tougher for a small-cap fund manager to provide evidence of its portfolio's sustainability under SFDR.
Given the uncertainty, some investment managers are proving reluctant to commit to labelling themselves as fully sustainable and may wait until later in the year before finally deciding whether to define themselves as an Article 8 or 9 fund.
""Investors are put in a difficult position as (some company)data needed to report on ...(the) mandatory indicators are not readily available from their investee companies,"" said Anna Hirai, Co-Head of ESG Research at consultants SquareWell Partners.
For Neil Robson, financial services and funds partner at law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman, the greater transparency provided by the new rules should help drive change and potentially expose any lack of action at odds with funds' green claims.
""Despite the green agenda being front-and-centre in the general media, many fund managers are still following a purely financial, profit-led strategy without any particular ESG focus.""

Her nomination, if it goes forward, would signal a tougher stance toward the tech platforms, especially following the selection of fellow antitrust progressive Tim Wu to join the National Economic Council.
Khan, a professor at Columbia Law School, was on the staff of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel which wrote a massive report last year about the major tech companies, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
The FTC works with the Justice Department to enforce antitrust law and also investigates companies accused of deceptive advertising.
Politico, which first reported the potential nomination, also reported that an FBI agent had made calls to Khan's associates as part of a background check for the position.

The White House declined comment. Khan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

1322,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 08:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: J&J 'under stress' to meet EU second-quarter vaccine supply goal - source,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has told the European Union it is facing supply issues that may complicate plans to deliver 55 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine to the bloc in the second quarter of the year, an EU official told Reuters.
Any delay would be a further blow to EU's vaccination plans, which have been hampered by bumpy supplies from other vaccine makers and a slow rollout of shots in many member states.
J&J told the EU last week that issues with the supply of vaccine ingredients and equipment meant it was ""under stress"" to meet the goal of delivering 55 million doses by the end of June, the EU official - who is directly involved in confidential talks with the U.S. company - told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
The official added the company had said it was not impossible to meet the goal, but that it showed caution.
J&J's vaccine, which requires only one dose for protection, is expected to be approved on March 11 for use in the EU by the bloc's regulator. EU officials have said deliveries could start in April.
The company has committed to deliver 200 million doses of its vaccine to the bloc this year. 
""Aligned with our agreement, we expect to begin supplying our commitment of 200 million doses to the European Union in the second quarter of 2021,"" J&J said in a statement, declining to comment on possible delays or the second-quarter target.
J&J began rolling out its vaccine in the United States this month, with a target of delivering 100 million doses by the end of May, but has nearly halved its delivery forecasts for March to 20 million doses as it ramps up new manufacturing facilities.
A spokesman for the European Commission declined to comment on J&J's delivery schedules. The Commission coordinates EU talks with vaccine makers and has come under fire for its role in a vaccination strategy that has so far lagged behind those in Britain and the United States.
An internal document from the German health ministry dated Feb. 22, and a schedule published by the Italian health ministry on March 3, confirm that under the EU contract J&J had committed to delivering around 55 million doses in the second quarter.
That includes about 10 million to Germany and 7.3 million to Italy. Supplies are expected to double in the third quarter, the two schedules show.
But J&J has not yet provided figures on planned deliveries. ""We don't really know how much to expect,"" the EU official said.
LATER START
Dutch Health Minister Hugo de Jonge told reporters he expected the company, which produces its COVID-19 vaccines for the EU in the Netherlands, to meet its second-quarter target of about three million doses for the country, although with limited deliveries in April and a ramp-up later in the quarter.
Ireland also expects J&J to begin supplies a bit later in April than initially planned, with the largest deliveries at the end of the second quarter, the head of the country's health service operator said on Tuesday, confirming earlier estimates for supplies through June.
EU countries raised questions earlier in the year about J&J's production network and contract with the EU, which would require it to send vaccines made at its Dutch factory to the United States for bottling before being shipped back to the EU.
A second EU official, also involved in talks with vaccine makers, said the bloc was trying to boost industrial capacity to bottle more shots in the EU, as part of plans to smooth out J&J deliveries. 
Actual deliveries have often diverged from contractual obligations as vaccine makers have struggled to ship millions of shots at breakneck pace amid the pandemic.
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) cut planned first-quarter deliveries of its vaccine to the EU to 40 million doses from 90 million, and told the bloc second-quarter supplies would be halved. It later said it was striving to provide more shots from outside Europe.
Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) have also faced delays in their deliveries to the EU, but kept their targets for the first quarter.

Under the contract with J&J, the EU has also the option of ordering another 200 million doses, which if exercised would double its supply from the U.S. firm.

The U.S. business, known as GE Capital Aviation Services or GECAS, is one of the world's biggest jet-leasing companies. It leases passenger aircraft made by companies including Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY).
Reuters on Monday reported AerCap and General Electric are discussing a deal to forge an industry titan with more than 2,000 jets, citing people familiar with the matter. 
AerCap said the outcome of the talks has yet to be determined and there can be no guarantee that an agreement will be reached. 
""No further statements will be made by the issuers or the company regarding this matter until the time of the conclusion of those discussions,"" the Irish jet leasing company said in a statement.
GE and AerCap, the world's two largest aircraft lessors, are paving the way for the biggest aircraft leasing shake-up in almost a decade.

This comes as the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to shift more of the world's fleet from battered airlines to the leasing industry, which already holds around half of Airbus and Boeing deliveries.

OSLO/LONDON (Reuters) - Norway has suspended a planned asset sale by engine maker Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) to a Russian-controlled company as it assesses the security implications for the country's navy, the justice ministry said on Tuesday.
Norway's NSM security agency is assessing the 150 million euro ($178 million) sale of Bergen Engines to a company controlled by Russia's TMH Group, the ministry said.
Britain's Rolls-Royce announced the planned sale on Feb. 4 as part of a disposal plan aimed at helping the maker of engines for aircraft and ships survive the pandemic.
Bergen Engines is, among other things, a supplier to NATO member Norway's navy.
""There is significant uncertainty in relation to national security interests, and this uncertainty must be dealt with,"" Justice Minister Monica Maeland told a news conference, while adding the sale must be put on hold for the time being.
""We don't know which conclusion we will draw,"" she said.
Any ongoing due diligence linked to the sale must also be put on hold as long as the review is ongoing, the ministry added.
A spokesman for Rolls-Royce said it had alerted the government in the proper way before announcing the sale of Bergen Engines.
""We understand, however, that the Norwegian Government now wishes to further investigate the deal and Rolls-Royce will co-operate in any way we can with that review. As requested, we have paused the sales process,"" the spokesman said.
TMH Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
While Norway welcomes foreign investment, this must be balanced against potential threats to national security, the justice ministry said.
""The security situation requires us to closely monitor foreign investments in strategic industries,"" Maeland said, adding she plans to give a separate briefing on the matter to parliament.
Bergen Engines makes medium-speed gas and diesel engines for marine and power generation customers and employs about 950 people. It generated revenue of 239 million pounds in 2019, Rolls-Royce said when announcing the planned sale.
Rolls-Royce shares were down 0.9% at 1200 GMT, lagging a 0.7% rise in the FTSE 100 benchmark index.

LONDON (Reuters) - A refusal by the European Union to grant access for the City of London would be taken into account when ""doing the right thing"" for financial services after Brexit, a British government minister said on Tuesday.
An UK-EU trade agreement from Jan. 1 does not cover financial services, leaving the global financial hub largely adrift from the bloc that had been its biggest export customer. 
Both sides are committed to agreeing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) by the end of March for informal, regular talks between their regulators.
Swathes of stock and swaps trading have already left London for Amsterdam, piling pressure on the government to boost the City's competitiveness in future rulemaking.
Once an MoU is agreed, Brussels has said it would assess access for the City under the bloc's ""equivalence"" system, but only if it gets sufficient information on British intentions to diverge from EU rules.
""We are not taking part in a race to the bottom, we are not building an enormous bonfire of EU regulation... that would be totally counterproductive,"" Britain's Financial Services Minister John Glen told an event held by PIMFA, a financial advisors' industry body.
Britain has published proposed changes to company flotations and fintechs, and will amend solvency rules for insurers.
""We have set out our direction of travel. What we are not going to do is to be in a situation where we don't do the right thing by the UK financial services sector,"" Glen said.
Britain will wait to see what happens with EU equivalence decisions, Glen said. In the meantime, it would hold a second public consultation on its plans for revamping Britain's post-Brexit regulatory framework.
""We will look at what we need to do going forward in light of the absence of any determinations from the EU on equivalence,"" Glen said.

""It's up to the EU how much they want to embrace global high standards or how much they wish to take a different approach, looking perhaps more inwardly.""

Investing.com - GameStop (NYSE:GME) shares soared again in premarket trade on Tuesday on fresh hopes for the company to reorient itself to online sales.
The stock trimmed its gains somewhat to trade up 10.4% from Monday's close at $214.80 by 7:40 AM ET (1240 GMT). The latest surge followed the company’s announcement it had set up a committee to spearhead transition to a digital life and reverse a long-term decline.
Ryan Cohen, a member of the company’s board and co-founder of online pet food retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY), will head the panel that a filing said will “identify initiatives that can further accelerate the company’s transformation”.
“The committee will continue to focus on identifying actions that can transform GameStop into a technology business and help create enduring value for stockholders. It is responsible for evaluating areas that include GameStop’s current operational objectives, capital structure and allocation priorities, digital capabilities, organizational footprint, and personnel,” the company release said.
The committee will also search for and appoint two senior executives – a chief technology officer and chief financial officer at the Nasdaq-listed firm.
GameStop attracted worldwide attention in January when a group of Reddit followers, ‘WallStreetBets’ plotted against hedge funds who were heavily short on the stock. 
The Reddit-driven short-squeeze sent the stock as high as $482 last month, far above most analysts' price targets. The stock has since been actively traded with strong volumes and price volatility.

1329,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 07:00AM ET</span>","Malaysia's Top Glove says no systemic forced labour found at firm, reports record profit","By Liz Lee
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's Top Glove Corp Bhd said on Tuesday an independent consultant had concluded there was no systemic forced labour at the firm after it took measures to address U.S. concerns of such practices at the world's largest glove maker.
The findings were announced as the company posted a fourth consecutive quarter of record profits, benefiting from soaring demand for its medical gloves during the COVID-19 pandemic, and said it expected to list its shares in Hong Kong in May or June of this year.
Top Glove appointed the consultant to assess the group's trade, human rights and labour practices after the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) placed products of two of its subsidiaries on an import ban over suspicions of forced labour last year.
""The independent consultant's opinion as of January 2021 was that there is no systemic forced labour within the group,"" Top Glove Executive Director, Lim Cheong Guan, said on Tuesday.
He also said the findings come after the consultant verified the company had implemented the correction action plans it submitted to U.S. authorities for review and approval.
""We are assured by our consultant that we are very close to the finishing line. And in our recent dialogue with the CBP personnel, they also assured us that this is the final leg,"" Top Glove Managing Director Lee Kim Meow told a virtual press briefing.
The CBP did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.
Impactt, the independent consultant, said in a statement that Top Glove has engaged them to perform quarterly verification for a year until August 2021.
It said that as at January, it found some indicators of forced labour were no longer present among Top Glove's direct employees, including abuse of vulnerability, restriction of movement, excessive overtime and the withholding of wages.
Impactt said the manufacturer was making progress on other indicators such as the retention of identity documents, abusive working and living conditions, deception, debt bondage, physical and sexual violence and intimidation.
""Considering the group's ongoing actions, these findings do not amount to systemic forced labour,"" it said.
The comments come as the company reported another record quarterly profit.
Net profit soared 2,380% to 2.87 billion ringgit ($695.93 million) in the second quarter of the financial year from 115.7 million ringgit a year ago, Top Glove said in a stock exchange filing.
Strong demand boosted sales, it said, adding that greater production efficiency and higher average selling prices had also underpinned second-quarter profits. 
The company said the profit achieved for the first half of the current financial year ending in August 2021 exceeded the group’s total profit for the past 20 years.
Global demand for gloves meanwhile would likely grow to about 15% per annum after the pandemic from around 10% per annum before the coronavirus, Top Glove said.
""While demand is likely to stabilise post-pandemic, the Group expects it will not revert to pre-pandemic levels owing to increased hygiene awareness as well as uncertainties surrounding the resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the company said.
It added that it expected governments to continue to stockpile gloves and other personal protective equipment.
Top Glove also reported record revenue of 5.37 billion ringgit in the second quarter, up 336% from a year ago.
The manufacturer, which is already listed in Malaysia and Singapore, is seeking a $1.9 billion dual primary listing in Hong Kong to fund ongoing expansion after its stellar performance over the past year.
But sources have told Reuters that two banks -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) - have opted out of the deal, citing concerns about Top Glove's rubber farming processes and the reputational risk of working with a U.S. sanctioned company.
Top Glove said a portion of the net proceeds from the listing will be invested in environmental, social and corporate governance practices and initiatives.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Tuesday, with the tech sector in particular expected to bounce back sharply after recent losses as vaccination optimism grows.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 175 points, or 0.6%, S&P 500 Futures traded 40 points, or 1.1%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 270 points, or 2.2%.
The Nasdaq Composite has been in the spotlight of late, as rising Treasury yields have spooked investors in the high growth stocks that populate much of this benchmark index. It dropped 2.4% on Monday, closing more than 10% below its Feb. 12 closing high, and falling into correction territory.
However, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note currently trades at 1.53%, below the levels near 1.60% seen on Monday, easing the pressure on these stocks that rely on cheap funding conditions.
Meanwhile, the House of Representatives will have the final vote on President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill on Tuesday after it passed the Senate with some revisions over the weekend. That clears the path for the president to sign it by next week. The Paris-based OECD said earlier that the extra U.S. stimulus will add a full percentage point to world GDP growth this year.
Adding to the positive news, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday that people who’ve been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 can meet safely indoors without masks. This announcement came with over 30 million Americans having received both doses of the  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines. The New York Post, meanwhile, reported that a new study had found that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is effective against the Brazilian strain of the virus, further easing concerns that new strains could complicate the economy's reopening.
In the corporate sector, attention is turning towards GameStop (NYSE:GME) once more, after the company tasked Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) co-founder Ryan Cohen, a major GameStop shareholder and board member, with spearheading the company's online sales efforts. 
GameStop was caught in a volatile tug-of-war last month between retail traders and professional managers who had bet heavily against the stock. Other stocks which have attracted interest in the Reddit chat rooms now include the likes of Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) and AMC Networks (NASDAQ:AMCX).
Oil prices pushed higher Tuesday, with the focus turning to  the release of U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, later in the session. Last week saw the largest U.S. crude oil build on record, with stocks increasing by over 21 million barrels a day.
Crude prices had surged Monday, with Brent spiking above $70 a barrel, after an attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities by Yemen-based forces. However, there was limited impact and prices ended the day lower.
U.S. crude futures traded 1% higher at $65.72 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.3% to $69.13.  
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1.6% to $1,705.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.5% higher at 1.1902.

High-flying tech stocks, which powered the market's rebound from the pandemic lows in March last year, have been hit by a one-two punch of rising yields and investors shifting funds to sectors poised to benefit from a recovery in the global economy aided by accelerated rollouts of COVID-19 vaccines.
""People went into this stock super aggressively to drive it from $40 to $900, and that means will usually come out just as fast,"" said Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin.
""It was obviously overdone both at $200, and I would say well overdone at $900. Retail often doesn't sell as fast as the institutions, so the correction could last longer than for other tech stocks.""
The tech-heavy Nasdaq index has declined more than 10.5% over the last three weeks. Tesla's shares fell as much as 6.5% on Monday, while peers Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc and Li Auto closed down 7.6% and 5.0% respectively.
The broader auto industry has been pressured by a global semiconductor chip shortage, which has caused a major delay in manufacturing activities and forced many companies to scale down production.
In late February, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said the company's Fremont, California plant was shut down for two days due to ""parts shortages"".

The weeks-long selloff has reduced Musk's wealth by more than $49 billion as of Friday, according to Reuters calculations.

1332,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 06:18AM ET</span>",Cathie Wood Keeps ‘Eye on the Prize’ After Rotation Pummels ETFs,"(Bloomberg) -- The violent stock rotation that sent the main ETF from Ark Investment Management to its worst losses in a year is a healthy development for a bull market that will spur the fund to “concentrate toward our highest-conviction names,” founder Cathie Wood said.
Wood’s exchange-traded funds gained in early trading on Tuesday, signaling a reprieve from a selloff that wiped 30% from her flagship investing strategy since a Feb. 12 high. The Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) has logged three weeks of declines, the longest stretch of losses since the Covid 19-spurred meltdown last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
ARKK gained 3.9% in the pre-market as of 5:34 a.m. in New York, with other Ark ETFs also in the green.
Speaking in an interview with Bloomberg TV Monday night, Wood said the rotation out of high-growth companies and into value stocks is “happening very quickly” but is a sign of the bull market broadening. Her strategy in such an environment is to treat her more liquid holdings such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as “cash-like instruments” and concentrate her funds in higher-conviction stocks.
“We keep our eye on the prize,” she said. “We have a five-year time horizon.”
Some of the biggest Ark holdings were also up on Tuesday before the bell. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Square (NYSE:SQ) and  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) -- whose miserable runs lately have helped drag down Wood’s ETFs -- were all trading higher in the pre-market after slumping on Monday.
Those stocks have been some of the hottest on Wall Street, surging amid a shift to online working and the election of U.S. President Joe Biden raising expectations of a policy boost for electric vehicles. Now, the prospect of rising inflation amid an economic recovery is driving up bond yields, making the highest priced equities less attractive.
Wood’s prolonged run of losses represents the biggest test yet for the firm she founded in 2014. Investors poured billions of dollars into her ETFs in recent months inspired by Ark’s stellar returns in 2020.
Short interest in ARKK, as measured by the percentage of available shares that are on loan, has climbed to a record of more than 5.2%, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. Bearish bets had eased slightly on Thursday.
Still, ARKK has yet to see a large-scale investor exodus despite the recent trouble, possibly due to dip buyers snapping up cheaper shares. Data show that Wood’s main fund recorded a small inflow on both Thursday and Friday, even as it retreated and other funds like the Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW) and the Ark Genomic Revolution ETF (NYSE:ARKG) posted outflows.
Meanwhile, the flagship fund is still up more than 100% in the past year.
“For high-flying niche ETFs that hit a rough patch, money historically has left more slowly than it came in,” Eric Balchunas, ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a recent note. “We expect ARKK’s flows to be similarly mixed for some time.”

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 06:10AM ET</span>",Brands hope to cash in on Clubhouse audio app frenzy,"By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - Last month, during a live game show on audio-chat app Clubhouse, tech entrepreneur and investor Noah Lichtenstein and his co-hosts handed out $3,200 in prizes funded by Square Inc-owned payment company Cash App, which sponsored the event.
Days later, top executives from Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), owner of fast food chains Burger King and Popeyes, created their own Clubhouse room to let people quiz them on anything they wanted after their quarterly financial report in an event billed as “Open Kitchen”.
The invite-only app, which launched last March, does not currently offer paid advertising. But the service that regularly draws big crowds into audio chat rooms lured by surprise appearances by the likes of musician Drake and billionaire Elon Musk, is also quickly attracting big companies hoping to reach the estimated 8 million users who have downloaded the hottest new digital platform since TikTok.
Brands are experimenting on Clubhouse in wide-ranging ways without a playbook. Some companies are offering money to well-known Clubhouse creators to sponsor their audio rooms. Others see opportunities to generate free buzz or get live feedback on their products, Clubhouse hosts said. 
So frenzied is the business interest that “It’s getting to the point where brands are investing and paying for people to advise them on how to use Clubhouse effectively,” said Kat Cole, a business adviser, investor and host of a weekly Clubhouse room called “Office Hours.”
Companies have long nurtured corporate profiles on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which boasts 2.8 billion users, or Twitter with 192 million users. On Clubhouse accounts must be tied to an individual with their real name, though brands may create a Clubhouse room and host content from them, said a Clubhouse spokeswoman. 
Restaurant Brands International (RBI) Chief Executive Jose Cil used the app to take questions ranging from how he entered the restaurant business to the similarities between fast food chains and fine-dining establishments, all while in the back of an Uber (NYSE:UBER), said Duncan Fulton, chief corporate officer at RBI.
Cil and other executives enjoyed Clubhouse so much that RBI’s global Popeyes team plan to host their own session, Fulton added.
Clubhouse stands out from other platforms because it gives users a shot at speaking with a major CEO or celebrity, said Ishan Goel, a brand strategist and founder of Goel Strategies, which has worked with clients like Colgate and Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI).
“I’m telling (executives) to just jump on,” Goel said. “Gen Z and younger millennials want to know who’s behind the scenes at these companies.”
Last week, a group of Clubhouse’s top 40 creators, who were brought together to advise the app’s founders, launched a new company called Audio Collective to create a more formal structure to match brands with hosts. The company will help decide on sponsorship pricing and assist hosts with planning their events, said Catherine Connors, one of the founders of Audio Collective and a former Disney executive.
While the app lacks advertising formats, some hosts are experimenting with inserting information about sponsors into the conversations. Shondra Washington, an Audio Collective founder and president of investment firm TBC-Capital, said she discussed her need for a new computer to incorporate mention of Upsie, a startup that provides warranties for tech devices and recently sponsored her Clubhouse room called “CrowdHouse.”
Upsie's sponsorship was disclosed verbally and in the title and description of the Clubhouse room.
The sponsorship took place during the holidays around the launch of the highly sought-after  Sony  (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation 5, and led to an uptick in the number of visits to Upsie’s website, Washington said. “It was the perfect time to talk about it.”
Some brands that missed the boat on hot services like TikTok, a short form video-sharing app, are trying to get ahead of the curve by diving into Clubhouse, even as the platform currently lacks analytics that help companies measure how well their marketing worked, Lichtenstein said. 
The largest prize to date that was awarded by Lichtenstein’s Clubhouse room called “I AM WOW $” which is sponsored by Cash App, was $1,600 to a musician from Texas who was out of work, he said.

“I can’t say for Cash App how they measure (the effectiveness) of this, but delivering this much joy to people has to have a lot of value,” Lichtenstein said.

Investing.com -- After a heady debt-fueled ride with Cellnex (MC:CLNX), investors in European telecoms can now enjoy the discreet charms of dullness with Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD)'s towers spin-off.
The U.K.-based telecoms group finally set the price range for the IPO of its towers unit on Tuesday, a move that will free up capital and reduce its debt burden while reducing the cost – so it hopes – of building out 5G networks.
The deal, set for the Frankfurt Stock Exchange next week, will value the company at anywhere between 11.7 billion and 14.7 billion euros ($14-$17.6 billion), will allow investors a new play on the fast-consolidating sector of telecoms infrastructure, which has burgeoned as the continent’s big telcos – most already heavily indebted - have scrambled to raise cash for 5G upgrades.
Vantage, with its 82,000 towers across 10 markets, promises to challenge Spain’s Cellnex for leadership in the European market. The Spanish company has been on a buying spree in the last couple of years, making the most of a first-mover advantage while the less agile incumbents have had their hands tied by internal restructurings. Vodafone has needed the best part of two years to bring Vantage to market, and France’s Orange (NYSE:ORAN) only announced its plans for a separate towers company last month.
Cellnex, which was the top-performing stock in the sector for most of the last three years, hasn’t benefited from the prospect of such competition. Cellnex stock has fallen 25% since October. A slew of acquisitions at increasingly demanding multiples has created the impression that it’s having to try harder and harder to stay ahead of the pack. As a result, its balance sheet is now looking strained. It paid a little over 400,000 euros a mast for CK Hutchison’s European towers in January, but 500,000 for Altice’s towers joint venture last month.   
Even though the ratings agencies have been appeased by capital increases, a BBB- rating leaves little room for mishaps on the earnings side, especially given that interest costs have swallowed the last three years’ operating profits.  
Vantage, by contrast, is coming to market with dull but respectable free cash flow of around 500 million, and a dividend payout that equates to 1.9% at the top of the bookbuilding range.  
A market value of 14.7 billion euros also makes Vantage look cheap relative to Cellnex at 20.5 billion.  However, analysts point out that Cellnex ought to be able to extract more revenue from each mast given its independent status. Mobile operators using Vantage’s masts will always fear being second-class customers behind Vodafone itself, which will remain the anchor tenant. 
For Vodafone, meanwhile, the news appears largely priced in: the bulk of its 1.9% move upward in European morning trading was due to uplift from the broader market rather than a pop in response to the news of the price range. The shares had fallen at the opening."

The state-owned wireless carrier will issue as many as 12 billion shares on the mainland China bourse, it said in a statement Tuesday to the Hong Kong stock exchange. The company didn’t disclose pricing for the new shares.
The second listing will help China Telecom tap diversified financing channels in both domestic and overseas capital markets, said the statement. The domestic pivot is likely aimed at neutralizing the impact of being delisted in the U.S. along with two other major Chinese telecommunications firms in January, a decision that the firms are appealing.
NYSE’s Second-Guessing on China Delistings Sows Confusion
Under Trump, the U.S. sought to sever economic links and deny Chinese firms access to American capital, marking an escalation of the administration’s moves over tariffs as part of the trade war.
China Telecom will use the listing proceeds to construct a 5G industrial Internet project and boost its cloud network, according to the statement. The wireless operator reported a net income of 20.9 billion yuan ($3.2 billion) for 2020 on Tuesday, missing analyst estimates. Operating revenue rose 4.7% to a better-than-expected 393.6 billion yuan.
The Shanghai listing plan is subject to approval by the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission and there is no guarantee that it’ll proceed, the company said.

The continent's stock markets have come under pressure as a jump in bond yields on the back of quick vaccine rollouts and a massive U.S. fiscal package has fanned worries about a potential rise in inflation.
Still, major European indexes have fared better than some of their tech-heavy U.S. peers.
""European market is much less tech heavy than the S&P 500, much less growth dominated, so higher bond yields are not such a negative,"" said Nick Nelson, head of European equity strategy at UBS.
""The speed of the move has been an issue ... if we're talking about a gentle rise in yields from here on, then that's more manageable, and more cyclical parts of the market such as Europe would do better.""

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S.-listed Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers Li Auto Inc, Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc and Xpeng Inc plan to list in Hong Kong as soon as this year, tapping a growing investor base closer to home, said people with direct knowledge of the matter.
The trio each aim to sell at least 5% of enlarged share capital in the Asian hub, the people said. Based on their New York market capitalisation on Monday, proceeds could reach $5 billion.
The companies have been working with advisors on the sales which could begin as early as mid-year, said one of the people, who declined to be identified due to confidentiality constraints.
Li Auto, Nio and Xpeng - which have raised $14.7 billion in U.S. markets since 2018 - declined to comment. U.S.-listed shares of the three automakers rose between 3.7% and 5.3% in early deals.
The plans come as the trio increase capital raising efforts to fund technology development and expand sales networks, to better compete in the world's biggest EV market where U.S. peer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is boosting sales of its China-made vehicles.
This year is set to be crucial for EV makers to seize market share as the industry expects China sales of new-energy vehicles (NEVs) to jump almost 40% from last year to 1.8 million units.
""Despite much richer financial resources now compared with a year ago, EV start-ups still need to invest heavily in next-generation technology,"" said analyst Shi Ji at Haitong International. ""Exploring a secondary listing much closer to their home market, if any, is a good move.""
Selling shares in Hong Kong would also add the trio to a slew of New York-listed Chinese firms seeking a presence on more local exchanges amid Sino-U.S. political tension.
The rising number of such listings ""has enhanced the status of Hong Kong's capital markets globally, and also helped issuers reach higher valuations and raise more capital,"" said Zhang Zihua, chief investment officer at Beijing Yunyi Asset.
TRACK RECORD
Under Hong Kong rules, a secondary listing requires at least two financial years of good regulatory compliance on another qualifying exchange.
Li Auto and Xpeng went public in the United States mid-last year so will likely apply in Hong Kong for a dual primary listing, said three people with direct knowledge of the matter.
As per Hong Kong's dual primary listing rules, firms are subject to full bourse requirements in Hong Kong and a second exchange, but are not bound by the two-year condition.
Xpeng is also considering a third listing on Shanghai's STAR Market for new-economy firms, said two other people.
""In the long run, it's helpful for consumer-focused companies like us to connect with domestic capital markets and domestic investors,"" Xpeng President Brian Gu told Reuters last week, declining to comment on any Hong Kong listing plan.
""This is the direction we should pay attention to.""
GOING GREEN
China's government has heavily promoted NEVs - such as battery-powered, plug-in petrol-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell cars - in response to chronic air pollution, spurring interest from technology companies and investors alike.
Last month, Reuters reported telecommunications firm Huawei Technologies Co Ltd plans to market EVs as early as this year.
China forecasts NEVs will make up 20% of its annual auto sales by 2025 from around 5% in 2020.

Domestic vehicle deliveries last year totalled 32,624 by Li Auto, 43,728 by Nio and 27,041 by Xpeng. That compared with 147,445 vehicles by Tesla, industry data showed.

Still, investors remain conflicted over whether the stimulus will help global growth rebound faster from the COVID-19 downturn or cause the world's biggest economy to overheat and fuel inflation.
""The chance of our seeing more inflation in the economy is meaningfully increased by the monetary policy actions and the fiscal policy actions that we're seeing around the world,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Chief Executive Officer David Solomon told a conference in Sydney via webcast.
""There is certainly a reasonable outcome where inflation accelerates more quickly than people are expecting, and that will obviously have an impact on markets and volatility.""

U.S. economic data pointed to a continued recovery. Wholesale inventories increased in January despite a surge in sales, the Commerce Department said on Monday, suggesting inventory investment could again contribute to growth in the first quarter.

European equity markets have struggled to continue Monday’s rally to any great degree Tuesday as economic news out of Japan disappointed, as the country's economy expanded at a slower-than-initially-reported pace in October-December, growing 2.8% on the quarter, versus a preliminary 3.0% gain.  A further sharp drop in Chinese stocks - despite the intervention of state-owned funds to prop up prices - also soured the mood.
Back in Europe, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said Monday that risks to the U.K. economy remain tilted to the downside.
This brings the revised fourth-quarter Eurozone GDP growth figures, due later in the session, into focus, with the region hard hit by Covid-related restrictions during that period.
In the corporate sector, Continental (DE:CONG) stock slumped over 6% after the German car parts manufacturer forecast a lower profit margin than expected for the coming fiscal year, due partly to the global shortage of semiconductors that has pushed up prices for a key input into many of its products.
Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) stock dropped 0.5% after the French media giant faced a claim for 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in damages, after a group of investors alleged the company made false financial statements during a merger deal two decades ago. Vodafone  (LON:VOD) stock rose by a similar amount after it set the price range for its mast business, Vantage Towers, which is due to start trading in Frankfurt next week.
On the flip side, one of the success stories of the Covid era, Domino’s Pizza (LON:DOM) saw its stock rise over 8% after launching a 45 million pounds ($62 million) share buyback program as profits climbed. 
Across the Atlantic, the Biden’s administration’s $1.9 trillion Covid relief is set to be taken up by the House of Representatives by “Wednesday morning at the latest,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday.
This follows the Senate passing the package on Saturday. Once the bill is passed by the House of Representatives, it will then make its way to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, continuing Monday's early gains, with traders turning their focus onto the release of U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day.
Fears of supply disruption from Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest exporter, after a combined drone and missile attack on some of its facilities by Yemen-based forces saw Brent spike above $70 a barrel Monday. However, there was limited impact and prices ended the day lower.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $65.50 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.8% to $68.78. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1.4% to $1,700.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% higher at 1.1896.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government picked Junko Nakagawa, the first female CEO of Nomura Asset Management, on Tuesday to join the central bank's fragmented nine-member board that faces the challenge of tackling the side-effects of prolonged monetary easing.
Nakagawa would join a Bank of Japan (BOJ) board split between members who see more room to ramp up stimulus, and others wary of the rising costs of prolonged easing.
While little is known about her views on monetary policy, Nakagawa may keep the board debate from leaning too much towards reflationary policy, despite a slight majority seen in favour of powerful monetary stimulus.
""The BOJ must consider the side-effects even if it pursues a reflationary stance,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""It is important to strike a balance, and her experience in asset management may prevent monetary policy from leaning excessively to one side.""
The 55-year-old banker would replace Takako Masai, who has consistently voted with the majority of the board while calling for more debate on the rising cost of prolonged monetary easing.
""She comes from the buy-side, which suggests she may have been chosen for her knowledge on timely themes like ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) investment,"" said Toru Suehiro, senior economist at Daiwa Securities.
The nomination needs approval of both houses of parliament to take effect. Nakagawa would assume the post after Masai serves out her five-year term on June 29.
Of the nine posts at the BOJ board, one has traditionally been held by a woman.
Officials at Nomura Asset Management, a unit of  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR), declined to comment on the nomination, saying they have nothing to say about the matter.
In the past, Nakagawa has been involved in efforts to promote exchange-traded funds (ETF) in Japan. The BOJ, which has its next policy review meeting on March 18-19, has been a big buyer of ETFs, as part of its easing strategy. 
Nakagawa rose through the ranks in Japan's male-dominated financial industry to become the first female head of Nomura Asset Management in 2019, with experience in investment banking and accounting.
She has also been a member of the Financial Services Agency's panel on corporate accounting since 2015.

In an interview with the Nikkei newspaper last year, Nakagawa described herself as a listener willing to work with colleagues with views different from her own.

In their lawsuit, the 90 investors, represented by law firm Soffer Avocats, allege top executives at the time failed to fully disclose the extent of Vivendi's debt as the group oversaw a $46 billion three-way tie-up with Seagram Co and Canal Plus. 
Vivendi's boss at the time was Jean-Marie Messier.
""The investor group contends that Messier and other Vivendi executives presented fake financials to conceal the existence of a severe liquidity crisis at the company,"" a spokesman for the investors' group said in a written statement. 
Vivendi's lawyer told Reuters the claim was groundless, citing a previous decision by a French criminal court that ruled Messier and other Vivendi executives didn't issue false information at the time. 
""This case has already been judged several times in France, in particular by the criminal judge, who ruled out that Vivendi issued any false information,"" said Hervé Pisani, managing partner of Freshfields in Paris. 
The case will be heard at Paris's commercial court from 1300 GMT. The court can take several weeks or months before announcing a decision.

1346,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 01:15AM ET</span>",U.S. lawmakers propose giving USPS $6 billion for electric delivery vehicles,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of 17 U.S. House of Representatives Democrats introduced legislation on Monday to provide $6 billion to the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to buy tens of thousands of additional electric delivery vehicles.
Ohio-based electric-vehicle maker Workhorse Group Inc shares jumped 13% on prospects the company may be able to sell electric postal vehicles. Last month, it lost out when the USPS awarded a $482 million contact to Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) Defense to finalize production for the next-generation postal vehicles. 
The bill sponsored by Representative Jared Huffman and seen by Reuters would require at least 75% of the new fleet be electric or zero-emission vehicles. If Congress approves funding, there is no guarantee the USPS would agree to buy vehicles from Workhorse.
Last month, the USPS said it was committed to having electric vehicles make up 10% of its next-generation fleet as part of its multibillion-dollar plan to retire its 30-year-old delivery vehicles. It said it could boost that percentage if it received billions of dollars in government assistance. 
""We welcome and are interested in any support from Congress that advances the goal of a Postal Service vehicle fleet with zero emissions, and the necessary infrastructure required to operate it,"" the USPS said on Monday. ""With the right level of support, the majority of the Postal Service’s fleet can be electric by the end of the decade.""
The legislation is backed by some key Democrats, including Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Representative Carolyn Maloney, who chairs the Oversight and Reform Committee that oversees USPS.
The bill would also require no less than 50% of medium/heavy-duty vehicle purchases be electric or zero-emission through 2029 and all new USPS vehicles to be zero-emission after January 2040.
Some lawmakers have talked about giving the Postal Service additional money to expand EV purchases as part of an infrastructure bill, but the prospects remain uncertain in Congress.
In January, President Joe Biden vowed to replace the U.S. government’s fleet of roughly 650,000 vehicles with electric models.
Workhorse said it applauds ""any efforts that support the Biden administration’s goal of expanding the government’s fleet of clean, non-combustion engine vehicles.""
Democratic Representative Tim Ryan separately wrote the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday asking about ""reports of what might be unusual trading of Oshkosh stock"" shortly before the contract was announced.

Ryan and two other Ohio lawmakers including Senator Sherrod Brown wrote Biden last week urging the administration to ""delay the contract until a thorough review is conducted."" Oshkosh and the SEC did not immediately comment.

The tie-up will take the form of a multi-fund investment by Temasek to anchor Asia and Africa-focused LeapFrog's future funds, and the Singapore state investor will also acquire a minority stake in LeapFrog, they said in a joint statement on Tuesday.
Impact or socially responsible investing has gone mainstream in the last few years, moving beyond being a niche for development banks. It has attracted the likes of some of the world's largest buyout funds including TPG, KKR and Blackstone (NYSE:BX).
""There is an urgent and pressing need to address the critical social and environmental challenges that the world is facing,"" said Benoit Valentin, head of impact investing at Temasek. 
""We believe in the potential of impact investing to unlock the capital to meet these challenges.""
Temasek's latest move comes two years after its philanthropic arm set up a private equity fund for impact investing. LeapFrog and its investment process will continue to be managed and controlled by its team of partners.
With the latest funding, LeapFrog says it will have received more than $2 billion from global institutional investors since it was founded in 2007.
""We will continue to open the gates of the capital markets to purpose-driven businesses,"" said Andy Kuper, founder and CEO of LeapFrog.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed Tuesday morning, as investors digested a rotation out of growth stocks that drove the Nasdaq 100 index into a technical correction and a fall in Treasury yields.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.37% by 10:02 PM ET (3:02 AM GMT). Data released earlier in the day said that the GDP grew 2.8% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2020, lower than both the 3% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the third quarter’s 5.3% growth.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 1.21%.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.66% and the Shenzhen Component slumped 1.66%.
Investors did cheer progress on the U.S.’ $1.9 trillion stimulus package, with House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying on Monday that the chamber aims to take up the bill “Wednesday morning at the latest.”
The timing of a vote in the House of Representatives “depends on when we get the paper from the Senate,” she added.
The package, proposed by President Joe Biden earlier in the year, was passed by the Senate on Saturday following a marathon overnight vote. Once the bill is passed by the House of Representatives, it will then make its way to Biden to be signed into law.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also said on Monday that the package would provide enough resources to fuel a “very strong” U.S. economic recovery, adding that “there are tools” to deal with inflation.
Optimism aside, some investors were still worried about whether the stimulus will drive a faster global economic recovery from COVID-19 or trigger runaway inflation.
“What’s going to determine the results today is the balance between buying for the reflation trade and the selling of tech (stocks)”, he said. “It’s difficult to say what’s going to be most influential given the spectacular gains across Europe compared to the big drop in the Nasdaq,” CMC Markets chief markets strategist Michael McCarthy told Reuters.
Investors are also keeping an eye on upcoming Treasury auctions as the ten-year Treasury yield traded just below 1.6%. Asian credit markets slumped as concerns about rising rates caused more deals to be scrapped.
Rising bond yields continue to be a persistent risk, as the U.S. benchmark traded around a 12-month high and raised fears that government aid programs could lead to runaway inflation.
Other investors wondered if equity valuations have become excessive, especially as speculative tech shares favor cheaper cyclical stocks.
“There’s definitely a lot of volatility in the market right now and many of the sectors that underperformed last year are rallying, this is part of a rotation,” AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB) senior equities portfolio manager Valerie Grant told Bloomberg."

Commissioner Shelly Botkin resigned effective immediately, the Public Utility Commission of Texas said. Her departure came a week after DeAnn Walker resigned as the regulator's chair amid criticism of the PUC'S handling of a deadly blackout during a mid-February freeze.
A PUC spokesman did not reply to a request for comment. Botkin could not be reached for comment. 
The firestorm over the outage worsened last week as the state's independent market adviser said some power charges were increased in error and could be rolled back under commission rules. 
Botkin and PUC Chairman Arthur D'Andrea, who was named to replace Walker last week, rejected repricing on Friday, saying it could have unintended consequences for power producers. On Monday, however, Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said some charges should be lowered. [nL4N2L70F6] 
Electricity and natural gas prices surged as an arctic air mass brought subzero temperatures, killing dozens of people and leaving much of the state's power market in the throes of a deep financial crisis. One company filed for bankruptcy and a dozen face removal from the state's grid for defaulting on power payments. 
The state's electric industry faces $47 billion in one-time costs after the commission and grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) raised prices to induce generators to add power. 
Botkin, who was appointed by Governor Greg Abbott to the commission in 2018, had been the spokeswoman for ERCOT before joining the commission. Under state law, remaining commissioner D'Andrea can act on proposals before the PUC.

1351,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 07:31PM ET</span>",How Toyota thrives when the chips are down,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
(Reuters) - Toyota may have pioneered the just-in-time manufacturing strategy but when it comes to chips, its decision to stockpile what have become key components in cars goes back a decade to the Fukushima disaster.
After the catastrophe severed Toyota's supply chains on March 11, 2011, the world's biggest automaker realised the lead-time for semiconductors was way too long to cope with devastating shocks such as natural disasters.
That's why Toyota came up with a business continuity plan (BCP) that required suppliers to stockpile anywhere from two to six months' worth of chips for the Japanese carmaker, depending on the time it takes from order to delivery, four sources said.
And that's why Toyota has so far been largely unscathed by a global shortage of semiconductors following a surge in demand for electrical goods under coronavirus lockdowns that has forced many rival automakers to suspend production, the sources said.
""Toyota was, as far as we can tell, the only automaker properly equipped to deal with chip shortages,"" said a person familiar with Harman International, which specialises in car audio systems, displays and driver assistance technology. 
Two of the sources who spoke to Reuters are Toyota engineers and the others are at companies involved in the chip business.
Toyota surprised rivals and investors last month when it said its output would not be disrupted significantly by chip shortages even as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford, Honda and Stellantis, among others, have been forced to slow or suspend some production.
Toyota, meanwhile, has raised its vehicle output for the fiscal year ending this month and jacked up its full-year earnings forecast by 54%.
CLASSIC LEAN SOLUTION
The source familiar with Harman said the company, part of South Korea's Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF), was experiencing shortages of central processing units (CPUs) and power management integrated circuits as early as November last year.
While Harman doesn't make chips, because of its continuity deal with Toyota, it was obliged to prioritise the carmaker and ensure it had enough semiconductors to maintain supplies of its digital systems for four months, or more, the source said.
The chips in especially short supply now are microcontroller units (MCUs) which control an array of functions such as braking, acceleration, steering, ignition, combustion, tire pressure gauges and rain sensors, the four sources told Reuters.
However, Toyota changed the way it buys MCUs and other microchips after the 2011 earthquake, which caused a tsunami that killed more than 22,000 people and triggered a deadly meltdown at Fukushima's nuclear power plant. 
In the aftermath of the quake, Toyota estimated its procurement of more than 1,200 parts and materials might be affected and it drew up a list of 500 priority items that would need secure supply in the future, including semiconductors made by key Japanese chip supplier Renesas Electronics.
The repercussions of the disaster were so severe it took six months for Toyota to get production outside Japan back to normal levels, having done so at home two months earlier.
It was a big shock to Toyota's just-in-time system because a smooth flow of components from suppliers to factories to assembly lines - as well as lean inventories - were central to its emergence as an industry leader for efficiency and quality.
At a time when supply chain risk is now front and centre in almost every industry, the move shows how Toyota was ready to throw out its own rule book when it came to semiconductors - and is reaping the rewards.
A Toyota spokesman said one of the goals of its lean inventories strategy was to become sensitive to inefficiencies and risks in supply chains, identify the most potentially damaging bottlenecks and figure out how to avoid them.
""The BCP for us was a classic lean solution,"" he said.
NO BLACK BOXES
Toyota pays for its stockpiling arrangement with chip suppliers by returning a portion of the cost cuts it demands from them each year during the life cycle of any car model under so-called annual cost-down programmes, the sources said.
Inventories of MCU chips - which often combine multiple technologies, CPUs, flash memory and other devices - are held for Toyota by parts suppliers such as Denso, which is partially owned by Toyota Group, chip makers like Renesas and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, and chip traders.
While there are different kinds of MCUs, those in short supply now are not cutting-edge chips but more mainstream ones with semiconductor nodes ranging from 28 to 40 nanometres, the sources said. 
Toyota's continuity plans for chips has also cushioned it from the impact of natural disasters exacerbated by climate change, such as fiercer typhoons and rain storms which often cause floods and landslides across Japan, including the southern Kyushu region manufacturing hub where Renesas also makes chips.
One of the sources involved in semiconductor supply, said Toyota and its affiliates had become ""extra risk averse and sensitive"" to the impact of climate change. But natural disasters and are not the only threat on the horizon.
Automakers fear there will be more disruptions to chip supplies because of rising demand as cars become more digital and electric, as well as fierce rivalry for chips from makers of smart phones to computers to aircraft to industrial robots.
The sources said Toyota has another advantage over some rivals when it comes to chips thanks to its long-standing policy of ensuring it understands all the technology used in its cars, rather than relying on suppliers to provide ""black boxes"".
""This basic approach sets us apart,"" said one of the sources, a Toyota engineer.
""From what causes flaws in semiconductors to gory details about production processes like what gases and chemicals you use to make the process work, we understand the technology inside and out. It's a different level of knowledge that you can't simply gain if you're just buying those technologies.""
'LOSING OUR GRIP?'
There has been an explosion in the use of semiconductors and digital technologies by automakers this century thanks to the rise of hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as autonomous driving and connected car functions.
Those innovations require even more computing power and use in part a new category of semiconductors called system on a chip, or SoC, which roughly speaking combines multiple CPUs on one logic board.
The technology is so new and specialised many carmakers have left it to big parts suppliers to manage the risks.
In keeping with its no black box approach, however, Toyota developed a deep in-house understanding of semiconductors to prepare for the launch of its successful Prius hybrid in 1997.
Years before, it poached engineering talent from the chip industry and opened a semiconductor plant in 1989 to help design and manufacture MCUs used to control Prius powertrain systems.
Toyota designed and manufactured its own MCUs and other chips for three decades until it transferred its chip-making plant to Denso in 2019 to consolidate the supplier's operations.
The four sources said Toyota's early drive to develop a deep understanding of semiconductor design and manufacturing processes was a major reason why it has managed to avoid being hit by the shortages, in addition to its continuity contracts. 
Two of the sources, however, said they were worried the Denso deal might indicate that Toyota was finally willing to ditch its no black box approach, even though the supplier is part of the broader Toyota Group.

1352,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 07:25PM ET</span>","In inclusivity push, Unilever to exclude word 'normal' from beauty products","By Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - Dove soap maker Unilever (NYSE:UL) will remove the word ""normal"" from its beauty and personal care products, as well as stop digital alterations of body shapes and skin colour of models used in its advertising in a push to be more inclusive.
The move from the London-based company, which is one of the top advertisers in the world, comes as it tries to move beyond the backlash it has faced for some of its advertising campaigns.
Unilever was pushed to rename its top selling skin-lightening brand in India to ""Glow & Lovely"" from ""Fair & Lovely"" last year after facing consumer ire over negatively stereotyping darker skin tones.
In 2017, the company faced a social media outcry over an advert for Dove body wash, which showed a black woman removing her top to reveal a white woman. (https://reut.rs/3cgXXTc)
More recently, an ad forced Unilever to pull all its TRESemmé haircare products from South African retail stores for 10 days due to a backlash.
""We know that removing 'normal' alone will not fix the problem, but we believe it is an important step towards a more inclusive definition of beauty,"" Sunny Jain, president of Unilever's beauty and personal care division told Reuters.
Globally, more than a hundred Unilever brands will have the word ""normal"" removed to describe skin type or hair texture, and replaced with terms such as ""grey hair"" for shampoos or ""moisture replenish"" for skin creams by March next year.
Unilever said a poll it conducted of about 10,000 people globally showed that more than half the respondents felt using ""normal"" to describe hair or skin made people feel excluded, while 70% said using the word in advertising had a negative impact.

The company also said it would stop digitally altering body shape, size, proportion and skin tones of models it uses in its own advertisements, or those of its paid influencers across all its brands, a move that started with the Dove brand in 2018.

1354,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 06:15PM ET</span>","GameStop jumps more than 40%, other 'meme stocks' rally on stimulus hopes","By Sinéad Carew and Manas Mishra
(Reuters) - Shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) jumped more than 40% on Monday and other so-called meme stocks rallied, lifted by news from the video game retailer and expectations that investors may plow funds from coming stimulus checks into the equity market.
GameStop shares last traded up 41.2% at $194.50, their highest closing level since Feb. 1, after the company tapped shareholder and Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) co-founder Ryan Cohen to spearhead a new committee to help the video game retail chain's transition to e-commerce. The stock was up as much as 53% at the session high.
Other stocks favored by retail investors on forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets also rallied. Some market watchers cited the U.S. Senate’s passage of a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill including $1,400 direct payments to Americans. 
""Maybe there's a thought that if people are going to get a lot of money in their stimulus checks, that some of it’s going into the stock market,” said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group. “Some of it might go into those same names that we saw in late January, those message board Reddit-type stocks.""
Retail investors surveyed by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) last month said they would put more than a third of their stimulus checks into the stock market, which could represent inflows of around $170 billion, the bank said in a research note. 
Retail buying of stocks and options has been among the factors driving markets higher over the past year, analysts said. Some 53% of respondents in the Deutsche Bank survey said they invested some funds from past stimulus checks in the stock market. 
Other stocks popular on Reddit also soared, with AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) up 15.4%, headphone maker Koss Corp climbing 27.5% and Rocket Companies up 3.0%.
The U.S. government should be able to start delivering $1,400 checks almost immediately once the aid bill is finalized and President Joe Biden signs it, tax experts say.
GameStop’s latest rally followed several wild swings in the share price from January. GameStop has become one of the hottest and most visible ""meme stocks"" followed on social media sites.
Cohen, a major shareholder who has pushed Gametop's move away from its brick-and-mortar model, joined the board in January shortly before a social media frenzy drove a meteoric rise in which GameStop shares surged more than 1,600%. 
Hedge funds that had bet against the stock were forced to unwind their short positions, a situation known as a ""short squeeze."" GameStop pared most of those gains the following month. 
Some analysts believe another short squeeze may be adding fuel to the stock's recent gains. Short interest in GameStop was valued at $1.9 billion, or 25.38% of the stock's float on Monday, compared to 32.56% about a week ago, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.
Over the past week, short bets worth $538 million were covered, Dusaniwsky said.
""Shorts will continue to be squeezed out of their positions as GME’s stock price continues to trend upwards,"" Dusaniwsky said in an email.
Recently, Cohen posted a cryptic tweet of an ice-cream cone, which some analysts viewed as a possible trigger for GameStop's most recent rally.
Cohen's RC Ventures activist firm reached a settlement with GameStop in January, giving Cohen seats on the company's board.
GameStop said its Strategic Planning and Capital committee will help drive the latest e-commerce push. Along with Cohen, the committee will include Alan Attal, a Chewy alumni who joined the board as part of the RC Ventures settlement, and another board member Kurt Wolf. 

GameStop's sales through brick-and-mortar stores are under increasing pressure, as more customers gravitate toward digital downloads of console games.

ARK's popular exchange traded funds have been battered by a recent shift away from the high-flying technology stocks that led markets higher for most of 2020, with the ARK Innovation exchange traded fund off 11% year-to-date.
""Right now the market is broadening out. In an underlying sense the bull market is strengthening and that will play to our benefit over the longer term,"" Wood told CNBC in an interview.
Wood shot to prominence over the last year with outsized bets on companies such as Tesla and Square that surged during the pandemic, attracting $14.84 billion in inflows over the past 12 months, according to Lipper data.
But technology stocks have faltered in recent weeks, as rising bond yields and expectations of an economic rebound spur a powerful rotation out of the ""stay-at-home"" names that drove markets higher for most of 2020 and into companies that would most benefit from an economic reopening.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq on Monday confirmed a correction as it closed 10% lower than its record close in February. (N)
Wood noted that the rapid increase in interest rates has ""shaken a lot of investors"" and helped trigger a rotation into value sectors which was has been ""part of the reason for Ark's setbacks.""
The stock picker also pointed to Invitae (NYSE:NVTA) Corp, another holding which is getting ""hammered"" despite being ""one of the most important companies in the genomic revolution."" Shares of the ETF's top holding,  Tesla Motors  (NASDAQ:TSLA), fell 5.8% on Monday and are off more than 20% this year.
""We're becoming more and more optimistic about our portfolios in the selloff,"" Wood said.
The Ark ETF lost 5.8% on Monday and is 29.6% below its record close of Feb. 12.

Yuan, who is also the chief executive officer of the company, transferred roughly 40% of his stake in the company to unspecified beneficiaries, Zoom disclosed in a filing late on Friday.
The transfers come as Zoom's shares have nearly tripled in the past 12 months, as the COVID-19 pandemic drove an increasing number of students and professionals to connect online.

The transfers were done in two tranches of about 9 million shares each and were shown as gifts, according to the filing.

1357,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 05:35PM ET</span>",Harley borrows Detroit's used-car playbook to pursue younger riders,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) has decided the best way to get younger customers to buy a new motorcycle is to sell them a used one first.
The Milwaukee-based company plans to roll out a certified pre-owned bike program, known as H-D Certified, adapting a strategy carmakers have been following for years to position well-tended used vehicles as a substitute for low-margin, ""entry-level"" new models.
Harley's embrace of used bikes is part of a new five-year turnaround strategy under Chief Executive Jochen Zeitz, and is the latest effort to expand the brand's appeal beyond middle-aged and affluent riders.
The 118-year-old American brand has been steadily losing U.S. market share amid declining retail sales for six years. (For a graphic on Harley's U.S. market share, click https://graphics.reuters.com/HARLEYDAVIDSON-USEDBIKES/dgkvlzonjvb/ )
But the demand for used Harleys, which are less expensive, has remained strong. Some dealers told Reuters that pre-owned bikes last year outsold new ones by three-to-one. 
Melissa Walters, owner of a Harley dealership in Fresno, California, says the coronavirus pandemic has led to an increased demand for outdoor recreational activity, but dealers are hard-pressed to find bikes to sell to customers.
""People are tired of staying home,"" she said. ""They want to go out and do something.""
That sentiment was echoed by over a dozen dealers in six states.
Data from industry consultant J.D. Power shows Harley was the most sought-after brand in the used big bikes market last year, boosting bets the certified program will draw in new customers. 
For Harley, it offers a way to build brand loyalty and attract new customers without engineering and manufacturing new lower-cost bikes, which tend to have lower profit margins.
""We believe this program will drive Harley-Davidson desirability, increase sales and margins, and enhance the overall customer experience while supporting growth,"" Zeitz told Reuters.
Under the pre-owned bike program, which was revealed last month, Harley will certify motorcycles up to five years old with up to 25,000 miles (40,234 km). Certified bikes will be inspected and backed by a 12-month limited warranty, and can be financed by Harley's financial arm, distinguishing them from other used Harleys.
While the heavyweight motorcycle maker has a similar program in the United Kingdom, this is the first time it is entering the used marketplace in the United States - its biggest market.
The program will be launched in late April and over 300 dealers have expressed interest in participating so far, Harley told Reuters.
""It's going to draw new riders ... and will give them entry into the Harley-Davidson world,"" said Brad Conn, marketing coordinator at an Indiana-based dealership that plans to sign up for the program. 
A POTENTIAL REVENUE STREAM
In the auto industry, according to J.D. Power, similar programs offer higher profit to dealers with faster inventory turnover. J.D. Power's data also shows the programs are more effective in cultivating brand loyalty and tend to generate more business for the financial arms of automakers, which fund the vehicle purchases. 
James Hardiman, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said the secondary motorcycle market has become a big business over the last decade and could be a ""significant"" revenue stream for Harley.
In 2017, online retailer for pre-owned vehicles RumbleOn Inc pegged the value of the used motorcycle market in the United States at $7.5 billion a year, with Harley bikes accounting for more than half of sales. The study also showed customers aged 18-34 were buying three used Hogs for every new one.
NEW VERSUS OLD 
A booming demand for pre-owned Harleys until now has been a drag on the company's U.S. retail sales, which have declined by nearly 40% since 2014. 
As its motorcycles do not wear out or go out of fashion quickly, used Harleys tend to be more in demand vis-à-vis pricey new models.
Zeitz has tried to address the problem in the past year by tightening the supplies of new bikes. Leaner new inventory together with the increased demand for outdoor sports have driven up the prices of pre-owned bikes.
Still, the company estimates there are 3 million unsold used Harleys in the United States, far more than the approximately 80,000 new bikes it shipped last year. 
""The biggest competition for a new Harley-Davidson bike is not an Indian bike or a Honda, or a Suzuki bike, but is a used Harley-Davidson bike,"" said Hardiman.
Faced with a similar situation in the 1990s, automakers launched certified programs to resell thousands of returned leased vehicles to first-time and budget-minded buyers. 
The programs allowed them to scrap less-expensive entry-level models, which had razor-thin profit margins, freeing up resources for more profitable products.
Harley is pursuing similar goals. It has done away with some of the cheaper entry-level models and will ramp up investment in touring, large cruiser and trike bike segments that drive company profit.
It is also looking to increase sales of ancillary products such as accessories, general merchandise and financial services by leveraging the certified bike program.
Michael Uhlarik, founder and lead consultant at Motorcycle Global, reckons the certified program is aimed at replacing lost motorcycle revenue from falling shipments.
Harley's bike shipments to dealers in the United States have dropped more than 60% from the 206,000 units in 2008. 

""It will never be a 200,000 vehicle-a-year company,"" said Uhlarik. ""They have to replace that lost revenue somewhere.""

(Reuters) - Technology-related shares sold off on Monday in a big downturn that pushed the Nasdaq into corrective territory and offset stocks that rose on hopes the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill will spur the U.S. economy.
The big technology stocks that have led Wall Street to scale successive peaks over the past year's rally fell with the Nasdaq closing down 2.41%, roughly 10.5% below its Feb. 12 record close of 14,095.47.
Financial shares and restaurant and travel-related stocks that are expected to do well when the economy reopens rose but were unable to offset the weight of the bigger tech shares that dominate the U.S. stock market.
After the legislation won U.S. Senate approval on Saturday, President Joe Biden said he hoped for a quick passage of the revised coronavirus relief package by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives so he could sign it and send $1,400 direct payments to Americans.
Prospects of more government spending and faster economic growth have stoked fears of a spike in inflation, sending the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to near one-year highs.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, however, said on Monday the package would fuel a ""very strong"" U.S. recovery and she did not expect the economy to run too hot because of the increased spending.
    In the S&P 500, the financial sector was the biggest boost, hitting a record as higher market interest rates and a steeper yield curve helped banks. Industrials were right behind, also reaching a record high, while the materials sector neared an all-time peak. The technology sector was deepest in the red.
As bonds yields have moved higher, concerns about equity valuations for growth-oriented stocks and tech stocks specifically have weighed on the Nasdaq relentlessly the last three weeks, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. 
Financials, along with restaurant and travel-related stocks that will do well as the economy reopens, have been leading the charge higher, James said. 
“People have been reallocating assets into those sectors. It's been coming out of growth-tech to fund that those purchases,” he said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 306.14 points, or 0.97%, to 31,802.44, the S&P 500 lost 20.59 points, or 0.54%, to 3,821.35 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 310.99 points, or 2.41%, to 12,609.16.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 14.03 billion shares. 
A slide in the big tech stocks that have driven the rally in equities since pandemic-induced lows of last March continued, with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc’s Google leading declining shares on Nasdaq.
Tech stocks are particularly sensitive to rising yields because their value rests heavily on earnings in the future, which are discounted more deeply when bond returns go up. The divergence between the tech stocks and non-tech stocks explains trading today, said Joe Saluzzi, partner and co-founder of Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. ""The stimulus package will be certainly helping the bigger cap names,"" Saluzzi said, referring to non-tech stocks. ""The get-out and non-stay at home stocks are doing better now,"" he said.
Banks added about 2% as the yield on the benchmark 10-year note stood near a 13-month high, while airlines jumped about 5%.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co jumped about 6% as California health officials set new rules that would allow Disneyland and other theme parks, stadiums and outdoor entertainment venues to reopen as early as April 1.
 GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) surged about 42% after the company said it had tapped shareholder Ryan Cohen to lead a transition to an e-commerce business.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.39-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 124 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 405 new highs and 28 new lows.

1359,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 04:42PM ET</span>","GameStop, Roblox Listing, Covid Relief: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Lately, it’s been a tale of two stock markets.
On the one side: industrial and cyclical stocks that are roaring back on optimism over the reopening trade On the other: the tech stocks that had driven the bull market for the last three years.
At one point it seemed impossible to keep pace with the major indexes without the big tech names, but that’s not necessarily the case now. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are among the tech stocks that stumbled, pulling the NASDAQ Composite down more than 2%.
Now we have to wait for the dip-buyers to show up. Bargain hunting tech stock investors have turned the tables in previous tech pullbacks. 
There is a lull in between earnings season as thoughts turn to warmer spring weather, the spread of vaccines to more people, and dreams of vacation travel at some point in the not-so-distant future.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. GameStop's new strategy: ecommerce
 GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) surged 35% on Monday after  Chewy Inc  (NYSE:CHWY) founder and board member of the electronics retailer unveiled a new ecommerce strategy. It’s the latest twist in the weird trading frenzy that has caught GameStop in a back and forth between retail traders and professional managers who had bet heavily against the stock.
Ryan Cohen, who invested in GameStop last year and took a board seat, will be leading the effort to transform the company. GameStop shares are up nearly 1000% this year. Cohen, the Chewy founder, is reportedly the reason GameStop’s CFO Jim Bell will depart later this month. Investors will be watching to see whether GameStop shares will take a breather.
2. Direct listing for Roblox
Roblox, maker of a gaming platform people can use to play other people’s games, is set to raise money selling 198 million shares at $43 a piece in a direct listing this week after previously delaying an IPO. The listing could value the company at $29 billion.
Why didn’t Roblox go public earlier? The December debuts of Airbnb and Door Dash -- which both soared on their opening days -- made it hard to properly value the shares. Direct listing is a relatively new way to go public that cuts out the Wall Street underwriter, allowing the market to set the price.
3. Biden's stimulus plan comes to a vote
The House will have the final vote on President Joe Biden’s Covid relief bill on Tuesday after it passed the Senate with some revisions. That clears the path for the president to sign it by next week, before some unemployment benefits run out.
Stocks have been reacting to the reopening trade, and the prospect of $1,400 checks to individuals earning up to $80,000 means more spending could come. That would benefit retailers such as  Kohls Corp  (NYSE:KSS),  Target  Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) and potentially give a boost to online used car dealers like  CarMax Inc  (NYSE:KMX).

Investing.com – The Dow closed higher after hitting an intraday record on Monday, as reopening stocks like industrials and financials climbed on bets for a sharp uptick in growth ahead of $1.9 trillion fiscal boost that is expected to pass this week. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.97%, or 305 points, and had hit a intraday record of 32,148.04, and the S&P 500 fell 0.50%, Nasdaq Composite fell 2.41%.
The Senate passed the $1.9 trillion stimulus plan on Sunday, and the House will vote on the bill on Tuesday, with many expecting the legislation to be signed into law by March 14 to ensure unemployment relief programs, set to expire in mid-March, don't lapse.
The Senate package includes direct payments of $1,400 per person for families earnings less than $160,000 per year or individuals earning less than $80,000 per year.
""This is a bill that will really provide Americans the relief they need to get to the other side of the pandemic, and we expect the resources here to really fuel a very strong economic recovery,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in an interview on MSNBC.
The ongoing backdrop for a stronger recovery supported cyclical stocks, which move in tandem with the economy. Materials, industrials, and financials were higher, with latter led by an uptick in the United States 5-Year.
The sharp uptick in rates continued to weigh on tech stocks, but some investors appear to be positioning for a rebound in the sector amid fading fears that the melt-up in rates will be disorderly.
""Our expectation for an improving economic outlook, coupled with strong fiscal stimulus, has the potential to inject near-term inflation concerns into fixed-income markets,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said. ""We expect that the increase in long-term rates will be orderly,.""
Wells Fargo lifted its 2021 S&P 500 Index earnings per share estimates to $190 from $175. ""We expect that our upwardly revised GDP growth forecast will feed directly into corporate revenues. We look for these positives, coupled with sizeable operating leverage, to boost earnings well beyond record levels set in 2019,"" Wells Fargo.
Mega cap tech stocks briefly moved off lows of the day, before resuming their decline.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com were lower.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) added Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) the stock to its conviction buy list, citing a boost from the ongoing digital transformation trend.
Energy, meanwhile, was lagging the broader market rally as oil prices gave up gains following a rally on news that Saudi Arabia's oil facilities were attacked on Sunday.

Tesla is now down almost 30% since the Nasdaq peaked on Feb. 12, reducing its gain in the past six months to about 43%. Since Feb. 12, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is down about 13%, with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook Inc down less than 10%. 
Since Tesla announced on Feb. 8 that it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoins, its stock has steadily fallen, while the price of bitcoin has climbed over 10%. Tesla said it bought the bitcoins during January, and if it hypothetically bought them at the mid-point price of about $45,000 for that month, its investment could now be worth around $1.7 billion, according to Reuters calculations.

Investing.com – The Dow hit all-time highs on Monday, as investors upped bets on cyclical stocks offsetting a malaise in tech as the economy is set for a further boost after the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus relief package.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.32%, or 416 points, and had hit a intraday record of 32,148.04, and the S&P 500 fell 0.12%, Nasdaq Composite fell 2.06%.
The $1.9 trillion stimulus package, which is expected to signed into law before a March 14 deadline to renew unemployment support measures, stoked investor optimism of a more robust economic recovery.
""This is a bill that will really provide Americans the relief they need to get to the other side of the pandemic, and we expect the resources here to really fuel a very strong economic recovery,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in an interview on MSNBC.
The ongoing backdrop for a stronger recovery supported cyclical stocks, which move in tandem with the economy. Materials, industrials, and financials were higher, with latter led by an uptick in United States 5-Year.
The sharp uptick in rates continued to weigh on tech stocks, but some investors appear to be positioning for a rebound in the sector amid fading fears that the melt-up in rates will be disorderedly.
""Our expectation for an improving economic outlook, coupled with strong fiscal stimulus, has the potential to inject near-term inflation concerns into fixed-income markets,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said. ""We expect that the increase in long-term rates will be orderly,.""
Wells Fargo lifted its 2021 S&P 500 Index earnings per share estimates to $190 from $175. ""We expect that our upwardly revised GDP growth forecast will feed directly into corporate revenues. We look for these positives, coupled with sizable operating leverage, to boost earnings well beyond record levels set in 2019,"" Wells Fargo.
Mega cap tech stocks briefly moved off lows of the day, before resuming their decline.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com were lower.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) added Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) the stock to its conviction buy list, citing a boost from the ongoing digital transformation trend.
Energy, meanwhile, was lagging the broader market rally as oil prices gave up gains following a rally on news that Saudi Arabia's oil facilities were attacked on Sunday.
In other news, GameStop (NYSE:GME) rallied 33% after the company appointed board member and Chewy.com (NYSE:CHWY) founder Ryan Cohen, to lead a new committee on the company's transition to become an e-commerce business."
1363,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 03:09PM ET</span>",Refiners Are Emerging from Deep Freeze and Buying U.S. Oil Again,"(Bloomberg) -- Physical oil prices in the U.S. are rebounding to levels seen before a deep freeze hit Texas last month, showing fuel-making plants are thirsty for crude again.
Seven of 18 refineries affected by the cold blast -- making up over 2 million barrels a day of crude processing capacity -- were operating normally as of Monday. Mars Blend, a regional sour crude benchmark, traded this month at the largest premium to Nymex oil futures in nearly three weeks, while other key grades also firmed. Another reason for the strength is due to increased demand for U.S. crude from overseas buyers after OPEC+’s surprise decision to continue limiting supply.
As much as 5.5 million barrels a day of crude processing capacity was suspended when arctic temperatures in the U.S. south halted power supply and damaged equipment at refineries in America’s energy hub in February. Crude inventories piled up by a record 22 million barrels as a result. Since then, plants including those operated by Motiva Enterprises LLC and  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO). have restarted, and the rest of the sites will likely resume operation this week.
Buying is popping up from South Korea, India, Canada and Europe, although interest from China has been muted because of high inventories. With OPEC producers keeping supply cuts in place in April, some customers that were expecting available supply from Middle East producers, especially of medium-high sulfur crudes, may have to seek alternatives like Mars Blend or Poseidon.
Saudi Arabia’s decision to increase official selling prices for its April supply to Asia and the U.S. could also spur additional purchases of U.S. sour crudes.

1364,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 02:40PM ET</span>",Apollo Global to buy insurance affiliate Athene for $11 billion,"By David French and Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) - Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc said on Monday it will merge with Athene Holding (NYSE:ATH) Ltd in an $11 billion all-stock deal, bringing in-house an annuities provider that helped turn it into one of the world's largest corporate credit investors.
Apollo has been getting paid lucrative fees by Athene, in which it controls a 35% stake, for more than a decade, providing asset allocation services and directly managing a portion of Athene's assets across its investment platform, primarily in its ever-expanding credit business. 
Yet Athene's shares underperformed the insurance sector following its stock market debut in 2016, prompting a bid from Apollo for its assets.
Apollo estimated the tax-free combination could result in its earnings more than doubling from 2020. Its existing stake in Athene did not contribute to earnings under accounting rules, despite representing 40% of Apollo's assets under management and 30% of its fee-related income.
A merger would allow Athene's business and assets to be integrated into Apollo's, providing both sides with enhanced earnings potential and a simpler ownership structure going forward, Marc Rowan, Apollo's incoming chief executive officer, told an analysts call.
""This transaction is about coordination, not consolidation. There is no plan to consolidate the businesses. There is no need to consolidate the businesses,"" said Rowan, who helped set up Athene in 2009. 
Rowan, who co-founded Apollo 31 years ago, has been tasked with running the New York-based firm after board Chairman Leon Black said in January he would step down as chief executive by July, following an independent review of his ties to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Buyout firms have been increasingly focused on the insurance space, with KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR), Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) and Sixth Street Partners all making significant acquisitions in the last year.
Under terms of the deal, each outstanding class A common share of Athene will be exchanged for 1.149 shares of Apollo common stock, representing a premium of about 16.5% to Athene's closing share price on Friday.
The company's shares were up 6.6% at $52.09 on Monday afternoon while Apollo shares were down 4.2% at $47.50.
Existing Apollo shareholders will own about 76% of the combined company, and Athene investors will own the rest. The deal is expected to be completed in January 2022.
Apollo also said the conflicts committee of its board has approved changes that would result in a simpler, more transparent corporate structure that is expected to be put in place by January 2022. 
The private equity firm said last month it would look in to changing its corporate governance structure, getting rid of shares with special voting rights that currently give Black and other co-founders effective control of the firm. 

Athene also serves as Apollo's partner insurance company and had total assets worth $202.8 billion at the end of 2020, with operations in the United States, Bermuda, and Canada.

1365,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 02:36PM ET</span>","Fully vaccinated people can gather without masks indoors, should still avoid travel: U.S. says","By Jeff Mason and Carl O'Donnell
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - People who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can meet without masks indoors in small groups with others who have been inoculated but should avoid non-essential travel and continue to wear face-coverings in public, the Biden administration said on Monday.
In a long-awaited update of its guidance for behaviors to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said fully vaccinated people could also meet in small groups with unvaccinated individuals deemed at low-risk for severe COVID-19 from one other household without masks.
The slight lifting of restrictions represented a still cautious approach to public health guidance despite the quickly growing number of vaccinated people. President Joe Biden has urged Americans to remain vigilant and continue to follow CDC guidelines to prevent another surge of cases. 
The CDC said fully vaccinated people should continue to follow many precautions such as avoiding big in-person gatherings, wearing masks when visiting with unvaccinated people from multiple households or wearing masks when with people at risk for severe COVID-19.
CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told reporters it was important to protect those who have not been vaccinated and remain vulnerable while some 60,000 new coronavirus cases occur every day.
""We remain in the midst of a serious pandemic, and still over 90 percent of our population is not fully vaccinated,"" she said. ""Therefore, everyone whether vaccinated or not, should continue to avoid medium- and large-sized gatherings as well as non-essential travel.""
More than 525,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the United States. Biden, who took office on Jan. 20, has encouraged Americans to wear masks for his first 100 days as president, a contrast from the approach by former President Donald Trump, who downplayed the pandemic and eschewed masks. Some states have begun to lift restrictions on a large scale. 
Many Americans eager to get back to their pre-pandemic way of life see vaccinations as a way to do that. Businesses, particularly in the travel and hospitality industry, are hopeful that a growing number of vaccinated people will feel comfortable flying and dining out again.
'AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP'
The new guidelines address how vaccinated people can safely resume some more normal activities and contacts with those outside their households while the coronavirus is still widely circulating, but they did not represent a large shift. 
""Today's action represents an important first step. It is not our final destination,"" Walensky said. ""As more people get vaccinated, levels of COVID-19 infection decline in communities, and as our understanding of COVID immunity accrues, we look forward to updating these recommendations to the public.""
The recommendations come as about 30 million people, or 9.2% of the U.S. population, have been fully inoculated with COVID-19 vaccines made by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/ BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), according to CDC data. 
Nearly 18% of the U.S. population, or 58.9 million adults had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.
The new guidelines were ""reasonable and quite appropriate,"" said Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean at the Emory School of Medicine. ""We need to start telling people what to do, and in that, the guidelines are pretty clear."" 
Currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines prevent people from becoming ill but not necessarily from being infected. Data on whether vaccinated people can still spread the virus to unprotected people is sparse, and Walensky warned that the risk vaccinated people could spread the disease remained. 

The CDC last month said vaccinated individuals could skip the standard 14-day quarantine after exposure to someone with COVID-19, as long as they remain asymptomatic.

He met Italian unions of the former Fiat Chrysler business in late January, launching a charm offensive amid fears in Italy that Stellantis's centre of gravity could shift towards France after the combination.

But he will have to find the right balance to preserve interests between France, Italy and the rest of Europe.

Cohen, a director at the video-game retailer, will chair a new board committee tasked with the transformation, the company said in a statement Monday, confirming an earlier report by Bloomberg News. The new strategic planning and capital allocation committee will be comprised of Cohen, Alan Attal and Kurt Wolf, GameStop said.
Its shares soared as much as 20%, adding to gains that had pushed the stock up more than threefold over the prior two weeks. GameStop has become a favorite of traders populating Reddit forums, whipsawing the shares recently as investors flocked to it in a short squeeze.
The new committee will be tasked with hiring executives to lead its customer care and e-commerce fulfillments, as well as finding a new chief technology officer and a new chief financial officer with technology and e-commerce experience. The committee will also identify opportunities to transform the company into a technology business and help improve shareholder returns.
It’s also responsible for evaluating areas that include GameStop’s current operational objectives, capital structure and allocation priorities, digital capabilities, organizational footprint, and personnel, the company said.
Cohen began pushing last year to transform GameStop into a more direct competitor to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., drawing on his success building Chewy into a pet-supply giant that sold for $3 billion. He won three seats on GameStop’s board earlier this year.
The activist investor joined the board of GameStop in January along with two allies. Cohen’s RC Ventures owns a roughly 13% stake in the video-game seller, and has pressed the company to undertake a strategic review to cut costs and to increase the variety of products and services it offers, and to transform from a brick-and-mortar retailer into an e-commerce company.
Enough #Gamestonk. The Real GameStop Is Worth a Look: Tae Kim
CFO Jim Bell was pushed out last month in a disagreement over strategy, a move investors took as a sign the video-game retailer is on the comeback trail.
Last week, the stock jumped after Cohen tweeted an apparent screenshot from a Pets.com television ad, with some Twitter users speculating that the image was a cryptic message about GameStop’s outlook.

1372,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 11:40AM ET</span>",Jet leasing shake-up looms as AerCap and GE unit discuss tie-up,"By Tim Hepher, Laurence Frost and Rachit Vats
(Reuters) - Aircraft leasing is poised for its biggest shake-up in almost a decade as its top two players AerCap and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s GECAS discuss a deal to forge an industry titan with more than 2,000 jets, financial sources said on Monday.
Talks over a tie-up follow years of speculation over a sale of GECAS and come as COVID-19 is expected to shift more of the world's jetliner fleet from the balance sheets of debt-laden airlines into the arms of the $60 billion leasing industry.
Aircraft lessors, who typically rent out aircraft for up to 12 years at a time, already account for about half of deliveries of jets built by Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA).
The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the possible deal, said the transaction could be worth $30 billion and that an announcement could come as early as Monday.
The two sides have been in discussions since late last year, one of the sources said.
General Electric (GE) said it did not comment on speculation. AerCap did not respond to requests for comment.
New York-listed shares in Ireland's AerCap jumped as much as 15% in early trading before stabilising with a gain of 12%. Shares in GE rose 2.8%, outpacing a mixed U.S. market.
AMBITIOUS EXPANSION
AerCap is the world's largest owner of commercial aircraft, with 1,080 jets directly on its books or managed on behalf of others. GECAS has 984 aircraft owned or under management, according to UK-based consultancy IBA Group.
The proposed tie-up would mark AerCap's most ambitious expansion under tenacious Chief Executive Aengus Kelly, who in 2013 struck a deal to buy its largest rival, Los Angeles-based International Lease Finance Corp, after the financial crisis.
It would also involve the latest move by GE Chief Executive Larry Culp to offload businesses and reduce debt since he took the reins of the struggling conglomerate in 2018. GE has already taken steps to reduce its exposure to aircraft financing.
Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard said the resulting behemoth would be the ""mother of all leasing companies"".
However, if a deal goes ahead, its sheer size could attract attention from antitrust regulators because AerCap and GECAS are already almost twice as big in fleet terms as the sector's third-largest player, Dublin-based Avolon, analysts said.
""The main question mark will be around the antitrust implications,"" said Bertrand Grabowski, a former senior aviation banker turned independent adviser.
""One option for AerCap will be to dispose of several hundred airplanes over time to comply with possible antitrust requirements,"" he added.
CONSOLIDATION 
A mega-merger in leasing could also spur further consolidation in a sector that has featured multiple takeovers in recent years.
""They will all be thinking there’s probably going to be more consolidation,"" IBA Group President Phil Seymour said of smaller lessors, adding that this was the ""natural impact of a downcycle"".
The structure of any deal to acquire GECAS was not immediately clear, but several sources predicted that it would be based on a similar stock structure to that by which ILFC's owner, insurer AIG (NYSE:AIG), become a shareholder in the new AerCap.
Major leasing companies are eyeing growth as airlines focus on repairing balance sheets wrecked by the drop in air travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, even though vaccines have prompted some talk of recovery.
Singapore bank DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY) said it expected aircraft lessors would largely emerge stronger from the crisis, but it warned that the weak finances of airlines meant some lessors would face extra problems collecting money from carriers or be forced to accept payment delays.

1373,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 11:30AM ET</span>","Greensill Capital files for insolvency, administrators appointed","LONDON (Reuters) - Greensill Capital filed for insolvency on Monday, its administrators said, days after losing investor funding and insurance coverage for its supply chain financing business. 
Grant Thornton said in a statement that three members of its restructuring team had been appointed as joint administrators of Greensill Capital (UK) Limited and Greensill Capital Management Company. 
Greensill, founded in 2011 by former  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) banker Lex Greensill, helped companies manage their finances by paying suppliers on their behalf and collecting the money later on.
However, its business unravelled rapidly after  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said it was winding down $10 billion of funds mostly invested in notes backed by Greensill due to concerns about how some underlying assets were valued.
The administrators will first address which parts of the business can be sold on immediately. 
Grant Thornton said the administrators were in ""continued discussion with an interested party in relation to the purchase of certain Greensill Capital assets"". 
Two sources familiar with the matter have said that Athene Holding (NYSE:ATH), a partner company of U.S. private equity giant Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc, is in talks to buy some of Greensill's business. 
Apollo and Athene declined to comment. 
The collapse of Greensill, whose founder received a state honour from Britain in 2018 for his services to the economy, could lead to a series of regulatory investigations and cause financing problems for its higher-risk borrowers.
Greensill said it had provided more than $143 billion of financing in 2019 to 10 million customers and suppliers.
In Germany, where Greensill runs a bank, financial regulator BaFin has filed a criminal complaint with prosecutors in Bremen, where the lender is based. The precise details of the complaint are not known. 
BaFin also suspended Greensill Bank's operations saying there was an imminent risk it could become bankrupt. The German bank kept Greenshill Capital's short-term loans on its balance sheet before they were securitised and sold to Credit Suisse.
Several German municipalities have flagged that they have put millions of euros into Greensill Bank, attracted by its lack of negative interest rates, and some are calling on the federal government to cover any losses. 
BaFin said an audit found that Greensill Bank could not provide evidence of receivables on its balance sheet purchased from mining tycoon Sanjeev Gupta's GFG Alliance. GFG has not responded to requests for comment on BaFin's findings.
In Britain, meanwhile, the financial regulator has taken action against GFG's own trade finance arm Wyelands Bank. 

The Bank of England's Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Regulation Authority said it had ordered Wyelands to repay all its depositors, without specifying why. GFG has declined to comment on the matter.

1375,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 10:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Canada eyes tighter rules for grow-your-own pot producers,"By Shariq Khan
(Reuters) - Canada's health regulator will launch a public consultation program on Monday in its draft guidance for individuals growing medical cannabis at home, hoping to clamp down on people selling weed on the black market.
In the draft document sent to some industry figures and seen by Reuters ahead of publication, Health Canada highlights recent police raids and arrests at production sites where people were using licenses to ""cover and support large-scale illegal production and sale"".
The move also comes as Health Canada tries to set right a relatively unstable official market, where illegal sales are one factor undermining the business plans of the dozens of producers and distributors set up over the past five years.
""Abuse of the medical purposes framework undermines the integrity of the system that many patients and health care practitioners rely on to access cannabis to address their medical needs,"" Health Canada said in the document.
The draft guidance for the first time sets out factors that the regulator may consider in refusing or revoking a registration for ""personal production"". Factors include authorization of unjustified amounts and ""criminal activity and/or diversion of cannabis"".
Health Canada could not be immediately reached for comment.
Canada in 2018 was the first major country to legalize cannabis but its programs have since run into a myriad of troubles.
Households spent more than C$3.1 billion buying non-medical pot from illicit channels last year versus C$2.9 billion of legal purchases, according to Statistics Canada data.
Graphic: Black markets plague Canadian cannabis - https://graphics.reuters.com/CANADA-CANNABIS/nmovazxjmpa/chart.png
In January, Ontario Provincial Police seized over 180,000 cannabis plants and numerous vehicles and firearms by raiding illegal cultivation facilities, many of which exploit Health Canada's personal medical weed cultivation licenses.
Under the rules, people using cannabis for medical purposes must get a daily amount authorized by medical care practitioners - doctors, nurses and social workers - to either be bought from official retailers or grown personally.
Health Canada said in December it was seeing a surge in the amount of pot personal cultivators were being authorized to grow.
Personal cultivators are allowed to grow as much as 36 grams per day on average, compared with just 2 grams authorized for daily purchase from retailers.

Health Canada will invite ""interested stakeholders"" to comment in the public consultation, expected to run for 60 days through May 7, with the aim of improving the programs' operation and judging what factors it should consider when assessing risks to public health, the guidance said.

After the end of the two-month period, the regulator plans to finalize the guidance and make it public.

LONDON (Reuters) - Deliveroo announced plans to launch what could be the biggest London listing in more than seven years on Monday, after the British food delivery firm's business surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, although it still posted a loss for 2020.
The initial public offering (IPO) is expected to value Deliveroo at more than $7 billion, based on a $180 million private funding round completed in January with backers including minority shareholder Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), the world's most valuable company. 
That would make it the biggest London IPO by market cap since  Royal Mail  (LON:RMG) in 2013.
The announcement is the latest in a busy start to London's IPO season, with footwear brand Dr. Martens and greeting card retailer Moonpig completing high profile deals earlier this year and online review platform Trustpilot in the process of marketing an IPO. 
In an accompanying trading update, Deliveroo said it had grown the total number of transactions processed on its online platform, the so-called Gross Transaction Value, by 64.3% last year to 4.1 billion pounds from 2.5 billion in 2019.
The closure of restaurants except for takeaway and delivery services for parts of the year during the COVID-19 pandemic fuelled a surge in Deliveroo business, and founder Will Shu believes the shift will last. 
""We feel confident of the behaviour of our new consumer base,"" he told Reuters. ""For example, when lockdown was lifted last summer...we continued to grow.""
He believes the company's expansion into the grocery sector will also drive business, along with offerings such as a new monthly subscription service. 
The company believes the restaurant and grocery sectors represent an addressable market of 1.2 trillion pounds in Deliveroo's 12 markets, of which just 3% of sales are currently estimated to be online.
That said, Deliveroo was still operating at an underlying loss of 223.7 million pounds ($308.93 million) in 2020, although down from 317.3 million pounds in 2019. This hasn't been a hurdle for tech IPOs in New York, and is not expected to dampen enthusiasm for Deliveroo's London listing. 
""There's a large amount of money sloshing around and looking for growth - the IPO market is not sensitive to profit,"" said Professor John Colley, associate dean of Warwick Business School.
""But it will be several years before Deliveroo makes a profit, and while they ultimately may make some money, it's difficult to see how they will justify the valuations being talked about currently,"" he added. 
CLASS SYSTEM
The company confirmed it plans to use a dual-class share structure that will give founder Shu more control over the company. 
This means it will have a ""standard"" listing upon entry into the London Stock Exchange, rather than a premium one, excluding it from the FTSE indices. 
However, this could change if recommendations made in a recent review of listing rules by former EU Commissioner Jonathan Hill are implemented. 
""It's obviously great news that Deliveroo, a global technology leader, born and bred in the UK, has chosen to list here,"" Hill said in a statement provided by Deliveroo. ""The changes we recommended would make it easier for more companies to follow Deliveroo's lead, sending out a message that London is open for business.""

1379,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 08:06AM ET</span>",Pandemic tames Airbnb in Europe's tourist hotspots - for now,"By Victoria Waldersee
LISBON (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic has achieved what many mayors across Europe have tried and failed to do: wipe out tens of thousands of Airbnbs from city centres and so help lower rental costs for locals, in some places by as much as 15%. 
While Europe's cities have long welcomed tourists, critics say the surge of properties listed on short-lettings site Airbnb in recent years had priced many locals out of their own housing markets, turning historic neighbourhoods into soulless spaces. 
Property management companies and landlords contacted by Reuters in cities including Lisbon, Barcelona, Prague, and Venice said the collapse of tourism in the pandemic meant some hosts had now replaced holidaymakers with mid- to long-term tenants, moved in themselves, or given up properties altogether. 
Data from holiday rental analytics firm AirDNA showed the number of Airbnb listings with at least one night booked or available in the past month in Europe's 50 largest cities plunged 21.9% year-on-year in 2020.
Airbnb says it has adapted to changing travel patterns, with people heading to smaller towns and cities rather than tourist hotspots. ""We had more listings in France, Germany, Portugal, Spain and the Czech Republic combined at the end of 2020 than the end of 2019,"" spokesperson Andreu Castellano told Reuters.
While some hosts in major European city destinations plan to return to Airbnb when tourists come back, others have left the holiday-let business for good.  
""If tourism had come back faster, maybe I wouldn't have taken this decision. But I can't go another year without a clear sense of when money is coming in,"" said Vanessa Rola, 40, who was renting four apartments in Lisbon's Graça district on travel platforms including Airbnb. Without tourists, she couldn't pay her own rent, and is in the process of ending her contracts.
In Venice, where AirDNA data showed year-on-year bookings for Airbnb and rival Vrbo combined were down 67% in January, residents' activists are urging the government to seize the opportunity to help locals by, for example, capping rental days and converting empty space into low-cost housing. 
""Before the pandemic, renting in Venice had become almost impossible for normal people,"" Marco Gasparinetti from residents' rights group Gruppo 25 Aprile told Reuters, blaming short-term lets for pushing up prices. The city of just 60,000 residents is normally visited by 20 million tourists a year. 
""There are 30,000 people who commute to Venice every day but can't afford to live here. Now that could change and help make sure Venice is not just an open-air theme park for tourists."" 
Graphic: Sliding market - https://graphics.reuters.com/AIRBNB-EUROPE/CITIES/azgpoeoaepd/airbnb-reservations.jpg
DISAPPEARING LISTINGS 
Last month, Airbnb reported better-than-expected bookings in its first earnings release since going public, buoyed by countryside getaways and a rebound in demand in North America. Business was weakest in Europe, the Middle East and Africa amid COVID-19 lockdowns and travel curbs. 
For years, European mayors have struggled to rein in the proliferation of vacation properties in city centres, lacking the data to enforce limits on rental days or the number of properties in a building used for holiday lets. 
Airbnb,  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE), Tripadvisor and Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG).com agreed last March to share data with the European Union's statistics agency on the number of nights and guests booked, and 2020 figures are expected in the second half of this year, Eurostat said.
Last September, 22 mayors wrote to EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager urging her to extend data-sharing to city administrations, so they could ""secure the liveability of our neighbourhoods.""
""As tourism returns, we must make it sustainable - creating a model that isn't prohibitive to holiday lets but does have limits which ensure this is a city you can visit, but also where you can live and work,"" Ricardo Valente, a councillor in Porto - one of the signatory cities - told Reuters.
But COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions on cross-border travel are doing the job for some city authorities – at least for now. 
Graphic: Airbnb available listings - https://graphics.reuters.com/AIRBNB-EUROPE/CITIES/xlbvgdkjapq/airbnb-listings.jpg
In Lisbon, which saw huge growth in Airbnbs in the historic centre, around 5,000 of the city's roughly 25,000 listings have disappeared from the website during the pandemic, according to website Inside Airbnb.  
Rental prices fell by 15% between March and December 2020, according to real estate database Confidencial Imobiliario, attributed largely to the sudden availability of thousands of former holiday lets.
In Prague, Airbnb listings tumbled from just over 14,500 to less than 8,000, according to Inside Airbnb. Rents have fallen by around 8%, real estate developer Trigema reported.
""I was losing $20,000 a month, and regulation was making things very complicated,"" said Ondrej, a landlord in Prague who has sold his two Airbnb flats and given up the three he was renting to sublet. 
""The Airbnb boom is over.""
Airbnb, however, says it has proved resilient amid shifting demand. ""Guests are getting out of city centres and booking whole homes,"" Castellano said. ""The Airbnb platform inherently adapts to where demand is ... we adapt to guests' needs.""
GONE FOR GOOD? 
Not everyone in city centres is giving up. Data from Portugal shows that while thousands of properties have fallen off Airbnb, just 114 have given up their holiday-let licence – a coveted asset in the city's historic districts, where the local council prohibited new licences from being issued in 2019.  
Programmes attempting to lure Airbnb owners onto the social housing market through tax incentives and the promise of a five-year contract have so far seen slow uptake: just 34 properties in Lisbon and 12 in Porto, the city councils said. 
Instead, some landlords are using local letting websites or their own direct booking channels to find longer-term tenants. 
Airbnb released three videos last month entitled ""Made Possible By Hosts"", widely seen as an attempt to woo back those who had left the platform. 
But for some, the wait is unaffordable. AirDNA data showed forward bookings in Rome, Lisbon and Budapest were 85-90% below last year's levels at the end of March. By contrast, bookings across U.S. holiday rental platforms were just 2% below last year, their data showed. 
Eduardo Miranda, head of Portugal's holiday let association, expects around 15% of Airbnbs to stay off the market in Lisbon for good, even when tourism returns.   

""This is going to be another year of sacrifice,"" Miranda said. ""The best of this summer will be lost. And if the summer is lost, the year is lost. Those who stay in the business will be the ones who really care.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Monday, with the richly-valued tech sector likely hard hit as investors fret over higher Treasury yields and potential inflation in the wake of the Covid-19 relief bill passing through the Senate.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down just 2 points, or 0.01%, S&P 500 Futures traded 20 points, or 0.5%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 180 points, or 1.4%.
After much deliberation, the Senate passed President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan on Saturday, one of the largest stimulus packages in U.S. history. The bill will now move to a vote in the House on Tuesday, and then to Biden, who hopes to sign the bill before enhanced jobless benefits expire on March 14.
This followed Friday’s surge in U.S. employment, and adds to fears that this package will overheat the economy, leading to inflation and to the Federal Reserve tightening policies more quickly than had previously been envisaged.
The yield on the benchmark 10-Year has risen sharply in recent weeks. It currently stands at 1.60%, just off Friday’s 1.62% high - levels not seen since the start of the pandemic.
Both Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have downplayed the rise in long-term Treasury yields, saying they are a sign of expectations for a stronger recovery, not of increased inflation concerns.
It’s the tech sector, full of stocks with very high valuations, which is suffering the most, with the Nasdaq Composite index falling for three straight weeks. Investors appear to be rotating out of the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) into cyclical plays that should benefit as economies reopen.
Elsewhere in the corporate sector,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) will be in focus Monday after the Wall Street Journal reported that the industrial conglomerate was nearing a $30 billion-plus deal to combine its jet-leasing unit with AerCap  (NYSE:AER).  
Adding to inflationary concerns has been the rise in crude prices, which continued Monday in the wake of a series of attacks on key Saudi Arabian oil facilities.
Yemeni Houthi forces launched missiles at the Saudi Arabian oil industry on Sunday, including Saudi Aramco’s facility at Ras Tanura, which is capable of exporting roughly 6.5 million barrels a day.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $66.28 a barrel, coming off its highest level since October 18, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.3% to $69.55, after climbing above $70 a barrel for the first time since the pandemic began.  
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.9% to $1,682.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% lower at 1.1865.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's H&M, the world's second-biggest fashion retailer, said on Monday it was shocked by the use of deadly force against protesters in Myanmar and that it had paused placing orders in the country. 
Police and military have killed more than 50 people to quell daily demonstrations and strikes against a Feb. 1 military coup, according to the United Nations last week.
H&M has around 45 direct suppliers in Myanmar, it said on its website, and has sourced in the country for seven years. 
""Although we refrain from taking any immediate action regarding our long-term presence in the country, we have at this point paused placing new orders with our suppliers,"" Serkan Tanka, Country Manager Myanmar, said in an email. 
""This is due to practical difficulties and an unpredictable situation limiting our ability to operate in the country, including challenges related to manufacturing and infrastructure, raw material imports and transport of finished goods."" 
Two protesters were killed by gunshot wounds to the head in Myanmar on Monday, witnesses said, while shops, factories and banks were closed in the main city Yangon as part of the uprising against the country's military rulers.
Tanka said H&M was extremely concerned about the situation in the country and that it was in dialogue with UN agencies, diplomatic representatives, human rights experts, trade unions and other multinational companies.
""These consultations will guide us in any future decision in relation to how we as a company can best contribute to positive developments in accordance with the will of the people in Myanmar,"" he said.

Myanmar's garment industry is smaller than that of neighbouring countries Bangladesh, China and Thailand. However, its around 600 factories are significant employers, providing jobs for around 450,000 workers in 2020, according to the Myanmar Garment Manufacturers Association

1384,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 06:00AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Gray Is The New Black as Rising Yields Lift Insurers,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The great rotation is making some long-unloved stocks popular again – none more so than that embodiment of dullness, the insurance sector.
Investors have despised the insurance business for so long that some of the names at the top of the performance charts will seem not just unfamiliar, but unrecognizable.
Names such as  NN  Group, (NASDAQ:NNBR), spun out of Dutch banking group ING (AS:INGA), didn’t even exist back in 2008, when the sustained downshift of long-term interest rates crushed the profitability of many insurers. Likewise, U.K.-based Phoenix Group, while its Wikipedia page states that it was founded in 1857, is essentially the creation of a flurry of deal-making over the last five years.  
Phoenix Group (LON:PHNX) stock rose 2.1% to its highest in three months on Monday after it reported full-year profits above the top end of its targeted range, with 1.7 billion of cash generation. It also nudged up its guidance for the next three years, as it increased its estimate for the efficiencies it can squeeze out of some of its recent acquisitions.
As a result, the company also raised its dividend by 3% to a level that now implies a 6.4% annual return. After 12 months in which the pandemic clobbered many of the most reliable dividend payers, such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), that is a no mean feat.
Others in the sector have even better dividend yields: Axa and SwissRe, two of the biggest players, trade at yields of over 6.5% (albeit Axa was forced to cancel a planned special dividend last year due to pandemic effects).
The strength of SwissRe’s balance sheet meant it was able to keep its payout unchanged despite heavy pandemic-related losses in its property and casualty businesses last year. CEO Christian Mumenthaler said he expects underlying profitability there to improve in 2021 as the pandemic recedes. Both SwissRe (SIX:SRENH) and Axa (MI:AXA) hit 52-week highs on Monday, as did German giant Allianz (DE:ALVG).
For some years, insurers – especially life insurers - have made more money on their asset management businesses than on the business of underwriting accident or longevity risk. That’s in large part due to the collapse of long-term interest rates, which has increased the cost of meeting the promises they made to long-term savers when interest rates were high. With interest rates now rising, meeting those obligations becomes easier.
Phoenix, which bought the lion’s share of Swiss Re’s life business last year as the latter tried to free up capital, and which now has the full rights to the  Standard Life  (LON:SLA) brand, seems particularly well positioned to enjoy the uplift, but the tailwind is clearly sectoral:  the economic recovery will strengthen primary insurance lines such as property and casualty, while reducing payouts for things like business interruption and event cancellations. For income investors in particular, what’s not to like?"

That’s the longest stretch of weekly losses for the Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) since the Covid-spurred meltdown last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund dropped about 4.3% as of 5:20 a.m. in New York, with other products from Wood’s Ark Investment Management falling in lockstep.
Contracts on the Nasdaq 100 fell 1.8% in early trading as benchmark Treasury yields topped 1.6%.

These stocks have been some of the hottest on Wall Street, surging as the pandemic accelerated a shift to online working while the election of U.S. President Joe Biden raised expectations of a policy boost for electric vehicles. Now, the prospect of rising inflation amid an economic recovery is driving up bond yields, making the highest priced equities less attractive.

The prolonged run of losses across Wood’s funds represents the biggest test yet for the firm she founded in 2014. Investors poured billions of dollars into her funds in recent months inspired by Ark’s stellar returns in 2020.
The latest data showed that the main fund recorded a small inflow on Thursday, even as it dropped 5.3%. Other funds like the Ark Next Generation ETF (NYSE:ARKW) and the Ark Genomic Revolution ETF (NYSE:ARKG) saw hundreds of millions in outflows.
Short interest in ARKK, as measured by the percentage of available shares that are on loan, has climbed to a record of more than 5%, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. Bearish bets had eased slightly on Thursday.

1388,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 05:10AM ET</span>",Texas city-run and rural electric firms face bailout over storm crisis,"By Jennifer Hiller, David French and Karen Pierog
(Reuters) - Financial strains on Texas city-owned utilities, rural electric cooperatives and the grid operator has spurred calls for state aid and lured private equity firms into plans to fix multi-billion-dollar charges.
The state's power costs jumped by roughly 10 times the usual, to about $47 billion, during a week-long cold snap that took down nearly half of its power plants. The charges have driven one co-op into bankruptcy and left two dozen others facing bills they will be hard-pressed to cover without outside help.
Several private equity firms have been in talks with the operator of the Texas electric grid to provide it financial support, four people familiar with the talks told Reuters. 
The grid acts as a clearing house, collecting from electric marketers including municipals and co-ops and paying generators usually within four days. When defaults occur, it spreads the shortfall to other grid users, adding pressure to those able to pay their own bills.
EMERGENCY FUNDING
It remains unclear what form this funding would take and whether Texas officials would agree to an offer from private equity firms. The buyout firms would likely provide a loan or bond which would cover the near-term cash needs of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the people said. 
ERCOT spokeswoman Leslie Sopko declined comment on financing options under consideration. 
It was unclear whether the private equity talks would yield any agreement. The dialogue has been hampered by a power vacuum left by top-level departures at ERCOT and the state regulator, some of the people said. There are also disputes over whether the state could use its emergency funds bail out providers.
Rating agencies are warning that, absent a government financial rescue plan, significant borrowing will be needed. Rayburn Electric, a north Texas co-op that serves 225,000 customers, said its weekly power costs soared more than 900 times. Residential customers that normally pay $150 per month face more than $3,200 bills without some reduction, Chief Executive David Naylor said. 
LIMITED OPTIONS 
Taking money from private equity and infrastructure funds would be one alternative to a state-led bailout. Another would be for ERCOT to sell bonds backed by future fees, delaying an immediate cash call.
San Antonio's municipal utility, the largest in the country, owes about $1 billion for gas and electricity purchased during the storm. The company – CPS Energy – has said it plans to seek $500 million in financing and may consider future legal remedies as a way to recover some of those costs.
Credit ratings firms warned of downgrades on dozens of rural electric co-ops and municipal utilities that have outstanding debt, moves that would raise their future debt costs. 
""It could be politically challenging and it could be difficult to raise rates to recover these costs,"" said Dennis Pidherny managing director at Fitch Ratings.
Texas power regulators on Friday vetoed requests by private electric providers and a recommendation by the state's market adviser to rescind rates and fees mistakenly levied. 
But officials may have to take a different tack when it comes to municipal providers and rural co-ops, officials said, because of their number and clout. The two groups have more than 3.5 million customers in the state combined, a Reuters tally shows. 
""I don’t think we want a wave of municipal bankruptcies,"" said state Senator Nathan Johnson, (D-Dallas). ""At a minimum we’re going to have to find a way to stretch out the time period over which losses can be amortized or recovered. At a minimum.""

One of the state's largest utilities, Vistra Corp, on Friday recommended any state bailout for the groups include a provision breaking the municipal providers' lock on supplying their communities.

(Reuters) - Shares of banks and automakers lifted European shares on Monday as investors continued to move into economy-linked sectors on hopes of a solid economic rebound from the coronavirus downturn.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index gained 0.4%, with the banking sector rising 2% to hit a fresh one-year high.
Spain's Banco de Sabadell jumped 5% to the top of the STOXX 600 index, while HSBC,  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) and  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) rose more than 2%.
Automakers and insurers also gained more than 1%, while sectors considered bond-proxies like utilities and personal & household goods were a drag.
Asian markets and Wall Street futures were, however, weaker as the U.S. Senate passage of a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill and a jump in oil prices stoked concerns about inflation, lifting government bond yields in Europe and the United States. 
""The reflationary trade is being more supportive of European stocks in general because they're not as weighted towards growth and tech that the U.S. is,"" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com.
""You've got some progress on trade with between Europe and the U.S. and that's good for some of the companies like Rolls Royce (LON:RR).""

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - India has urged the United States, Japan and Australia to invest in its vaccine production capacity, an Indian government source told Reuters, as the so-called Quad alliance tries to counter China's growing vaccine diplomacy.
Beijing has committed to provide at least 463 million doses of its home-made COVID-19 vaccines through exports and donations across the world from Asia to Africa, Europe and Latin America, according to Reuters calculations. 
Two senior Indian officials said the Quad alliance, grouping the United States, Japan, Australia and India, was stepping up efforts to expand global vaccination to counter China's growing soft power. India, the world's biggest vaccine maker, believes it is best placed to steer the effort, they added.
Asked for comment, a U.S. State Department spokesperson did not refer to India's request for funds or to China but said Washington was deeply focused on expanding global vaccination, manufacturing and delivery.
""Secretary (Antony) Blinken spoke with his Quad counterparts on February 18 to discuss cooperation on COVID-19 response and recovery and climate change, among other issues,"" the official told Reuters.
There was no comment from the Australian government. But a government source said a global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic was a policy priority for the country and its Quad partners. Australia is exploring a number of options to work with partners to enhance stability and prosperity in the region, the source said.
Japan's Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi told a news conference on Friday that the four countries discussed the ""necessity and importance of international cooperation to ensure equal access to vaccines for developing countries,"" at the February meeting, but nothing was decided.
An Indian foreign ministry spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
One of the two Indian sources, an official who has direct knowledge of Quad alliance discussions, said the group had had several meetings about global vaccination. 
""India has more vaccine options than any other Asian country at this point of time,"" said the source, declining to be named as he was not authorised to talk on the matter. ""India expects members of the Quad alliance to pay to ramp up production.
A second Indian source said that at the February virtual meeting, the Quad countries discussed ways to ""encourage alternative medical supply chains, thereby implying less dependency on China"".
A top political advisory body in Beijing, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said concerns that China was using vaccines to sway other countries were ""extremely narrow-minded.""
China's purpose was to make vaccines available globally, the foreign ministry said.
BILLIONS OF DOSES
Indian companies such as the Serum Institute of India (SII), Bharat Biotech, Biological E and Cadila Healthcare have the combined capacity to produce billions of doses of their own vaccines or contract-manufacture for others.
SII, the world's biggest single manufacturer, is producing the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine for many countries and will soon start making the  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) shots in bulk.
India is also trying to sell a vaccine created by Bharat Biotech and the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research to 40 countries including Brazil, the Philippines and Zimbabwe. Bharat Biotech says it can make about 700 million doses of the shot a year.
Indian vaccine makers are also planning to produce more COVID-19 vaccines developed by the United States and Russia, including Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).
A top Indian vaccine official told Reuters in January that the government had also held discussions with U.S. companies  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc about making their shots in India.
Serum's Novavax partnership holds ""the key to the Quad’s diplomatic alliance in vaccines and push China out of regional vaccine sales"", one of the Indian sources said.
""The focus is also on making sure the Quad alliance secures all the key markets for vaccines,"" he said.

Indian companies will also produce about 300 million doses of Russia's Sputnik-V vaccine, but the source said Washington was not keen on helping expand Moscow's clout in vaccines.

1391,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 04:16AM ET</span>",World shares ease as yields and oil ring inflation alarm,"By Danilo Masoni and Wayne Cole
MILAN/SYDNEY (Reuters) - World shares dipped on Monday as the U.S. Senate's passage of a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill put fresh pressure on Treasuries and tech stocks with lofty valuations, raising inflation jitters.
These concerns overshadowed the prospect that stimulus would give another boost to the world's No.1 economy, likely helping global growth rebound faster from the COVID-19 downturn.
Analysts expect a sharp acceleration in inflation, stoked in part by the latest spike in oil prices, which on Monday climbed above $70 for the first time since the pandemic began. 
""Between reflation, inflation risk and equity valuations, there's plenty of reasons for the market to be jittery over the bond re-pricing,"" said Natixis strategist Florent Pochon.
""Equity valuations will of course remain a burning issue in particular for overly rich sectors,"" he also said, adding however that sell-offs should be seen as buying opportunities, given that central banks remain ""structurally dovish"".
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS) fell 0.1% by 0828 GMT, as gains in European cyclical and travel stocks were offset by losses in Asia.
Chinese stocks posted their biggest decline in seven months, down 3.5%, on concerns that Chinese officials could tighten policy to rein in lofty valuations.
Nasdaq futures fell 2% in early European trade, reversing early gains, while S&P 500 futures fell 1% as investors looked past the benefits of the fiscal package.
According to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), every $1 trillion of fiscal stimulus adds around $4-$5 to companies' earnings per share, implying 6-7% upside for the remainder of the year.
Equity investors had taken heart on Friday from U.S. data showing nonfarm payrolls surged by 379,000 jobs last month, while the jobless rate dipped to 6.2% in a positive sign for incomes, spending and corporate earnings.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen tried to counter inflation concerns by noting the true unemployment rate was nearer 10% and there was still plenty of slack in the labour market.
Yet yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries still hit a one-year high of 1.626% in the wake of the data, and stood at 1.594% on Monday.
U.S. yields increased a hefty 16 basis points for the week, while German yields actually dipped 4 basis points.
The European Central Bank meets on Thursday amid talk it will look at ways to restrain further increases in euro zone yields.
The diverging trajectory on yields boosted the dollar against the euro, which fell to a three-month low of $1.1891.
BofA analyst Athanasios Vamvakidis argued the potent mix of U.S. stimulus, faster reopening and greater consumer firepower was a clear positive for the dollar.
""Including the current proposed stimulus package and further upside from a second-half infrastructure bill, total U.S. fiscal support is six times greater than the EU recovery fund,"" he said. ""The Fed is also supportive with U.S. money supply growing two times faster than the Eurozone.""
The dollar index shot up to levels not seen since late November and was last at 92.06, well above its February trough of 89.677.
The U.S. currency also gained on the low-yielding yen, reaching a nine-month top of 108.63, and was last changing hands at 108.4.
The jump in yields has weighed on gold, which offers no fixed return, and pushed it down 0.1% at $1,698 an ounce and just above a nine-month low.
Oil prices were up the highest levels in more than a year after Yemen's Houthi forces fired drones and missiles at the heart of Saudi Arabia's oil industry on Sunday, raising concerns about production.
Prices had already been supported by a decision by OPEC and its allies not to increase supply in April. [O/R]

1392,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 04:15AM ET</span>",Price and policy fears drive Chinese investors into cloistered stocks,"By Samuel Shen and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Worries about the frothiness of China's stock market and steps authorities might take to rein it in are forcing investors out of popular technology and consumer sectors and into small-cap shares and other sequestered stocks in sectors such as banking.
That churn has seen investors rush out of richly valued market darlings such as Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd and Meituan. Shanghai-listed spirit maker Kweichou Moutai Co Ltd, a popular bet on China's rising consumerism, has plunged 25% from its Feb. 18 high.
The Hang Seng TECH Index, which tracks Hong Kong-listed tech giants including Tencent and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd, plunged more than 6% on Monday, extending a decline that has brought the benchmark 27% off its peak hit just two weeks ago.
""The bubble is bursting,"" Dong Baozhen, a Beijing-based hedge fund manager said, referring to the sharp sell-off in tech and consumer stocks. The spectre of inflation and tighter credit is a ""killer"" of high-flying stocks, he said.
Instead, there are signs of money seeking shelter in banking - once shunned for fear of virus-related bad loan exposure - and unfashionable small-cap stocks, as well sectors poised to benefit the most from economic recovery, such as energy. Amid bloodshed in tech, financial stocks have been relatively firm while an index tracking small firms has barely budged.
Growth-oriented stocks have suffered globally in recent weeks from rising concerns over inflation. In China, additionally, fears that authorities are keen to reduce generous, pandemic-era stimulus has led to near-panic selling of such stocks.
At the annual meeting of China's National People's Congress this month, authorities set an economic growth target of above 6% for the year, underwhelming market expectations.
The goal is conservative, as if ""creating room for policymakers to take action to contain risks of asset bubble in both equity and property,"" Citi Private Bank analysts said in a client note on Monday.
In addition, comments from top banking regulator Guo Shuqing against asset bubbles last week also sent a hawkish message reminding markets that China is the world's most-expensive market for non-financial equities.
Even after the recent sell-off, Moutai's price is 55 times trailing earnings, while Tencent trades at 45 times.
The combination of high valuation and the government's policy tendency ""could be very meaningful for Chinese equities because policies still heavily influence the market,"" Citi said, forecasting another 10% drop in China's benchmark CSI300. The index hit record high on Feb. 18 and has lost 14% since. 
HIDDEN GEMS
Michelle Leung, chief executive of China-focused asset manager Xingtai Capital, said the bubble in China's big-cap tech and consumer staples was partly fuelled by global investors' rush to increase exposure to China as it recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic.
""If you're trying to buy China quickly, the easiest thing to do is to buy an exchange-traded fund, an index fund or a big-cap consensus name,"" and that has caused crowding in Moutai, Alibaba, Tencent and the like, she said.
Many consensus names are still valued at 60 times their earnings or greater, which ""doesn't quite make sense at this point,"" said Leung, a value-driven, bottom-up investor.
Leung's half-a-billion-dollar long-only China fund has outperformed the MSCI China Index by around 20% annually over the past three years, vindicating a strategy of ""buying hidden gems"" when most investors are chasing momentum.
Her portfolios include electric scooter producer Yadea Group Holdings Ltd and property management firm A Living Smart City Services Co Ltd, bought at price-earnings ratios of 8 and 11 times respectively.
Brian Bandsma, a New York-based portfolio manager for Vontobel's Quality Growth Boutique, said he is shifting to defensive stocks because companies such as Meituan and Nio Inc showed clear over-valuation, even placing them in bubble territory. 
Liam Zhou, founder of Shanghai-based Minority Asset Management, recommended buying Chinese banking stocks, citing the sector's low valuation and reduced risks due to the government's deleveraging campaign. 

Chinese banks are perennial laggards but have rebounded to a three-year high in recent weeks, and the sector still trades at a 30% discount on average to their net assets.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Monday helped by gains from the oil majors as crude prices soared, while hopes for a global recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic also supported financial stocks.. 
At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.9% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.7% and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.6%.
The heavily-weighted oil majors helped push the overall markets higher, with BP (NYSE:BP), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and Total all posting stock gains of over 1%. 
This followed strong gains in crude prices as Houthi rebeles in Yemen fired missiles targeting the Saudi Arabian oil industry on Sunday, including Saudi Aramco’s facility at Ras Tanura, which is capable of exporting roughly 6.5 million barrels a day. Saudi Arabia reported no loss of life or significant damage to the facilities.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $66.65 a barrel, just off its highest level since October 18, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.9% to $69.97, earlier climbing above $70 a barrel for the first time since the pandemic began.  
Banking and insurance stocks were also supported by the ongoing rise in bond yields, even though the economic recovery appears likely to arrive later in continental Europe than in the U.S. and U.K. due to delays in rolling out vaccines against Covid-19. The Stoxx 600 Banks index rose 2.6%, with banks from the Netherlands and Sweden to Greece hitting their highest levels in over a year.
Earlier, China’s exports surged in the first two months of the year, up over 60% in dollar terms, reflecting strong global demand for manufactured goods, and boosting confidence that the global economy is in a strong recovery phase.
Additionally, the U.S. Senate passed the $1.9 trillion stimulus package, proposed by President Joe Biden earlier this year, over the weekend. This raises the likelihood that this bill will be passed into law before enhanced jobless benefits expire on March 14.
Equity markets have been boosted over the last few months by the expectation that loose fiscal and monetary policy will give a powerful boost to the economic recovery, but optimism has been tempered by fears over rising inflation and interest rates. 
In European corporate news,  Direct Line  (LON:DLGD) stock rose 0.7% after the insurer declared both a final dividend and a share buyback even as its pretax profit fell in 2020.
 Pearson  (LON:PSON) stock fell 3.1% after the company launched a review of its international publishing businesses as its adjusted profit and revenue fell in 2020.

The yield on the benchmark Treasury 10-year note has risen sharply in recent weeks, climbing as high as 1.62% on Friday after starting the calendar year below the 1% mark. It currently stands at 1.59%.
This rapid surge has also unnerved equity investors, putting pressure on stocks with high valuations, particularly the high-growth stocks which had contributed so much to the sharp equity market gains of the last few months.

The missiles were intercepted, but the move by the Iran-backed Houthi is the latest in a series of attacks on Saudi Arabia and follows a recent rise in Middle Eastern tensions. 
U.S. crude futures traded 1.6% higher at $67.14 a barrel, just off its highest level since October 18, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.7% to $70.56, climbing above $70 a barrel for the first time since the pandemic began.  
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,697.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1891.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down Monday morning, even as optimism over the U.S.’ $1.9 trillion stimulus package and hopes for a global economic recovery from COVID-19 grew.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.18% by 10:02 PM ET (3:02 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.68%.
Trade data released earlier in the day showed that exports rose 60.6% year-on-year in February, imports rose 22.2% year-on-year and the trade balance was at $103.25 billion. All the metrics were higher than the figures in forecasts prepared by Investing.com as well as January’s numbers.
The annual session of the National People’s Congress, which opened on Friday, also continues.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slumped 1.16%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.23%, with GDP data to be released on Tuesday. The country extended its state of emergency in Tokyo and surrounding prefectures, originally slated to end on Mar. 7, until around Mar. 21.
South Korea’s KOSPI inched down 0.10% and in Australia, the ASX 200 rose 1.01%.
The U.S. Senate passed the massive stimulus package, which was proposed by President Joe Biden earlier in the year, on Saturday. The House of Representatives aims to pass the bill before Tuesday and get Biden’s sign-off before a deadline to renew unemployment aid programs expires on Mar. 14.
U.S. jobs data released on Friday also continued to give stocks a boost, with non-farm payrolls for February at 379,000, above the 182,000 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and January’s 166,000 reading.
The better-than-expected data and raised hopes for more stimulus measures also pushed bond yields up, with ten-year Treasury yields hit the 1.6% mark on Friday.
The moves continue to increase worries about inflation risk and raised questions about equity valuations. However, the Federal Reserve on Friday played down the need for a monetary policy response.
“Clearly with the stimulus measures in place, there is some concern for inflation, but nothing to derail the relatively positive outlook for equities at this point,” Rachel Farrell, chief executive officer of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management in Australia, told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, the U.S. will release more economic data, namely the February consumer price index, on Wednesday.
Across the Atlantic, the European Central Bank will hand down its monetary policy when it meets on Thursday."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Sunday urged computer network operators to take further steps to gauge whether their systems were targeted amid a hack of  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Outlook email program, saying a recent software patch still left serious vulnerabilities.
""This is an active threat still developing and we urge network operators to take it very seriously,"" a White House official said, adding that top U.S. security officials were working to decide what next steps to take following the breach.
CNN on Sunday separately reported the Biden administration was forming a task force to address the hack. The White House official, in a statement, said the administration was making ""a whole of government response.""
While Microsoft released a patch last week to shore up flaws in its email software, the remedy still leaves open a so-called back door that can allow access to compromised servers and perpetuating further attacks by others. 
""We can’t stress enough that patching and mitigation is not remediation if the servers have already been compromised, and it is essential that any organization with a vulnerable server take measures to determine if they were already targeted,"" the White House official said. 
Already, a source told Reuters more than 20,000 U.S. organizations had been compromised by the hack, which Microsoft has blamed on China, although Beijing denies any role. 
The back channels for remote access can impact credit unions, town governments and small business, and have left U.S. officials scrambling to reach victims, with the FBI on Sunday urging them to contact the law enforcement agency. 
Those affected appear to host Web versions of Microsoft's email program Outlook on their own machines instead of cloud providers, possibly sparing many major companies and federal government agencies, records from the investigation suggest.
A Microsoft representative on Sunday said it was working with the government and others to help guide customers, and the company urged impacted clients to apply software updates as soon as possible.
Neither the company nor the White House has specified the scale of the hack. Microsoft initially said it was limited, but the White House last week expressed concern about the potential for ""a large number of victims.""

So far, only a small percentage of infected networks have been compromised through the back door, the source previously told Reuters, but more attacks are expected.

The British broadband and mobile telecoms operator said on Monday that Jan du Plessis, who was appointed chairman in November 2017, had informed the board of his intention to retire once a successor has been appointed.
""The chairman throughout his tenure has demonstrated strong leadership ... been extremely supportive of management and any suggestion that he has impeded the transformation of BT is without foundation,"" BT said in a statement on Saturday. 
""There has been no misalignment between the board and executive management over the company's strategy,"" BT added.
On Friday Sky News reported that Jansen, who joined BT as CEO in 2019, had told fellow directors he was frustrated with the speed at which it was taking key strategic decisions.
Jansen indicated that he was prepared to resign unless a new chairman who could accelerate the pace of change was appointed, Sky News said, citing several people close to the company.
Jansen is seeking to make the former monopoly more agile. 
He wants BT to accelerate Britain's shift to fibre and 5G networks, and he is pushing the government and regulator Ofcom to create the conditions that would allow him to turn on the taps to billion of pounds of investment.
That aim was boosted by changes to corporation tax announced on Wednesday to incentivise investment. 
Jansen said in November he was open-minded about selling a stake in the company's networks unit Openreach.
However, he said any decision would come after Ofcom publishes its new framework. 

Du Plessis sought to build bridges with Ofcom during his tenure. ""Above all, our relationship with Ofcom has improved significantly over the last three years,"" he said on Monday.

1405,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 09:05PM ET</span>",Texas power regulator rejects request to cut $16 billion in charges during freeze,"By Gary McWilliams
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Texas' state power regulator on Friday unanimously vetoed a request to cut about $16 billion from state power charges during the final day of the state's February cold snap, saying even a partial repricing could have unintended effects.
The Public Utility Commission deferred voting on a separate proposal to slice service fees that would have saved retail electric providers about $1.5 billion for power never provided. Both proposals were recommended by the state's independent power market adviser. 
Total electricity charges jumped by about $47 billion during a winter storm that knocked out nearly half of Texas power plants, hiking prices for gas and power that have roiled the state's energy sector. Storm-related costs sent one company into bankruptcy and a dozen more face being unplugged from the state's grid for non-payment. 
""The PUC choose to ignore the recommendation of the economists hired by the state to advise regulators,"" Brandon Young, chief executive of Payless Power, an electricity marketer, said in an interview. ""As a result, $16 billion in costs are being passed to all electric providers -retail electric, municipal providers and cooperatives."" 
The state's grid operator had raised power prices to $9,000 per megawatt hour, to induce power plant operator to increase power or stay running for five days. However, that 450-times-the-usual price remained in place after the emergency passed, adding about $16 billion to the total. 
State market adviser Carrie Bivens described that final day's pricing as a mistake by grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), recommending the PUC ""correct ERCOT's real time prices."" 
Revising prices could hurt the companies that had hedged their power costs and result in greater uncertainty, said commissioners. 
""Decisions were made about these prices in real time based on information available to everybody,"" said PUC Chairman Arthur D'Andrea. ""It is impossible to unscramble."" 
The mistake and fees charged for standby power service that were provided sparked a firestorm of protests by the dozens of companies that market electricity in Texas. Commissioners on Friday deferred a vote on Bivens' call for reducing ancillary services fees, saying there was no reason to rush.
Vistra Corp, a power plant operator that receives some of the fees, argued it was unfair for regulators to cherry pick ""certain prices,"" for a rollback. The ancillary services commissioners are considering cutting would not reduce residential bills, it said. 
""It would be inappropriate for the Commission to just reprice ancillary services without addressing the other pricing issues and challenges,"" wrote Amanda J. Frazier, a Vistra senior vice president in a letter to the commission. 

Federal and state investigators are examining why the state and utilities were unprepared for a deep freeze that left up to 4.3 million Texans without power, heat and water. Consumers will see higher prices as the storm costs get passed down through rate increases or fewer choices in providers, officials said.

Capacity will be limited to between 15% and 35%, the California Department of Health said in an update. Masks and other safety measures will be required and the parks initially will be open only to state residents.
Outdoor stadiums and ball parks will also be allowed to reopen at reduced capacity, starting April 1.
Ken Potrock, president of the Disneyland Resort, said in a statement that the decision meant ""getting thousands of people back to work and greatly helping neighboring businesses and our entire community.""
""With responsible Disney safety protocols already implemented around the world, we can’t wait to welcome our guests back,"" Potrock said.
He did not give a date for the reopening of Disneyland in the southern California city of Anaheim.
Disney shares were trading at $195.10 after hours, after closing at $189.99.
Disney in September said it was furloughing some 28,000 workers, mostly across its U.S. theme parks in California and Florida. Walt Disney World in Florida reopened in July last year, with limited capacity.
Friday's announcement follows a decline in coronavirus cases in California and the rollout of vaccines. A parking lot at Disneyland is currently being used as a mass vaccination site.
Theme parks like Disneyland, Universal Studios, Legoland and Knott's Berry Farm protested strongly last October when California health officials ruled out any quick reopening of their attractions.
The California Attractions and Parks Association called Friday's announcement ""encouraging news.""

""Parks now have a framework to safely and responsibly reopen... putting people safely back to work and reinvigorating local economies,” the association said in a statement.

1407,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 07:10PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Investors weigh how far tech stocks can slide after volatile week,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As U.S. technology shares stumble, investors are debating whether the decline is an opportunity to scoop up bargains or a sign of more pain to come for stocks that have led markets higher for years. 
The Nasdaq Composite, an index heavily populated by tech and growth names, has slumped 8.3% since its Feb 12 closing record, over three times the decline for the S&P 500. Drops in popular growth stocks have been even steeper, with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares off 27% and Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) down 32%. 
Taking advantage of pullbacks in names like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been a winning strategy over the last decade as big technology and growth stocks drove the market’s gains. In a sign some bargain-hunters may have already swooped in after a bumpy week, the Nasdaq reversed a steep loss during Friday's session to end up 1.6%. 
Some market participants, however, worry the current decline could be longer-lasting than previous dips, as expectations of a powerful U.S. economic recovery fuel a shift away from the “stay-at-home” trade towards names primed to benefit from a nationwide reopening. A surge in bond yields is accelerating that rotation, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield hitting 1.625% on Friday, its highest level in over a year.
“As the economy reopens, other sectors are going to have fantastic earnings growth,” said Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research. Earnings increases for the large tech and growth stocks are ""not going to look nearly as good.” 
Data on Friday showing U.S. employment rising more than expected in February offered further evidence of a rebounding economy. 
Investors are awaiting the March 16-17 Federal Reserve meeting, after comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave little indication that the central bank was concerned by the recent yield rally.
The rise in Treasury yields, which move inversely to bond prices, means bonds offer greater competition to equities and other comparatively risky investments. Higher yields can weigh even more on tech and growth stocks with lofty valuations, as they threaten to erode the value of their longer-term cash flows. 
The S&P 500 technology sector has pulled back 7% since yields began their latest surge in mid-February, while the Russell 1000 growth index has fallen 7.7% against a 1.8% gain for its counterpart value index, which is replete with bank and other stocks expected to gain in a rebounding economy. 
Chase Investment Counsel, a wealth management firm, has scaled back its tech holdings in recent weeks, including selling some Apple and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) shares, over concerns about their valuations and evidence the market was rotating elsewhere, said Chase President Peter Tuz. 
""Clearly the stocks are not acting well compared to a lot of other groups out there,"" Tuz said. The economic rebound is also likely to give a strong boost to earnings in beaten down sectors, taking the shine off some technology companies’ expected results. 
Profits for the financials, materials and industrials sectors in 2021 are estimated to jump 23%, 34% and 72%, respectively, according to Refinitiv IBES, compared to a 15% rise for tech companies. 
At the same time, valuations in the sector remain historically elevated. At 26.6 times forward earnings, the technology sector's valuation has pulled back but it remains well above its historical average of nearly 21, according to Refinitiv Datastream. 
Still, some investors believe the pullback could be an opportunity to buy, pointing to tech companies' solid profitability that can persist even after the earnings rebound in the broad economy peters out. While elevated historically, the sector's valuation is also well below levels during the dot-com bubble 20 years ago, that saw the Nasdaq drop over 50% in less than a year. 

“The health of tech today is so far superior to what it was,” said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus (NYSE:SNV) Trust. “I am still optimistic and I still think that the fundamentals are solid. I don’t see a huge pullback like in the summer of 2000.""

(Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply higher after a volatile session on Friday, with the Nasdaq rebounding at the end of a week that saw it extend losses to about 10% from its previous record high.
All three main indexes bounced back from losses earlier in the day, with investors in recent sessions spooked by rising interest rates that offset optimism about an economic rebound.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) rallied 2.15%, boosting the S&P 500 more than any other stock, with gains in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Oracle also lifting the index. 
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields hit a new one-year high of 1.626% after nonfarm payrolls increased by 379,000 jobs last month, blowing past a rise of 182,000 forecast by economists polled by Reuters.
Focus is also on a $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid bill as a sharply divided U.S. Senate began what was expected to be a long debate over a slew of amendments on how that money would be spent.
The Nasdaq logged its third straight weekly decline after a recent spike in Treasury yields dented demand for high-flying technology stocks. 
Rising interest rates disproportionately hurt high-growth tech companies because investors value them based on earnings expected years into the future, and high interest rates hurt the value of future earnings more than the value of earnings made in the short term.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq is around 8% below its Feb. 12 closing high.
Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said his firm in recent days has bought shares in a handful of growth companies whose prices have been pummeled in the recent selloff.
""Next week, I would expect volatility to continue, with pockets of opportunity, with certain things that sold off potentially rebounding,"" Dollarhide said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.85% to end at 31,496.3 points, while the S&P 500 gained 1.95% to 3,841.94. 
The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.55% to 12,920.15.
In a busy session, volume on U.S. exchanges was 17.4 billion shares, compared with the 15.3 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
For the week, the S&P 500 rose 0.8%, the Dow added 1.8% and the Nasdaq lost 2.1%.
In Friday's session, the S&P 500 energy sector index surged 3.9% to over a one year high as oil prices soared. [O/R]
 Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) jumped more than 6% after  Barclays  (LON:BARC) upgraded the business software maker to ""overweight"" expecting improvement in the IT spending environment.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.86-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.12-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 55 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 225 new highs and 134 new lows.

(Reuters) - American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Co said on Friday that a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX bound for New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport declared an emergency after the captain shut down one engine over a possible mechanical issue.
American's Flight 2555 from Miami with 95 passengers and six crew landed safely at Newark without incident, the airline said.
The possible issue was related to an engine oil pressure or volume indicator and not the result of anything related to the MCAS system linked to two fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 that prompted the plane's 20-month grounding, it said.
 Boeing Co  said it was aware of the American flight and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it will investigate.
American was the first U.S. carrier to resume 737 MAX flights late last year following the FAA's approval of safety updates by Boeing. 
When it cleared the plane to fly again, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said he was confident that the jet was safe but warned that in-flight mechanical problems occasionally occur with all commercial aircraft.
""For that reason, it is inevitable that at some time in the future, a Boeing 737 MAX will turn back to its originating airport, divert, or land at its destination with an actual or suspected in-flight problem,"" he said.
The FAA evaluates all events involving a U.S. airline, he said at the time, adding: ""It’s very important to differentiate between these routine events that happen with any aircraft and the acute safety issues that led to the loss of lives and grounding of the MAX.”

American took delivery from Boeing of the jet involved in Friday's incident on Dec. 30, according to information on FlightAware.

1410,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 05:37PM ET</span>",Wall Street's SPAC sell-off drags on amid fears of a bubble,"By Joshua Franklin and Aaron Saldanha
(Reuters) - Shares of special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), for months the darling of Wall Street as they attracted unprecedented investor interest, slid again this week amid concerns that their valuations have become inflated. 
The Defiance Next Gen SPAC Derived ETF, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks SPACs, was down more than 6% in morning trading on Friday and is on track for its biggest weekly drop since it launched in October. 
A SPAC is a shell company that raises money in an initial public offering (IPO) to merge with a privately held company that then becomes publicly traded as a result. For the company merging with a SPAC, it is an alternative to doing an IPO itself. 
SPACs gained immense popularity last year among amateur retail traders as well as Wall Street funds that are hoping to ride the coattails of prominent investors who have raised SPACs, such as hedge fund manager Bill Ackman and serial blank-check dealmaker Chamath Palihapitiya. 
SPACs have increasingly focused on deals in industries of the future such as electric vehicles, self-driving cars and space exploration. They are seen as having lucrative potential but are also fraught with uncertainty. 
The trigger for the recent sell-off was the announcement last month of Churchill Capital IV Corp's long-awaited merger with electric vehicle company Lucid Motors.
The stock had run up more than 500% in anticipation of the deal, but it slumped more than 40% on the announcement as investors became more skeptical about the prospects of a company that has yet to produce cars regularly.
Since then, broader concerns over frothy valuations have spread to other popular names that have done SPAC deals, such as sports betting platform DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Inc and QuantumScape, a maker of batteries for electric vehicles.
QuantumScape, which has said it does not expect to generate an operating profit until 2027, saw its market cap hit a high of almost $45 billion in December. It has since lost 72% of its market value. 
In a further hit to SPACs, Palihapitiya, one of the most high-profile SPAC investors, sold his remaining personal stake in space tourism startup Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) for around $213 million.
London Stock Exchange (LSE) Chief Executive David Schwimmer warned on Friday that the ""frothy"" U.S. market for SPACs could see investors coming off ""poorly"". A British government review this week recommended making it easier for SPACs to list on the LSE.
While SPACs allow private companies to list more quickly than a conventional initial public offering process, critics have asked questions about a possible misalignment of incentives by SPAC promoters in some cases. 

A two-year study ended January by JP Morgan Asset Management https:// showed SPAC sponsors earned returns of 958% on average, compared to an average gross return of just 90% for ""buy and hold"" SPAC investors.

1411,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 05:37PM ET</span>",Ford rejects U.S. ITC criticism over SK Innovation battery deals,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co on Friday dismissed criticism from the U.S. International Trade Commission over its decision to pursue battery contracts with SK Innovation.
The ITC said the second-largest U.S. automaker pursued new contracts even after evidence had emerged that the South Korean electric vehicle (EV) battery maker misappropriated trade secrets from cross-town rival LG Chem.
""Contrary to the ITC's assumption, Ford was committed to three additional battery programs tied to SK Innovation before any misconduct had surfaced,"" Ford said, adding that ""key facts"" would have emerged if the ITC ""conducted a public interest hearing.""
The ITC did not immediately comment.
The ITC last month sided with LG Chem in its trade secrets claims, issuing a limited 10-year exclusion order prohibiting imports of lithium-ion batteries made by SK Innovation (SK). 
It permitted SK to import components for domestic production of batteries for Ford's EV F-150 program for four years, and for Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s MEB electric vehicle line for North America for two years.
SK has warned the ITC decision would force it to halt construction of a $2.6 billion battery plant in Georgia if it is not overturned by President Joe Biden.
In a redacted opinion released on Thursday, the ITC questioned why Ford pursued battery contracts with SK Innovation after SK's misconduct in this investigation had come to light.
It said Ford sought business with SK even after a company employee was deposed in November 2019 in the commission's investigation and when the automaker only had a contract with SK to supply batteries for the EV F-150.
""There is no explanation in the record why Ford would choose to ignore or excuse SK's egregious misconduct,"" the ITC said.
""The fault here belongs with SK, as well as with those, like Ford, who deliberately chose to continue to cultivate prospective business relationships predicated on SK's trade secret misappropriation.""
Ford said Friday it ""does not condone the actions SK Innovation is accused of - particularly misappropriating trade secrets and destroying evidence in the course of an investigation.""

LG Chem noted the ITC ruling found SK misappropriated LG trade secrets worth billions of dollars spanning the entire electric vehicle battery business.

1413,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 05:35PM ET</span>",Lender to U.S. electric co-ops carries $4 billion in exposure to waylaid Texas market,"By Tim McLaughlin
BOSTON (Reuters) - A go-to lender for U.S. electric cooperatives has $4 billion in exposure to the Texas market, where last month’s deep freeze slammed the finances of several co-ops hit with astronomically high gas and electric prices during the state’s grid blackout.
The latest quarterly financial disclosure from the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation (CFC) shows the Texas market accounts for 15% of the lender’s $27.1 billion in outstanding loans. Dulles, Virginia-based CFC has not had any loan defaults in its electric utility loan portfolio since fiscal 2013.
Numerous Texas electric co-ops are facing potential bankruptcy due to the massive bills incurred when power prices spiked during the Texas freeze that killed several dozen people and left millions without power for days. 
CFC, which is searching for a replacement of its long-time chief executive, will be put to the test in the coming weeks and months as Texas electric utilities and cooperatives sort out billions of dollars in unpaid charges from the collapse of the state’s main electric grid.
On Monday, Brazos Electric Power Cooperative Inc, the biggest electric co-op in Texas, filed for bankruptcy protection in Houston, citing a disputed $1.8 billion debt to the state's main grid operator.
CFC has disclosed that it has $85 million in outstanding unsecured loans and letters of credit to Brazos. CFC said it is not currently able to assess to what extent, if any, the bankruptcy process may impair the lender’s ability to collect the amounts outstanding, according to a U.S. regulatory filing.
CFC did not return a message seeking comment.
CFC is a tax-exempt, member-owned finance cooperative run by CEO Sheldon Petersen, who has quadrupled the size of CFC’s loan portfolio over the past 25 years. Global executive search firm Korn Ferry (NYSE:KFY) is looking for someone to replace Petersen, who plans to retire this year.
About 98% of CFC’s portfolio consists of loans to rural electric systems. Its financing supplements the loan programs of the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. CFC makes loans makes so electric co-ops can buy and build transmission lines and generation facilities.
In 2018, for example, Texas-based Rayburn Country Electric Cooperative Inc received a $250 million line of credit from a group of lenders led by CFC, according to Refinitiv data.
Like Brazos Electric, Rayburn is due to receive a massive energy bill linked to last month's storms. Rayburn expects to receive about $735 million in invoices from Texas' main electric grid operator for costs associated with energy spikes during the recent deep freeze. 

That is about 92,000% more than Rayburn's normal February weekly bill of about $800,000, according to disclosures with Texas utilities regulators.

Texas's energy market saw extreme volatility in mid-February when a deep freeze reduced supplies, sending the cost of emergency fuel and power sky high. With bills now coming due, many energy companies are expected to file for bankruptcy or seek regulatory or legal remedies to put off payment.
""The polar vortex drove volatility in energy markets, and, as a market-maker and liquidity provider, we were positioned to help our clients manage their risks in that challenging environment,"" said a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman in an emailed statement.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 snapped its two-week losing streak Friday, on strong jobs data and a rebound in tech as bargain-hunting investors swooped in to take advantage of the recent rout that pushed stocks to oversold levels. 
The S&P 500 rose 1.95%, Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.85%, or 572 points, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.55%, and had been down more than 2% intraday.
The U.S. economy created 379,000 jobs last month, well above economists' consensus forecast of 182,000, with the unemployment rate falling to 6.2% from 6.3%, underpinned by easing Covid-19 restrictions and a ramp-up in vaccine distribution. 
""While one report does not make a trend and payroll data are certainly volatile, it's safe to conclude that the winter soft patch is now officially over,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
The robust jobs data initially pushed  U.S. rates sharply higher, souring the outlook for the high-flying tech stocks, but investors swooped in buy the dip helping the sector move off intraday lows.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) moved off their lows of the day.
The dip buying comes after a rout in tech earlier this week that pushed the broader market into oversold territory.
""The short-term trading charts on the SPX are now oversold after this most recent decline- so we would suspect some stabilization or a potential oversold rally to materialize,"" Janney Montgomery Scott said in a note. For a sustained move higher, the S&P 500 now needs ""to clear 3900 initial resistance,"" but below this level, further volatility is likely to occur.""
Cyclical stocks – those that move in tandem with the economy – were buoyed by signs of a faster recovery, with energy stocks leading to the upside amid rising oil prices.
Oil prices added to their gains from Thursday, when OPEC and its allies decided to keep output steady, prompting economists to up their forecasts on energy prices amid an ongoing tightening in global supplies.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) raised its forecast on Brent Oil Futures by $5 per barrel to $75/bbl in 2Q and $80/bbl in 3Q21.
""We believe it is now clear that OPEC+ is in fact pursuing a tight oil market strategy, with our updated supply-demand balance pointing to OECD falling to their lowest level since 2014 by the end of this year,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note.
Still, the faster pace of vaccine rollouts and ongoing reopening will boost inflation and likely take rates along for the ride, potentially muddying the road ahead for growth stocks.
""Well inflation in the reopening sensitive sectors is likely to prove transient, a more sustainable impulse to inflation will start to take shape in 2021, led by shelter inflation healthcare services, and a multi quarter past true of dollar weakness into goods,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said.

BRUSSELS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The European Union and the United States agreed on Friday to suspend tariffs imposed on billions of dollars of imports in a 16-year-old dispute over aircraft subsidies, and said any long-term solution would need to address Chinese competition.
The two sides said in a joint statement that the four-month suspension will cover all U.S. tariffs on $7.5 billion of EU imports and all EU duties on $4 billion of U.S. products, which resulted from long-running World Trade Organization cases over subsidies for planemakers Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA).
It will ease the burden on industry and workers and focus efforts on resolving the conflict, the statement said.
As well as effective support measures and enforcement, key elements of a resolution would include ""addressing the trade distortive practices of and challenges posed by new entrants from non-market economies, such as China,"" it said.
The suspension followed a telephone call between U.S. President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, officials said.
The White House said Biden had underscored his support for the EU and his commitment to revitalise the U.S.-EU partnership, while Von der Leyen described the accord as excellent news for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, and a very positive signal for economic cooperation in the years to come.
EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis hailed a reset in the EU's relationship with its biggest and economically most important partner. 
""Removing these tariffs is a win-win for both sides, at a time when the pandemic is hurting our workers and our economies,"" he said.
The U.S. tariffs cover EU planes and plane parts, wine and jam from France and Germany, Spanish olives, German coffee, screwdrivers and other tools, and liqueurs, cheese and pork from across the EU. 
EU tariff targets include U.S. planes and parts, along with tobacco, nuts, sweet potatoes, rum, vodka, gym equipment, casino tables, tractors and machines used in construction known as shovel-loaders.
The suspension will take effect once official notices are published, expected in coming days.
The tariff suspension will help Boeing as the company resumes deliveries of its 737 MAX in Europe after a 22-month safety grounding ended in January.
""We welcome this step by the EU and the U.S. government and hope it will allow for productive negotiations to finally resolve this dispute and bring a level playing field to this industry,"" Boeing spokesman Bryan Watt said in an emailed statement. 
The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States said the tariff suspension was a ""promising breakthrough"" but added that it was ""extremely disappointed"" that a 25% tariff EU tariff on American whiskey, the largest U.S. spirit export, would remain in place as part of a separate trade dispute over U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs.
""I rejoice for our French winegrowers,"" wrote French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire in a tweet. ""Let us continue on the path of cooperation to find a final agreement. In these times of crisis, it must be time for reconciliation.""
Friday's agreement between Brussels and Washington mirrors a four-month tariff suspension agreed on Thursday by the United States and Britain. 

Biden and von der Leyen also discussed the COVID-19 pandemic, tackling climate change, and strengthening democracy during their call, as well as China, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and the Western Balkans.

1420,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 02:35PM ET</span>",Geico must face lawsuit claiming it overcharged on car insurance during pandemic: judge,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - The auto insurer Geico Corp, a unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, must face a proposed class action claiming it overcharged policyholders as the coronavirus pandemic led to less driving and fewer accidents, a judge has ruled.
In a decision on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman in Chicago said Illinois drivers may try to prove Geico violated a state consumer fraud law by unfairly and deceptively marketing its ""Geico Giveback"" discount program. She dismissed breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims.
Neither Geico nor its lawyers immediately responded to requests for comment on Friday. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to similar requests.
Geico had last April offered policyholders $2.5 billion of credits, including 15% on renewals from April to October, averaging about $150 per policy.
But policyholders led by Briana Siegal said this induced them to renew and pay excessive premiums rather than shop around, as stay-at-home orders and closures of businesses and schools resulted in less time on the road.
Siegal also said Geico's credits compared unfavorably with refunds offered by other insurers.
She cited a report by the Consumer Federation of America and Center for Economic Justice awarding Geico's program a ""D-minus,"" below the ""A"" and ""B"" grades given to State Farm and Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL), which offered refunds.
Without ruling on the merits, Coleman said the plaintiffs adequately alleged that Geico misled them into thinking it was passing on all its savings from reduced driving, and failed to disclose that its premiums were ""not based on an accurate assessment of risk during COVID-19.""
Geico's ""loss ratio,"" or percentage of premiums paid to cover claims, fell to 74.1% in 2020 from 81.3% a year earlier, and was the lowest since 2007.
Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, has owned all of Geico since 1996. Geico is based in Chevy Chase, Maryland. 
The case is Siegal v Geico Casualty Co et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 20-04306.

1422,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 01:05PM ET</span>",UK paper must publish front page statement of Meghan's privacy win: judge,"LONDON (Reuters) - British newspaper the Mail on Sunday must publish a front-page statement to say Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, had won a privacy case against it, according to a ruling handed down by a London High Court judge on Friday.
Last month, judge Mark Warby ruled the tabloid had clearly breached the royal's privacy and infringed her copyright by publishing parts of a five-page letter she wrote to her father, Thomas Markle, who she fell out with around the time of her 2018 wedding to Queen Elizabeth's grandson, Prince Harry.
As a consequence of that ruling, Warby has ordered that the newspaper must run a notice on its front page and a statement about the outcome of the case in its inside pages.
He also ruled that MailOnline must also publish the notice of Meghan's victory for a week. 
""In my judgment these are measured incursions into the defendant's freedom to decide what it publishes and does not publish, that are justified in pursuit of the legitimate aim I have identified, and proportionate to that aim,"" Warby said.
""They will involve little if any additional expense, and certainly nothing approaching the scale of the expense that has been lavished on this litigation.""
Last week, Warby awarded 450,000 pounds ($630,000) as a provisional payment towards Meghan's legal costs, with her legal team seeking an overall amount of more than 1.5 million pounds 
At that hearing, Warby refused the paper permission to appeal his decision, but said it could approach the Court of Appeal directly, saying he saw ""no real prospect"" it would reach a different conclusion.
""We will be applying to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal, including in relation to aspects of the Judgment today,"" the Mail on Sunday said in statement following Friday's ruling.
Warby criticised the paper for failing to remove the offending articles from its website after his ruling.
""This cannot be accidental, or an oversight. In the absence of any explanation, I am tempted to infer that it is a form of defiance,"" he said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) wants electric vehicles to make up the majority of European sales for its core brand by 2030, it said on Friday, the latest carmaker to accelerate the shift towards battery-powered models.
Fully electric vehicles are expected to account for more than 70% of its total European vehicle sales by 2030, compared with a previous target of 35%, the world's second-largest carmaker said as it unveiled its 'Accelerate' strategy.
""With Accelerate we are increasing the speed on our path to a digital future,"" said Ralf Brandstaetter, who heads the Volkswagen brand and also sits on the group's management board.
""In the coming years, we will change Volkswagen as never before,"" he added, saying that integrating data and software functions into cars would open up new sources of revenue.
Challenged by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Volkswagen also plans to offer self-driving vehicles and wants to develop operating systems - the heart of future electric cars - on its own to cash in on data-based business models.
""If you place that into the hands of a third party you can no longer develop these business models yourself,"" Brandstaetter said.
Volkswagen has earmarked around 16 billion euros ($19 billion) for investment in the future trends of e-mobility, hybridization and digitalisation up to 2025.
The group had been a laggard on electrification until it admitted in 2015 to cheating on U.S. diesel emissions tests and had to deal with new Chinese quotas for electric vehicles.
This prompted a strategic shift to zero-emission and self-driving technology, and it now has one of the most ambitious programmes in the industry.
Automakers are also racing to develop electric vehicles to meet tighter CO2 emissions targets in Europe and this week Volvo joined a growing number of carmakers aiming for a fully-electric line-up by 2030.
Stellantis, the product of the merger between Fiat Chrysler and PSA, plans to have fully-electric or hybrid versions of all of its vehicles available in Europe by 2025.
In China and the United States, Volkswagen expects the share of fully electric vehicles it sells to rise to 50% by 2030, the brand said, aiming to head off rivals including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to become the world's leader in electric vehicle production.
""Of all the major manufacturers, Volkswagen has the best chance of winning the race. While competitors are still in the middle of the electric transformation, we are taking big steps toward digital transformation,"" Brandstaetter said.

1427,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 10:45AM ET</span>",Greensill's funding problems could cause broad ripples,"(This March.4 story corrects paragraph three to make clear that GAM Holdings closure of the fund related to concerns about perceptions of supply chain finance rather than about asset valuations)
By Tom Bergin
LONDON (Reuters) - A funding crisis at Greensill Capital could spill over to some of its high-risk borrowers and lead to losses for insurers and banks that have done business with the UK-based supply chain finance firm if its clients default, according to several industry experts and a review of public filings.
Greensill, backed by Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group Corp's Vision Fund, helps companies spread out the time they have to pay their bills. The loans, which typically have maturities of up to 90 days, are securitized and sold to investors, allowing Greensill to make new loans. 
Earlier this week, Greensill’s primary source of funding came to an abrupt halt. Swiss bank  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG and asset manager GAM Holdings AG suspended redemptions from funds that held most of their around $10 billion in assets in Greensill notes. Credit Suisse said it was concerned about being able to accurately value them, while GAM cited “media coverage related to supply chain finance."" 
Greensill is preparing to file for bankruptcy and is also in talks to sell large parts of its business to private equity firm Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc, a source close to Greensill said on Wednesday. But Apollo is not planning to bail out Greensill's borrowers and does not even want to provide loan arrangement services to Greensill's riskier clients, two sources close to the talks said, because of the financial and reputational risks. 
While Greensill did not name Apollo, it confirmed on Tuesday it was in talks with ""a leading global financial institution"" to buy its business. Apollo, Softbank and Credit Suisse declined to comment. 
The uncertainty about what happens over the next few days could ripple through Greensill's clients and other financial institutions.
For the company's clients, an inability of Greensill to continue funding them may mean having to repay debts soon and finding alternative sources of financing in the near term, according to four experts in short term, inventory-backed - or 'supply chain' - financing of the type Greensill offers.
That could be especially problematic for its higher-risk clients, which may struggle to raise funds elsewhere or have to pay much more for the financing.
""If you have just a single source for this kind of capital, you may have to scramble around,"" said Craig Jeffrey, of consultancy Strategic Treasurer, near Atlanta, which advises clients on supply chain finance. 
Any inability of borrowers to pay could, in turn, lead to losses for credit insurers that have sold protection against defaults on Greensill securities bought by the Credit Suisse funds. And if those insurers don't pay up, investors could sue Credit Suisse to cover their losses, said Thorsten Beck, finance professor at the University of London. Analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a research note this week that even if the Swiss bank doesn't face direct financial losses, it would face reputational damage from the crisis.
In addition, a bank owned by Greensill in Germany, which keeps the company's short-term loans on its balance sheet before they are securitized and sold to Credit Suisse, could also be on the hook for losses if the sudden withdrawal of credit prompts any defaults on debts it was temporarily holding, according to ratings reports and published accounts.
On Wednesday, Germany's financial regulator Bafin filed a criminal complaint against Bremen-based Greensill Bank saying the lender could not provide evidence of receivables it said it had purchased from metals-to-finance group GFG Alliance. 
In a statement to Reuters, Greensill Capital spokesman James Doran said talks were ongoing with a suitor on a deal for parts of its business which could help preserve operations and jobs. ""While the structure of the new business is still being determined, we expect the transaction will ensure the majority of Greensill clients will continue to be funded in the same way as they currently are while also preserving a substantial number of jobs."" 
Greensill Bank always ""seeks external legal and audit advice before booking any new asset,"" Greensill Capital added. It declined to comment on the specific Bafin allegation. GFG did not respond to requests for comment about Greensill Bank.
SUPPLY CHAIN MODEL
The supply chain lending model is usually seen as a relatively low-risk investment. But Greensill, formed in 2011 by former  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) banker Lex Greensill, has taken on some highly indebted customers, publicly available accounts for borrowers show. It has also lent money to fund fixed assets like buildings and factories, which are more typically funded via longer-term financing, the accounts show, whereas supply chain financing usually covers short-term debts like paying for inventory.
One of its largest customers is GFG, run by Indian-British metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta. GFG Alliance had to pay a 12% interest rate when it issued debt on public markets in 2019. 
But Greensill said his business typically provided credit to businesses for around 4%, and could do so because investors would accept low returns as he ensured debts were backed by assets which would be quickly realized. 
Reuters could not learn the specific rate that Greensill charged GFG and how much of the Credit Suisse and GAM funds' assets are accounted for by GFG loans. Previous accounts for the funds and the companies involved show hundreds of millions of dollars of outstanding credit at any one time.
GFG Alliance spokesman Andrew Mitchell said the group had alternative funders to Greensill.
""GFG Alliance has adequate current funds and its plans to bring in fresh capital through refinancing are progressing well,"" he said, adding the troubled companies GFG bought were being turned around and were generating positive cashflow.
GERMAN EXPOSURE
Any customer defaults could also impact Greensill Bank in Bremen, Germany, a review of ratings reports and published accounts shows. The bank's exposure to GFG is unclear but its most recent capital requirements disclosures show that in 2019, it took on over $1 billion in exposures in Macedonia, the Czech Republic and Romania, after GFG began doing business in these countries. 
Greensill Bank is largely funded by around 3 billion euros of deposits and depositors are protected by the bank's membership of the deposit protection fund of the Federal Association of German Banks.
Greensill Bank declined to answer questions about its finances and neither it or Credit Suisse disclose its exposure to individual companies. 
Any losses to the Credit Suisse funds could also flow to multiple parties. Credit insurers have sold the Credit Suisse funds and Greensill protection against defaults on Greensill securities bought by the funds. While Greensill Capital is responsible for first losses on the funds to the tune of $1 billion, accounts show, insurers cover much of the rest, Credit Suisse said in January. 
Credit Suisse declined to confirm whether the debts currently in the fund are covered by insurance and who covered them.
Credit Suisse, too, is a creditor to Greensill. The Zurich-based bank has $140 million in loans outstanding to the company, a source familiar with the matter said. 

Greensill declined to say if sale talks envisaged the potential buyer taking on its debts or those debts held by the Credit Suisse funds. Credit Suisse declined to comment on the debt.

1428,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 10:10AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse winds down $10 billion Greensill-linked funds,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Abhinav Ramnarayan
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said on Friday it is winding down its $10 billion supply chain finance funds, which were mostly invested in notes backed by speciality finance firm Greensill.
London-based Greensill group is preparing to file for insolvency and is in talks to sell parts of its business to U.S. private equity firm Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc, sources close to the matter said, after the loss of backing from asset managers Credit Suisse and GAM.
Greensill declined to comment on the insolvency preparations or the Credit Suisse move. Apollo also declined to comment.
""The fund boards have now decided to terminate the funds. Credit Suisse Asset Management's priority is to ensure a balance between a timely liquidation of the funds and maximizing value for the investors,"" the Swiss bank's fund arm said.
Credit Suisse's asset management arm added in a statement on Friday that it was closing the funds as a result of valuation uncertainties, reduced availability of insurance coverage for new investments and challenges in sourcing suitable investments.
Switzerland's second-largest bank had on Monday suspended redemptions from the funds backing Greensill's lending operations over concerns about being able to accurately value them, and on Wednesday said it was looking to return excess cash to shareholders.
INSURANCE COVERAGE
Credit Suisse said the funds had experienced ""reduced availability of insurance coverage for new investments"", but declined to say if existing investments were protected.
How much money investors in the funds being closed recoup may depend on the insurance coverage for the investments. 
The funds provide credit backed by blue chip companies but also highly leveraged companies which are not rated by major credit agencies, including Sanjeev Gupta's GFG Alliance.
GFG declined to comment on the problems facing Greensill, but said it had alternative financing options for its business.
Bond and Credit Company (BCC), a unit of Japan's Tokio Marine, had provided $4.6 billion of coverage to Greensill credit notes, according to an Australian court ruling which denied Greensill's request that BCC's former part-owner, Insurance Australia Group (IAG (LON:ICAG)), be forced to extend coverage.
Tokio told Greensill last year that it had launched an investigation into whether the insurance provided was approved in line with company procedures, court documents showed.
Tokio Marine declined to comment. Insurance Australia said the sale of its BCC stake in 2019 meant that IAG had no further economic interest or exposure to trade credit insurance. Greensill declined to answer questions on insurance matters. 
APOLLO PLANS
Apollo has already begun the process of funding Greensill's clients that they intend to continue to work with if it completes the purchase of Greensill's operating business, a source familiar with the acquisition talks said. 
The private equity group, which is known for buying troubled assets, particularly after the 2008 financial crisis, plans to manage the Greensill process through its partner insurance company Athene, the source added. 
Apollo manages the invested assets of Athene, a New York-listed insurer. It will pick out some of the more attractive assets in Greensill's loan portfolio, the source said. 
Another source said that Apollo, through Athene, will prioritise Greensill clients with an investment grade credit rating, and anything below that is unlikely to be included. 
A spokesperson for Apollo declined to comment. 
Credit Suisse said more than 1,000 investors were invested across the four liquidated funds, all of them institutional or professional investors, and it would begin paying out cash from them in installments beginning Mar. 8.

Cash or cash equivalents accounted for some $3.7 billion of the four Credit Suisse funds' $10.1 billion value as of last week, a note to investors showed.

1429,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 10:00AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Oxford study indicates AstraZeneca effective against Brazil variant, source says","By Rodrigo Viga Gaier
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Preliminary data from a study conducted at the University of Oxford indicates that the COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) PLC is effective against the P1, or Brazilian, variant, a source with knowledge of the study told Reuters on Friday.
The data indicates that the vaccine will not need to be modified in order to protect against the variant, which is believed to have originated in the Amazonian city of Manaus, said the source, who requested anonymity as the results have not yet been made public.
The source did not provide the exact efficacy of the vaccine against the variant. They said the full results of the study should be released soon, possibly in March.
Early results indicated the AstraZeneca vaccine was less effective against the South African variant, which is similar to P1. South Africa subsequently paused the use of the vaccine in the country. 
The information comes as a small-sample study suggested the COVID-19 vaccine developed by China's Sinovac may not work effectively against the Brazilian variant.
Responding to a request for comment, Fiocruz, which sent the samples that formed the basis of the study, told Reuters it did not have any information on the study, as it was being led by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford.
Representatives for AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Brazil is currently confronting a brutal and long-lasting second wave of the coronavirus, hitting a daily record of 1,910 deaths on Wednesday.

The P1 variant is among the factors that epidemiologists believe is contributing to a rise in cases and deaths, and there has been concern in the scientific community about the variant's resistance to vaccines.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened strongly higher on Friday in response to a blowout employment report for February that allowed the prospect of a strong recovery to outweigh fears of higher interest rates for once this week. 
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 224 points, or 0.7%, at 31,148, while the S&P 500 was up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite - again underperforming - rose 0.1%. 
Earlier, the government had said that the U.S. economy had added 379,000 jobs in February, almost double the consensus forecast for 182,000 and a dramatic acceleration from the past two months. January's payroll growth was also revised up by over 100,000 to 166,000.
""A very strong jobs report for February is just the start,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist with ING, in a note to clients. ""Construction is set to rebound next month after winter storms and with more state Governors relaxing Covid containment measures we expect to see even better numbers in March and April.""
He expected further support for the job market from the rapid rollout of vaccines across the country in the second quarter. U.S. President Joe Biden said earlier this week that the country will have enough vaccine for all adults by the end of May - two months ahead of his previous estimate. That's because the Food and Drug Administration has now approved a one-shot vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) that allows the inoculation campaign to be ramped up more quickly. The U.S. is currently vaccinating more than 2 million people a day.
Again, there was pressure on higher-value tech names, notably some of the key holdings of fund manager Cathie Wood's ARKK suite of funds. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell another 5% to trade below $600 for the first time since early December, while Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) stock fell 5.2%. Other electric vehicle makers that have enjoyed sky-high valuations so far - thanks in large part to assumptions of interest rates near zero for the foreseeable future - also weakened. ADRs of Nio (NYSE:NIO) fell 5.2%, while Fisker (NYSE:FSR) stock fell 3.1% and  Churchill Capital IV , the SPAC through which Lucid Motors has agreed to go public, fell another 5.2%. CCIV (NYSE:CCIV) has now lost some 60% from its peak valuation less than a month ago. 
Mean reversion was also in evidence with Gap (NYSE:GPS) rising 8.3% after its latest earnings promised an upturn in its fortunes, while Costco (NASDAQ:COST) fell 2.9% as its update signaled that the panic-buying of last year is unlikely to return.
Energy companies continued to be well bid, after the decision by OPEC to keep its output unchanged on Thursday. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stock rose 5.9% to its highest since the start of the pandemic.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock gained 2.1% and  Chevron  stock (NYSE:CVX) 3.0%. Oilfield services companies stocks were also lifted by hopes that higher crude prices will prompt an uptick in work in the shale patch. Schlumberger  (NYSE:SLB) stock rose 1.8% while Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) stock rose 3.7%."
1432,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 08:25AM ET</span>",Travel industry bets on vaccine passports to draw Brits to the Mediterranean,"By Sarah Young, Clara-Laeila Laudette and Laurence Frost
LONDON/MADRID/PARIS (Reuters) - The race to roll out vaccination passports is spurring competition among travel companies and tourist destinations for the large number of Britons set to receive COVID-19 shots before the summer.
Thanks to its swift vaccine deployment https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps, Britain is the only major European country likely to inoculate a large share of working-age adults by the peak season. They may become the first big regional test of digital health credentials in development.
Airlines such as easyJet (LON:EZJ) saw outbound bookings from Britain surge last week as the government raised the prospect of a return to quarantine-free summer travel, and the European Union agreed to develop vaccine passports under pressure from tourism-dependent southern countries.
But cooped-up consumers' getaway plans face reality checks – from unpredictable virus variants to lingering EU divisions over vaccine passports, with France leading resistance from several states over political and discrimination concerns.
Britain's tentative move towards restoring travel ""puts pressure on other countries to do the same, which is good for us"", said Grigoris Tasios of the Greek Hoteliers' Federation. Greece has eased restrictions for vaccinated Israelis and is discussing a similar arrangement with the UK. 
Tourism from Germany, another big travel market lagging the UK on vaccinations, hinges on Berlin dropping quarantines for tested passengers, Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said this week. 
In the aftermath of Britain's departure from the EU, its reputedly unruly tourists are at the centre of a battered travel industry's summer hopes.
Spain, typically Britons' number-one destination by far, has pushed hard for EU vaccination certificates. The island of Mallorca's mostly shuttered hotels anxiously await details, their spokeswoman Maria Duran said.
""We're paying very close attention to the UK, the first country to design and share a roadmap for restoring mobility,"" she said. Spain saw UK visitor numbers plunge to 3.1 million last year from more than 18 million in 2019.
'DON'T COME' - FRENCH MAYOR
Athens is appealing directly to British consumers. 
Those with shots will be spared tests, with or without the EU's blessing, tourism minister Harry Theocharis said in UK media interviews.
Tourism sustains a fifth of Greece's workforce and economy, hit by a 76% drop in international arrivals last year and 14 billion euros ($17 billion) in lost sector revenue.
Greece's position, and similar Spanish assurances, contrast with the message from France, the second-ranked destination for Britons – which is in no hurry to welcome them back.
""Don't come,"" the mayor of Nice Christian Estrosi advised potential overseas visitors last month as the Mediterranean city grappled with a faster-spreading COVID-19 variant first identified in Britain. ""It's not the time.""
As a result, airlines and tour operators are pushing ""sun-and-sea"" bookings to Spain, Greece and Portugal in a bid to bring in much-needed cash.
""The trend now is towards what's likely to be open,"" said Toby Kelly, CEO of UK travel agency Trailfinders, pointing to a ""massive pickup in demand"" to Greek destinations.
""Greece has been the big story, with its government totally behind vaccine certificates.""
Without waiting for Brussels, Cyprus joined the rush on Thursday, announcing that vaccinated UK tourists could enter from May 1 without testing or quarantine. 
Andy Davies, a 43-year-old British company director who booked a Mallorca villa for July after getting vaccinated, said he was reassured by Britain's reopening plans and ""noises coming out of Europe about the vaccine passport"".
Free cancellation guarantees on the rental and easyJet flights also helped, he said. 
""Clearly there are still risks.""
'QUEUES OUT THE DOOR'
Whether and how a EU vaccination passport would work with UK and other versions is unclear. Airlines are developing a Travel Pass app through industry body IATA, while the World Economic Forum is working on another alternative, CommonPass. See FACTBOX:
Without digitisation, document checks will quickly become unworkable when travel picks up, IATA warns. Even at 10% of pre-crisis traffic, test paperwork is already creating airport bottlenecks as staff spend 20 minutes with each passenger.
""Without automating these procedures (it's) going to be very difficult to get everyone away over the summer,"" Heathrow Airport boss John Holland-Kaye said. ""All airports would have queues out the door.""
Even after the EU go-ahead at a Feb. 25 summit, ambivalence among governments like France, Germany and Belgium could hamper vaccine passports' deployment.
""I would not accept a system that makes access to this or that country conditional on a (vaccine) certificate,"" said French President Emmanuel Macron. ""Our younger people will not have been vaccinated by the end of June or July.""
Airlines are aware of the sensitivities. 
""I think we should not call it a vaccine passport,"" Virgin Atlantic CEO Shai Weiss said recently. ""It's really a digital health app.""
A government-issued pass with international backing ""won't come out quickly enough for this summer"", Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary predicted this week. Instead, Ryanair plans to enable medical certificate uploads to its customer app, in the hope authorities will accept them.
Without faster progress towards an international standard, more governments are likely to go their own way. 
French regional airports are usually thronged with the 10 million UK passengers who fly in each year – the biggest national contingent. But they are worried about losing another summer, their UAF association chief Thomas Juin said, unless Paris sets out its own terms for a tourism revival.

""The more time goes by with Spain and Greece taking action, the more France is going to be left behind,"" he added.

1433,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 08:22AM ET</span>",Insurers rewrite business policies after pandemic legal tussles,"By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. insurers are strengthening language in policies that cover business losses to protect them from future claims related to the coronavirus pandemic or other widespread illnesses that disrupt operations, industry sources say.
New policies and renewals now define terms like ""communicable disease"" or ""microorganism"" – something existing policies often lacked, and which led to a flood of lawsuits that insurers have so far largely won.
An exclusion drafted by the Lloyd's Market Association, for example, says insurers will not cover any claim ""directly or indirectly arising out of, attributable to, or occurring concurrently or in any sequence with a Communicable Disease.""
Another, used by Farmers Mutual Hail Insurance Company of Iowa, excludes losses from even the ""fear or threat"" whether ""actual or perceived"" of a communicable disease or ""any action in controlling, preventing, suppressing"" it.
Some companies, such as The Cincinnati Insurance Cos, a unit of Cincinnati Financial Corp (NASDAQ:CINF), said they are not adding exclusions because current policy language makes clear that pandemics are not covered.
""A COVID-19 or pandemic-related exclusion would be like adding suspenders to a belt,"" spokeswoman Betsy Ertel told Reuters.
Cincinnati has been named in 149 lawsuits for claims denial, ranking it second behind Hartford Financial Services Group (NYSE:HIG) Inc, with 222 suits, and well ahead of Chubb (NYSE:CB) Ltd's 64 and American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG), with 38, according to data compiled by the University of Pennsylvania Law School.
Plaintiffs attorneys are pressing for coverage to apply. If insurers had been required to cover losses from business customers affected by the pandemic, it would cost them as much as $431 billion a month, according to an industry group. Critics have called that figure inflated.
Litigation related to existing policies sent shockwaves through the industry because of potential losses. The new language aims to snuff out ambiguity.
""Rather than have those terms continue to be undefined, insurers are including definitions to expressly reference COVID-19 or other SARS-related viruses,"" said Alan Lyons, who chairs the insurance and reinsurance group at law firm Herrick, Feinstein LLP in New York.
Pandemic-hit U.S. businesses have filed nearly 1,500 lawsuits challenging insurers who denied claims, according to the UPenn litigation tracker. 
Judges have handed insurers victories by dismissing about 81% of the 205 state and federal lawsuits decided so far. But among just the state decisions, insurers have lost 65% of cases when policies lacked virus exclusions and 43% even when there was an exclusion, said Tom Baker, professor at UPenn Law. 
""Because the governing law is state law, the early decisions from federal courts may not be as predictive of ultimate outcomes as those in state courts,"" Baker said.
Insurers have argued that business-interruption policies are intended to cover property damage, which the pandemic did not cause, and that their language does not specifically cover infectious illnesses and often includes exclusionary phrases.
""The policyholders are not entitled to recover because the virus does not damage property,"" said Michael Menapace, an insurance lawyer at Wiggin and Dana LLP who also works with the Insurance Information Institute, an industry association.
The court battles are not over, and some insurers have faced legal setbacks.
However, stronger language about communicable diseases has added extra security for insurers, whose own businesses have been hit by the economic decline and near-zero interest rates.

Plaintiffs attorneys remain hopeful. They point to victories in Ohio and in the United Kingdom, where courts found insurers liable for some claims, even on policies with virus exclusions. The Ohio decision, however, is likely to go through lengthy appeals and U.K. decisions do not have much effect on the United States.

ZURICH/PARIS (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS will on Monday begin its appeal against a record 4.5 billion-euro ($5.37 billion) penalty levied by a French court for allegedly helping wealthy clients stash undeclared assets offshore.
The case will be watched by banks across Europe, where fines for tax-related and other offences have historically been lower than in the United States.
Swiss rival  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) is under investigation over whether it helped some 2,650 Belgians hide their accounts from tax authorities. Credit Suisse says it has strictly complied with all applicable laws.
A French court in 2019 found UBS guilty of soliciting clients illegally and laundering the proceeds of tax evasion, imposing a 3.7 billion euro fine and 800 million euros in civil damages after an investigation that started in 2011.
The bank has denied any wrongdoing. It has so far set aside a tenth of that amount, or 450 million euros, to cover the penalties. It says any fine should be based on the amount of unpaid taxes and not the total funds parked by clients in Switzerland.
French prosecutors said at the time that UBS sent Swiss bankers to golf tournaments, classical music concerts and hunting parties to solicit clients illegally, advising them to put their money in Switzerland and offering them methods to shield activities from the French taxman.
The bank, the world's largest in wealth management, said it regularly organised social events for clients and they did not constitute unlawful solicitation.
    UBS, under the helm of CEO Ralph Hamers since November, refuted allegations it had set up a broad system to target French clients and launder the proceeds of tax fraud by those customers.
The case also yielded a landmark ruling in Switzerland in 2019, marking a further erosion of Swiss bank secrecy and setting a precedent for foreign governments seeking information from Swiss banks.
Switzerland's highest court at the time ruled that historical data on 40,000 UBS clients must be handed to French tax authorities, which said they want to use it to pursue French tax dodgers, despite the bank's concerns prosecutors would use the data in their trial against the bank.
However, judges stipulated the transferred data could not be used in the ongoing criminal case against UBS in France or as evidence against the bank.
    The appeals trial is set to run between March 8 and 24, although a verdict may not be delivered for at least a further three months. Any ruling can be appealed to France's Supreme Court.

Online demand for expensive makeup and handbags has received a boost during the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting luxury goods sellers to double down on their e-commerce business at a time when store traffic has been under pressure.
""Luxury ecommerce is poised for exponential growth,"" HBC Chief Executive Officer Richard Baker said.
Insight's equity investment values the online business, called Saks, at $2 billion, HBC said, adding the retailer's 40-store fleet would operate separately and would be referred to as SFA.
Marc Metrick, the chief executive of the combined firm, would helm Saks, with former Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) executive Sebastian Gunningham also joining the e-commerce company's board.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's competition watchdog wants a new independent banking industry body to accelerate take-up of ""open banking"" apps to spawn new fintech companies and offer more choice to consumers.
Open banking allows third-party internet based applications to compete with big banks by accessing a customer's accounts to make payments, or find better deals on loans and other services and products.
The Competition and Markets Authority on Friday launched a public consultation until the end of March on strengthening how the financial sector operates open banking and ensures sufficient competition.
Open banking has made a ""good start"" with hundreds of apps now available and around 450 firms in the pipeline, the CMA said.
""While the largest banks have shown signs of embracing open banking, they may also have an incentive to slow the further development of the open banking ecosystem, where this conflicts with their own commercial objectives,"" the CMA said.
HSBC, Lloyds (LON:LLOY), NatWest and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) continue to dominate high street banking, and the CMA wants the new industry body to push forward open banking.
It would replace the Open Banking Implementation Entity or OBIE, an interim body funded by big banks and led by a trustee Imran Gulamhuseinwala.
""Open banking has been critical to supporting the UK's emerging and growing fintech industry,"" Gulamhuseinwala said.
UK Finance, which represents Britain's banks, has put forward a blueprint for a not-for-profit company, but the CMA said there was a risk of big banks having an ""inappropriate"" influence over the new body's chair.
An ""independent and vigorous"" chair was needed to oversee a period of growth and not ""quiet consolidation"", the CMA said.
There are over three million users of open banking apps in Britain, with new users being added at the rate of a million every six months. Usage is expected to increase further as the government uses it to collect tax from companies.

Many of the apps are provided by fintechs, a critical growth sector for the government as it seeks to bolster the City of London's global attraction after being cut off from the European Union by Brexit.

1438,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 07:57AM ET</span>",EV rollout will require huge investments in strained U.S. power grids,"By Nichola Groom and Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - During several days of brutal cold in Texas, the city of Austin saw its fleet of 12 new electric buses rendered inoperative by a statewide power outage. That problem will be magnified next year, when officials plan to start purchasing electric-powered vehicles exclusively.
The city's transit agency has budgeted $650 million over 20 years for electric buses and a charging facility for 187 such vehicles. But officials are still trying to solve the dilemma of power interruptions like the Texas freeze.
""Redundancy and resiliency when it comes to power is something we have long understood will be an issue,"" said Capitol Metro spokeswoman Jenna Maxfield.
Austin's predicament highlights the challenges facing governments, utilities and auto manufacturers as they respond to climate change. More electric cars will require both charging infrastructure and much greater electric-grid capacity. Utilities and power generators will have to invest billions of dollars creating that additional capacity while also facing the challenge of replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. 
Extreme weather events add additional layers of difficulty.
""Reliability keeps you awake,"" California Energy Commission member Siva Gunda said in an interview.
Rolling blackouts during a California heat wave last year prompted the state to direct its utilities to procure emergency generating capacity for this summer and to reform its planning for reserve power. 
The state plans an aggressive phase-out of sales of gas- and diesel-powered cars and trucks by 2035 - which, if achieved, would require vast increases in electric grid capacity. (For a graphic on the extra power that will be needed for electric cars, click https://tmsnrt.rs/3rhyX4S ) 
Graphic: Estimated U.S. capacity if 66% of all cars are EVs by 2050 - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-WEATHER/GRIDS-AUTOS/qzjvqgzxmvx/chart.png
The power and transport sectors combined make up more than half of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Their simultaneous greening is considered critical for the United States - the world's second-largest emitter behind China - to meet its obligations under an international accord to address global warming. (For a graphic on the energy sources that fuel U.S. transportation now, click https://tmsnrt.rs/387haFR )
Graphic: Fossil fuels power the U.S. transportation sector - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-WEATHER/GRID-AUTOS/xklpyowgqpg/chart.png
The goal is to power electric cars with renewable energy rather than the coal and natural gas that currently dominate the U.S. power supply. To realize that vision, electricity from intermittent sources like wind and solar will need to be stored, probably through battery technology, so that cars can charge overnight or at other times when supply outstrips demand.
DOUBLING POWER CAPACITY
A model utility with two to three million customers would need to invest between $1,700 and $5,800 in grid upgrades per EV through 2030, according to Boston Consulting Group. Assuming 40 million EVs on the road, that investment could reach $200 billion.
So far, investor-owned companies have plans approved for just $2.6 billion in charging programs and projects, according to trade group Edison Electric Institute.
""The electrification of the transportation sector will catch most utilities a little bit off guard,"" said Ben Kroposki, director of the Power Systems Engineering Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NYSE:LH) (NREL).
The organization estimates that, by 2050, the electrification of transportation and other sectors will require a doubling of U.S. generation capacity.
If not managed carefully, the needed investments could saddle consumers with higher energy bills, according to a report last month by California’s utility regulator. Another challenge: lower-income customers often can't afford to make the upfront investment in electric cars, home batteries and rooftop solar systems that could save them money in the long term.
'CHICKEN AND EGG' PROBLEMS
Utilities are embracing EV sales growth as both a promising new source of revenue and an opportunity to use excess wind and solar power generated at very windy or sunny times when supply exceeds demand.
Investments in both the grid and charging infrastructure that are recovered from ratepayers could add between $3 billion and $10 billion in cumulative cash flow to the average utility through 2030, according to Boston Consulting Group. The forecast also includes potential revenues from new products outside of utilities' regulated businesses, such as customer fleet routing or charging station maintenance.
The revenue opportunity is still nascent, however, with EVs making up less than 2% of all vehicles registered in the United States. And utilities must invest in infrastructure now for consumers to feel secure in their purchase of an EV, said Emily Fisher, general counsel of utility trade group Edison Electric Institute. 
""There is definitely a chicken-and-egg situation with charging infrastructure,"" she said.
AUTOMAKERS BET BIG ON EVs
Major U.S. automakers General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford have announced large investments in EV development to keep pace with electric-car pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and to prepare for the prospect of tougher emissions regulations. EV share could grow to 15% by 2030, according to U.S. Department of Energy forecasts.
The electricity to power all those cars is expected to come primarily from renewable energy sources and natural gas, according to NREL. Even if natural gas generation increases to support electrified transportation, overall emissions are projected to decline, the organization said.
Large new investments may pose difficulties for utilities already experiencing weather-related problems. In Texas, many of the companies that would be making those investments face a financial crisis stemming from last month’s cold snap. Utilities and power marketers face billions of dollars in blackout-related charges, and several have filed for bankruptcy.
CHARGING UP
Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) Trucks, the world's biggest maker of heavy-duty haulers, plans to sell electric vehicles in Europe, North America and Japan by next year. But the company is grappling with how to charge what will one day become hundreds of thousands of battery-powered trucks, said Daimler Trucks chairman Martin Daum.
The need for massive investments in grid infrastructure and charging stations ""cannot be underestimated,"" Daum said. 
Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley last week called on U.S. government leaders to support EV sales with favorable regulation and subsidies for the production of batteries and charging infrastructure.
But Robert Barrosa, senior director at Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY)'s Electrify America, which is building out fast-charging stations throughout the nation, said the gradual pace of EV adoption will allow utilities to adapt.
""We're not in a doom-and-gloom situation,"" Barrosa said. ""We're not going to 80% battery electric sales overnight...it will be a natural transition.""
Barrosa said U.S. energy consumption decreases over the last 20 years, due to efficiency gains in appliances and the transportation sector, mean that the U.S. power system has enough established capacity to support EV growth without the immediate need for big investments. (For a graphic on U.S. power generation and consumption, click https://tmsnrt.rs/3e5f6SH) 
Graphic: The U.S. is generating more electricity than it consumes - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-WEATHER/GRID-AUTOS/qmyvmwenyvr/chart.png
Utility  Xcel Energy  (NASDAQ:XEL) said EV adoption would likely not require capacity additions until after 2030, and that near-term investments would mainly be in distribution systems. The company is planning to accommodate 1.5 million electric vehicles in its Midwest and Western service territories by 2030, about 30 times more than its current capability.
The utility in December received approval to spend $110 million on electric vehicle charging infrastructure in Colorado, which passed a law in 2019 requiring utilities to develop plans for widespread transportation electrification. The plan is expected to add 65 cents a month to residential customer bills. 
Electric vehicles - especially commercial ones with large batteries - can help stabilize the grid in the long run by feeding power back into the system during times of peak demand, using chargers that allow electricity to flow in both directions. Passenger cars that sit idle most of the day could one day earn money by feeding power back into the grid with the help of bi-directional chargers, utilities predict.
During the Texas outages, some Twitter users said they used their electric vehicles to power their homes. But wider applications of such vehicle-to-grid technology would require larger infrastructure changes and utility involvement.

""Planning is going to be more sophisticated,"" said Ryan Popple, co-founder of Proterra, which produced some of Austin's electric buses. ""And as vehicle-to-grid becomes more common with our commercial fleets, it's actually going to make the overall technology even more attractive.""

1440,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 07:13AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Mixed; Treasury Yields and Payrolls in Focus,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Friday, in cautious trading after the previous session’s sharp sell-off, ahead of the closely watched monthly employment report.
At 7:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 30 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 42points, or 0.1%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 20 points, or 0.2%.
Wall Street closed sharply lower Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite falling 2.1%, erasing its gains for the year and dropping into correction territory from its February high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.3%, now over 3% below its record high, and the S&P 500 fell 1.3%. 
Stocks could rebound Friday, but any gains look tepid as U.S. Treasury yields remain elevated. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell shrugged off investor fears about rising inflation, stating on Thursday that the central bank’s ultra-loose monetary policy was here to stay given the uneven economic recovery.
“It seems clear that upside risks to U.S. yields will dominate into the Fed meeting of March 17, leaving both risk assets and short dollar positions vulnerable,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
The latest barometer of the state of the recovering economy will come with the release of the government’s tally of new non-farm jobs in February, due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT). Expectations are for a reading of 182,000, up from the 49,000 reported for January. 
“Powell made it very clear that the U.S. has a long way to go to meet its full employment goals – meaning in reality a strong jobs report should not bring pricing of the first Fed hike substantially nearer than the currently-priced 1Q ‘23,” added ING.
In the corporate sector, the big tech names will again be in focus as investors think twice about owning richly-valued companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which is now 30% lower than its record high earlier this year.
Also in the spotlight will be the oil majors, on the back of sharp gains in the price of crude after the decision of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, not to increase output in April. 
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) were both up around 2% premarket, while U.S. crude futures traded 2.5% higher at $65.42 a barrel and the international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.7% to $68.53, its highest since 2019. Both contracts surged more than 4% on Thursday,  
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,693.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1937.

1441,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 05:55AM ET</span>","A new era of volatility begins, but equity inflows continue: BofA","By Thyagaraju Adinarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors poured billions of dollars into high-flying stocks even as the ongoing bond market rout led to sharp losses on Wall Street and kicked off a ""new era of volatility"", BofA said on Friday.
Hovering close to 1.6%, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields have risen close to 45 basis points in the last month, triggering a sell-off in equities, which have lost $4 trillion in market value since the mid-February peak.
The investment bank, analysing flows on the back of EPFR data, said equity funds saw $22.2 billion of inflows, driven by $2.3 billion into tech and $2 billion into financials in the week to Wednesday. 
The bond market slump is yet to prompt a major change in positioning among investors, with a record 62.6% of BofA's clients invested in stocks.
A $29 trillion monetary and fiscal stimulus has led to an ""addictive"" Wall Street-Fed dependency culture, Michael Hartnett, the bank's chief investment strategist said in the note to clients. Markets will now likely push the Fed via higher yields into a yield curve control (YCC) policy announcement, he added.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's messaging on Thursday disappointed Wall Street as investors had built expectations he would act on the yield spike in U.S. 10-year Treasuries.
Bonds yields surged and high-flying tech stocks slumped as Powell spoke at a Wall Street Journal forum.
""The bond market threw another tantrum,"" said Steen Jakobsen, chief investment officer at Saxo Bank. 
""The most intense bond and equity selling unfolded while he spoke (on Thursday), clearly indicating a tantrum-like demand for more reassurance from the Fed that it will not allow rates to continue higher.""
A flood of money supply and ultra-low or negative interest rates have boosted world stocks, which have added close to $40 trillion from the bottom of coronavirus sell-off last year.
Stocks have added about $6 billion per hour, since last March, almost 10 times faster than the pace seen in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, according to BofA.
""We think the Fed will inevitably move to YCC,"" Hartnett said, adding the U.S. dollar could rise before that, but any announcement of a switch to YCC would likely trigger the start of a great bear market in the greenback.
The U.S. dollar index hit November highs on Friday. Still, investors were largely bearish with net $30 billion dollar short positions, a bit less than the $35 billion at the end of January - which was the most since 2011.
The Fed's policy-making committee convenes next on March 16-17.

1443,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 04:56AM ET</span>",StockBeat: The Sun Also Rises on Oil and Gas Stocks,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- As European stock markets took fright Friday at the sight of U.S. and Asian markets selling off, there was at least one sector still enjoying a strong end to a strong week. 
Oil and gas stocks, which surged on Thursday after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries surprisingly kept a tight cap on its output quotas for April, were still enjoying their moment in the sun, many hitting their highest levels in over a year as analysts revised up their crude price targets for 2021.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts now expect Brent crude prices to hit $70 a barrel by the end of the month, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts expect it to hit $80 by the third quarter.
The Stoxx Oil and Gas index rose 0.5% to its highest level since February 2020, when the start of the pandemic knocked the bottom out of the oil market as travel demand collapsed.
Gains throughout the sector broadened as markets recovered from the overnight shock of bond market volatility that followed another relaxed take on the inflation outlook from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Even at the end of a week that has seen most names rally by between 5% and 10%, there appeared to be little pressure to consolidate. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDSa) stock rose 1.6%, and is now trading above where it was when it announced its fateful dividend 'reset' last spring, while BP (NYSE:BP) stock rose 2.0% and Equinor (NYSE:EQNR) stock rose 2.9%, the last of the three hitting its highest in 13 months along with Italy's Eni (NYSE:E).
There were even bigger 'mean reversion' trades in smaller producers and, conspicuously, in oilfield services stocks, as investors priced out the risk of any further cut to capital spending against a more favorable pricing environment. U.K. independent  Tullow Oil  (LON:TLW) rose another 8%, bringing its gains for the year-to-date to 68%. But long-neglected names such as Petrofac (LON:PFC), Saipem (OTC:SAPMY), Hunting  (OTC:HNTIY) and Tenaris (NYSE:TS) made solid gains too.
The case for the upstream producers is relatively straightforward, especially since Shell and others have signaled that they don't intend to increase production from here on, but rather just to pocket the higher cash flow and use it to reduce debt and keep shareholders happy. Rising bond yields aren't great for majors who have borrowed to get themselves through the last year, but the forces driving yields higher are also ensuring the majors can service that debt more easily.
The case for the services companies, however, is a little more nuanced. The 'OPEC+' decision on Thursday was effectively a bet on the fact that non-OPEC supply - particularly U.S. shale - won't come back in a hurry even if the cartel does squeeze supply for longer.  In other words, a bet that any pick-up in business for oilfield services will be at best modest. That's important for the likes of Austria's Schoeller-Bleckmann  (VIE:SBOE), which does most of its business in the U.S.   
The OPEC+ decision is also an admission, implicitly, that the bloc doesn't yet believe fully in the demand recovery story, for good reason: international air travel is still on its knees, and from India to Italy and Texas, Covid-19 cases have stopped falling as governments have bowed to pressure to reopen. 
However, that's unlikely to bother anyone in the industry in the short term. The clouds have lifted, and it's time to enjoy the sunshine.

1444,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 04:55AM ET</span>","Texas grid operator made $16 billion price error during winter storm, watchdog says","By Kanishka Singh
(Reuters) - Texas' power grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) made a $16 billion pricing error in the week of the winter storm that led to power outages across the state, Potomac Economics, which monitors the state's power market, said.
ERCOT kept market prices for power too high for more than a day after widespread outages ended late on Feb. 17, Potomac Economics, the independent market monitor for the Public Utility Commission of Texas, which oversees ERCOT, said in a filing.
""In order to comply with the Commission Order, the pricing intervention that raised prices to VOLL (value of lost load) should have ended immediately at that time (late on Feb. 17),"" Potomac Economics said.
""However, ERCOT continued to hold prices at VOLL by inflating the Real-Time On-Line Reliability Deployment Price Adder for an additional 32 hours through the morning of February 19,"" it said, adding the decision resulted in $16 billion in additional costs to ERCOT's markets.
The findings of Potomac Economics were reported first on Thursday by Bloomberg and the Texas Tribune.
Separately, rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service downgraded ERCOT by one notch from A1 to Aa3 and revised the grid operator's credit outlook to ""negative"" on Thursday.
On Wednesday, ERCOT's board ousted chief executive Bill Magness, as the fallout continued from a blackout that left residents without heat, power or water for days.
The mid-February storm temporarily knocked out up to half the state's generating plants, triggering outages that killed dozens and pushed power prices to 10 times the normal rate.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Friday, with rising U.S. bond yields and fresh worries about the Covid-19 pandemic spooking investors.
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.9% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.7% and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 1.1%.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made it clear at a conference on Thursday that the central bank wouldn’t be changing its ultra-loose monetary policy any time soon.
These comments prompted Treasury yields to rise close to last week’s highs, something that may bush borrowing costs for households and business higher, crimping the recovery.
The February U.S. jobs report is due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), and will be studied closely, with the addition of 182,000 payrolls expected, compared with just 49,000 in January.
Adding to the concerns Friday were worries about a global fight for Covid-19 vaccines after a shipment of 250,000 doses of AstraZeneca’s drug that were destined for Australia was blocked by Italy under a new European Union regulation. Italy is one of a number of EU countries to have experienced a rise in Covid-19 cases over the last two weeks.
The World Health Organization warned that the number of new coronavirus infections globally rose last week for the first time in seven weeks.
Oil and gas stocks outperformed as crude prices pushed higher, following the decision of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies not to increase output in April. Equinor stock rose 1.8% to its highest in over a year, while Royal Dutch Shell (AS:RDSa) stock and  Total  (PA:TOTF) stock edged down by less than half a percent each.
The group, known collectively as OPEC+, approved the continuation of current curbs on production at its ministerial meeting on Thursday, with small exemptions for Russia and Kazakhstan.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% higher at $64.75 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.6% to $67.80, its highest since 2019. Both contracts surged more than 4% on Thursday.
In corporate news, Stellantis (PA:STLA) stock rose 0.6% after the world’s fourth largest car maker announced late Thursday it will begin the distribution of the stake it still holds in components group Faurecia to its shareholders.
UBS (SIX:UBSG) stock fell 1.6% after the Swiss banking giant’s net profit dropped marginally last year from the unaudited results, while compensation for its executives soared. 
 Aggreko  (LON:AGGK) stock rose 1.2% after the temporary power provider backed a 2.3 billion pound ($3.2 billion) takeover bid from private equity firms, while  London Stock Exchange  (LON:LSEG) stock fell 4.5% despite the financial information company reporting a healthy rise in 2020 profit and declaring an increased dividend.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.6% to $1,690.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1926.

The pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.9% in early trading, with shares of travel, mining, and financial services companies leading the declines.
While Powell said the rise in yields was ""notable"", he did not consider it a ""disorderly"" move, or one that pushed long-term rates so high the Fed might have to intervene in markets more forcefully to bring them down.
The comments fuelled a sell-off on Wall Street on Thursday, pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq to erase its yearly gains. European tech shares also fell 1.0%, on course for their second weekly loss.

Libor, or London Interbank Offered Rate, is being replaced by rates compiled by central banks after lenders were fined billions of dollars for trying to rig what was once dubbed the world's most important number, used for pricing home loans and credit cards across the world.
""This is an important step towards the end of Libor, and the Bank of England and FCA urge market participants to continue to take the necessary action to ensure they are ready,"" the FCA said in a statement.
All sterling, euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen denominations of Libor will end on Dec. 31, the FCA said. As previously announced by the U.S. Federal Reserve, some dollar denominated versions will continue until mid-2023.
""Today’s announcements mark the final chapter in the process that began in 2017, to remove reliance on unsustainable LIBOR rates and build a more robust foundation for the financial system,"" Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said in a statement.
""With limited time remaining, my message to firms is clear – act now and complete your transition by the end of 2021.""

The FCA said that it does not expect any Libor setting to become ""unrepresentative"" before December, meaning that contracts that use Libor for pricing would have to switch to another rate at short notice.

In late December, the SEC charged Ripple, which is associated with cryptocurrency XRP, with conducting a $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering.
After that, the top U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase shut down trading in XRP, which is the world's seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market value. 
""It (the lawsuit) has hindered activity in the United States, but it has not really impacted what's going on for us in Asia Pacific,"" Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple's chief executive officer, told Reuters in a video interview from California.
""We have been able to continue to grow the business in Asia and Japan because we've had regulatory clarity in those markets,"" he said, adding that he did not know of any exchange outside the United States that had halted XRP trading.
""XRP is traded on over 200 exchanges around the world. It's really only three or four exchanges in the United States that have halted trading,"" he said.
Garlinghouse was one of two of the firm's executives alleged by the SEC in December of personally gaining about $600 million received from the unregistered offering. 
Financial regulators around the world are looking to decide how they should regulate the cryptocurrency industry.
The outcome of their assessments could determine whether cryptocurrencies will grow into mainstream assets or remain niche products. 
Gary Gensler, President Joe Biden's nominee to lead the SEC, promised during his congressional confirmation hearing to provide ""guidance and clarity"" to the cyptocurrency market. 
While bitcoin is considered a commodity by U.S. financial regulators, most other cryptocurrencies have yet to be classified as commodities or securities.
Ripple has signed more than 15 new contracts with banks globally since the SEC brought its lawsuit, Garlinghouse said, adding that he believed the lack of clarity in the United States has been a ""hindrance"" to innovation.

""We're seeing the activity of XRP liquidity has grown outside the United States and continue to grow in Asia, certainly in Japan,"" he said.

Russia’s biggest dollar-store chain priced 178 million global depositary receipts, representing one ordinary share each, at the top end of an initial $8.75 to $9.75 range, according to a statement Friday. The sale values Fix Price at $8.3 billion.
Proceeds from Russian IPOs and secondary public offerings could reach more than $10 billion this year after a long fallow period, according to VTB Capital. This could make 2021 the biggest year for Russian share sales since before international sanctions were imposed on the country in the wake of its annexation of Crimea in 2014.
Online retailer Ozon Holdings (NASDAQ:OZON) had a $1.3 billion U.S. IPO in November, and more deals are lining up, with gold miners Nord Gold SE and GV Gold PJSC said to consider going public.
Fix Price could sell another 27 million GDRs from an over-allotment option, bringing the deal size to as much as $2 billion. That would mark the biggest IPO from a Russian company since United Co. Rusal Ltd.’s Hong Kong listing in 2010, which raised $2.2 billion.
If allocated in full, 24% of Fix Price’s total share capital will be publicly traded.
Fix Price, which uses a model similar to  Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR). in the U.S., has prospered as Russian wages have stagnated since the 2014 collapse of the ruble. It operates more than 4,200 stores and had revenue of 190 billion rubles ($2.6 billion) last year.
BofA Securities,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and VTB Capital are joint global coordinators and bookrunners on the IPO.

1453,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 02:30AM ET</span>",Top Toshiba shareholder gets further support for proposed investigation,"By Makiko Yamazaki and Takashi Umekawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - Effissimo Capital Management has gained further backing in its push for a probe into Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp, but big stakes built up by investors like BlackRock have raised questions over how much influence it and other activist shareholders will ultimately wield.
Glass Lewis became on Friday the second major proxy advisor to recommend shareholders vote in favour of an independent investigation into allegations that investors were pressured ahead of last year's annual general meeting.
Singapore-based Effissimo, which is Toshiba's top shareholder with a 9.9% stake, made the proposal after investor complaints about the last AGM.
Reuters has reported the Harvard University endowment fund had been told by a Japanese government adviser that it could be subject to a regulatory probe if it voted against management at the AGM. The fund abstained from voting as a result and later learnt there was no basis for any probe, sources have said.
Toshiba conducted its own investigation into complaints about last year's AGM and found it was not involved in any effort to pressure the Harvard fund. It did not reach a conclusion as to whether there had been any pressure. 
The vote about the proposed independent investigation will take place at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on March 18.
Activist investors are estimated to hold about 25% of Toshiba's shares and their dissatisfaction with management saw Chief Executive Nobuaki Kurumatani only narrowly hang onto his job with 57% of the vote at the last AGM.
Toshiba, however, was reinstated in the Topix index on Feb. 25, requiring index-linked funds to purchase its shares - a shift that is expected to dilute the influence of activist shareholders in the longer term. 
Both BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Mizuho Financial Group Inc have built stakes of 5% in Toshiba, filings on Friday and late Thursday showed - stakes which sources familiar with the matter said likely reflects the need to have shares on hand for their customers.
Toshiba shares jumped 6% on the news.
But to vote at the March 18 meeting, shareholders need to have held Toshiba shares as of Feb. 1. It is unclear at what point BlackRock and Mizuho began additional share purchases.
BlackRock and Mizuho declined to comment.
Toshiba had no immediate comment.
Glass Lewis also joined Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) in recommending that a probe look into allegations of vote miscounting at last year's AGM.
Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank Ltd has acknowledged it made mistakes in the counting but Effissimo says some irregularities have not been accounted for.

Unlike ISS, Glass Lewis also backed a proposal from U.S. hedge fund Farallon Capital Management, Toshiba's second largest shareholder, which wants the board to present a five-year capital policy plan or make certain returns to shareholders.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A late rally in Chinese shares on Friday helped pull Asian stocks off one-month lows as investors picked bargains while attention shifted to U.S. non-farm payrolls due later in the day.
E-Mini futures for S&P 500, which were down 0.5% during early Asian trading, gave up all losses by afternoon to be a shade higher. 
Futures for Europe were pointing to a weaker start though, with those for Eurostoxx 50, Germany's Dax and London's FTSE down 0.3% to 0.6%.
In Asia, Australian stocks dropped more than 0.7%, Japan's Nikkei share average shed 0.2%, after earlier being down more than 1%, and shares in Seoul fell 0.4%. 
Chinese shares, which had opened in the red, reversed losses with the bluechip CSI300 index up 0.3%.
That left MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan down 0.4% at 694.87 but still above the day's low of 684.52, a level not seen since Feb. 1. 
""China had a decent rally at the lows so that pulled markets higher. We saw a nice turnaround coming through,"" said Chris Weston, Melbourne-based strategist for Pepperstone. 
""We are seeing some strength come back. Energy, staples, utilities have done well and financials too as a hedge against rising rates."" 
Earlier, equity investors were rattled by a sell-off in U.S. Treasuries which sent yields rising and hoisted the dollar to a three-month high, dragging the Japanese yen lower.
Energy markets were not spared the volatility either, with oil prices adding to big gains overnight after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies agreed to mostly maintain their supply cuts in April as they await a more solid recovery in demand from the COVID-19 pandemic. [O/R]
Investor focus turned to the release of the U.S. non-farm payrolls for February, with the market eyeing a bounce back in employment growth and a steady unemployment rate at 6.3%.
""We suspect the market will be inclined to look through a weaker number, with investors looking ahead to the big fiscal stimulus planned in the U.S. and the eventual removal of Covid-related restrictions later this year,"" said Ray Attrill, head of forex strategy at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY). 
On Thursday, U.S. stocks slumped after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell disappointed some investors by not indicating that the Fed might step up purchases of long-term bonds to hold down longer-term interest rates.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.1%, taking it down about 10% from its record close on Feb. 12 and putting it in correction territory. 
Even though Powell made it clear that the Fed was not close to changing its ultra-loose monetary policy stance anytime soon, some analysts still worried rising Treasury yields could herald higher borrowing costs, thereby limiting the fragile U.S. economic recovery.
Bond investors sold U.S. debt. The yield on 10-year Treasuries climbed above 1.5% though it was still below a one-year high of 1.614% struck last week. 
The yield curve, a measure of economic expectations, steepened on rising yields, with the gap between two- and 10-year yields widening by another 6.3 basis points overnight.
Rising Treasury yields bolstered demand for the dollar. The dollar index jumped to a three-month high of 91.734. 
A stronger dollar hobbled the yen. By early Friday, the yen fell to as low as 108.11, the lowest since June 9.
The euro was also tripped by a firmer dollar, with the common currency sluggish at $1.1955.
Climbing yields and dollar strength pummeled gold prices, which sank to a nine-month low as investors sold the precious metal to reduce the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding asset. 
Spot gold was last at $1,697 per ounce, trading below $1,700 for the first time since June 2020.
Oil prices extended gains on Friday after zooming higher overnight.

U.S. crude futures climbed 82 cents to $64.65, holding just below a 13-month high hit on Thursday. Brent crude rose 88 cents to $67.62 a barrel.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening largely lower Friday, following the lead from Wall Street as rising U.S. bond yields again startled investors along with fresh concerns over the Covid-19 pandemic.

There was a sharp selloff on Wall Street on Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropping over 2%, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made it clear that the central bank wouldn’t be changing its ultra-loose monetary policy any time soon.
Some investors had expected Powell to signal his willingness to adjust the Fed’s asset purchase program to combat rising yields, as they could bring higher borrowing costs and limit a fragile U.S. economic recovery.
The February U.S. jobs report is due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), and will be studied closely, with the addition of 182,000 payrolls expected, compared with just 49,000 in January.
Adding to the concerns Friday were worries about a potential shortage of vaccines globally after a shipment of 250,000 doses of AstraZeneca’s drug that were destined for Australia was blocked by Italy under a new European Union regulation. 
Additionally, more than a dozen U.S. states have reported increases in hospitalizations for the coronavirus, threatening to reverse a national trend that has pushed in-patient numbers to the lowest level for months.
This comes a few days after the World Health Organization warned that the number of new coronavirus infections globally rose last week for the first time in seven weeks.
In corporate news, Stellantis (PA:STLA), the world’s fourth largest car maker, announced late Thursday it will begin the distribution of the stake it still holds in components group  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) to its shareholders.
Oil prices pushed higher Friday, continuing the sharp gains of the previous session, following the decision of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies not to increase output in April.

The next OPEC+ meeting will take place on April 1, where May’s production levels will be discussed.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% higher at $64.81 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.7% to $67.85, its highest since 2019. Both contracts surged more than 4% on Thursday,

1456,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 01:35AM ET</span>","Analysis: Wealth managers frustrated over bitcoin, anxious for piece of the action","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The rollercoster ride in bitcoin since the start of the year has not dampened wealth manager Jim Paulsen's enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency. 
Yet Paulsen, chief investment officer for Leuthold Group, which manages $1 billion, cannot own bitcoin in client portfolios due to regulatory constraints. This has left him on the sidelines watching the world's most popular cyrptocurrency surge more than 900% since its March lows in volatile trading that also saw bitcoin lose more than 20% in the span of a few days. 
""What I like about bitcoin is... its correlation to stocks and other assets is extraordinarily independent,"" said Paulsen, who remains frustrated that he cannot own it for clients. 
The promise of an asset class that behaves differently than stocks or bonds is leaving portfolio and wealth managers scrambling own cryptocurrencies if they can. 
Many view bitcoin as a good inflation hedge. Nearly 20% of advisors are contemplating investing in cyryptocurrencies this year due to concerns about inflation, up from 6.3% in 2019, according to a report from Citi. 
Still, a number of advisors say they are unable to own bitcoin for their clients until they can hold it in an exchange-traded fund or mutual fund that clears legal hurdles common for any investment.
Should that happen, institutional money could flow in and push the asset class higher, analysts said.
BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, said on Jan. 21 it was adding bitcoin futures as eligible investments for certain funds. Fund experts expect other asset management firms to follow suit. 
Yet the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not yet recognize cryptocurrencies as a security like a stock or a bond, and has not ruled whether mutual funds can own them directly, said Robert Jenkins, global head of research at Refinitiv Lipper. So it remains unclear whether any mutual funds currently own bitcoin because they are not required to disclose it, he said.
In the United States, eight firms have tried without success since 2013 to create a bitcoin ETF, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at New York based CFRA. 
The SEC did not respond to questions for this article. 
Funds like the popular ARK Invest ETF line that have positions in bitcoin do it through shares of the Greyscale Bitcoin Trust, a publicly traded trust that holds a set number of bitcoin units and often trades at a premium to the value of its underlying portfolio. 
Securities regulators in Canada approved the world's first bitcoin ETF on Feb. 12, leading some investors to hope that U.S. regulators will shortly follow. 
President Joe Biden's nominee to head the SEC, Gary Gensler, spoke in broad terms about crytocurrencies in a confirmation hearing Tuesday, suggesting that the agency should provide more regulation on how it views the asset class. Some investors have taken his appointment as raising the likelihood that a bitcoin ETF will be approved for the U.S.
Gensler ""seems more crypto-friendly than previous folks who had oversight,"" said Viraj Patel, head of asset allocation at Fiduciary Trust International, who has not yet made investments in the asset class for clients but is waiting for a U.S.-based ETF. ""We're really looking at cryptocurrency through the lens of this could be gold 2.0,"" said Patel.
Still, Rosenbluth said he was skeptical of a product being approved this year, saying there would be a high bar to clear tied to market manipulation and custody audit. 
Even in the absence of an ETF, retail interest ""remains strong with no signs of abating,"" JP Morgan analysts wrote in a Feb 16 research note.
Overall, cyptocurrency funds and products that investors can buy direct brought in nearly $5.6 billion in assets in 2020, up more than 600% from the year before, according to asset manager CoinShares. Cryptocurrency funds have gathered $4.2 billion in flows for this year through March 1, Coinshares said. 

""Not allowing the purchase of cyrpto is something that's frustrating to many advisors, but it's such a volatile asset that many investors end up doing it on their own,"" said Jimmy Lee, chief executive of the Wealth Consulting Group.

An inquiry into Crown's plans to open a new casino in Sydney last month found it was unfit to hold a gambling licence due to allegations it dealt with tour operators linked to organised crime, failed to protect staff jailed in China for breaking that country's anti-gambling laws, and had ""dysfunctional"" leadership dominated by Packer.
The states where Crown already has casinos subsequently announced their own inquiries, with Victoria choosing a quasi-judicial Royal Commission and Western Australia picking a less powerful format.
Before the upgrade to a Royal Commission, the Western Australian inquiry had the powers of a Royal Commission but the commissioner did ""not have the immunities and protections afforded by the Royal Commissions Act"", the state's Attorney General John Quigley told reporters.
A Royal Commission would ""provide the next State Government with a thorough and independent examination"" of Crown and the state's regulatory system, Racing and Gaming Minister Paul Papalia added in a statement. 
The upgraded inquiry was called while the state government was in ""caretaker"" mode ahead of a state election.
Crown Chair Helen Coonan said the Royal Commission was an opportunity for the company to ""detail the reforms and changes to our business to deliver the highest standards of governance and compliance, and an organisational culture that meets community expectations"".
Royal Commissions are Australia's most powerful type of inquiry where investigators can compel witnesses to testify. They typically end with a report that may include recommendations for referrals to law enforcement agencies.

The Western Australia Royal Commission would be required to deliver its final report by Nov. 14, Quigley said, making it longer than the Victorian inquiry which runs to August.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down Friday morning, continuing Thursday’s losses after U.S. Treasury yields' moves increased investor jitters.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.29% by 10:25 PM ET (3:25 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component inched down 0.07%. China’s National People’s Congress (NPS) opened on Friday, where a conservative economic growth target of above 6%, below economists’ forecasts, was set for 2021. The congress also outlined fiscal support to support China’s economic recovery from COVID-19.
Beijing also placed reforms in Hong Kong’s electoral system on the agenda for its annual 'two sessions’ meetings that began on Thursday. The reforms could lead to Hong Kong’s Legislative Council elections being delayed for another year to September 2022 and place curbs on democracy activist's being elected. The NPS is now reportedly set to review a draft resolution proposing the reforms in the coming days.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.07%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 1.48%. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said the current state of emergency in the Tokyo region, set to expire on Mar. 7, could be extended by two weeks.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.88% and in Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.99%.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell disappointed expectations during the Wall Street Journal jobs summit on Thursday by declining to indicate purchases of long-term bonds to hold down longer-term interest rates. He did however mention the recent runup in yields without hinting at intervention during his speech at the summit, saying that he would be “concerned by disorderly conditions.”
Bond yields rose in Australia after a jump in the ten-year Treasury to 1.56% lifted the yield curve to its steepest point since 2015. The dollar inched up on Friday.
Some investors expressed concern about rising inflation and the impact of higher yields on elevated stock valuations, even as others view the rate moves as a positive sign of economic recovery.
“The U.S. dollar has gained 0.8%, and there you see the holy trinity of market fears - rising real rates, increased expectations of rate hikes, and a stronger U.S. dollar,” Pepperstone Markets Ltd. head of Research Chris Weston told Reuters.
Other investors agreed with Weston.
“It makes logical and intuitive sense that Treasury yields should move back up to 1.50% or 2%, but we are concerned with the rest of the market about the speed at which it’s getting there,” Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors LLC investment strategist Mona Mahajan told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate voted on Thursday to take up President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package bill, with the chamber widely expected to approve the country’s sixth stimulus package since COVID-19-induced lockdowns began a year ago at the end of the debate over the weekend.
Investors also await February’s U.S. employment report, including non-farm payrolls, due later in the day."

WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) on Thursday criticized Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co for pursuing battery contracts with SK Innovation after evidence had emerged the South Korean electric vehicle (EV) battery maker misappropriated trade secrets from cross-town rival LG Chem.
The ITC last month sided with LG Chem in its trade secrets claims, issuing a limited 10-year exclusion order prohibiting imports into the United States of lithium-ion batteries by SK Innovation (SK). It permitted SK to import components for domestic production of batteries for Ford's EV F-150 program for four years, and for Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) of America’s MEB electric vehicle line for North America for two years.
In a redacted version of its full 96-page opinion Thursday, the ITC questioned why the second largest U.S. automaker had continued to pursue battery contracts with SK Innovation ""after SK's misconduct in this investigation had come to light.""
It said Ford had sought business with SK even after a company employee in November 2019 was deposed in the commission's investigation and at a time when it only had a contract with SK to supply batteries for the EV F-150.
""There is no explanation in the record why Ford would choose to ignore or excuse SK's egregious misconduct,"" the ITC added. ""The fault here belongs with SK, as well as with those, like Ford, who deliberately chose to continue to cultivate prospective business relationships predicated on SK's trade secret misappropriation.""
The ITC also rejected Ford's request to extend exemptions to Ford's unannounced new EVs.
""Ford's basis for extending the exemption is to take advantage of economies of scope by using similar SK batteries with misappropriated technologies across several unnamed vehicles,"" it said. ""The commission finds the evidence concerning the public interest does not support Ford’s request."" 
Ford declined to comment on Thursday, referring to its previous statement that the ITC decision supported its efforts to bring its EV Ford F-150 to market in mid-2022.
SK Innovation has warned previously that the decision would force it to halt construction of a $2.6 billion battery plant in Georgia if not overturned by President Joe Biden.
It said on Friday the finding could destroy thousands of high-tech green energy jobs, frustrate plans to protect the environment and ""endanger U.S. national security"" by making it more dependent on Chinese companies for batteries.
""Thankfully, it is entirely within the discretion of the Biden administration to undo it,"" SK said.
LG Chem noted the ITC ruling found SK misappropriated LG trade secrets ""worth billions of dollars spanning the entire electric vehicle battery business... The release of the ITC's decision puts to rest any questions of whether SK Innovation did anything wrong — they did, repeatedly, and now they must be held accountable.""
The ITC said SK Innovation was at least a decade behind LG Chem citing ""the very large volume of stolen trade secret documentation, and the expertise improperly acquired by (SK Innovation) from the former LG Chem employees it hired away.""
The ITC also found the ""investigation demonstrates not merely SK's eagerness to destroy documents, but also SK's callous disregard to ascertain the scope of the destruction after the commencement"" of ITC proceedings.
SK Innovation shares fell as much as 6.3% in morning trade, hitting their lowest since mid-January, while LG Chem shares rose 3.7% against a 0.8% decline in the broader KOSPI. 
VW has sought at least a four-year extension like Ford.
The ITC opinion said ""VW's preference for less expensive batteries using misappropriated LG trade secrets — in perpetuity, no less — is not a compelling public interest."" 

VW said Thursday the ""ruling will only limit competition, reduce U.S. battery capacity, hurt consumers and cost American jobs. Our team is working with the U.S. Trade Representative to avoid these consequences.""

GameStop shares closed up 6.4% at $131.93 after earlier hitting $147.87, their highest since a surge in the heavily shorted stock late last month.
One analyst and some Twitter users pointed to a cryptic tweet by Ryan Cohen, a major shareholder of GameStop and founder of e-commerce firm Chewy (NYSE:CHWY).com, as a plausible reason for the move, although Reuters could not independently determine causation.
The late afternoon rally in GameStop began roughly around the time that Cohen tweeted what appeared to be a screenshot with the puppet dog advertising mascot of Pets.com, a famous casualty of the dotcom bubble two decades ago. 
Cohen and GameStop had no comment on the tweet.
The tweet was ""as good an explanation as any"" for the sudden surge in GameStop shares, said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter in an emailed comment to Reuters. 
""The core 'story' is that he will change the company and reverse its fortunes, so anything he does to reinforce that change... is going to move the stock higher,"" he said.
""I don't know if this was the actual catalyst today, but in such an ugly market, it makes sense.""
Wall Street ended sharply lower on Thursday, leaving the Nasdaq down around 10% from its February record high.
A GameStop rally last month has also been linked to a Cohen tweet. A Feb. 24 surge in the company's shares began roughly around the time Cohen tweeted a picture of a McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) ice cream cone with a frog emoji. 
The tweet left some GameStop bulls wondering online whether it was a veiled message that Cohen would fix GameStop's business, like the fast-food chain modernized its ice cream machines.
GameStop has become one of the most visible of the so-called meme stocks that are closely followed on sites such as Reddit's popular WallStreetBets forum. 
The stock surged more than 1,600% in January after a wave of buying forced investors betting against the company's shares to unwind their positions, before paring most of those gains the following month. 

Cohen's RC Ventures activist firm reached a settlement with GameStop in January, giving Cohen seats on the company's board.

1462,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 08:40PM ET</span>","U.S. 10-year Treasuries borrowing rate in repo market goes negative, indicating stress","By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The cost of borrowing U.S. 10-year Treasuries in the overnight repurchase, or repo market, went deeply negative on Thursday, analysts said, as investors sought to short the notes, causing market stress.
Negative rates in the repo market, which is important to the financial system, with trillions of dollars in short-term loans traded daily, partly reflect uncertainty about how long the U.S. Federal Reserve will keep its easy monetary policy. 
""There is more market stress right now because the market is very volatile,"" said Scott Skyrm, executive vice president at broker-dealer Curvature Securities. 
The negative cost-to-borrow came as investors were shorting the notes in a bet that U.S. Treasury yields would continue to rise, on expectations of increased issuance to finance the U.S. stimulus package and on optimism on prospects of a recovery as the country emerges from the coronavirus pandemic.
That has boosted short positions on the benchmark U.S. Treasury note which last yielded 1.578%.
The 10-year cost to borrow repo rate, which is typically positive, has been negative since Monday and hit as low as -4.25% on Thursday, analysts said. It was last at -0.50% as the Federal stepped in on Thursday to sell U.S. 10-year Treasuries in the market. The last time U.S. 10-year repo rates went negative before this week was June 2020 and before that in March of the same year, Skyrm said.
The general collateral rate, however, remained above zero on Thursday at 0.05%, after dipping negative last week at -0.05 basis points.
The repo market sees Wall Street's financial institutions borrow from money market funds and other investors and pledge their Treasuries and other securities they own as collateral. Lenders in repo markets typically include money market funds, insurance companies, corporations, municipalities, central banks and commercial banks that have excess cash to invest. 
Negative repo rates typically occur when a particular collateral security becomes in demand - in this case analysts pointed to the 10-year Treasury - or there is a reduced supply in the repo market. 
In order to borrow these securities, buyers have to tempt potential sellers with cheap cash or a repo rate that is less than the general collateral repo rate. 
On the other hand, dealers and depository institutions borrow cash against long positions in securities to finance their net inventory and balance sheet position.
""There's general pressure on rates at the short end, the same themes that have been in place for a while,"" said Tom Simons, money market economist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).
""Supply is falling – we're having bill redemptions every couple of days here on the order of $25-$30 billion."" 
Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist at TD Securities, said dealer positions in off-the-run, or older securities, have grown sharply with the selloff in Treasuries that pushed yields higher. Dealers have attempted to hedge this risk by selling on-the-run or newer securities. 
""This has driven the cost of borrowing on-the-run Treasuries sharply lower and past the fail rate which is the penalty rate market participants pay if they cannot deliver a security,"" he added. 
That so-called fail rate is -3%, Goldberg said. 
Some investors also turned to the Fed to obtain collateral on Thursday, with its reverse repo operation seeing $2.1 billion in demand, up from half a billion on Wednesday. Demand in the facility increased last week as Treasury volatility increased, peaking at $11.2 billion on Friday.
Skyrm said the Fed loaned $8.7 billion of its $10.9 billion holdings of U.S. 10-year notes on Thursday, easing the debt squeeze. 

Analysts also said dealers are also preparing for next week's U.S. Treasury auction with the $38 billion sale of reopened U.S. 10-year notes, especially in the wake of last week's poor auction of 7-year notes.

Oportun Inc, which received an investigation demand from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on March 3, said legal collection practices and hardship treatments offered by the company during the COVID-19 pandemic are now under the scanner. 
The parent company said its practices were in full compliance with the CFPB guidance.
The CFPB did not immediately respond to Reuters request for a comment outside working hours.
According to the lending platform's website, any customer affected by the COVID-19 pandemic would be offered a host of services, including reduced payments and deferrals. Any skipped payments would not be reported as late, if arrangements are made in advance.
The consumer watchdog has ramped up its oversight under the new administration. David Uejio, the acting director of CFPB, said in January the watchdog would focus on ""overseeing the companies responsible for COVID relief"".

""Chinese telecommunications companies -- their behavior is a threat to American economic and national security. We're going to use (the entity list) to its full effect,"" she told MSNBC in an interview released Thursday.
U.S. suppliers to companies on the entity list must apply for special licenses before they ship goods overseas, but the applications are often denied.
Raimondo said firms like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, ZTE Corp (HK:0763) should be on the list. ""If you look at their behavior, they deserve to be targeted and if it's necessary then that's what we'll do,"" she said.

1465,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 07:15PM ET</span>","Listings boom, trading frenzy fuel record 2020 for investment banks","By Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - A surge in blank-cheque investment vehicle fundraising and frantic pandemic-related trading in 2020 boosted investment banks' income by a record 28% from the year before, a report showed on Friday.
Revenues for the 12 largest investment banks tracked in research firm Coalition Greenwich's index rose to $194 billion, the highest annual total for the industry since the survey began around a decade ago.
The trading bonanza showed how Wall Street and European banks benefited as the COVID-19 pandemic sparked global government and central bank action, upending asset prices and sending investors scrambling for safe havens.
Later in the year banks feasted on the craze for so-called blank-cheque or special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), which raise money to acquire another company without specifying which one to their investors in advance. 
Just one part of a listings boom which also included more traditional initial public offerings (IPOs), SPACs raised a record $82 billion last year and the trend has been gathering steam in 2021, boosting fee income for banks organising the deals. 
Fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) income rose 41% year-on-year, the Coalition report said, with commodities revenues hitting record levels as investors sought safe havens in precious metals and as oil prices surged later in the year.
Central Bank intervention to stimulate flatlining pandemic-hit economies also drove strong trading in credit products, except for more complex structured debt which risk-averse investors largely shunned.
In equities, derivatives volumes hit their highest level in a decade, Coalition said, but again more complex structured products underperformed as companies axing dividends in the first half of the year hit derivatives tied to such payouts.
JOB CUTS
Despite the bumper year, frontline revenue-producing bankers faced job losses, Coalition said, with positions down 1% from a year earlier to 48,700 as banks cut structured equity derivatives jobs in particular on waning demand.
That meant revenue per employee rose across all business lines, with the trend most evident in FICC where the measure rose to some $6 million, up 44% from 2019.
Banks kept bonus increases modest even as income soared, mindful of being seen to splurge too much amid an economic crisis and looking ahead to likely tougher times this year.

Coalition's index tracks Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) ,  Barclays  (LON:BARC), BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), HSBC, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) and UBS.

The San Francisco-based company's shares rose 4.4% to $25.42 in extended trading after fourth-quarter earnings beat expectations. 
With consumers working and attending classes online during the pandemic, Old Navy's affordable clothing and Athleta's joggers, tees and shirts have become stay-at-home favorites.
Athleta's sales surged 29% to more than a billion dollars in the fourth quarter and that is expected to reach $2 billion by 2023, Chief Executive Officer Sonia Syngal told analysts in a post-earnings conference call. 
""We have never been more confident in Athleta's path forward,"" Syngal added. 
Gap now plans to open 30 to 40 Old Navy stores and 20 to 30 Athleta stores in fiscal 2021, and close about 100 Gap and Banana Republic stores.
The company had started shutting stores of its namesake brand and Banana Republic even before the pandemic as their businesses were struggling due to stiff competition. 
Last month, Gap made a $140 million bet to beef up its network of distribution centers as customers shift to online shopping. 
Online sales surged 49% in the quarter.
Fiscal year 2021 net sales is expected to reflect mid- to high-teens growth, and Gap forecast earnings to be in the range of $1.20 per share to $1.35 per share.

On a per share basis, Gap earned 28 cents per share in the fourth quarter, 10 cents more than expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

(Reuters) - The Texas electricity market faces ""insurmountable distress"" as more gas and service bills come due, power industry officials said on Thursday at a hearing into financial fallout from the state's February blackout. 
High prices for emergency fuel and power saddled the companies that sell, transmit and generate electricity in the state with about $47 billion in storm-related costs. Those costs have led to one bankruptcy and put two retail providers out of business in the state.
Consumers facing bills for broken water pipes and food losses will see higher prices as costs get passed down through rate increases or fewer choices in providers, officials said. Future spending on weather defenses and grid linkages could add billions of dollars to the recovery. San Antonio's city-owned utility expects about $1 billion in extra costs. 
""The market is facing a financial crisis and it's a very severe financial crisis,"" Catherine Webking, executive director of an industry lobby group told state lawmakers at a hearing in Austin on Thursday. ""You’ll see more and more financial distress that is insurmountable,"" as bills for natural gas and financial collateral come due in coming weeks, she testified. 
Vistra Corp., one of the largest utilities in Texas, forecast that buying natural gas at high prices triggered by the storm and selling power at fixed-rate prices will cut its profit by between $900 million and $1.3 billion, Vistra senior vice president Bill Quinn testified. 
GAS SHORTAGES 
Vistra's power plants ran between 20% and 30% below capacity because of a lack of natural gas, Quinn said. ""Getting gas to them was a challenge,"" he said, noting all four of the utility's gas providers could not meet their fuel commitments.
On Wednesday, grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) disclosed 12 energy companies and two municipal utilities were overdue on $2.21 billion for power and services during February. 
Part of the deficit was covered by tapping internal grid accounts, but the rest eventually will be passed along to all grid users, straining those that have covered their initial bills, an official said.
ERCOT has little means to cover the charges, said Kenan Ogelman, the grid's vice president for commercial operations. It collects money from suppliers and pays generators, typically in four days. Texas may have to consider providing a financial backstop during future emergencies, he said in response to a question. 
""This event has demonstrated some consideration for a grid instrument,"" Ogelman said. Multi-billion dollar service charges have led to collateral calls on top of the fuel bills. The short period to pay both has led to ""cascading concerns,"" he said.
The decision to hold power rates high to keep power plants running even after the emergency passed was management judgment, he said. ""In hindsight, it would look like that wasn't needed. In real-time it looked like it was needed,"" Ogelman said. 
ERCOT normally uses a bid system to set prices but officials decided to set a $9,000 per megawatt hour charge that was about 450 times the price before the storm. It held at that $9,000 level for about 90 hours, leading to 10s of billions of dollars in charges over five days. 

The state Public Utility Commission (PUC) on Friday is expected to vote on a proposal to claw back some charges for standby power and other services that were not provided. It could save grid users about $1.5 billion, Carrie Bivens, the state's independent market adviser told the PUC in a letter on Thursday. She previously estimated the storm would push up state-wide power costs by $47 billion.

Millions of dollars in pandemic-related charges have further hurt profit margins of retailers, who have already been investing heavily in their supply chains to cut delivery time as online demand surges due to the health crisis.
Costco offered a premium pay to workers at the onset of the pandemic outbreak and from March raised the minimum wage for its hourly staff to $16, a dollar over what its competitors Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) pay per hour.
The warehouse retail chain, which brings in only a fraction of sales from its online channels and relies largely on the treasure hunt shopping experience, has been focusing on growing its online sales over the past year. Overall online sales jumped 75.8% in the second quarter from a year earlier. 
Net income attributable to the company rose to $951 million, or $2.14 per share, in the second quarter ended Feb. 14, from $931 million, or $2.10 per share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting a profit of $2.45 per share.
Total revenue rose to $44.77 billion from $39.07, beating analysts' average estimate of $43.78 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Shares of Issaquah, Washington-based Costco, which shed about 14% this year, slipped 1.6% in extended trading.

1474,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 04:31PM ET</span>","Feb. Jobs, Tech Tantrum, Biden Relief: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Thursday’s market action demonstrated the well-known habit of stocks reacting to even the mildest comments from Federal Reserve policy makers.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank would keep buying bonds at its current pace despite the “notable” rise in U.S. interest rates, shrugging off the notion that inflation would spiral out of control.
He has said this before, but investors are becoming increasingly worried about rising rates, so repeating the same mantra only added to investor jitters.
Nasdaq has now given up its gains for the year as growth stocks fall out of favor.
Here are three things that could affect trading tomorrow:
1. Jobs number
The government’s tally of new non-farm jobs added for February is expected to be released at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT) on Friday. Analysts are expecting a reading of 182,000, up from the 49,000 reported for January.
Job numbers are an important barometer of the recovering economy. The number of people who applied for jobless benefits last week remained at an elevated level but were slightly below expectations.
2. Tech stocks
As tech stocks sank on Thursday, Reuters calculated that the NASDAQ Composite had wiped out all of its gains this year, falling about 10% from its record high on Feb. 12. That would put the tech-heavy index in a correction. 
With interest rates rising, it seems investors were thinking twice about owning richly valued names like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), which is now 30% lower than its record high earlier this year. But in previous sell-offs, we’ve seen investors swoop in to buy the dip. Friday will show us whether that pattern holds true this time or whether a true rotation from growth to value stocks is taking place. 
3. Biden stimulus
The Senate voted to consider President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus, but it’s not going to be an easy slam dunk. Reuters reported the vote along party lines, 51 to 50, with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie.
A final vote could come over the weekend, though Republicans could try to stall the movement of the bill with procedural matters. Democrats said they would send more aid to smaller U.S. states to make sure they won unanimous party support.

1476,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 04:25PM ET</span>",Nasdaq ends sharply lower after Powell comments,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply lower on Thursday, leaving the Nasdaq down nearly 10% from its February record high, after remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell disappointed investors worried about rising longer-term U.S. bond yields.
A decline of 10% from its February record high would confirm the Nasdaq is in a correction. 
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield spiked to 1.533% after Powell's comments, which did not point to changes in the Fed's asset purchases to tackle the recent jump in yields. It still held below last week's one-year high of 1.614%.
Some investors had expected the Fed might step up purchases of long-term bonds, helping push down long-term interest rates.
""The market has been worried about the rise in long-term interest rates and the Fed chairman in his commentary didn't really push back towards this increase in rates and the market took it as a signal that yields could rise further, which is what has happened,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in Florida.

In a day of heavy trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq wiped out all of its year-to-date gains and ended down 9.7% from its record closing high on Feb. 12. The S&P 500 has declined over 4% from its record high close on Feb. 12.
Data showed the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits rose last week, likely boosted by brutal winter storms in the densely populated South, though the labor market outlook is improving amid declining new COVID-19 cases.
The crucial monthly payrolls report is expected on Friday.
Wall Street has been under pressure in recent sessions as a spike in U.S. bond yields hurt valuations of high-flying tech stocks. Stocks expected to thrive as the economy reopens outperformed in recent weeks due to expectations of a new round of fiscal aid and vaccinations.
The S&P 500 energy sector index jumped 2.5% and reached a one-year high on the back of higher oil prices. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.11% to end at 30,924.14 points, while the S&P 500 lost 1.34% to 3,768.47. 
The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.11% to 12,723.47.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 18 billion shares, compared with the 15 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) were among the largest drags on the S&P 500. Tesla dropped almost 5%.
Tech stocks are particularly sensitive to rising yields because their value rests heavily on future earnings, which are discounted more deeply when bond returns go up.
""Valuations are at the high end of historic ranges, so you are seeing selling, especially in the higher valuation areas like the Nasdaq and tech general,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.79-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 5.62-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. travel demand remains low even as tens of millions of Americans get vaccinated for COVID-19, with just 12% planning a spring break trip this year, the industry said on Thursday.
The industry has been devastated over the past year by the collapse in travel demand because of the pandemic. The U.S. Travel Association said polling that it commissioned suggested Americans remained wary about travel and that it was ""far from clear when demand for travel will rebound on its own.""
The industry again urged new tax credits to encourage leisure and business travel.
""We really can't recover until we get this pandemic under control,"" said U.S. Travel Association Chief Executive Roger Dow, who added that corporate travel departments were still advising employees not to travel.
The travel industry has also been hit by restrictions that have barred millions of international travelers from coming to the United States for non-essential trips from Europe, Canada, Mexico and Brazil.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still discouraging Americans from any non-essential travel. The group urges the U.S. government to set a target date for seeking to resume international travel, which remains down nearly 80%.
In early 2020, the U.S. travel industry employed 16.9 million people, which fell to 8.7 million in April 2020. It rebounded to 13 million jobs as of January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Hotels, airlines, restaurants, convention centers and other travel destinations are still hurting and major events remain virtual. Many travel destinations remain closed like Disneyland, while others like professional sporting events have limited fans.
The industry said the number planning to travel for spring break fell from 16% in a poll a week earlier.

The group believes travel demand will see a significant rebound by Memorial Day on May 31. President Joe Biden said this week the United States would have enough COVID-19 vaccine for every American adult by the end of May.

Investing.com - The Nasdaq tumbled for a second-day in a row Thursday, erasing its gains for the year as U.S. rates resumed their sharp acceleration after Federal Reserve Powell offered no clues on ramping-up bond purchases and shrugged off investor fears about rising inflation.      
The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3%, or 335 points, but had been down by more than 700 points intraday. The S&P 500 fell 1.28%. 
Powell said the central bank would continue the current pace of bond buying despite the sharp jump in U.S. rates as inflation is unlikely to spiral out of control.  The U.S. United States 10-Year Treasury jumped above 1.5%, while the United States 30-Year rose to a more than one-year high. 
Beyond tech, energy bucked the trend, rising 1%, on a sharp jump in oil prices after OPEC and its allies agreed to keep production steady through April. Saudi Arabia, which was pushing against calls to increase global supply, said it would extend its one million barrels per day voluntary production cut into April to allow Russia and Kazakhstan to increase production.
The rally in oil prices has been touted as harbinger of further doom in equities amid growing inflation fears.  ""Further strength in crude oil prices ( > $65-66) could spark escalated de-risking in equities- against a combination of inflation fears and rising geopolitical tensions overseas,"" Janney Montgomery Scott said in a note.

By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - ARK Invest founder and chief investment officer Cathie Wood reiterated her bullish position on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and bitcoin on Wednesday while warning that the growth of digital wallets will ""gut"" traditional banks. 
Wood, whose $24.4 billion ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund is the largest actively managed ETF tracked by Lipper, said in an interview on Benzinga's YouTube channel that her fund remains ""opportunistic"" despite the recent slide in the S&P 500 as investors have raised concerns over valuation and the prospect of higher inflation. 
""The benchmarks are filling up with value traps"" due to the pace of innovation in fields including artificial intelligence and robotics, Wood said. ""We think the big risk is in the benchmarks, not what we're doing.” 
The S&P 500 stock index fell 1.3% Wednesday. On Feb. 25, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 3.5%, its biggest daily decline in four months. Both indexes churned in January but remain up year to date.
Wood, who founded the firm in 2014, has become one of the faces of the U.S. stock market rally during the coronavirus pandemic. The ARK Innovation fund is up 136% over the last 12 months. The fund fell 6.1% on Wednesday and is up less than 1% for the year to date. 
Tesla Inc, which accounts for roughly 10% of the Ark Innovation fund's portfolio, remains attractive given its lead in autonomous driving, she said. Shares of the company are up nearly 345% over the last 12 months despite dropping nearly 20% over the last four weeks. 
""Our conviction on its autonomous strategy has increased,"" she said. 
At the same time, companies that rallied during the pandemic such as  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc and television streaming platform  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc remain attractive given their expected growth rates over the next five years, she said. 
Shares of Zoom are ""probably undervalued"", while Roku and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ""will take the lion’s share of the connected TV market,"" Wood said. 
Along with technology stocks, Wood said she expects the price of bitcoin will keep rising as more U.S. companies diversify cash holdings and add the cryptocurrency to their balance sheets. Tesla Inc, for instance, said on Feb. 8 it had purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin, while Square said on Feb. 23 it added another $170 million to its bitcoin position in the fourth quarter. 
Should other U.S. companies follow suit, the price of bitcoin could increase by between $40,000 and $400,000, Wood said. 

The cryptocurrency rose 7.5% to $51,030 in Wednesday afternoon trading.

U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman in Manhattan said the June 2019 lawsuit over alleged spoofing in gold, silver, platinum and palladium futures from 2007 to 2014 was filed long after the two-year federal statute of limitations had run out.
The investors said the clock started in January 2018 when the traders Edward Bases and John Pacilio, both from Connecticut and also defendants, were charged with commodities fraud. Six other people were criminally charged at the time.
But in a 32-page decision, the judge said the clock had begun ticking by December 2016, when a lawsuit alleging manipulation of silver futures contracts in the same period was filed by the same lawyers in the same Manhattan courthouse.
""They knew of the harm as early as 2016,"" Liman wrote. ""They just did not know the identity of everyone who perpetrated it. The wrong itself was not concealed.""
Lawyers for the investors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Bases, who worked at Bank of America, and Pacilio, who worked at Bank of America and Morgan Stanley, face a July 12 trial in Chicago federal court. Both have pleaded not guilty.
In June 2019, Bank of America paid $25 million an entered a nonprosecution agreement to end a Department of Justice spoofing probe, and $11.5 million to end a related U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission civil case. Morgan Stanley reached a $1.5 million civil settlement with the CFTC three months later.

The SEC has deployed a 22-person team that will focus on disclosures from public companies related to issues such as climate change, investment-advisor activities and funds dedicated to ESG investments, the agency said on Thursday.
This is the latest in a series of SEC moves in recent weeks under President Joe Biden, who has made climate a key focus of his administration.

Rooting out disclosure-related fraud is considered ""bread and butter"" work for the SEC, but climate-related disclosures have not been a central focus. 
The SEC has brought cases against automakers Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V., now part of Stellantis NV, BMW AG and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) related to what they shared with investors about diesel emissions.

ESG funds have attracted a higher percentage of inflows than other equity funds since 2013, according to an August 2020  Barclays  (LON:BARC) report. But the SEC has largely steered away from specific directives to firms on ESG issues despite the growing investor interest, until recently.

1489,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 01:10PM ET</span>",Britain lifts more curbs on 'dark' trading to limit stocks Brexodus,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said on Thursday it was lifting more curbs on ""dark"" trading, throwing down the gauntlet to the European Union after billions of euros of trading left London for Amsterdam in the wake of Britain's departure from the bloc.
Dark trading refers to the use of platforms that allow institutional investors to trade shares without having to disclose a range of details on the transaction before it is executed.
The ""double volume cap"" or DVC, part of the EU's securities law MiFID II that Britain has put into UK law, limits dark trading in any given share to a certain portion of total trading in it.
""In December, we announced that we would not automatically apply the DVC to UK equities, and we are now extending this to all equities,"" the FCA said in a statement on Thursday.
Some 8 billion euros in daily share trading left London for the EU in January after the Brexit transition period ended on Dec. 31, piling pressure on Britain to fight back to keep the City of London globally attractive.
The FCA will hope that easing curbs on dark trading will lead to more share trading in London by big global investment firms who like the anonymity of dark pools for buying and selling big blocs of shares.
Last December the FCA lowered the minimum amount for a dark transaction to well below levels in the bloc, where exchanges are lobbying for dark trading to be curbed further.
Anish Puaar, market structure analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, said Brexit had given Britain a chance to create a more liberal market structure that is easier to navigate than the EU market.
""The UK might not have to do much to set itself apart. Even if it does nothing, it could become more attractive if the EU tightens curbs on off-exchange trading,"" Puaar said.

The announcement comes a day after a government-backed review recommended loosening listing rules to attract more company flotations to London.

1492,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 12:26PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Lithium giant Albemarle slams Chile over 'unjust' withholding of Atacama study,"By Dave Sherwood 
SANTIAGO (Reuters) -  Albemarle  (NYSE:ALB) Corp, the world's top lithium producer, has accused a Chilean regulator of ""unjust"" discrimination for refusing to make public a key report on the impact of mining on the Atacama salt flat, according to court filings.
U.S.-based Albemarle in July last year asked to see the publicly funded report but regulator Corfo rejected the request after Chilean miner SQM, a top competitor, objected on grounds it contained confidential information. A government watchdog upheld the decision.
Both Albemarle and SQM - the only two lithium miners on the salt flat - contributed data to the report. But while SQM's contract with the government allows it to review and comment on the study, Albemarle's agreement does not.
Albemarle blasted that discrepancy in previously unreported arguments made before a Santiago appeals court in February, saying it resulted in ""arbitrary, unjust, illegal, and above all, unconstitutional discrimination."" The company is appealing the watchdog's decision and demanding the report be made public immediately.
The spat underscores rising tensions between Albemarle and regulators in the Andean nation over operations in the high-altitude Atacama flat, home to one-quarter of the world's current supply of lithium.
Albemarle has for months also feuded with Corfo over royalty payments, and with another Chilean regulator over data used to determine its production quota.
The Atacama report and the true state of the flat's environmental health has long been an obsession of lithium industry watchers because of the area's huge importance in satisfying soaring global demand for the white metal, a vital component in the batteries that power electric vehicles.
Corfo told Reuters in a written statement that it had sent a final draft of the environmental study - meant to guide government regulation and oversight of the flat - to SQM for review on Feb. 16. 
Corfo's contract with SQM requires it offer the company the opportunity to comment, but the agency is not required to implement the company's suggested changes.
The regulator said it would make the final draft public following SQM's review ""provided that any eventual affected third parties did not oppose its release.""
SQM did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the case. The Chilean miner has previously argued in filings that releasing the study would put it at a competitive disadvantage, and says it has adhered to the terms of its contract with Corfo.
Albemarle told Reuters in a statement that it wants the study made public immediately.
""This report... should be a contribution towards ensuring the sustainability of the Salar de Atacama,"" the company said.

Lawmakers, academics, environmentalists, local communities, German carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Chilean courts have all emphasized the importance of an environmental study to help dispel lingering questions on the impact of lithium mining in Chile.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Star stockpicker Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation fund appeared to be returning to earth on Thursday after more than doubling last year. 
The $23 billion fund slid 2.5%, leaving it down nearly 25% from its Feb. 12 high. Those losses are 8 times more than the roughly 3% decline in the benchmark S&P 500 over the same time. Despite that slide, the fund remains up 122% over the last 12 months. 
Wood shot to prominence over the last year with her outsized bets on companies such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Square that surged during the pandemic, attracting $14.84 billion in inflows over the past 12 months, according to Lipper data. Over the last month, however, technology stocks have faltered as investors have priced in concerns about higher inflation as the pace of vaccinations increase and hopes that the broad economy will put the coronavirus pandemic behind it. 
Ark Invest did not respond to a request for comment. 
Shares of Tesla Inc, which account for roughly 10% of the ARK fund, are down 26% over the last month, while shares of  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc are down 13%. Shares of Teldadoc Health Inc, another of the fund's top holdings, are down slightly more than 25% over the same time. 
The rapid decline in performance could lead to large outflows from the fund as investors start to chase other managers that appear to have a hotter hand, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. 
""Investors that arrived in 2021 after seeing triple-digit returns in 2020 are likely to be disappointed and be less likely to stick around as short-term losses pile up,"" he said. 

Investors pulled $465.3 million from the ARK Innovation fund on Feb 23, which was the fund's largest outflow on record, according to Morningstar.

1495,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 12:05PM ET</span>",French watchdog has called for EU probe into funds delegation,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - France's markets watchdog said on Thursday it has asked the European Union's executive body to examine whether investment funds are circumventing limits on delegating stock picking to asset managers outside the bloc.
Asset managers in London manage assets worth over 2 trillion pounds ($2.8 trillion) in funds listed in the bloc, and delegation arrangements have allowed this to continue after Brexit.
""There are certain types of delegation arrangements where so much activities are delegated outside of the firms that you might question what is inside the firm,"" Natasha Cazenave, managing director at French markets watchdog AMF, told a Politico event.
""We are calling on the European Commission to look into that. You are not supposed to delegate more than what you actually oversee yourself,"" she said, without mentioning any country or firm.
EU securities watchdog ESMA last year called on the European Commission to hardwire into EU law its guidance for avoiding ""empty shell"" investment firms being set up by UK firms in the bloc ahead of Brexit.
Brexit and the market events of last March have intensified scrutiny of the EU's 18.8 trillion euro funds sector just as the bloc's fund rules are up for review.
Global regulators are due to consult in the summer on potentially stricter rules for money market funds after central banks had to inject liquidity into markets to stop them freezing up when economies went into pandemic lockdowns last March.
""Industry must find a business model that is sustainable without the intervention of central banks,"" said Francesco Mazzaferro, head of the European Systemic Risk Board at the European Central Bank.
""We need to reinforce liquidity buffers, considering perhaps having some counter cyclical buffers,"" Cazenave said in reference to an extra buffer required of banks for drawing down during market stresses.
Eric Pan, CEO of global funds industry body ICI, said that many parts of the market suffered stress last March and that stricter rules for funds and crimping delegation would lead to higher costs for end investors.

1496,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 11:54AM ET</span>",SPAC Froth Turns on Itself With Stocks Plunging 20% in Two Weeks,"(Bloomberg) -- It may turn out that five new special purpose acquisition companies per day was too many.
SPAC mania is showing signs of hitting a stock-market saturation point, with an index tracking blank-check flyers suddenly down about 20% from its peak. The craze is being clipped as quickly as it whipped up, with sentiment souring on growth stocks amid a runup in interest rates and rotation into beaten-down names. Before the selloff, SPACs had almost doubled since October.
“When the price is moving up way faster than fundamentals can justify, that screams risk to us, and people who have those exposures are experiencing that risk today,” said Matt Stucky, portfolio manager at Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) Mutual Wealth Management Co. “It’s an awfully risky proposition to have a lot of capital invested in an exposure that is pretty volatile.”
The group’s meteoric growth has come to symbolize speculative behavior in equities. SPACs surged as famous executives, athletes, private-equity giants and venture-capital firms alike rushed to raise money for yet-to-be identified future investments, tapping appetite for early-stage companies. In the first two months of 2021, 175 SPACs sold initial public offerings, or roughly five deals per trading day, according to data compiled by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
In February alone, 90 SPACs raised $32 billion, a monthly record. Should the current pace of issuance persist, this year’s offerings will surpass the full-year total of 2020 before the end of this month, Goldman Sachs strategists led by David Kostin estimate.
“The blistering pace of issuance is likely unsustainable,” they wrote in a note this week.
The pace of money raising from SPACs has far exceeded the heydays of traditional IPOs during the dot-com era. In terms of dollars, SPAC issuance has been running at a clip of $28 billion a month, Goldman data show. In 1999 and 2000, companies raked in an average $5.4 billion a month through initial offerings, according to data compiled by Jay Ritter, professor of finance at the University of Florida’s Warrington College of Business.
Riskier areas of the market have sold off in recent days amid a bout of Treasury market volatility. The IPOX SPAC Index, which tracks the performance of a broad group of special purpose acquisition companies, has fallen toward a bear market, down about 20% since a mid-February peak. It’s on track for its second-worst week ever relative to the S&P 500.
Meanwhile, the Defiance Next Gen SPAC Derived ETF (ticker SPAK), is also down about 20% from its February top, with the fund on pace for its worst week of outflows on record.
While it isn’t crazy that SPACs became popular given their structure and relatively loose listing requirements, according to Marketfield Asset Management’s Michael Shaoul and Timothy Brackett, any frenzy of this magnitude tends to result in “a long and expensive period of regret.”
Outsize returns for buyers look “much less likely (on average) today than it did six months ago, given the bloat of size and number of deals and the ramp-up of negotiated valuations,” they wrote in a note. “Of course this is not a coincidence, since it is the massive expansion of market cap caused by SPAC issuance that is helping undermine its prior success.”

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets bounced in early trade on Thursday after a fresh wave of volatility in bond markets eased off, ahead of a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. However, they soon lost momentum and were trading mixed within half an hour of the opening.
Powell is due to speak at 12:05 PM ET (1705 GMT), in what will be his last public appearance before the Fed’s next policy-setting meeting. His comments will be parsed for any sign of unease at what has been happening in bond markets lately – having signally failed to show any concern last week in his testimony in front of Congress.
By 9:40 AM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 155 points, or 0.5% at 31,425 points, while the S&P 500 was up 0.4%, along with the Nasdaq Composite. 
Although bonds were stable, money started to flow out of technology stocks again as the morning progressed, with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock falling 2.0% to its lowest since late December, NVIDIA  (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock falling 1,6% and Square (NYSE:SQ) falling 5.2%, the market being unimpressed by its decision to buy Tidal, the streaming company founded by rap star Jay-Z.
Earlier, there were grounds for cautious optimism on the labor market, as the Challenger Job Cuts survey showed a drop in February to its lowest level in a year.
The Labor Department’s data on unemployment also showed a 1 million drop in the total number of people claiming jobless benefits through February 13, although a rise in initial jobless claims for the subsequent week provided a note of caution.
Losses were heaviest where valuations had been most stretched after a runaway rally in 2020 on the back after the pandemic drove the Fed to cut interest rates to zero, as well as accelerating many of the long-term structural changes in the economy that are central to tech stocks’ investment cases.
Hydrogen fuel cell company  Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG) fell 11.2% and is now down 38% over the last month, while the ADRs of Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) fell another 5.7%, taking their losses to 31% for the month. By contrast, General Motors stock (NYSE:GM) inched down 0.6% after reports that it is to build a second battery factory in the U.S., while Volkswagen (OTC:VWAPY) ADRs rose another 2.3% in the wake of a UBS report that drastically revised upward its estimates of VW’s ability to compete in electric cars.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, were lifted along with crude prices after Saudi Arabia's oil minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman indicated in his opening remarks to OPEC's monthly meeting on output quotas that he was against a major increase in output in April, preferring that the bloc ""keep its powder dry"".

1500,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 08:50AM ET</span>",Delta to spend $30 million to neutralize most of its 2020 climate impact,"(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) said on Thursday it would spend more than $30 million to offset 13 million metric tons of carbon emissions over 10 months last year as part of its pledge to help combat climate change.
Delta said it had also cut emissions by retiring more than 200 older aircraft early in 2020 as it dealt with a plunge in demand from the coronavirus pandemic. Replacement planes will be 25% more fuel efficient, the U.S. airline said.
Delta in February 2020 announced plans to invest $1 billion over the next decade in initiatives like offsets, sustainable aviation fuel and carbon sequestration that would limit the impact of global air travel on the environment, the first airline to make a commitment of that scale.
That followed moves in Europe by easyJet (LON:EZJ) to offset emissions on all flights and British Airways and Air France on domestic flights. 
The amount Delta plans to pay for offsets from March 1 to Dec. 31 would equate to less than 0.35% of its revenue during the period, based on Reuters calculations using its financial results from April 1 to Dec. 31.
Delta said the carbon tonnage offset was equal to the carbon sequestered by 17 million acres of U.S. forests in one year, enough to cover the state of West Virginia. 
U.S. airlines are under pressure by the Biden administration to do more to reduce emissions.
The CEOs of major carriers met with White House officials last Friday to discuss tackling aviation pollution and urge U.S. support for greener aviation fuel. 
United Airlines has committed to a multimillion-dollar investment in carbon capture, a technology designed to suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as part of a plan to be 100% green by 2050.
Delta said it also believed carbon capture had significant potential.

1502,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 07:21AM ET</span>",Honda's part self-driving Legend a big step for autonomous tech,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd on Thursday unveiled a partially self-driving Legend sedan in Japan, becoming the world's first carmaker to sell a vehicle equipped with new, certified level 3 automation technology. 
The launch gives Japan's No.2 automaker bragging rights for being the first to market, but lease sales of the level 3 flagship Legend would be limited to a batch of 100 in Japan, at a retail price of 11 million yen ($102,000). 
Still, the new automation technology is a big step towards eliminating human error-induced accidents, chief engineer Yoichi Sugimoto told reporters.
The Legend's ""Traffic Jam Pilot"" system can control acceleration, braking and steering under certain conditions.
Once the system is activated, a driver can also watch movies or use the navigation on the screen, helping to mitigate fatigue and stress when driving in a traffic jam, Honda said in a statement.
It can alert the driver to respond when handing over the control, such as vibration on the driver's seatbelt, the carmaker said. And if the driver continues to be unresponsive, the system will assist with an emergency stop by decelerating and stopping the vehicle while alerting surrounding cars with hazard lights and the horn, it added.
The announcement comes after the Japanese government awarded a safety certification to Honda's ""Traffic Jam Pilot"" in November.
Global automakers and tech companies, including Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, have been investing heavily in autonomous driving.
Yet even as the technology advances, regulations on autonomous driving differ from country to country. Audi unveiled an A8 sedan with level 3 technology in 2017 but regulatory hurdles have prevented it from being widely introduced.
Honda has no plans to increase production or sales of a level 3-equipped Legend for now, its operating officer said on Thursday.

A spokesman for Airbus, which has been hit hard by slumping demand for aircraft in the coronavirus crisis, said other measures - such as voluntary redundancy programmes, early retirement or internal transfers - had been agreed instead.
Negotiations started later in Spain, the spokesman said.
Airbus has been struggling to reach targets to cut staff as part of a restructuring plan affecting up to 15,000 jobs, especially at its headquarters in France and in German plants, sources had earlier told Reuters.
The IG Metall union and works council representing Airbus workers in Germany said they had agreed with the aircraft manufacturer on an overall package to safeguard employment and sites in the country until the end of 2023.
About 1,300 employees at Airbus Germany and 1,000 at Premium Aerotec, a subsidiary that makes large plane components, took voluntary redundancy between November and February, Holger Junge, head of the group works council, told a news conference.
""Production figures have stabilised,"" Junge said. ""But we have not overcome the crisis.""
Airbus agreed to avoid further job cuts through short-time work and reducing hours by up to 20% from 2022, he said. Airbus employs about 55,000 people in Germany.

In January, Airbus stuck to ambitions for a partial recovery in jet production later this year, although there is speculation that it may have to delay that due to extended coronavirus lockdowns in Europe.

1505,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 07:05AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Edge Lower; Powell Speech in Focus,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen weakening at the open Thursday, continuing the previous session’s sell-off ahead of a key speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 60 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 12 points, or 0.3%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 50 points, or 0.4%.
Wall Street closed in the red on Wednesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropping 2.7%, the S&P 500 lost 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed, losing just 0.4%.
The prime driver for this weakness was a surge in bond yields, as the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to 1.49%, before stabilizing around 1.47%. This is not quite at the one-year high of 1.61% set last week, but still increases worries over potentially stretched equity valuations as these have been supported by expectations of a prolonged period of low interest rates.
With this in mind, Powell’s speech at a conference, at 12:05 PM ET (1705 GMT), will be studied carefully to see if he continues to downplay the rise in yields.
“This will be the last chance to hear from the Fed before it enters the two-week blackout period this weekend ahead of the March 17th FOMC meeting. The tone of this Q&A could well set the risk tone for the next two weeks,” analysts at ING said, in a research note.
Adding to the uncertainty has been data pointing to a slow and uneven economic recovery, particularly in the labor market. Wednesday saw the release of an unexpectedly weak private payrolls report, bringing the weekly jobless claims figure into focus later Thursday, ahead of Friday’s closely watched official employment report.
On the earnings front, BJs Wholesale (NYSE:BJ) and Kroger (NYSE:KR) are among the names reporting before the open, while Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Gap (NYSE:GPS) are due after the closing bell.
Oil prices were largely unchanged Thursday, with traders waiting for news from a meeting of top producers over output levels going forward, particularly given Saudi Arabia’s surprise announcement in January of a unilateral cut of an additional one million barrels per day.
The pre-meeting of OPEC’s market monitoring committee ended without a formal recommendation to the ministers who will start thrashing out a deal at 8 AM ET (1300 GMT).
This important meeting has meant market participants looked through Wednesday’s surge in U.S. crude stockpiles, seen as a result of the recent spell of wintry weather in the southern states.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $61.38 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.1% to $64.12. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,714.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.2035.

1506,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 06:06AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Lufthansa's Warning Puts Spotlight on EU Vaccine Failure,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Germany’s biggest airline gave some food for thought to those playing the reopening trade on Thursday, revising down its own outlook and stressing that the fate of the sector this year rests in the hands of European politicians who are, so far, failing to get vaccines into people’s arms.
Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) said expects a second straight operating loss in 2021, albeit a much smaller one than last year’s 5.5 billion euros. For the first quarter, CEO Carsten Spohr said he expects a drain of 300 million euros.
As so often in the past, the airline will have more planes than it needs this year: it will fly only 40% -50% of its pre-pandemic capacity this year, compared to an earlier estimate of up to 60%. Lufthansa reckons it needs to be flying over 50% of capacity to generate positive operating cash flow.
“Our business has recovered more slowly than we had initially hoped,” Spohr said.
The airline was also downbeat on the longer-term outlook it doesn’t expect traffic to return to pre-Covid levels until at least the middle of the decade. It had earlier expected business to be back to 2019 levels by 2024. As a result, it’s looking at retiring more of its older planes.
All this was published along with a record net loss of 6.7 billion euros ($8.0 billion) that the market had already priced in. Lufthansa stock fell 1.4%, making it the worst performer of the major European airlines on the day.
Strikingly, right at the top of Lufthansa’s news release was an appeal to the European Union to set up “internationally recognized, digital vaccination and test certificates “ to allow people to travel with confidence again, free from the fear of catching Covid-19 in an enclosed plane cabin.
Such schemes “must replace travel bans and quarantine” Spohr said. The interesting part about that is that Lufthansa’s largest shareholder, the German government, is arguably the biggest obstacle to such a scheme, having pushed back heavily at last week’s EU summit against appeals from countries such as Greece and Spain whose economies depend more on tourism.
The European Commission said on Monday it will soon start drafting a law establishing an EU-wide “Digital Green Pass”, but it is unlikely to satisfy Madrid or Athens unless the scheme is also expanded to include the U.K.
Euronews reported on Tuesday that the plan is likely to require at least three months of technical work and will have to satisfy concerns ranging from data privacy and discrimination to forgery. That timetable leaves very little time for slippage if the scheme is to be of any use to holidaymakers and those seeking seasonal work abroad.
So – does this mean that the enthusiasm for European airline stocks is misplaced? The Stoxx Total Market Airlines index is up over 60% since the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine breakthrough, and the likes of International Airlines Group (LON:ICAG) and Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ) both rose again on Thursday, invalidating any read-across for the broader sector. More importantly, data compiled by Investing.com suggests that the stocks are still protected by low absolute and relative valuations: European airlines trade at an average of 0.22 times sales. The comparable ratio for U.S. airlines is 1.
Even so, Lufthansa’s warning should be a reminder that the travel sector can’t recover until the virus is beaten, and that beating the virus depends on the EU drastically improving its record on vaccinations. The continent’s three most-vaccinated countries – the U.K., Norway and Serbia – are very different in profile and have little in common except their non-membership of the EU.   "
1507,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 06:01AM ET</span>","Bond scares linger, investors look to Powell","By Tom Arnold and Hideyuki Sano
LONDON (Reuters) - Worries about lofty U.S. bond yields hit global shares on Thursday as investors waited to see if Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell would address concerns about a rapid rise in long-term borrowing costs.
The spectre of higher U.S. bond yields also undermined low-yielding, safe-haven assets, such as the yen, the Swiss franc and gold.
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries slipped to 1.453%. They earlier touched their highest levels since a one-year high of 1.614% set last week on bets on a strong economic recovery aided by government stimulus and progress in vaccination programmes.
""Equities and yields continue to both drive and thwart one another,"" said James Athey, investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
""Fed speech continues to express very little concern and certainly is not suggestive of any imminent action to curb the rise in yields. The Powell speech today is hotly anticipated, but I fear more out of hope than rational expectation.""
The Euro STOXX 600 was down 0.5% and London's FTSE 0.6% lower. 
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, lost 0.5%, its third day running of losses.
The MSCI's ex-Japan Asian-Pacific shares lost 1.8%, while Japan's Nikkei fell 2.1% to its lowest since Feb. 5.
E-mini S&P futures slipped 0.2%. Futures for the Nasdaq, the leader of the post-pandemic rally, fell 0.1%, earlier hitting a two-month low.
Tech shares are vulnerable because their lofty valuation has been supported by expectations of a prolonged period of low interest rates.
But the market is focused on Powell, who is due to speak at a Wall Street Journal conference at 12:05 p.m. EST (1705 GMT), in what will be his last outing before the Fed's policy-making committee convenes March 16-17.
Many Fed officials have downplayed the rise in Treasury yields in recent days, although Fed Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday acknowledged that concerns over the possibility a rapid rise in yields could dampen economic activity.
In addition, anxiety is building over a pending regulatory change in a rule called the supplementary leverage ratio, or SLR, which could make it more costly for banks to hold bonds.
""The market is likely to be unstable until this regulation issue will be sorted out,"" said Masahiko Loo, portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB). ""There aren't people who want to catch a falling knife when market volatility is so high.""
The market will also have to grapple with a huge increase in debt sales after rounds of stimulus to deal with a recession triggered by the pandemic.
The issue is not limited to the United States, with the 10-year UK Gilts yield on Wednesday touching 0.796%, near last week's 11-month high of 0.836%, after the government unveiled much higher borrowing.
On Thursday, Germany's 10-year yield was down 2 basis points to -0.31% after rising 5 basis points on Wednesday, still moving in tandem with U.S. Treasuries.
Currency investors continued to snap up dollars as they bet on the U.S. economy outperforming its peers in the developed world in coming months. The dollar rose to a roughly seven-month high of 107.33 yen.
""U.S. dollar/yen has been on a one-way trajectory since the start of 2021,"" said Joseph Capurso, head of international economics at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY). ""The brightening outlook for the world economy is a positive for both U.S. dollar/yen and Australian dollar/yen.""
Other safe-haven currencies were weakened, with the Swiss franc dropping to a five-month low against the dollar and a 20-month trough versus the euro.
Other major currencies were little changed, with the euro flat at $1.2054.
Gold fell to a near nine-month low of $1,702.8 per ounce on Wednesday and last stood at $1,714.
Investor focus on a U.S. economic rebound was unshaken by data released overnight that showed the U.S. labour market struggling in February, when private payrolls rose less than expected.
Oil prices rose for a second straight session on Thursday, as the possibility that OPEC+ producers might decide against increasing output at a key meeting later in the day underpinned a drop in U.S. fuel inventories. 

U.S. crude rose 0.6% to $61.65 per barrel. Brent crude futures added 0.7% to $64.54 a barrel,

1508,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 06:00AM ET</span>",Analysis: Greensill's funding problems could cause broad ripples,"By Tom Bergin
LONDON (Reuters) - A funding crisis at Greensill Capital could spill over to some of its high-risk borrowers and lead to losses for insurers and banks that have done business with the UK-based supply chain finance firm if its clients default, according to several industry experts and a review of public filings.
Greensill, backed by Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group Corp's Vision Fund, helps companies spread out the time they have to pay their bills. The loans, which typically have maturities of up to 90 days, are securitized and sold to investors, allowing Greensill to make new loans. 
Earlier this week, Greensill's primary source of funding came to an abrupt halt. Swiss bank  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG and asset manager GAM Holdings AG suspended redemptions from funds that held most of their around $10 billion in assets in Greensill notes over concerns about being able to accurately value them.
Greensill is preparing to file for bankruptcy and is also in talks to sell large parts of its business to private equity firm Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc, a source close to Greensill said on Wednesday. But Apollo is not planning to bail out Greensill's borrowers and does not even want to provide loan arrangement services to Greensill's riskier clients, two sources close to the talks said, because of the financial and reputational risks. 
While Greensill did not name Apollo, it confirmed on Tuesday it was in talks with ""a leading global financial institution"" to buy its business. Apollo, Softbank and Credit Suisse declined to comment. 
The uncertainty about what happens over the next few days could ripple through Greensill's clients and other financial institutions.
For the company's clients, an inability of Greensill to continue funding them may mean having to repay debts soon and finding alternative sources of financing in the near term, according to four experts in short term, inventory-backed - or 'supply chain' - financing of the type Greensill offers.
That could be especially problematic for its higher-risk clients, which may struggle to raise funds elsewhere or have to pay much more for the financing.
""If you have just a single source for this kind of capital, you may have to scramble around,"" said Craig Jeffrey, of consultancy Strategic Treasurer, near Atlanta, which advises clients on supply chain finance. 
Any inability of borrowers to pay could, in turn, lead to losses for credit insurers that have sold protection against defaults on Greensill securities bought by the Credit Suisse funds. And if those insurers don't pay up, investors could sue Credit Suisse to cover their losses, said Thorsten Beck, finance professor at the University of London. Analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a research note this week that even if the Swiss bank doesn't face direct financial losses, it would face reputational damage from the crisis.
In addition, a bank owned by Greensill in Germany, which keeps the company's short-term loans on its balance sheet before they are securitized and sold to Credit Suisse, could also be on the hook for losses if the sudden withdrawal of credit prompts any defaults on debts it was temporarily holding, according to ratings reports and published accounts.
On Wednesday, Germany's financial regulator Bafin filed a criminal complaint against Bremen-based Greensill Bank saying the lender could not provide evidence of receivables it said it had purchased from metals-to-finance group GFG Alliance. 
In a statement to Reuters, Greensill Capital spokesman James Doran said talks were ongoing with a suitor on a deal for parts of its business which could help preserve operations and jobs. ""While the structure of the new business is still being determined, we expect the transaction will ensure the majority of Greensill clients will continue to be funded in the same way as they currently are while also preserving a substantial number of jobs."" 
Greensill Bank always ""seeks external legal and audit advice before booking any new asset,"" Greensill Capital added. It declined to comment on the specific Bafin allegation. GFG did not respond to requests for comment about Greensill Bank.
SUPPLY CHAIN MODEL
The supply chain lending model is usually seen as a relatively low-risk investment. But Greensill, formed in 2011 by former  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) banker Lex Greensill, has taken on some highly indebted customers, publicly available accounts for borrowers show. It has also lent money to fund fixed assets like buildings and factories, which are more typically funded via longer-term financing, the accounts show, whereas supply chain financing usually covers short-term debts like paying for inventory.
One of its largest customers is GFG, run by Indian-British metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta. GFG Alliance had to pay a 12% interest rate when it issued debt on public markets in 2019. 
But Greensill said his business typically provided credit to businesses for around 4%, and could do so because investors would accept low returns as he ensured debts were backed by assets which would be quickly realized. 
Reuters could not learn the specific rate that Greensill charged GFG and how much of the Credit Suisse and GAM funds' assets are accounted for by GFG loans. Previous accounts for the funds and the companies involved show hundreds of millions of dollars of outstanding credit at any one time.
GFG Alliance spokesman Andrew Mitchell said the group had alternative funders to Greensill.
""GFG Alliance has adequate current funds and its plans to bring in fresh capital through refinancing are progressing well,"" he said, adding the troubled companies GFG bought were being turned around and were generating positive cashflow.
GERMAN EXPOSURE
Any customer defaults could also impact Greensill Bank in Bremen, Germany, a review of ratings reports and published accounts shows. The bank's exposure to GFG is unclear but its most recent capital requirements disclosures show that in 2019, it took on over $1 billion in exposures in Macedonia, the Czech Republic and Romania, after GFG began doing business in these countries. 
Greensill Bank is largely funded by around 3 billion euros of deposits and depositors are protected by the bank's membership of the deposit protection fund of the Federal Association of German Banks.
Greensill Bank declined to answer questions about its finances and neither it or Credit Suisse disclose its exposure to individual companies. 
Any losses to the Credit Suisse funds could also flow to multiple parties. Credit insurers have sold the Credit Suisse funds and Greensill protection against defaults on Greensill securities bought by the funds. While Greensill Capital is responsible for first losses on the funds to the tune of $1 billion, accounts show, insurers cover much of the rest, Credit Suisse said in January. 
Credit Suisse declined to confirm whether the debts currently in the fund are covered by insurance and who covered them.
Credit Suisse, too, is a creditor to Greensill. The Zurich-based bank has $140 million in loans outstanding to the company, a source familiar with the matter said. 

Greensill declined to say if sale talks envisaged the potential buyer taking on its debts or those debts held by the Credit Suisse funds. Credit Suisse declined to comment on the debt.

The lawsuit filed by Exxon's natural gas business said the massive storm and state declarations of emergencies prevented it from fulfilling its supply commitment to Macquarie Energy, the second largest U.S. gas marketer.
Exxon is asking the Texas court to rule that the massive storm, caused when an arctic air mass swept the central United States, was a natural disaster.
Such a ruling would allow Exxon to break its contract with Macquarie without a penalty, overriding a demand from the Australian company that Exxon cover the wholesaler's $11.7 million in damages for missed deliveries. 
U.S. gas demand and prices soared last month when freezing temperatures hit as far south as Texas, where 4.3 million homes lost power.
A Macquarie spokesperson in Australia declined immediate comment. Exxon did not reply to a request for comment after normal business hours. 
The cold sent spot gas at a west Texas hub to $203.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) on Feb. 16. It also prompted Texas and Louisiana to declare emergencies and direct gas supplies to the states' power generators. 
Australia's Macquarie was one of the largest winners in the cold snap, benefiting from record U.S. natural gas prices. It could collect a $317 million profit from a weather related gas binge, analysts said.
Macquarie had rejected Exxon's own declaration of a natural disaster, the lawsuit said, but the Australian company later issued its own force majeure declaration over gas it had agreed to provide Exxon in Texas.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A large global recall of electric vehicles has led Hyundai Motor Co to sharply revise down fourth-quarter operating profit, although reports said battery maker LG Chem Ltd would bear the bulk of the costs.
LG will assume 70% of the estimated $900 million costs to replace battery systems in some 82,000 electric vehicles globally, according to Yonhap news agency and other South Korean media.
But Cho Hyun-ryul, an analyst at Samsung (KS:005930) Securities, said he estimated LG's burden was slightly lower at 62% of the costs.
Hyundai and LG Chem, whose wholly owned LG Energy Solution makes the batteries, declined to comment on how costs were divvied up.
The recall, which mostly concerns the Kona EV, Hyundai's biggest selling electric car, is one of the first mass battery pack replacements conducted by a major automaker. It has been closely watched as it has set a precedent in how car and battery makers split the bill when problems arise.
Hyundai said on Thursday it was revising down fourth-quarter operating profit by 300 billion won ($265 million) or nearly a fifth to 1.3 trillion won, while LG Chem slashed its operating profit by more than 80% to 119 billion won.
The latest recall for the Kona EV follows a recall late last year for a software upgrade after a spate of fires. One of the recalled Kona EVs caught fire in January, however, and South Korean authorities launched a probe into whether the first recall had been adequate.
The new recall applies to nearly 76,000 Kona EVs built between 2018 and 2020, including about 25,000 sold in South Korea. Some Ioniq EV models and Elec City buses were also included.
The estimated 1 trillion won ($900 million) in costs includes 38.9 billion won that was spent on the first recall.

It said it will use a dual-class share structure for the first three years of the listing, which will give co-founder and chief executive Will Shu more control over the company.
This means Deliveroo will not initially be eligible for a ""premium"" listing that would allow it to join the major FTSE indices, although it said in a statement on Thursday it will move to a single structure after three years. 
The Deliveroo IPO is one of the most eagerly watched-for initial public offerings (IPOs) expected in London in the first half of 2021, after petcare firm IVC Evidensia abandoned its immediate IPO plans in favour of private funding.
Dual-class share structures are a common feature of listed technology companies in the United States but are frowned on by some British investors as they can give executives outsized influence on shareholder votes relative to their stake sizes. 
Britain signalled this week that companies may soon be eligible for a ""premium"" listing using a dual-class structure after a review commissioned by Finance Minister Rishi Sunak, although not in time for Deliveroo's listing.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JP Morgan are leading the deal, while Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citi, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) and Numis are also part of the syndicate of banks managing the transaction, sources told Reuters earlier this year.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Lufthansa may permanently ground more jets to emerge leaner from the coronavirus pandemic, the German airline group said on Thursday, as it reported a record 6.7 billion euro ($8.10 billion) loss for 2020.
The group, which also owns Austrian Airlines and the Swiss and Eurowings brands, trimmed its 2021 capacity plans as COVID-19 disruption drags on, but held out hope for a summer upturn.
""We are examining whether all aircraft older than 25 years will remain on the ground permanently,"" Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said, pledging to make 2021 ""a year of redimensioning and modernisation"" for the company.
Lufthansa reported a 1.14 billion-euro ($1.38 billion) fourth-quarter net loss with a 1.29 billion deficit in adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT). Revenue fell 71% to 2.59 billion euros.
Its shares were down 0.4% at 12.73 euros as of 0841 GMT in Frankfurt, after gaining nearly 15% since the start of the year on recovery hopes.
Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said that despite ""tangible progress"" on cost-cutting at its airline subsidiaries, ""Lufthansa mainline is still stuck at step one"" with short-term crisis union agreements.
""More needs to happen - and faster,"" Roeska said.
Lufthansa cut its global workforce by 20% to 110,000 in 2020 and is seeking to eliminate another 10,000 German jobs or equivalent wage costs.
The group, which received a government-backed 9 billion euro bailout last June, said it will operate at 40-50% of pre-crisis capacity this year, down from an earlier 40-60% forecast.
Summer travel will nonetheless pick up swiftly whenever restrictions are eased, Spohr said, and Lufthansa stands ready to restore 70% of its flight schedule ""in the short term"".
The group's full-year net loss of 6.73 billion euros was on 13.59 billion euros in revenue, down 63%. The company predicted a narrower 2021 EBIT loss than last year's 5.45 billion euros.
Analysts had expected losses of 6.63 billion euros for 2020 and 1.24 billion euros for the last three months, according to Lufthansa's consensus polling.
The airline group has outlined plans to cut its fleet to 650 planes in 2023 and phase out ageing Boeing (NYSE:BA) 747-400s and Airbus 340-600s. A slower recovery means more grounded planes may never return to service before retirement.
Operating cash burn was reduced to 300 million euros per month in the fourth quarter and is expected to remain stable at that level in the first three months of 2021, the company said.
Like many airline peers, Lufthansa posted record 2020 cargo profits as mass aircraft groundings squeezed capacity and sent freight prices soaring. Divisional adjusted EBIT jumped to 772 million euros from 1 million, dwarfed by passenger losses. 
Net debt increased to 9.9 billion euros as of Dec. 31 from 6.7 billion a year earlier, while total liquidity stood at 10.6 billion euros including 5.7 billion euros in unused aid.
""We have sufficient liquidity to withstand a market environment that remains difficult,"" Chief Financial Officer Remco Steenbergen said.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Thursday, amid resurgent worries over higher bond yields and extended equity valuations on a busy day for earnings.
At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.2% and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.8%.
European markets received a weak handover from Asia, and before that Wall Street, following more gains in U.S. Treasury yields, with the benchmark 10-year yield climbing to a high of 1.49% on Wednesday before retreating slightly. 
Yields of major European government bonds, with German bunds being the main example, have also risen, but by less than their American counterparts, amid some mixed signaling from the European Central Bank over whether or not it needs to react.
Rising yields lessen the attractiveness of stocks whose expected profits lie far in the future. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will also be in focus. He is due to speak at a conference at 12:05 PM EST (1705 GMT), and investors will look to see if he tries to downplay the recent volatility.
In the corporate sector, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) stock fell 1.2% after the German airline posted record losses for 2020, adding that it may permanently ground more planes to emerge leaner from the coronavirus pandemic. It now says it expects to fly no more than half its pre-pandemic schedule this year, down from an earlier estimate of 60%.
Merck KGaA (DE:MRCG) stock rose 1.4% after the German drugmaker offered a solid outlook for 2021, expecting earnings to grow in the high single-digit to low teens percentage range.
 Aviva  (LON:AV) stock climbed 3.6% after the U.K. insurer agreed to sell its Italian business and pay down 800 million pounds ($1.1 billion) of debt, while  Schroders  (LON:SDR) stock dropped 1.6% despite the U.K.-based money manager reporting record levels of assets under management.
Eurozone retail sales for January are due later in the session.
Oil prices climbed higher Thursday, as traders positioned themselves ahead of a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, a grouping known as OPEC+.
This influential group had been expected to ease production cuts, but Reuters is reporting that they are now considering rolling over the current output curbs into April, allowing the recovery in oil demand to become more established.
This has allowed market participants to look through Wednesday’s surge in U.S. crude stockpiles, jumping a record 21 million barrels last week, especially as this figure was influenced by the recent spell of wintry weather in the southern states.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $61.48 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.4% to $64.33.

The firm's profit before tax and exceptional items increased slightly to 702.3 million pounds from 701.2 million, beating a company-compiled consensus of 649.2 million. It said it would pay a dividend of 79 pence, unchanged from a year earlier.
The company generated net inflows of 42.5 billion pounds, down from the 43.4 billion in 2019.
Schroders shares were down 2% at 3.51 pounds in early trade.

1518,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 03:30AM ET</span>",Texas power grid operator ERCOT fires CEO after deadly blackouts,"By Kanishka Singh and Ann Maria Shibu
(Reuters) - Texas' power grid operator ousted chief executive Bill Magness on Wednesday, as the fallout continues from a deadly blackout last month that left residents without heat, power or water for days.
His departure followed fierce criticism by state lawmakers of the handling of the crisis by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which has led one large electricity provider to seek bankruptcy and put several others near to it.
The mid-February storm temporarily knocked out up to half the state's generating plants, triggering outages that killed dozens and pushed power prices to 10 times the normal rate.
""ERCOT's decision to oust CEO Bill Magness signals accountability for the disaster that swept through our state two weeks ago,"" Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement on Twitter.
""(This step) offers the opportunity for new leadership that can more efficiently prepare and direct our state's resources when dangerous weather strikes,"" he added.
Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, who earlier this week called for the heads of ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission to resign, also welcomed the move.
The legislature now can begin ""fixing what went wrong,"" Patrick said. 
ERCOT said in a statement cited by multiple media organizations that its board had directed that Magness be given a 60 days' termination notice. The board would begin an immediate search for a new CEO.
Magness worked at ERCOT for more than a decade and became its CEO and president in 2016 after working as its general counsel, the Texas Tribune newspaper reported.
Brad Jones, former head of New York's power grid, is the leading candidate to replace Magness as ERCOT's CEO, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the board's thinking.
Magness was grilled for hours last week for leaving power prices at up to 450 times the usual rate after the threat to the state's grid had ended.
Seven of ERCOT's 15 directors have resigned in the last week and the head of the state's Public Utility Commission, which supervised ERCOT, resigned on Monday. 

The winter storm caused widespread blackouts across Texas, a state unaccustomed to extreme cold, knocking out power to more than 4 million people at its peak.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Merck KGaA predicted further earnings gains in 2021 as an effort by the pharma industry to ready treatments and vaccines against the coronavirus bolsters demand for its supplies for biotech labs.
Merck, which also makes pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals, said on Thursday it expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) adjusted for one offs, to grow in the ""high single-digit to low teens percentage range"".
The Life Science unit, which supplies gear and chemicals for biotech labs, in December announced a combined $47 million investment at production facilities in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, to produce supplies for developers of COVID-19 vaccines and lifesaving therapies.
This would begin to increase output from 2021, it said at the time, for products like filters and single-use plastic bags and tubes for bioreactors.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Thursday, following weakness on Wall Street and in Asia overnight amid resurgent worries over higher bond yields and extended equity valuations.
At 2:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.5% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.4%.
The equity indices all closed lower on Wall Street Wednesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite leading the way by falling 2.7%. This weakness carried over into Asia, with the Nikkei in Japan losing 2.1% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng down 2.5%, and Europe is set to follow suit.
This followed more gains in U.S. Treasury yields, with the benchmark 10-year yield last seen trading at 1.48% after climbing to a high of 1.49% on Wednesday before retreating slightly. This sparked concerns of a potential pickup in inflation and an earlier-than-expected decision from the Federal Reserve to tighten its currently very loose monetary policies.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is due to speak at 12:05 PM EST (1705 GMT), and investors will look to see if he tries to downplay the recent rise in Treasury yields.
Yields of major European government bonds, with German bunds being the main example, have also risen, but by less than their American counterparts, amid some mixed signaling from the European Central Bank over whether or not it needs to react.
Rising yields lessen the attractiveness of stocks whose expected profits lie far in the future.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares in the Bank of Japan, one of only a handful of central banks that are publicly listed, hit their upper limit for a fourth straight session in Tokyo on Thursday, taking their gain for the week to 93%.
The perplexing surge to the highest since mid-2018 for the stock in Japan's monetary authority is being seen by some analysts as a sign of an excess of cash in the market searching for a home, comparing it to the surge in cryptocurrency bitcoin.
Thursday's rally came even as the Nikkei 225 slumped more than 2%, dragging the stock index to a small loss for the week.

The Japanese government owns 55% of the BOJ's outstanding shares, which are traded on the JASDAQ bourse for small firms. The BOJ's objective is not to make profits, its shares have no voting rights, pay restricted dividends and volumes are extremely low because they cannot be traded electronically.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Texas' power grid operator on Wednesday cited 12 energy companies and two municipal utilities for failure to pay their bills for power and services during February's deadly blackout that has led to the ouster of the operator's chief executive. 
The companies and utilities owe $2.21 billion for power and services during the storm, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which runs the grid providing electricity to 90% of state residents, said.
In response to the blackouts, some of which ERCOT imposed to balance the grid after freezing generators went offline, the operator ousted Chief Executive Bill Magness, following calls for his resignation by state lawmakers.
The winter storm created a surge in electricity demand that overwhelmed the grid at the same time the cold temperatures and other faults knocked out nearly half the state's power plants. High prices for emergency fuel and power saddled the companies that sell, transmit and generate electricity in the state with about $47 billion in costs, an official estimated. 
Texas consumers will see higher prices as the storm-related charges and unpaid fees are passed along to remaining providers. 
An ERCOT spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Magness is still listed as CEO on the ERCOT website. He took on the role in 2016. 
ERCOT FACES LAWMAKERS 
ERCOT officials are scheduled to go before a Texas senate committee on Thursday that is delving into the grid failure and resulting financial crisis facing the state's power industry. 
As part of its duties, ERCOT acts as a clearinghouse, collecting for power and paying the companies that provide the electrons. Defaulting companies can have their customers taken and their outstanding debts are reallocated to all grid users. 
The largest of ERCOT's 14 debtors, Brazos Electric Power Cooperative Inc, filed for bankruptcy on Monday listing $1.8 billion owed to ERCOT. A Brazos spokesman did not reply to requests for comment. 
The second-largest ERCOT debtor, Entrust Energy Inc, on Wednesday became the second electric provider cut from the grid in five days. It owed nearly $234,000. Entrust did not reply to a request for comment after normal business hours.
The first company dropped from the grid, Griddy Energy LLC, had its customers moved to other providers after failing to pay an undisclosed amount.
Vinnie Campo, the general manager of renewable power marketer Bulb US, said this week that he supports a proposal before the state's Public Utility Commission to roll back some $2 billion in service fees.
Bulb was cited on Tuesday as being $30,800 short on grid payments. However, a company spokeswoman said that amount was paid. Wednesday's list of debtors showed Bulb was $5.1 million in arrears on its ERCOT bills. 
""Our primary focus through the storm and going forward is protecting customers from price increases and bill shock,"" said Campo. ""The market is in need of fixing and fast,"" he said, criticizing storm price increases as a ""windfall"" for generators. 
ERCOT's disclosure of those firms behind on their bills ""is perfectly fair game,"" said Patrick Woodson, chief executive of retail power marketer ATG Clean Energy, whose company is not on the list. 

""I hope they will apply the same standards to identifying the market participants who made massive profits during this disaster,"" he said.

The China-U.S. Industrial Cooperation Fund, launched in November 2017 on the sidelines of former U.S. President Donald Trump's visit to Beijing, has completed two investments in the United States, China Investment Corp (CIC) Chief Strategy Officer Zhao Haiying told Reuters on Wednesday.
The fund was launched with the aim of reaping returns from helping the U.S. firms that it invests in to expand their market in China.
It fell short of the initial $5 billion target, due to a change in strategy, according to a person with direct knowledge.
CIC declined to comment further. Goldman declined to comment.
Zhao said the fundraising went smoothly but CIC has no near-term plans to invest in a second fund with Goldman of a similar nature.
The joint fund first invested alongside Goldman to buy Boyd Corp, a Pleasanton, California-based manufacturer of rubber seals and gaskets, for $3 billion in September 2018, Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/article/us-goldman-sachs-fund-china-exclusive-idUSKCN1RA0CX in 2019.
It completed a second deal last year despite heightened trade tensions between the world's two largest economies, Zhao said, without disclosing details.
CIC will keep watching for potential policy changes in the United States under the Biden administration and ""continue to explore long-term opportunities,"" Zhao said.

1528,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 10:34PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Down, Investors Wary as Treasury Yields Rise","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down Thursday morning, pressing pause on Wednesday's gains and following in the footsteps of their U.S. counterparts. A rise in benchmark Treasury yields brought back investors’ memories of the previous week’s selloff in government bonds that caused yields to rise and share to tumble.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 1.82% by 10:25 PM ET (3:25 AM GMT), while the Shenzhen Component dropped 2.71%. The National People’s Congress, where Premier Li Keqiang will deliver his 2021 work report, opens on Friday.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 2.80%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.78% and South Korea’s KOSPI was down 1.46%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 1.10%.
Australian bonds dropped as benchmark Treasury yields hovered near a 1.5% gain during the previous session. The five-year breakeven rate, which measures market inflation expectations over the next five years, also hit its highest level since 2008.
The selloff rattled investors’ nerves globally amid rising concerns about excessive stock optimism. It remains to be seen whether policymakers will now step in to purchase longer-dated bonds, which they currently appear reluctant to do.
Investors are now turning to U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s upcoming comments for guidance.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Wednesday he shared the view that the recent rise in yields was healthy ahead of Powell’s speech. But some investors did not share Evans’ view.
“Inflation is a concern; there is a lot of money sloshing around the system, and it makes sense to have some sort of a correction right now … and bond yields going up is the market’s implicit way of tightening since the Fed has made it clear they don’t have the intention of doing so,” Spotlight Asset Group chief investment officer Shana Sissel told Bloomberg.
U.S. data released on Wednesday also pointed to a slow and uneven economic recovery from COVID-19. The ISM non-manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) for February was 55.3, against the 58.7 figure in both forecasts prepared by Investing.com and January. ISM non-manufacturing employment was 52.7 in February, down from January’s 55.2 reading.
However, the Fed’s Beige Book said that the U.S. economy expanded modestly in the first two months of the year and sentiment among business owners is picking up as COVID-19 vaccine rollouts boost the prospects for growth. Democrats are also drumming up support for a $1.9 trillion stimulus package, ahead of the bill coming up for debate in the Senate.
Further U.S. economic data will provide a further update on both the seed and direction of the economic recovery. U.S. factory orders, initial jobless claims and durable goods orders data will be released later in the day. February’s U.S. employment report, including non-farm payrolls, is due on Friday."

The AS2 will be powered by engineered synthetic fuel and can reach supersonic speeds of up to Mach 1.4, or about 1,000 miles (1,610 km) per hour, which is 50% faster than conventional business jets, Aerion said.
Production of the jets will begin in 2023 at the firm's Aerion Park facility in Melbourne, Florida, with the first 300 AS2 aircraft planned for the first decade of production, the company said.
Aerion's global order backlog for the AS2 is now valued at more than $10 billion. 
The company said it will also develop a supersonic flight training academy for civil, commercial and military supersonic aircraft in collaboration with Berkshire's professional aviation training provider, FlightSafety International.
U.S. startups Aerion, Boom Supersonic and Spike Aerospace are working to reintroduce supersonic passenger travel for the first time since the Anglo-French Concorde retired in 2003.
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co's GE Aviation unit has said it completed initial designs for the new Affinity turbofan engine, which will be used in Aerion's AS2 jet.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled in favor of the country's telecoms regulator over a label that aims to curb the dominance of Carlos Slim's telecommunications company  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX).
The ruling deals a blow to one of the country's largest companies in its ongoing fight to peel back restrictions. 
Mexico's Federal Institute of Telecommunications (IFT) acted within the constitution when it determined that the America Movil Economic Interest Group, made up of Telcel and other subsidiaries, is a ""preponderant agent"", the court said in a statement. 
That label, given in 2014, opened the door for stricter regulations under a reform of the country's telecommunications industry, aimed at breaking up the dominance of Slim's telecoms empire.
The classification and measures imposed on the company by the IFT ""validly limit its rights in benefit of the citizens to reduce the asymmetries in the coverage of the networks with respect to the different mobile operators"", the supreme court said in a statement.
A spokesman for America Movil said the company was aware of the resolution, but declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the IFT also declined to comment.
While the ruling does not change the status quo for America Movil, it is a setback for the giant's ongoing battle to shake off the restrictions imposed by the reform, industry experts said.
""It's a significant defeat for America Movil and Carlos Slim ... all the restrictions stay in place,"" said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. 
It could also pave the way for the IFT to impose more restrictions aimed at trimming back its power and making it easier for rivals to enter the market. 
""It might free up the IFT to be more forceful in insisting that America Movil act to reduce its market share below 50% by further sharing infrastructure or making other concessions to rivals,"" said Andrew Paxton, a business historian at Mexico's Economic Research and Teaching Center (CIDE).

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) will open its first-ever physical store outside the United States on Thursday.
The world's largest online retailer said the cashierless store, dubbed ""Amazon Fresh,"" is located in Britain, in the London Borough of Ealing. It will carry a private UK food brand it's calling ""by Amazon"" and will let consumers skip the checkout line when they shop.
The opening is a sign of the Seattle-based company's ambition to sell food globally and its belief that physical stores are a key way to capture consumers' high spend on groceries, a category it has yet to dominate.
It so far has worked toward that goal in the United States by acquiring the Whole Foods Market chain in 2017 and testing shoppers' interests with an array of other formats: about two dozen cashierless convenience stores called Amazon Go, two Seattle-area Amazon Go Grocery stores that are about four times the size, and 10 Amazon Fresh supermarkets in California and Illinois.
As in the Go stores, customers will scan a smartphone app to open the UK store's entry gates. Ceiling cameras and shelf weight censors determine what shoppers add to their carts or put back, and their on-file credit cards are billed after they exit.

The location, much smaller than a supermarket, will sell prepared meals, some groceries, and Amazon devices, as well as offer a counter for picking up and returning online orders.

The broadcaster quoted Porsche Motorsport vice-president Fritz Enzinger as saying it would be ""of great interest if aspects of sustainability -- for instance, the implementation of e-fuels"" played a role.
""Should these aspects be confirmed, we will evaluate them in detail within the VW Group and discuss further steps,"" he said.
""Porsche and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) are observing the constantly changing regulations in all relevant racing series around the world. 
""This is also the case with regard to the emerging new engine and drivetrain regulation for Formula One from 2025.""
Formula One's governing body, the FIA, last year delivered the first barrels of 100% sustainable fuel made from bio-waste to engine manufacturers for testing and validation.
It said the aim was a mandatory requirement of 100% sustainable fuels in F1, which has target of being a net zero carbon sport by 2030.
""Our top sustainability priority now is building a roadmap for the hybrid engine that reduces emissions and has a real world benefit for road cars,"" managing director for motorsport Ross Brawn said in December.
""We believe we have the opportunity to do that with a next generation engine that combines hybrid technology with sustainable fuels.""
Formula One's new chief executive Stefano Domenicali, a former head of Volkswagen-owned Lamborghini, said in January that the sport was in discussions with manufacturers not currently involved.

""For the moment, they prefer to stay still quiet, but the good news is that there are other…companies, very important companies, that are really keen to understand what is the value that they can bring home using the F1 platform,"" he said.

Shares of the Pittsburgh-based apparel retailer rose more than 5% in after market trade, as the company also beat Wall Street expectations for fourth-quarter revenue and profit. 
""We're seeing really good signs in terms of where we're headed for the quarter,"" Chief Executive Jay Schottenstein told analysts. 
The apparel retailer has been doubling down on investments in its Aerie brand, which includes comfortable leggings and bralettes, opening new stores and boosting its digital business.
American Eagle is also closing some of its underperforming stores and moving away from malls, where traffic has been thinning, and will open new stand-alone stores. The company plans to open 50 Aerie stores this year. 
For the fourth quarter ended Jan. 30, Aerie recorded a 25% rise in revenue from a year earlier, while digital revenue for the retailer surged 35%. 
""Aerie had an exceptional 2020....and (we) see significant future runway,"" Schottenstein said.
The company forecast higher spending for fiscal 2021, as it plans investments in supply chain to ensure fast delivery and online features for the convenience of shoppers.
It expects annual capital expenditure to be in the range of $250 million to $275 million, up from $128 million in 2020. 
For the fourth quarter, total net revenue fell about 2% to $1.29 billion, beating analysts' average expectation of $1.28 billion, according to Refinitiv estimates. 
Excluding one-time items, the company earned a profit of 39 cents per share, beating estimates of 36 cents. 

Holiday-quarter earnings, however, fell about 25%, weighed by underperforming stores and a charge of $103 million due to pandemic-related expenses.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co will close at least 60 Disney retail stores in North America this year, about 20% of its worldwide total, as it revamps its digital shopping platforms to focus on e-commerce, the company said on Wednesday.
The media and entertainment company also is evaluating a significant reduction of stores in Europe, a spokesperson said, adding that locations in Japan and China will not be affected. Disney currently operates roughly 300 Disney stores around the globe.
The company did not say how many people would lose their jobs as a result of the closures.
Consumers have been moving to digital shopping over physical locations, and chains including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) have shuttered brick-and-mortar stores. The global coronavirus pandemic accelerated that change when people were forced to stay home.
""While consumer behavior has shifted toward online shopping, the global pandemic has changed what consumers expect from a retailer,"" said Stephanie Young, president of Disney's consumer products, games and publishing.
Over the past few years, Disney has expanded its shops inside other retailers such as  Target  (NYSE:TGT) in the United States and Alshaya Group stores in the Middle East. Those locations will continue to operate, as well as stores inside Disney parks. Disney-licensed products also will remain widely available through third-party retailers.
Disney will overhaul its shopDisney apps and websites over the next year. 
""We now plan to create a more flexible, interconnected ecommerce experience that gives consumers easy access to unique, high-quality products across all our franchises,"" Young said.
Digital shopping gives Disney a chance to offer a much broader selection and include higher-end products from all of its Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars brands. 
New products will include adult apparel, artist collaborations, premium home products and collectibles, the company said. It recently unveiled streetwear featuring Grogu, the ""Star Wars"" character popularly known as Baby Yoda.

In November, Disney launched digital marketplaces in Australia, New Zealand and India.

Investors sold shares of the major tech companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), both ending the day in the red along with other big tech stocks, even though the Federal Reserve again tried to reassure the market that wage pressures would not cause a spike in inflation.
The central bank’s Beige Book, which is a compilation of observations from the Fed’s 12 reserve banks through Feb. 22, showed the U.S. economic and labor market growth as well as inflation remained modest.
An unexpectedly weak private payrolls report also rattled hopes that the economic recovery was well on its way. 
More data on jobs -- specifically the number of new and continuing jobless claims -- will be released on Thursday, ahead of the closely watched government data on jobs due out on Friday.

Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) said after the closing bell that it would cut 60 stores in North America, or 20% of its locations, as it focuses on e-commerce. Digital is a trend at Disney, which has also put a greater emphasis on its streaming operation to distribute its content rather than rely on traditional movie theaters, which have been restricted from operating fully because of public health directives. Shares of Disney are up 65% over the last year.

(Reuters) - The Nasdaq ended sharply lower on Wednesday after investors sold high-flying technology shares and pivoted to sectors viewed as more likely to benefit from an economic recovery on the back of fiscal stimulus and vaccination programs.
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) dropped, weighing more than any other stocks on the S&P 500.
The S&P 500 financial and industrial sector indexes reached intra-day record highs. Most other S&P 500 sectors declined.
The Russell 1000 value index, which leans heavily on economy-linked sectors, edged up, while its growth index, comprising large tech companies, lost ground.
""Today is the perfect encapsulation of the big theme we've been seeing in the past couple of months: The vaccine rollout is going well and the economy improving, and that is sending yields and rate expectations higher, which is hurting growth stocks,"" said Baird investment strategist Ross Mayfield, in Louisville, Kentucky. 
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 119.08 points, or 0.38%, to 31,272.44, the S&P 500 lost 50.46 points, or 1.30%, to 3,819.83 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 361.04 points, or 2.7%, to 12,997.75.
The U.S. economic recovery continued at a modest pace over the first weeks of this year, with businesses optimistic about the months to come and demand for housing ""robust,"" but only slow improvement in the job market, the Federal Reserve reported. 
While the vaccine distribution is expected to help the economy, data showed U.S. private employers hired fewer workers than expected in February, suggesting the labor market was struggling to regain speed.
Another report showed U.S. services industry activity unexpectedly slowed in February amid winter storms, while a measure of prices paid by companies for inputs surged to the highest level in nearly 12-1/2 years.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield ticked up to 1.47%, pressuring areas of the market with high valuations. It was still off last week's peak of above 1.61% that roiled stock markets as investors bet on rising inflation.
Rising interest rates disproportionately hurt high-growth tech companies because investors value them based on earnings expected years into the future, and high interest rates hurt the value of future earnings more than the value of earnings made in the short term.
""There is a definite headwind for equity markets if yields go above the 1.5% level with most investors keeping an eye on the pace of yield growth,"" said Michael Stritch, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management.
President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill would phase out $1,400 payments to high-income Americans in a compromise with moderate Democratic senators, according to lawmakers and media reports.

The top U.S. oil producer incurred a historic loss of $22.4 billion last year and is trying to convince a skeptical Wall Street that it can rebound after years of overspending left it deeply indebted and lagging behind rivals better geared for a world demanding cleaner fuels.
Exxon last year fell out of the Dow Jones index of top U.S. companies and shares fell to a two-decade low. Activist investors are pushing it to lessen its reliance on fossil fuels.
""The priority right now is to rebuild the balance sheet,"" Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said on a media call following a virtual analysts day that emphasized the company's commitment to lower spending and reducing debt, which has ballooned to $67.6 billion from $37.8 billion two years earlier.
That said, some analysts criticized Exxon's spending plans, saying the company's focus is likely to shift more to oil than gas, unlike rivals  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa). It is also taking a measured approach to spending in its low-carbon group as other global oil giants aggressively move towards renewable projects. 
Woods reaffirmed plans to keep annual project spending at or below $19 billion in 2021 and between $20 billion and $25 billion through 2025. Production will remain largely flat at around 3.7 million barrels of oil and gas per day.
Previously, Woods had planned to hike spending to as much as $35 billion per year to build production, but has reversed course after costly misfires on U.S. shale and Canadian oil sands.
Shares were up 2.3% to $57.37 as oil prices climbed on Wednesday. The stock is up more than a third this year, but over the longer-term trails broader averages.
Oil and gas production spending will focus on Guyana, Brazil and U.S. shale oil. The company expects its 400,000 barrels of daily output in west Texas and New Mexico to rise to about 700,000 by 2025, ""based on market conditions,"" said Senior Vice President Neil Chapman. Two years ago, it forecast 1 million barrels per day in the Permian as early as 2024.
Overall output is likely ""to steadily shift from gas to liquids, which is at odds with most peers,"" said Biraj Borkhataria, analyst with RBC Capital Markets.
Exxon vowed to increase its investments in carbon capture and storage as part of a new low-carbon business. Such efforts will account for about 3% of new spending, Exxon said, up from 1% previously. 
""It is still far from the double-digit levels of companies such as Shell and Total,"" said Pavel Molchanov, analyst with Raymond James.
Exxon expects $2 billion of a proposed $3 billion in savings from workforce reductions and efficiencies, said Andrew Swiger, chief financial officer. It has said it could cut around 14,000 employees and contractors, or 15% of its global workforce, by the end of the year.
Engine No. 1, a newly formed activist firm that is trying to place four new directors on Exxon's board, was critical of the company's efforts. 
""ExxonMobil today presented a vision of the future that we believe risks continued long-term value destruction, including a lack of serious diversification efforts and the hope that carbon capture will enable the company to avoid long-term evolution,"" the firm said in a press release.
On Monday, Exxon named activist investor Jeffrey Ubben and former Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) executive Michael Angelakis to its board as it attempts to assuage investor concerns. 

""Maybe the best news about the board additions is that the 'our way or the highway' position that Exxon has taken for many years may be changing,"" said Mark Stoeckle, senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds.

MILAN/PARIS (Reuters) - Newly-formed Stellantis, a combination of Peugeot-maker PSA and Fiat Chrysler (FCA), wants to use its clout to take on rivals racing to produce more electric vehicles, Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said on Wednesday. 
Stellantis is now the world's fourth largest carmaker, with 14 brands including Opel, Jeep, Ram and Maserati, and like its peers, it is grappling with a shortage of semiconductors and investments in electric vehicles.
Low global car inventories and cost cuts should help boost profit margins this year, though the carmaker is also looking beyond savings, Tavares said. 
""This is not a crisis merger,"" he told an analyst conference, after Stellantis forecast higher profitability for 2021 and PSA and Fiat which merged in January reported better-than-expected results for 2020.
""This is a merger that is going to open new opportunities for a company that is sound, with talented people ... who do not want to be cornered in a legacy or a dinosaur position.""
Stellantis aims to deliver over 5 billion euros a year in savings through the merger, as well as bulking up to face industry challenges. 
Automakers are racing to develop electric vehicles to meet tighter CO2 emissions targets in Europe and this week Volvo joined a growing number of carmakers aiming for a fully-electric line-up by 2030.
Stellantis plans to have fully-electric or hybrid versions of all of its vehicles available in Europe by 2025, broadly in line with plans at top rivals such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Renault-Nissan, although Stellantis has further to go to meet that goal.
The group said 2021 results should be helped by three new high-margin Jeep vehicles in North America and a strong pricing environment there. The U.S. market has driven profits for years at FCA and starts off as the strongest part of Stellantis.
The carmaker is targeting an adjusted operating profit margin of 5.5%-7.5% this year.
That compares with a 5.3% aggregated margin last year: 4.3% at FCA and 7.1% at PSA excluding a controlling stake in parts maker Faurecia, which is set to be spun-off from Stellantis shortly.
Tavares said he did not consider the guidance to be cautious. It assumes no more significant lockdowns caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic, but the executive warned of other headwinds including the rising price of raw materials. 
The industry is being squeezed by a COVID-19-related global shortage of semiconductors, used for everything from maximising engine fuel economy to driver-assistance features. 
Tavares said the problems might not be fully resolved by the second half of 2021, as some auto rivals have flagged, describing supplies as the ""big unknown"" for revenues in 2021.
COST CUTS
The group is now working through reorganising some of its factory set-ups, though it has pledged to close no plants, and finalising new management teams. 
Priorities for 2021 will also include defining a strategy for China, Tavares said, where some Stellantis brands have struggled more than rivals. 
Tavares, who previously ran PSA, achieved an improvement in margins at the French carmaker by cutting costs, simplifying its vehicle line-up and delivering synergies on its purchase of Opel/Vauxhall, a strategy investors hope he can replicate.
Combined adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) amounted to 7.1 billion euros ($8.6 billion) at the group last year. At the end of 2020, combined liquidity stood at 57.4 billion euros and free cash flow at 3.3 billion euros.
Stellantis is planning a capital markets day for late 2021 or early 2022. The group's shares closed flat on Wednesday.

1545,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 03:10PM ET</span>",Scientists warn of rebound after record 7% fall in global emissions,"By Nina Chestney
LONDON (Reuters) - Coronavirus restrictions led to a record 7% fall in global carbon emissions last year, but the drop will be short-lived unless efforts to phase out fossil fuel are intensified, a study by scientists in the journal Nature Climate Change said.
The study by scientists from institutions in Australia, Britain, France, Norway and the United States, confirmed preliminary estimates from May last year that global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels fell by 7%, or 2.6 billion tonnes, to 34 billion tonnes.
On Tuesday, the International Energy Agency said global CO2 emissions dropped by 5.8% in 2020.
The study in Nature Climate Change analysed daily CO2 emissions across 71 countries and six economic sectors, using data from daily electricity use and mobility tracking services.
To keep the global temperature rise to 1.5-2 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) this century, emissions must decrease by 1-2 billion tonnes a year, the United Nations says.
""When fossil fuel infrastructure is put into use again, there is a risk of a big rebound in emissions in 2021 as was seen in the wake of the global financial crisis in 2009,"" said Glen Peters, research director at Norwegian climate research institution CICERO, which took part in the study.
Although a full rebound is unlikely this year as the pandemic continues, future emissions will largely depend on the alignment of countries' economic recovery plans with climate targets and green growth, the research said. 
To meet climate targets under the 2015 Paris climate accord, post-COVID-19 actions must deliver a ten-fold increase in emissions cuts compared with the period 2016-2019, together with divestment from fossil fuel infrastructure worldwide.
Commenting on the paper, Robin Lamboll, research associate in climate science and policy at London's Grantham Institute said: ""A drop in emissions for one or two years doesn’t really have a long-term effect on climate change.""

""The question for the future is to what extent the emissions reduction indicates a change of culture, and to what extent government assistance is going towards growing a greener economy rather than rebooting fossil fuels,"" he added.

1546,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 02:45PM ET</span>",Explainer - Supply chain finance: Greensill's business model,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan
(Reuters) - SoftBank-backed British fund Greensill Capital is in talks to sell large parts of its business after losing the backing of two asset managers who underpinned parts of its multi-billion dollar supply chain financing model.
WHAT IS SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE? 
Supply chain financing, often also referred to as reverse factoring, is a method by which companies can get cash from banks and funds such as Greensill Capital to pay their suppliers without having to dip into their working capital.
In a typical example, a company such as a supermarket chain, concerned about its small food suppliers during a temporary shock such as the COVID-19 pandemic, approaches its bank.
The small suppliers issue invoices to the supermarket, which confirms to the bank they are valid. Those suppliers then get their money right away from the bank, rather than having to wait 30 days or even months to be paid by the retailer.
At the height of the COVID-19 crisis, use of supply chain financing is reported to have hit a record high in Europe, with banking providers alone earning about $27 billion in fees, data from Coalition shows.
WHY IS IT UNDER SCRUTINY?
Supply chain finance does not have the same disclosure requirements applied to more conventional forms of debt. 
Companies involved often say simply ""we have an arrangement with suppliers for early payments"" in their accounts, which provides the only real clue that they are effectively taking on potentially large amounts of debt to pay suppliers. 
Often this does not come to light until a company runs into trouble, a risk that prompted credit ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) to liken supply chain financing to ""tiger traps"".
Britain's Carillion, Spain's Abengoa and the United Arab Emirates' NMC Health are high profile examples of companies which collapsed on the weight of debt, much of it undisclosed.
WHERE DOES GREENSILL FIT IN? 
Founded by Lex Greensill, a former  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) banker and adviser to the British government, Greensill is the largest non-bank provider of supply chain finance.
Its technology-driven approach has provided $143 billion of financing in 2019 across 10 million customers and suppliers.
In 2019, it secured $1.455 billion of funding over two rounds from SoftBank's Vision Fund, one of the biggest venture capital funds in the world. 
A spokesperson told Reuters in December that it saw volumes and new business increase in 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis. 
But  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Swiss fund GAM this week suspended funds linked to Greensill, prompting it to say it was in talks about selling large parts of its business.

(Reuters) - American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines on Thursday will begin providing workers with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s single-shot COVID-19 vaccine at Chicago's O'Hare airport, according to letters sent to Chicago-based employees.
So far, U.S. airlines are not requiring that employees take the vaccine, which the industry widely views as a key element to a recovery in travel, but they strongly encourage them to do so. 
United Airlines Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said in January that the airline may make the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory for workers, something a spokeswoman said on Wednesday the company is still considering once vaccines are more widely available.
""A vaccine mandate only works if the vaccine is widely available to all of our U.S. employees, which we know is not yet the case,"" she said.
In Chicago, United is working in partnership with the city and local health department on vaccine distribution, which will be available on a reservation-only basis for employees who live or work in Chicago and are either flight crew or over 65.
""Unfortunately, not having enough vaccines in circulation continues to be the biggest challenge,"" United said in its letter seen by Reuters.
It also has airport point of dispensing (POD) sites for employees in Denver and Honolulu.
An American Airlines spokeswoman said O'Hare is the first airport where it is rolling out a limited supply of the vaccines, which will be administered by Premise Health.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) launched a vaccination site at its Atlanta hub in February for employees eligible under Georgia's distribution phase, and its Delta Flight Museum is one of four mass COVID-19 vaccination sites in the state.
""We're looking for opportunities to replicate this in other states where possible,"" a spokesman said.

Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) said it does not have vaccination clinics because it does not have vaccines available to provide workers through an on-site third party, but strongly encourages employees to receive it.

The job cuts are on top of 3,500 put at risk after new CEO Simon Roberts embarked on a major restructuring in November that closed Argos shops and in-store meat, fish and deli counters.
The latest move will see the group vacate two floors at its headquarters in Holborn, central London, two floors at its office in Milton Keynes, outside of the capital, and one floor at its office in Manchester, northern England. Other smaller offices will also close.
""The money we save will enable us to invest in what customers really care about - lower prices, exciting new products and the most convenient ways for them to shop,"" said Roberts, who succeeded Mike Coupe in June.
Sainsbury's, Britain's second largest supermarket group after Tesco (OTC:TSCDD), also said it plans to close its online fulfilment centre (OFC), or so called ""dark store"", in Bromley-by-Bow, east London, as it focuses on servicing online orders from regular stores.
It said it hoped to redeploy most of the 650 workers at the centre to other stores.
Sainsbury's' latest job cuts come a week after rival Asda said 5,000 jobs were at risk from a restructuring.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Aon (NYSE:AON) will face a list of objections by the EU's antitrust watchdog which it must overcome with concessions to proceed with its $30 billion bid for Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW), two people familiar with the matter said.
The negotiations may derail Aon's goal of closing the deal in the first half of the year unless it offers concessions in the coming weeks to stave off the charge sheet, the people said.
The deal, announced a year ago, would create the world's largest insurance broker, putting the merged entity ahead of world No. 1 Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc (NYSE:MMC).
The insurance industry has seen a wave of consolidation triggered by falling valuations, companies seeking to boost their business models, soaring COVID-19 related claims, and other challenges such as climate change.
The European Commission, which suspended its investigation into the deal last month while waiting for Aon to provide requested information, is concerned the takeover may drive up prices and hold back innovation.
The EU enforcer and Aon declined to comment.
Aon shares extended losses and were down 0.5% while Willis erased earlier gains and were 0.6% lower by 1655 GMT.
The Commission is readying a statement of objections, a charge sheet setting out possible competitive harm, the people said. 
Companies have about two weeks to respond and can request a closed-door hearing.
Aon could stave off the charge sheet by offering concessions to address EU regulators' concerns. The company has been in informal discussions about concessions but has not made an official offer to date, the people said.
The EU enforcer wants Willis' reinsurance business to be divested, which Aon has refused, and it is also looking to see if the companies may have to sell the global coordination of employee benefits broking and consultancy services, another person with direct knowledge of the matter said. 
Finding the right concessions that would satisfy large multinational clients, a key focus of the Commission's questionnaires sent to rivals and customers, will not be easy, said a person who had received several such documents.
""In order for a fourth competitor or third competitor to merge, they would need to replace Willis. Replacing Willis means replacing Willis' footprints, their data analytic skill abilities, their cross risk capability, these are really expensive, hard things to build,"" the person said.

The deal has also fuelled concerns with the Australian antitrust watchdog which last month said it could significantly hurt competition in commercial risk, reinsurance and employee benefits broking and advisory services in Australia.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The social media persona ""Roaring Kitty,"" whose online posts helped spark January's trading frenzy in  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) shares, appeared before Massachusetts securities regulators on Wednesday to testify as part of an examination into his activities.
Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin, the state's top securities regulator, last month subpoenaed Keith Gill, who touted GameStop stock in his spare time while he was a registered broker and working at the insurer MassMutual.
He was a key figure in the so-called ""Reddit rally,"" which saw shares of GameStop surge 400% in a week before crashing back to pre-surge levels. Galvin's spokeswoman said Gill was giving testimony virtually in response to the subpoena.
William Taylor, Gill's attorney at Zuckerman Spaeder, declined to comment.
Gill, 34, began sharing his positions on Reddit's popular Wallstreetbets trading forum in September 2019, posting a portfolio screenshot indicating he had invested $53,000 in GameStop.
By late January, Gill, known as ""Roaring Kitty"" on YouTube and ""DeepF***ingValue"" on Reddit, was up over 4,000% on stock and options investments in the company, with his GameStop position plus cash worth nearly $48 million, according to his Reddit posts.
Gill testified before the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services on Feb. 18 that he remained ""as bullish as I've ever been on a potential turnaround for GameStop.""
While trading in GameStop, Gill worked at MassMutual in a marketing and financial education job and was a registered financial broker in Massachusetts.
Galvin's office said that MassMutual has told regulators it was unaware of Gill's outside activities. He left MassMutual in late January and is no longer a broker registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

The broker-dealer arm of MassMutual on Friday filed a termination notice for Gill with FINRA and said an internal review of his ""outside activities"" was ongoing.

1556,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 12:45PM ET</span>","GM extends production cuts due to chip shortage, Stellantis warns of lingering pain","By Ben Klayman and Nick Carey
DETROIT/LONDON (Reuters) - The global semiconductor chip shortage led General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Wednesday to extend production cuts at three North American plants and add a fourth to the list of factories hit, and Stellantis to warn the pain could linger far into the year.
The extended cuts do not change GM's forecast last month that the shortage could shave up to $2 billion from this year's earnings. GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson subsequently said chip supplies should return to normal rates by the second half of the year and he was confident the profit hit would not worsen.
However, Stellantis on Wednesday did not give an estimate for the financial hit it expects this year from the shortage and said the issue could last into the second half of 2021. 
The chip shortage, which has hit automakers globally, stems from a confluence of factors as carmakers, which shut plants for two months during the COVID-19 pandemic last year, compete against the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip supplies.
Consumers have stocked up on laptops, gaming consoles and other electronic products during the pandemic, leading to tight chip supplies. They also bought more cars than industry officials expected last spring, further straining supplies.
GM did not disclose the impact on volumes or say which supplier or parts were affected by the chip shortage, but the U.S. automaker said it intends to recover as much of the lost output as possible.
""GM continues to leverage every available semiconductor to build and ship our most popular and in-demand products, including full-size trucks and SUVs,"" GM spokesman David Barnas said. ""We contemplated this downtime when we discussed our outlook for 2021.""
GM said it would extend downtime at plants in Fairfax, Kansas, and Ingersoll, Ontario, to at least mid-April, and in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, through the end of March. In addition, it will idle its Gravatai plant in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in April and May. 
The Detroit automaker had previously extended production cuts at three North American plants into mid-March and said vehicles at two other plants would only be partially built. Following Wednesday's cuts, forecasting firm AutoForecast Solutions estimated GM could lose more than 216,000 units globally due to the shortage.
While reporting quarterly results on Wednesday, Stellantis said the chip shortage could weigh on 2021 earnings and Chief Financial Officer Richard Palmer told analysts on a conference call the financial impact was a ""big unknown."" 
Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said the automaker was working hard to find alternative chip supplies, but he was ""not so sure"" the issue would be resolved by the second half of 2021.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said last month the lack of chips could cut company production by up to 20% in the first quarter and hurt profits by as much as $2.5 billion. It had previously cut production of its top-selling F-150 pickup truck.
Some automakers, including  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Hyundai Motor Co, avoided deeper cuts by stockpiling chips ahead of the shortage.
Industry officials and politicians have pushed U.S. President Joe Biden's administration to take a more active role in dealing with the chip shortage. 
Last week, Biden said he would seek $37 billion in funding to supercharge chip manufacturing in the United States. An executive order also launched a review of supply chains for such critical products as semiconductor chips, electric vehicle batteries and rare earth minerals. 

Complicating matters was a severe winter storm in Texas last month that killed at least 21 people and led to the shutdown of several chip plants. Semiconductor industry officials said customers would face knock-on effects in several months.

Shares of the Family Dollar parent rose 5% as it said the 50 combination stores it had already opened in small towns and rural communities were more productive and delivered higher gross margins.
Family Dollar stores sell discretionary goods, including apparel, comforters and automotive supplies for under $10, while Dollar Tree outlets typically sell essentials such as food and toilet paper for $1 or less.
Dollar Tree Chief Executive Michael Witynski said in a video https:// the company had identified over 3,000 locations to introduce the combination store concept.
The move comes at a time when people are consolidating their shopping trips to buy everything from cheap toilet paper to higher-priced electronics under one roof to allay fears of catching the new coronavirus.
Dollar Tree said several of the 200 new Family Dollar stores it plans on opening and 1,250 outlets it would renovate this fiscal year would follow the combination store format.
""The combination stores leverage Dollar Tree's growth narrative, supporting its compelling value and convenience proposition and delivering highly competitive prices in convenient locations,"" CFRA Research analyst Camilla Yanushevsky said.
In the fourth quarter ended Jan. 30, increased competition from big-box retailers and a resurgence in COVID-19 cases meant Dollar Tree missed market estimates for sales.
Net sales rose 7.2% to $6.77 billion, below Refinitiv IBES estimates of $6.79 billion.
Net income jumped over 300% to $502.8 million, or $2.13 per share, as the company took a $313 million charge last year. Analysts had estimated a per-share profit of $2.11.

Dollar Tree, which did not provide a forecast for fiscal 2021, also boosted its stock repurchase plan by $2 billion.

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - When the market value of Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) briefly rose above the 100-billion-euro mark on Wednesday for the first time since 2015, the boss of the normally staid carmaker took to Twitter, Elon Musk-style, to crow about it.
VW shares soared as much as 6% after investment bank UBS raised its price target on the stock by 50% and said the company's new electric vehicle platform was set to challenge Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s dominance in the battery electric vehicle (BEV) market.
Herbert Diess, chief executive of VW Group, highlighted the UBS note on Twitter and shared the market capitalisation milestone.
""The market has been waiting for our #BEV-ramp-up and wanted to see some proof points,"" Diess posted. 
Traders reacted with comparisons to Tesla chief Elon Musk who frequently uses Twitter to talk up products developed by his companies, cryptocurrencies or other buzzing technologies.
The comparison, at least for now, must end there.
Diess sent his first tweet using the ""@Herbert_Diess"" handle less than two months ago and has since tweeted 51 times. While he has managed to amass almost 25,000 followers in this time, Musk can boast of 48.3 million.
""The sheer fact that he started his own account apart from the official VW account tells me, that between the lines he wants to express: We are here,"" a Germany-based trader said.
Though unrelated and more a market-moving tweet, another trader highlighted instances of a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision on Musk's tweet in 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share.
EV RACE VS. MARKET CAP RACE
But despite recent share price gains -- up 20% this year -- VW's market capitalisation is just one-sixth that of Tesla. Shares trade 7.5 times 12-month forward earnings; possibly its role in the EV transition is not fully priced.
Tesla meanwhile trades at 160 times 12-month forward earnings, levels many consider bubble-like.
On the market capitalisation gap, UBS said VW's only takes into account its EV business out to 2025, and doesn't price its cash flow-rich legacy business, indicating there is room for the share price to rise.
It added that VW would likely ""master"" the transition to close the volume gap with Tesla in 2022. 
At 300 euros, UBS has the most bullish price target on VW. Analysts' median price target on its shares was 191 euros, according to Refinitiv data.
Preferred shares, which are listed in Germany's benchmark DAX index, hit January 2018 highs on Wednesday, while ordinary shares rose as much as 5.6% to their highest since July 2015, two months before the diesel scandal broke.
VW closed 4.7% higher at 185.18 euros per share on the day, taking its market value to 99 billion euros.

U.S. District Judge David Hittner issued the ruling on Tuesday afternoon, imposing a $14.25 million penalty on Exxon for pollution from the Baytown, Texas, refinery and chemical plant complex over eight years.
In 2017, Hittner issued a $19.95 million penalty to Exxon, finding it was responsible for the pollution from the Baytown complex between 2005 and 2013 as alleged in a lawsuit initially filed in 2010 under the U.S. Clean Air Act by the Sierra Club and Environment Texas. 
In July, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans threw out the penalty and ordered Hittner to determine which violations of the Clean Air Act specifically caused harm to members of the organizations living near Exxon’s Baytown operations. 
The new penalty was based on a finding of 3,651 days of violations and rejection of an “Act of God” defense by the energy giant for pollution during 2008’s Hurricane Ike, which shut the complex. 
“We are currently reviewing the decision and considering next steps,” Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said on Wednesday.The head of Environment Texas called on Exxon to accept the latest ruling. 
“We call on Exxon to finally stop its scorched-earth litigation tactics, pay its penalty and drop these endless appeals,” said Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas. 

The lawsuit was filed under a provision of the Clean Air Act that allows citizens to sue when regulators have failed to stop pollution. Any fine will be paid to the federal government.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will review a tax surcharge on bank profits as it threatens the industry's ability to compete against rivals in the United States and European Union, finance minister Rishi Sunak said on Wednesday. 
Sunak said in his annual budget statement that he was launching the review so the combined tax burden on banks did not rise significantly after a planned increase in corporation tax to 25% from 2023, from 19% currently.
The 8% surcharge, calculated on the same basis as corporation tax, raised 1.5 billion pounds ($2.1 billion) for the government in the 2019-20 financial year. 
The review follows years of lobbying by banks against taxes levied directly on them, but any relaxation could risk public criticism at a time when millions of Britons are struggling financially in the pandemic.
""We welcome the review of the bank surcharge which has long placed UK headquartered firms at a disadvantage to those in New York and in Asian centres,"" said Miles Celic, CEO of finance lobby group TheCityUK.
Fellow industry group UK Finance urged the government to widen its review to include the banking sector's total tax burden.
The surcharge is separate to the more lucrative levy on bank balance sheets, which raised 2.5 billion pounds last fiscal year.
Leaving the surcharge unchanged would make UK taxation of banks ""uncompetitive and damage one of the UK's key exports"", the government said in its budget document.
Changes will be laid out in the autumn and legislated for in the forthcoming Finance Bill 2021-22, the document said.
Finance bosses have previously warned that Britain's tax receipts from its huge financial services sector are set to fall from this year due to the impact of Brexit and further fallout from the pandemic.
A study by the City of London Corporation, which administers the capital's financial district, calculated the sector made a tax contribution of 76 billion pounds ($106 billion) in the year to March 2020.
The 135 billion pound financial sector accounts for more than 10% of UK tax receipts.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly little lower again on Wednesday as a fresh slide in bonds again raised questions over assumptions as to companies' future profitability.
The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rose some 5 basis points to 1.47% on nagging worries about heavy future supply, and concerns that a tightening of bank regulations will make it harder for the country's banks to hold the bonds coming on to the market. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 33 points, or 0.1%, at 31,424 points, but the broader S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.6%. 
The mood also darkened a little after ADP's private payroll survey for February showed a gain of only 117,000, some 60,000 short of forecasts. In mitigation, the previous month's number was revised up by over 20,000, however. The figures have been a poor guide to the official Labor Department's report on employment trends in recent months, but suggest that the labor market is still struggling to pick up momentum despite the lifting of Covid-19-related restrictions in many states in recent weeks. The official labor market report is due on Friday.
A further disappointment came with the Institute of Supply Management's non-manufacturing survey, whose main index fell to 55.3 instead of staying at 58.7 as expected. The ISM registered a drop in new orders and a rise in prices paid, adding further anecdotal evidence of incipient inflationary pressures. The Federal Reserve has indicated it is untroubled by what many analysts see as 'noisy' short-term data, and are more guided the ongoing evidence of labor market slack. As such, governor Lael Brainard said on Tuesday, it will be 'some time' before the Fed has to think about tapering its bond purchases, which are currently running at $120 billion a month.
Rocket Companies (NYSE:RKT) stock, which has the subject of a retail-driven short squeeze on Tuesday, was suspended, limit down, at the open and traded over 15% lower after the circuit-breakers lifted. 
Among the gainers was crafts retailer Michaels (NASDAQ:MIK), which rose 23% after agreeing to be taken private by Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO).
Alphabet  (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock inched 0.6% lower after its Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit said it would end ad sales based on individual users’ browsing histories, a move that again indicates the pressure on tech platforms to rein in some of the aggressive techniques that have made them so profitable in recent years.
Elsewhere,  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock edged up 0.5% after the oil and gas major said it will keep its capital spending between $16-19 billion in 2021, and between $20-25 billion in the subsequent four years, keeping overall output flat over the period. The company appointed two activist investor representatives to its board on Monday after increasing pressure to shore up returns and account more realistically for the likely costs of climate change policies in the future.

BOSTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has hired veteran banker Alfredo Porretti to head its shareholder activism defense efforts in North America as investors are launching new campaigns to push corporations into making significant changes, three sources said.
He will head Shareholder Engagement and M&A Capital Markets for North America and will be based in New York, the sources said.
Porretti was previously head of Shareholder Advisory at independent investment bank  Greenhill  (NYSE:GHL) & Co, and before that worked at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) on the bank's shareholder activism and corporate defense team. 
He is a lawyer and began his career at Cleary Gottlieb.
JPMorgan declined to comment.
The move comes after two executives working on activism defense left the bank. Benjamin Wilson, who had been responsible for North America, left in February to join another firm, and Kirshlen Moodley, who had been head of the practice in Europe, Middle East and Africa, left in late 2020.
JPMorgan had restructured its shareholder advisory business several months ago with David Freedman, a veteran dealmaker, who was tapped to lead the global shareholder engagement and M&A capital markets group.
Activism defense has become a major franchise for investment banks, as hedge funds such as Elliott Management, Starboard Value and Third Point (NYSE:SPNT) push for changes at companies.
While the COVID-19 pandemic tamped down activist campaigns last year, the pace is picking up now with a number of investment firms pressing for strategic reviews to consider M&A and demanding board refreshments. Several firms have nominated directors to boards at companies ranging from  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) to OneSpan (NASDAQ:OSPN).

There has also been movement among bankers in the last months. In January, UBS hired Aneliya Crawford from law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP to co-head its activism defense group.

The Coalition for a Responsible Exxon (CURE), which has 145 members, said the energy giant Exxon had taken steps in the ""right direction"" amid pressure from activist investors to cut costs, refresh its board and focus more on clean energy.
But the group said in a statement more work still lay ahead for one of the world's biggest oil and gas companies.
It said it wanted Exxon to commit to a deeper, long-term shift in capital allocation strategies to make its operations consistent with the Paris accord on tackling climate change.
The company should make additional changes to its board to ""address fiduciary and climate concerns"", as well as split the chairman and chief executive posts, the group said.
Exxon, one of America's most well-known brands, named three new directors in the last five weeks, steps the coalition said showed ""that the company may intend to change"".
Darren Woods, Exxon's chief executive and chairman, said on Wednesday the company was ""committed to growing shareholder value by meeting the world's energy demands today and pursuing a technology-driven strategy to succeed through the energy transition.""
Investment firms Engine No. 1 and D.E. Shaw have pressed for changes at Exxon for months. Engine No. 1 has pushed for the naming of directors with more energy industry expertise.
On Monday, Exxon named activist investor Jeffrey Ubben and former Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Chief Financial Officer Michael Angelakis as directors.

1570,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 09:25AM ET</span>","Energy firms bet on hydrogen boom, but payday far away","By Ron Bousso and Stephanie Kelly
(Reuters) - Governments and energy companies are placing large bets on clean hydrogen playing a leading role in efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions, but its future uses and costs are highly uncertain.
""Without hydrogen by 2050 we cannot aim to be a net zero (carbon) economy,"" Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) CEO Ben van Beurden told the CERAWeek online conference this week.
The universe's most abundant element, hydrogen has been touted for decades as an alternative to fossil fuels, but attempts to commercialise it for use in vehicles and industry have largely failed.
So far, commercial-scale production has been from natural gas or coal and it is a niche market used mainly in oil refining and heavy industry. 
But so-called blue hydrogen, where carbon emissions from its production are not released into the atmosphere, and green hydrogen, which is made with renewable power, are attracting huge interest as a clean alternative to natural gas that can be used for heating homes, heavy industry and transportation. 
The European Union, Britain, Japan and South Korea, as well as leading oil and gas companies, such as Royal Dutch Shell, BP (NYSE:BP) and Total, have set out plans to invest heavily in hydrogen.
In the Canadian province of Quebec, where hydropower is abundant, green hydrogen is going to be a reality, Canadian Natural (NYSE:CNQ) Resources Minister Seamus O'Regan said. Canada last year unveiled a hydrogen strategy that could be worth $40 billion.
But converting natural gas storage, pipelines, furnaces and boilers to hydrogen will be a costly and long process. 
""Hydrogen will not be the solution to each and everything... it's not the silver bullet that solves all problems,"" Siemens Energy CEO Christian Bruch told the conference.
""I don't see really a large-scale commercial viability any time before 2025 or even the end of the decade,"" Bruch added. ""There is still some way to go to prove we have resilient and reliable systems.""
One challenge is the cost of producing green hydrogen, which cannot compete with natural gas or with hydrogen produced from natural gas.
Known as grey hydrogen, hydrogen produced from natural gas or coal in a process that emits high levels of carbon dioxide, is the most common form of the fuel produced today and costs around $1 per kilogram. 
Cleaner blue hydrogen, which captures and stores the carbon dioxide, costs $2 to $3 per kg to produce while green hydrogen - based on the use of clean energy and electrolysis to extract hydrogen from water - costs around $5 per kg, BP's head of innovation & engineering David Eyton said.
He said transporting hydrogen was also expensive even if it is converted to liquid in the form of ammonia, which Saudi Arabia's national oil company Aramco (SE:2222) has begun offering customers.
""Hydrogen is expensive to transport. So if you can use it locally, that's a much more sensible thing to do than sending it a long distance,"" Eyton said.
Shell's van Beurden also said that hydrogen was for now a very small business.

""It will scale up, and it will take a long time before it is a business that is large enough to start making a real difference on sort of planetary scale,"" he said.

Investors just pulled $944 million from BlackRock Inc.'s (NYSE:BLK) $26.3 billion iShares TIPS exchange-traded fund (NYSE:TIP), according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s by far the largest withdrawal in the more than 17-year history of the product, which buffers investors in government debt against growth in consumer prices.
From oil to copper, investing strategies betting that the U.S. economy will run hot this year are losing a little steam after the recent boom spurred by fresh stimulus and the vaccine rollout.
The TIPS ETF was trading at the highest levels on record before its mid-February retreat, with assets having peaked at more than $27 billion.
Reflation trades have been on a tear across global markets this year, with everything booming from small-cap companies and energy stocks to price-protected debt strategies. But historic valuations and the long journey to a post-pandemic world are giving some investors pause for thought.
Meanwhile, the selloff in long-dated nominal bonds -- among the biggest losers when inflation breaks out -- is easing. Some $755 million was added to the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) in the past three sessions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

1575,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 07:26AM ET</span>",European telcos cash in on tower assets as high-cost 5G investment looms,"By Isla Binnie and Supantha Mukherjee
MADRID/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - European telecoms firms are cashing in on the money-making power of masts, as tower companies line up to pay multi-billion dollar price tags for antennas buzzing with ever more data ahead of the advent of 5G.
Faced with straitened revenue growth and stubbornly high debt built up during the last network upgrade, telecoms companies are relishing the quick cash injections they can get from selling these portfolios, or future income from spin-offs. 
Upgrading networks, including towers, for 5G - which promises an age of self-driving cars and brain surgery performed at a distance - will soak up some $890 billion between 2020 and 2025, the GSMA industry body says. 
European operators are increasingly willing to exploit assets to help finance those build-outs. While selling towers outright brings piles of cash, many are also looking to create separate tower units or launch joint ventures with independent companies as a way to keep a chunk of potential future growth.
So far this year, Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) has lined up its towers business for the European sector's biggest listing since 2014, while Orange created a separate towers unit.
Independent tower companies have proved hungry to buy, snapping up more than 14 billion euros ($16.9 billion) worth of assets so far this year to access the steady, inflation-linked returns antenna-topped towers generate. 
But around 66% of sites in Europe are still wholly or partially owned by phone companies,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) estimates, compared with less than 10% in the United States. ""The market is unlocking,"" said Julian Plumstead, Chief Executive for Europe at American Tower (NYSE:AMT), which bought more than 30,000 towers from Spain's Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) in January. 
Compared to the United States, Plumstead told Reuters, ""We are still in the early to middle ages of our industrial development, but looking forward I think the trend will continue and possibly accelerate."" 
GRADUALLY RELINQUISHING 
In cases where operators and tower companies have signed joint ventures, the tower companies say they usually have the option to buy out the operators after a number of years.
This means some are gradually relinquishing these unlikely trophies in stages. Telefonica netted more than $9 billion with the sale to American Tower of sites it had already hived off into a separate unit in 2016.
""We fully understand the interest of the operators in going for this two-stage approach,"" Cellnex Deputy Chief Executive Alex Mestre told Reuters. ""There is revalorization of the asset ... and the operators can seize that.""
Plumstead said American Tower had managed to beef up its portfolio - from an admittedly low base - in Europe this year despite restrictions on movement.
""Getting people into the field has not been as easy... but we've built more towers this year than in Europe last year and we'll plan to do the same again this year."" Towers are prized assets partly because contracts to use them are like an ""infinite marriage"" in which operators pay steady rates for decades, in the words of one industry expert.
Shares of both American Tower and Cellnex touched record highs last year during the pandemic after more than doubling and more than tripling respectively in value in the last half decade.
TOWERING OVER EUROPE
Deal-making has been concentrated in Western Europe until now, but regional leader Cellnex and American Tower, whose buy from Telefonica increased its presence in Europe sevenfold, are both now looking further east and in Scandinavia.
""We are looking at a wider geographic scope,"" Cellnex's Mestre said. ""We have started also in the Nordics, we have started in Poland and in all those areas in our core geographies where we believe there are still a lot of towers yet to be outsourced.""
Almost all European operators are now discussing what they should do with their tower assets, industry executives say. 
High multiples paid for recent deals have piqued their interest. American Tower paid Telefonica around 30x its tower unit's most recent core earnings for the assets, according to analysts at Moody's (NYSE:MCO).
Operators willing to part with their towers have commanded average valuations 22.1 times higher than the assets' core earnings since mid-2018, Moody's also said. Cellnex clinched the lowest price among recent deals, paying 16x earnings for a portfolio from Poland's Play last October.
""If you conclude that it's not really a competitive advantage to own the towers, then you should dispose of them because the multiple arbitrage is high,"" said Nikos Stathopoulos, chairman of mobile operator United Group, which owns 6,000 towers in Bulgaria, Slovenia and Croatia.
Sweden's Telia is also considering wringing money out of its more than 9,000 towers by partnering with external investors, a spokeswoman told Reuters, while Telenor is also aiming to generate value from its tower portfolio, a representative said.

Rocket, parent of Quicken Loans, was up 6.2% at $44.12 in premarket trading, following Tuesday's 71.5% surge. UWM Holdings was trading 19.3% higher at $10.90. 
The company, which struck a deal last year to go public via a SPAC deal, has also gained favor with retail traders online.
The latest gains have placed Rocket and some other mortgage lenders among stocks that have seen wild swings after becoming a focus of investors on sites such as Reddit's WallStreetBets, where mentions of the company have multiplied in recent days. 
Message volume related to Rocket on trading-focused social media site Stocktwits more than doubled, data on Wednesday showed, with more than 94% of posts featuring positive sentiment toward the stock. 
On Tuesday, Rocket's market capitalization rose by more than $34 billion to $82.6 billion. Its shares are currently heavily shorted, leaving them vulnerable to a short squeeze, where investors betting against a company's shares are forced to unwind their positions after a rally.
Investor appetite towards mortgage vendors this month is in stark contrast to their recent outlook towards the sector. A slew of canceled initial public offerings in recent months pointed to fears that the U.S. housing market may have reached a peak.

Shares of a few other companies in the sector also rose premarket, with those of residential mortgage platform provider LoanDepot trading 4.2% higher to $24.50, although in thin volumes.

1577,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 07:16AM ET</span>",Renewable diesel boom highlights challenges in clean-energy transition,"By Rod Nickel, Stephanie Kelly and Karl Plume
(Reuters) - For 17 years, trucker Colin Birch has been hitting the highways to collect used cooking oil from restaurants.
He works for Vancouver-based renderer West Coast Reduction Ltd, which processes the grease into a material to make renewable diesel, a clean-burning road fuel. That job has recently gotten much harder. Birch is caught between soaring demand for the fuel - driven by U.S. and Canadian government incentives - and scarce cooking oil supplies, because fewer people are eating out during the coronavirus pandemic.
""I just have to hustle more,” said Birch, who now sometimes travels twice as far across British Columbia to collect half as much grease as he once did.
His search is a microcosm of the challenges facing the renewable diesel industry, a niche corner of global road fuel production that refiners and others are betting on for growth in a lower-carbon world. Their main problem: a shortage of the ingredients needed to accelerate production of the fuel.
Unlike other green fuels such as biodiesel, renewable diesel can power conventional auto engines without being blended with diesel derived from crude oil, making it attractive for refiners aiming to produce low-pollution options. Refiners can produce renewable diesel from animal fats and plant oils, in addition to used cooking oil.
Production capacity is expected to nearly quintuple to about 2.65 billion gallons (63 million barrels) over the next three years, investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in an October report.
Rising demand is creating both problems and opportunities across an emerging supply chain for the fuel, one small example of how the larger transition to green fuels is upending the energy economy. A renewable diesel boom could also have a profound impact on the agricultural sector by swelling demand for oilseeds like soybeans and canola that compete with other crops for finite planting area, and by driving up food prices.
Local and federal governments in the United States and Canada have created a mix of regulations, taxes or credits to stimulate more production of cleaner fuels. President Joe Biden has promised to move the United States toward net-zero emissions, and Canada's Clean Fuel Standard requires lower carbon intensity starting in late 2022. California currently has a low-carbon standard that provides tradable credits to clean fuel producers.
But the feedstock supply squeeze is constraining the industry's ability to comply with those efforts.
‘SPINNING FAT INTO GOLD’
Demand and prices for feedstocks from soybean oil to grease and animal fat is soaring. Used cooking oil is worth 51 cents per pound, up about half from last year's price, according to pricing service The Jacobsen.
Tallow, made from cattle or sheep fat, sells for 47 cents per pound in Chicago, up more than 30% from a year ago. That's boosting the fortunes of renderers such as Texas-based Darling Ingredients (NYSE:DAR) Inc and meat packers such as  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN). Darling shares have about doubled in the last six months.
""They're spinning fat into gold,"" said Lonnie James, owner of South Carolina fats and oil brokerage Gersony-Strauss. ""The appetite for it is amazing.""
Clean fuels could be a boon for North American refiners, among the pandemic's hardest-hit businesses as grounded airlines and lockdowns hammered fuel demand. Refiners  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO), PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF) Inc and Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) all lost billions in 2020.
Valero’s renewable diesel segment, however, posted a profit, and the company has announced plans to expand output. Marathon is seeking permits to convert a California refinery to produce renewable fuels, while PBF is considering a renewable diesel project at a Louisiana refinery.
The companies are among at least eight North American refineries that have announced plans to produce renewable fuels, including Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), which is reconfiguring a California refinery to produce 800 million gallons of green fuels annually. 
Once new renewable diesel production capacity comes online, feedstocks are likely to become more scarce, said Todd Becker, chief executive of Green Plains (NASDAQ:GPRE) Inc, a biorefining company that helps produce feedstocks.
Goldman Sachs estimates that an additional 1 billion gallons of total capacity could be added if not for issues with feedstock availability, permitting and financing.
""Everybody in North America and around the world are all trying to buy low carbon-intensity feedstocks,"" said Barry Glotman, chief executive of West Coast Reduction.
His customers include the world's biggest renewable diesel maker, Finland’s Neste. A spokesperson for Neste said the company sees more than enough feedstock supply to meet current demand and that development of new feedstocks can ensure supply in the future.
SOYBEAN, CANOLA BOOM
Renewable diesel producers are increasingly counting on soybean and canola oil to run new plants. 
The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) is forecasting record-high soybean demand from domestic processors and exporters this season, largely because of soaring global demand for livestock and poultry feed. 
Crushers who produce oil from the crops are also scouring Western Canada for canola, helping to drive prices in February to a record futures high of C$852.10 per tonne. Soybeans reached $14.45 per bushel in the United States last week, the highest level in more than six years.
Rising food prices are a concern if the predicted demand for crops to generate renewable diesel materializes, said USDA Chief Economist Seth Meyer. U.S. renewable diesel production could generate an extra 500 million pounds of demand for soyoil this year, Juan Luciano, chief executive of agricultural commodities trader Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) Co, said in January. That would represent a 2% year-over-year increase in total consumption.
Greg Heckman, CEO of agribusiness giant  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) Ltd, in February called the renewable diesel expansion a long-term ""structural shift"" in demand for edible oils that will further tighten global supplies this year.
By 2023, U.S. soybean oil demand could outstrip U.S. production by up to 8 billion pounds annually if half the proposed new renewable diesel capacity is constructed, according to BMO Capital Markets. 
That same year, Canadian refiners and importers will face their first full year complying with new standards to lower the carbon intensity of fuel, accelerating demand for renewable diesel feedstocks, said Ian Thomson, president of industry group Advanced Biofuels Canada.
Manitoba canola grower Clayton Harder said it is hard to envision a vast expansion of canola plantings because farmers need to rotate crops to keep soils healthy. Farmers may instead have to raise yields by improving agronomic practices and sowing better seed varieties, he said.
British Columbia refiner Parkland Corp is hedging its bets on feedstock supplies. The company is securing canola oil through long-term contracts, but also exploring how to use forestry waste such as branches and foliage, said Senior Vice President Ryan Krogmeier.
The competition to find new and sustainable biofuel feedstocks will be fierce, said Randall Stuewe, chief executive at Darling, the largest renderer and collector of waste oils.

""If there is a feedstock war, so be it,"" he said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Wednesday, amid growing optimism that the country’s ramped-up vaccination program will lead a prompt and strong economic recovery.
At 7:10 AM ET (1210 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 210 points, or 0.7%, S&P 500 Futures traded 21 points, or 0.6%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 73 points, or 0.6%.
President Joe Biden announced late Tuesday that the U.S. will have sufficient Covid-19 vaccines to vaccinate every adult by the end of May, two months ahead of schedule. This follows Merck agreeing to help rival Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) ramp up the manufacture of its single-shot vaccine.
The vaccine rollout is seen as a key part in getting the country back to work and for the economy to recover. Already Texas, the second biggest U.S. state by population, has said it will lift its mask requirement and would allow businesses to fully reopen next week.
This comes with President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill now in the Senate, after having passed through the House of Representatives.
Focus will turn to the release of ADP private payrolls data for February, at 8:15 AM ET (1315 GMT), as an indicator of how Friday’s official employment report will turn out. Expectations are for a gain of 177,000 during the month versus the 174,000 added in January.
Also on the economic data slate Wednesday is the ISM non-manufacturing PMI release, at 10 AM ET, as well as the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, four hours later.
Meanwhile, in the corporate sector, earnings are due from the likes of spirits company Brown Forman (NYSE:BFb), discount retailer Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) and fast food chain Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN) before the opening bell.
Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday even as the world’s top producers prepared to discuss increasing output.
Thursday sees the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, including Russia, get together to discuss potentially easing production cuts in the light of a rally that has taken prices to 13-month highs. .
Saudi Arabia earlier this year unilaterally cut its output by 1 million barrels a day for February and March.
The American Petroleum Institute reported Tuesday U.S. crude stocks rose by 7.4 million barrels in the week to Feb. 26, and official numbers from the U.S. Energy Information Administration are due at 10:30 AM ET. The numbers are still affected by the widespread refinery closures in the South last week after an extreme cold snap.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.6% higher at $60.70 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.6% to $63.68. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.6% to $1,722.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.2064.

1579,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 07:09AM ET</span>",Cost of Treasuries-Led Rout Seen in Troubled Bond Sales Globally,"(Bloomberg) -- A string of poorly-received bond auctions in the past week is driving home a message -- the Treasuries-led global rout is leaving investors scarred and governments staring at higher borrowing costs.
Treasuries resumed declines on Wednesday, sending yields higher across the curve. That follows a disastrous sale of seven-year notes in the U.S. last week, which set the tone for tepid demand for subsequent sovereign bond offerings from Indonesia to Japan and Germany. The push for higher rates comes as central bank policy makers attempt to ease investors’ discomfort at the pace of the recent jump in yields.
Investors are demanding higher yields to compensate for the risk of further volatility, which may complicate efforts to finance $14 trillion worth of fiscal stimulus. Concerns that central banks may withdraw policy support has soured sentiment, amid mounting evidence of a faster-than-anticipated economic recovery.
“Investors will be increasingly differentiating countries based on their fundamentals and prospects,” said Tuuli McCully, head of Asia Pacific economics at Scotiabank. “Considering elevated debt levels in some countries, higher funding costs could dampen their economic recovery momentum further.”
Clear Message
The message from Europe and Asia Pacific’s markets this week is clear. In Germany, a sale of 15-year bonds on Wednesday received the weakest demand since the tenor was launched last summer. That comes after Indonesia’s Finance Ministry agreed to sell 13.6 trillion rupiah ($951 million) of non-Islamic bonds on Tuesday, the least since March 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Including bills, the sale totaled 17 trillion rupiah, below the government’s revised target of 30 trillion rupiah.
“If there is still no reversal in sentiment, the government may need to accept higher bid yields, or cut down on planned spending,” said Frances Cheung, a rates strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore.
Even though global bonds have stabilized this week, investors are clearly still rattled by the prospect of more volatility. Other than Indonesia, Japan’s sale of 10-year bonds on Tuesday recorded the lowest bid-to-cover since February 2016, and Germany’s sale of 15-year debt also saw tepid demand.
Italy’s sale of green bonds was the exception, racking up 76 billion euros of orders, boosted by its environmentally-friendly tag. In Russia, the Finance Ministry sold the most fixed-coupon notes since June, as mild sanctions from the U.S. failed to deter investors.
In early signs of what would unfold at the U.S. auction last Thursday, the coverage ratios for debt sold in Thailand and Australia a day before that dropped. Later, there were signs of distress in Italy, while New Zealand ended up accepting just over half of the bids it received for a sale as yields soared.
The U.K.’s annual budget due Wednesday will also be in focus as the government tries to balance the need for prolonged economic aid with calls to control the deficit. Strategists expect Britain to nearly halve its borrowing in 2021-22, following an expected record high of 486 billion pounds this fiscal year.
“We are in an uncomfortable spot where attention is shifting toward elevated asset prices,” said Eugene Leow, a rates strategist at DBS Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “Even as central banks try to reassure, there is this lingering fear that less loose policy may be on the way.”
Perspective
For all the jitters, optimists say that higher yields are a sign of confidence and emerging economies continue to enjoy inflows and improved current-account positions. In Asia, central banks have built up their foreign-exchange holdings by the most since 2013.
“We remain of the view that fears of a 2013-like Taper Tantrum for emerging markets are overblown,” said Sameer Goel, Deutsche Bank’s global head of EM research in Singapore. “Central banks stand readier as part of fiscal-monetary coordination to quarterback term premia and the cost of capital to governments.”
Still, the recent jump in yields has put central banks on guard. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard warned Tuesday that bond-market volatility could further delay any pullback in asset purchases while European Central Bank Executive Board member Fabio Panetta said the recent jump in yields “is unwelcome and must be resisted.” Still, the institution as a whole sees no need for drastic action to combat rising yields, according to officials familiar with internal discussions..
While the Federal Reserve’s guidance is that a hike is unlikely until at least 2024, money markets in the U.S. are positioned for interest rates to start rising again by the end of next year.
“That’s a significant difference, a big gap between the Fed’s message and where the market is, and they will push back against that,” said Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) & Co. in New York.

1580,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 06:45AM ET</span>",Prudential's U.S. spin-off plan on track as Asia drives profit rise,"By Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - British insurer Prudential (NYSE:PUK) expects to split off its U.S. business in the second quarter, it said on Wednesday as it posted a 4% rise in full-year operating profit on the back of strength in Asia.
Prudential, which has been pressed by activist investor Third Point (NYSE:SPNT) to split the business in two, said in January that it would separate U.S. unit Jackson through a demerger and could raise up to $3 billion in new equity.
The life insurer on Wednesday said that it is making ""good progress"" with the plans, adding that its preferred option for the capital increase is a global offering to institutional investors and a public share sale to Hong Kong retail investors.
Prudential hived off its UK insurer and asset manager M&G in 2019, following in the footsteps of rivals such as  Standard Life  (LON:SLA) Aberdeen and Old Mutual, which have also restructured complex businesses.
""These two transactions constitute the largest structural change in Pru’s 172-year history,"" Chief Executive Mike Wells, a former boss of the insurer's U.S. business, said on a media call.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Cazenove said Prudential's exit from the United States was ""a positive"" because it would reduce risk from U.S. macroeconomic factors while focusing purely on Asia, where it has performed strongly
Prudential shares were up 1% at 14.99 pounds by 1013 GMT. 
Wells also said the company was talking to its staff in Myanmar daily since the military coup on Feb. ended the country's tentative steps towards democratic rule and triggered domestic protests and international dismay.
There have been no incidents affecting Prudential's Myanmar staff so far, Wells said.
The company's earnings statement said that Prudential sees Myanmar as an ""opportunity for rapid growth"" alongside Vietnam, the Philippines, Cambodia and Laos. 
After deducting restructuring costs and other one-offs, Britain's largest insurer reported 2020 adjusted operating profit from continuing operations up 4% at $5.5 billion, beating a company-supplied consensus forecast of $5.26 billion. 
Profit in Asia was up 13% at $3.7 billion while Jackson registered a 9% decline to $2.8 billion.

Prudential said it would pay a second interim dividend of 10.73 cents per share and a total dividend of 16.10 cents per share.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd is considering two sites in Arizona and another one in New York in addition to Austin, Texas, for a new $17 billion chip plant, according to documents filed with Texas state officials.
The documents dated Feb. 26 also estimated tax abatements concerning the plant will be about $1.48 billion over 20 years from Travis County in Texas and the city of Austin, up from the $805.5 million previously mentioned.
Samsung (KS:005930) is in talks with the sites at Arizona and New York, with each offering property tax abatement and ""significant grants and/or refundable tax credits"" to fund infrastructure improvements, the documents said. 
The new plant Samsung plans to build would produce ""advanced logic devices"" for Samsung's chip contract manufacturing business, and could create 1,800 jobs, according to previous documents filed with Texas state officials. 
Samsung already has a chip plant in Austin, which due to shutdowns caused by a winter storm last month is expected to need some weeks to resume production.
Samsung's U.S. customers for its contract manufacturing chip business include Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).

Samsung is considering a number of possibilities in terms of expansion, a spokesman for the South Korean firm told Reuters on Wednesday, without elaborating.

(NYSE:RKT) rose in premarket trading, set to extend Tuesday’s 71% surge on sentiment that the home-loan provider could be the latest retail trader favorite for its high short interest.
The stock jumped as much as 17% premarket, before paring gains to trade 5.6% higher at $43.94 as of 5:17 a.m. in New York. Shares rose even after RBC Capital Markets downgraded its recommendation to sector perform from outperform, with a price target that suggests 28% downside.
Rocket hit an all-time high Tuesday after CNBC mentioned the company as a possible new target among traders discussing stocks on Reddit. The stock has more than doubled since it went public in August and now has a market capitalization of about $83 billion.
“It seems heavy short interest in the stock was exposed, driving a jump at the open and the dam burst once heavy open interest in $30 call options were triggered, fuelling another dealer gamma squeeze like we have seen with GameStop (NYSE:GME),” Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said in emailed comments.
Rocket carries 46% short interest as a percentage of float, according to S3 analytics. The analytics provider published a report Tuesday identifying exceptionally high trading and option volume for the stock, alongside a large amount of short selling into the rally.
Reddit comment volume for Rocket surged to nearly 19% of total comments on the forum WallStreetBets Tuesday, according to SwaggyStocks, a ticker and sentiment tracker. Rocket was the fifth-most-mentioned company on the market social media platform Stocktwits yesterday, at 3% of 271,666 stories carried on Bloomberg.
Rocket’s jump may have been a matter of time, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Ben Elliott. “Rocket has been a fringe meme stock for a while, so I figured something like this would happen eventually,” Elliott said.

1584,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 05:55AM ET</span>","StockBeat: UBS's VW Call, Stellantis Earnings Drive Cyclicals to New Highs","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The cyclicals rally in Europe shifted up a gear on Wednesday, bolstered by hopes that the key export market of the U.S. will be fully reopened faster than previously thought, compensating for a still-uneven recovery at home.
The cyclicals-heavy DAX in Germany hit an all-time high in early trading before retracing a fraction to be up 0.8% by 5.30 AM ET (1030 GMT) in Europe. The FTSE MIB also rose 0.9%, shrugging off a fresh tightening of lockdown restrictions in a handful of regions as a result of an uptick in Covid-19 cases.
The moves were driven to a large degree by optimism for the auto sector, on the back of a strong first set of earnings from Stellantis, the atrociously named holding company created by the merger of Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) and Fiat, and a new report by UBS analysts sharply upgrading their price target for Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) in recognition of its progress on the shift to electric mobility.
By 5:30 AM ET, Stellantis (PA:STLA) stock was up 2.4% at its highest since October 2019, when the merger was still not a done deal and the pandemic wasn’t even thought of. The group reported a strong end to 2020 and forecast an operating margin of as much as 7.5% in 2021 as it squeezes out the extra efficiencies promised by the merger.
Volkswagen preferred stock meanwhile rose 4.5% to 184.93 euros, its highest since January last year. The price level stands out because it still represents a discount of nearly 40% to UBS’s new 12-month target price of 300 euros. Analyst Patrick Hummel said in a research note that he had underestimated the potential for VW, especially with regard to its ID.3 model.
VW boss Herbert Diess said last month that “we should prepare for a significant upturn” as vaccination programs allow a global economic recovery. But it’s still unusual for a major investment bank to issue such a radical re-appraisal of a European legacy automaker.
Such big revisions are more reminiscent of Wall Street analysts’ grudgingly bringing their Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) forecasts into line with the sky-high expectations of retail investors. However, Tesla trades at over 1,100 times last year’s earnings, while Volkswagen traded at less than 12 times as of Tuesday’s close. Even at UBS’s new target, it’s hard to argue that the valuation gap is sustainable, particularly since many analysts now see Europe, VW’s home market, as driving the shift to electric mobility over the next few years. Stellantis sees European car sales rising 10% this year, compared to 8% growth in North America and 5% in China.
VW isn’t alone in adapting slowly to that trend. UBS also upgraded  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Continental (DE:CONG) stock to buy from hold, citing their progress in adapting. Renault stock rose 5.2% and Continental rose 5.1%.

1586,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 05:30AM ET</span>",Texas electricity regulator under pressure to slash winter storm bills,"By Gary McWilliams
HOUSTON (Reuters) - The Texas electricity regulator meets Wednesday for the first time since a devastating winter storm fueled a financial crisis in its power market, amid calls to slash billions of dollars from costs facing businesses and consumers. 
The storm temporarily knocked out up to half the state's generating plants last month, triggering outages that killed dozens and pushing up power prices to 10 times the normal rate. About $47 billion in higher costs is threatening the companies that sell, transmit or generate electricity in the state. Consumers will see higher prices as the costs are passed along.
Power marketers that sell electricity want the state's Public Utility Commission to reduce, suspend or rescind fees for ancillary services such as standby power that they are required to pay, though in some cases the services were not provided during the blackout. According to one power marketer, those fees ballooned from $37,000 to $19 million for the week of the storm. 
The Independent PUC adviser Carrie Bivens this week recommended cuts that could shave about $2 billion from service fees, though she provided no estimate of the total.
Rules designed to encourage more power during emergencies pushed wholesale prices to $9,000 per megawatt hour (mwh) and led to $25,000 per mwh service fees. The average U.S. home uses about 900 kilowatt hours per month. 
One of Bivens' recommendations would shave two-thirds off the fees charged marketers for the routine services. Another would reverse the fees paid to the generators that failed to provide services during the storm. If left in place, the fees could force out a quarter of the state's about 100 providers and concentrate up to 80% of the market among three large utilities. 
""There could be a number of retail service providers who aren't able to remain in business if ERCOT does not relent on the demand for payment,"" said Catherine Webking, an attorney who represents companies seeking fee cuts. 
It is unclear how the PUC will act. It supervises grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which acts as a clearinghouse, collecting money from electricity sellers and paying those that produce the electrons. It is facing a $2.46 billion shortfall from companies that have not paid their bills. ERCOT on Monday said it would begin naming businesses that have failed to pay and disclose the amounts each owed.
ERCOT's plan to name and shame scofflaws ""is perfectly fair game,"" said Patrick Woodson, chief executive of ATG Clean Energy, who said his company is unscathed. However, he added: ""I hope they will apply the same standards to identifying the market participants who made massive profits during this disaster."" 

The crisis claimed its first victim Monday when Brazos Electric Power Cooperative Inc, whose members provide power to about 660,000 in the state, filed for bankruptcy after receiving bills for $2.1 billion from ERCOT.

1587,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 05:20AM ET</span>",Analysis: Top Glove bets on pandemic boom to propel ambitious $1.9 billion HK listing,"By Scott Murdoch, Anshuman Daga and Liz Lee
HONG KONG/SINGAPORE/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's Top Glove Corp Bhd is betting that pandemic-induced sales can provide enough fuel for its $1.9 billion Hong Kong listing to break through the headwind of U.S. sanctions and the prospect of slower growth as vaccinations become widespread.
Analysts said the unknown pace of vaccination programmes mean the world's largest medical gloves maker could command a higher price for its stock by listing sooner rather than later, while the firm when announcing its plan on Friday talked up post-pandemic sales likely exceeding pre-pandemic levels.
The bullish stance comes even as  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) opted out of working on the deal in the wake of the U.S. sanctions on Top Glove over allegations of forced labour practices, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Top Glove's sales benefited greatly from the COVID-19 pandemic but the company also suffered an outbreak causing 5,000 infections, one death and rebuke from investors including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).
With vaccination programmes underway worldwide, analysts foresee the end of the supernormal cycle for the medical gloves industry, pointing to potential over-capacity and rising costs.
Those concerns have rendered Top Glove stock Malaysia's most shorted. Short interest is at 2.69% of its share capital and 4.2 days of average daily trading volume.
""The company might find it difficult to attract new investors to the Hong Kong offer unless they offer HK shares at a significant discount to the market price due to bad press coverage,"" said LightStream Research analyst Oshadhi Kumarasiri, who publishes on Smartkarma platform.
""But at the end of the day, if it's offered at a substantial discount to the market price, it won't be that hard to find subscribers.""
REPUTATIONAL RISK
Top Glove was in talks with Citi, UBS and China International Capital Corp (CICC) to manage the listing, Reuters reported in October.
Citi and UBS opted not to sponsor the deal late last year due to heightened concerns about Top Glove's rubber farming processes and the reputational risk of working with a U.S. sanctioned company, said the people, who declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media.
U.S. Customs in July sanctioned imports from some Top Glove subsidiaries, whose sales make up 12.5% of the firm's sales, after finding evidence of forced labour practices. Top Glove has said it is improving factory and workers' living conditions.
UBS and Top Glove could also not agree on fees, another person said.
Top Glove - which will join a small list of companies with three listings, after its primary in Kuala Lumpur and secondary in Singapore - did not respond to a request for comment.
Citi and UBS declined comment. CICC did not respond to a request for comment.
GOOD TIMING
Top Glove plans to complete the Hong Kong listing process by the second quarter of this year as it seeks to expand its investor base to Hong Kong and mainland Chinese shareholders.
Its draft prospectus showed CICC as sole sponsor, though firms typically appoint more banks closer to launch. The U.S. sanction, however, makes it unlikely international investment banks will work on the Top Glove deal, the people said.
Earnings are still way above pre-pandemic levels but markets are already pricing in lower growth. Analysts have cut estimates for Top Glove's net income by 7.3% on average over the past 30 days for the year ending August, and trimmed revenue by 5%, Refinitiv data showed.
""It's better to go for a listing now than later because there'll likely be more uncertainties going forward, such as possibly lower average selling prices for gloves,"" said a Kuala Lumpur-based analyst tracking the company.

""No one is sure how fast or how much prices can come down yet, so if Top Glove is able to chalk up good profit and sales now, it's a good time to do it now.""

This week, Danone said Faber - who until now has combined the CEO and chairman roles - would stay on as chairman and oversee the search for a new chief executive.
""With Mr. Faber as chairman, the incoming CEO will not have the appropriate latitude to set a new direction,"" wrote Artisan, which has a stake of around 3% in Danone.
Artisan Partners' letter to Danone's board of management echoed a similar position from investment company Bluebell, which also said Danone should appoint another independent chairman instead of Faber.

Activist investors say Danone - whose brands include Evian and Actimel - needs a management revamp as they believe that under Faber's tenure, Danone's sales growth, margins and share price have lagged rivals, including Perrier-owner Nestle and Unilever (NYSE:UL), the maker of Cornetto ice cream and Lipton tea.

LONDON (Reuters) - Swedish activist investor Cevian Capital on Wednesday urged all European companies to include environmental, social, and governance (ESG) targets in their management pay plans.
Amid growing public and political concerns about climate change and economic inequality, companies are under increasing pressure to show they are taking greater responsibility for how they generate their profits.
While more are making a general push on ESG improvements, for example by setting emission-reduction targets, Cevian said many were ""box checking"", and few had a proper link between performance on ESG issues and executive pay.
""Only a tiny share of companies meaningfully incorporate ESG targets into their incentive plans,"" said Christer Gardell, managing partner at Cevian Capital.
""To get away from ESG box checking and ensure that ESG considerations are truly embedded in corporate strategies, we need to incentivise management teams to embrace them.""
The push on pay comes as part of a broader drive by investors globally to get companies to do more on environmental and social issues, with some of the biggest pledging to get tougher on company boards in the current AGM season.
Cevian, which counts ABB, Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) among its top holdings, asked companies to develop proposals to incorporate ESG targets into incentive plans in time for their annual general meetings (AGMs) in 2022.
AGMs are key dates for companies, when directors seek shareholders’ blessing for pay packages, board line-ups and other matters.
Cevian said if its talks with companies failed to get the right response, it could vote against the re-election of directors, oppose their pay plans and back shareholder resolutions on the issue.

1590,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 04:20AM ET</span>","Japan's SMFG likely to halt all new lending for coal power, sources say","By Takashi Umekawa
TOKYO (Reuters) -  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group  (NYSE:SMFG) is likely to halt new financing for any coal-fired power plants, sources close to the matter said, reflecting increasing pressure on Japanese lenders to cut coal funding.
While SMFG has said it would not finance new coal-fired power plants in principle, until now it has not ruled out funding projects considered to be more environmentally friendly, such as so-called ultra-supercritical (USC) power plants that burn coal more efficiently than older designs.
However, the company is now likely to remove that exception from its lending policy, meaning a complete halt to new finance for coal plants, said the two sources, who declined to be named as the information is not public.
Japan's biggest banks are under pressure from global investors and environmental groups over coal funding. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has also pushed efforts to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
""It's a fact that the criticism from environmental groups has become so strong,"" one of the sources said.
A spokesman for SMFG said that while nothing had been decided, it would review its policy for businesses and industries that could have a major impact on the environment. 
An application for accreditation from the United Nations Green Climate Fund (GCF) - a global fund designed to fight climate change - was put on hold by SMFG last year after environmentalists said the fund should not work with a bank with coal exposure.
Bigger rival Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group Inc has stopped lending to coal power projects except under ""special circumstances"" based on a country's energy policy and international agreements signed by Japan. No.3 lender Mizuho Financial Group Inc, meanwhile, has said it could fund coal projects that will be transformed into highly efficient power plants.
Mizuho shareholders last year rejected a proposal, backed by Nordic funds including Nordea Asset Management, which sought to rein in financing of coal projects in Asia. 
Sources told Reuters last week that trading house Mitsubishi Corp has decided to pull out of an estimated $2 billion project in Vietnam. 

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday called on wealthy nations to end coal use by 2030, urging G7 nations to make that commitment by a leaders' summit in June.

LONDON (Reuters) - Cyber security company Avast said demand for its products surged in the second quarter of 2020 as people shifted to working from home in the pandemic, helping it to meet expectations for revenue and earnings growth.
The London-listed group reported revenue of $892.9 million for 2020, up 7.1% on an organic level, and core earnings of $495.5 million, up 2.6%, with both numbers coming in slightly ahead of analysts' average forecasts.
Chief Executive Ondrej Vlcek said demand for the company's security, protection and privacy software spiked in the second quarter of 2020 as people moved from offices to homes.
""We never expected that surge that happened in Q2 between March and say May to last for too long,"" he said in an interview. 
""It only lasted for one quarter and then it went back to normal, but it helped us to acquire new customers.""
He said Avast added almost 1 million new paying customers last year, a rise of 7.9% to 13.6 million.
The top line, however, was dampened in the second half by a deliberate shift to selling customers one-year licences rather than heavily discounted multi-year deals.
""In terms of the lifetime value, we will get better value by signing those annual licences instead of two year or three year licences,"" he said.
The transition to one-year subscriptions would exert downward pressure on billings this year, the company said, particularly in the first half.
Organic billings growth would also be heavily weighted toward the second half, due in part to the comparison with the spike seen in the second quarter of last year, it said.

Overall Avast said it expected to deliver 2021 organic revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8%.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Wednesday, on optimism that the global vaccination program will lead to a prompt economic recovery, while attention turns to the annual U.K. budget statement.
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.9% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.8% and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 1.2%.
Europe has been hit very hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, confidence is growing that the second half of the year will see strong growth as the region’s economies reopen, even if many European countries have been slow in implementing their vaccination programs.
The European Union aims to increase the region's vaccine production capacity to 2-3 billion doses per year by the end of 2021, Industry Commissioner Thierry Breton was quoted as saying in the Italian press on Wednesday.
Britain has suffered the biggest death toll in Europe and the restriction measures put in place to combat the virus resulted in the mainly services-based economy shrinking by 10% last year, its worst slump in three centuries.
Against this backdrop, Finance Minister Rishi Sunak has been tasked with steering the country through what the government has said will be the final stages of these restrictions, while avoiding any further damage to battered public finances. He will announce his plans on how to do this in a budgetary statement later Wednesday.
Elsewhere, China’s services sector activity grew at its slowest pace in ten months in February, following another Covid outbreak at the start of the year. By contrast, India's grew at its fastest in a year.
February services PMI data for much of Europe are expected later in the session, and are also expected to suffer a step backwards given the restrictions currently in place throughout the continent.
In corporate news, Stellantis (MI:STLA) stock rose 2% after the automaker, formed in January through the merger of  Fiat  Chrysler and PSA Group, said it’s aiming for a profit margin of 5.5%-7.5% this year.
British insurer  Hiscox  (LON:HSX) stock slumped over 12% as it posted a huge loss for 2020 and continued to withhold its dividend.
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday, shrugging off a sharp rise in U.S. inventories, amid cautious optimism about returning demand as global vaccination programs ramp up. 
Thursday sees the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, get together to discuss global supply. The market widely expects them to raise output, probably by around 1.5 million barrels per day, given the recent price rises and generally positive oil market outlook.
Official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration are due later in the session.

1593,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 03:35AM ET</span>","BOJ shares hit limit up again on mix of memento traders, liquidity","By Junko Fujita and Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares in the Bank of Japan (BOJ) hit their upper trading limit for a third session on Wednesday, in the latest example of how excess liquidity can draw retail investors toward seemingly irrational trades.
Shares in the BOJ, one of a handful of central banks with listed stock, surged more than 17% to 47,000 yen ($439.80) to reach their highest levels since May 2018. 
So far this week, the central bank's shares have surged by 68%, which is on par with volatile cryptocurrencies and select meme stocks chased up by U.S. retail investors.
The price spiral has left professional stock analysts scratching their heads, because they say there are no fundamental reasons to justify the move.
The Japanese government owns 55% of the BOJ's outstanding shares, which are traded on the JASDAQ bourse for small firms. The BOJ's objective is not to make profits, its shares have no voting rights, pay restricted dividends and volumes are extremely low because they cannot be traded electronically.
""The move in BOJ shares is just based on speculation. It's moving exactly the same as bitcoin,"" said Koichi Kurose, chief strategist at Resona Asset Management. 
""This means investors with abundant cash are hunting out for anything new to invest, based on the day's topical theme. They are buying BOJ shares because of the recent market boost.""
A BOJ spokesman declined to comment on the share price moves. 
The rally in BOJ shares comes just a few weeks before the central bank conducts a review of its monetary policy.
The central bank is widely expected to scale back on its purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which some critics say have distorted prices in the stock market.
Japanese social media was abuzz with posts about Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's revelation in January that the BOJ's ETF holdings were likely reaping unrealised profits of around 12-13 trillion yen due to a massive rally in Tokyo stocks.
Japanese shares have risen to heights not seen since the asset bubble economy of the late 1980s, with the Nikkei index reclaiming the 30,000-mark last month on expectations for a quick economic rebound from the coronavirus pandemic.
A stock analyst suggested some investors might be buying BOJ shares for the physical stock certificate as a memento of the 2020s era of easy central bank money and soaring equities.
The analyst, who declined to be named, said the current surge reminded him of when retail speculation pushed the BOJ's stock to a record high of 755,000 yen in 1988, and that sentiment now is as bubbly as it was decades ago.
""BOJ shares might have surged on its upbeat earnings but the bank's business objective is not to post profits, its purpose is to stabilise BOJ notes,"" Hiroyuki Kubota, a financial analyst, tweeted.
""We have to be cautious that BOJ shares are attracting speculative money,"" Kubota added.
Resona's Kurose warned that a fall in BOJ shares could portend a market downturn. 
""After all BOJ shares have no substance in them. Shareholders do not have rights to seek higher returns,"" he said.

1595,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 03:25AM ET</span>",Britain to ease listing rules to buttress London after Brexit,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will modernise its listing rules to attract more high-growth and ""blank cheque"" SPAC company flotations to London, Finance Minister Rishi Sunak said after a government-backed review said the capital was on the back foot after Brexit.
The London Stock Exchange is facing tougher competition from NYSE and Nasdaq in New York, and from Euronext in Amsterdam since Britain fully left the European Union on Dec. 31.
In a bid to keep London globally competitive after Brexit, Sunak commissioned a review of listings rules last November. It was led by former European Commissioner Jonathan Hill and published its recommendations on Wednesday.
""The review has more than delivered and I'm keen we move quickly to consult on its recommendations, cementing the UK's reputation at the front of global financial services,"" Sunak said in a statement.
The Financial Conduct Authority will consult publicly on the proposed changes, though some would require legislation to implement.
The government faces pressure to act - it announced a fast-track work visa scheme last week for fintechs - after swathes of euro stock and swaps trading left London for Amsterdam and New York after full Brexit in December.
But asset managers and company directors warn about eroding corporate governance standards by easing listing rules.
Hill said ""the composition of the FTSE index makes clear another challenge: the most significant companies listed in London are either financial or more representative of the 'old economy' than the companies of the future.
He added that there was a sense that the financial sector is on the ""back foot"" due to Brexit and new competition emerging from Amsterdam.
""The recommendations in this report are not about opening a gap between us and other global centres by proposing radical new departures to try to seize a competitive advantage,"" Hill said.
""They are about closing a gap which has already opened up. All the recommendations are consistent with existing practices in other well-regulated financial centres in the USA, Asia and Europe,"" Hill added.
'STATE OF THE CITY'
Two changes seek to move London in line with New York and other financial centres by allowing founders to list their company while still retaining significant control.
Hill recommends allowing dual class share structures to give directors and founders enhanced voting rights on certain decisions for five years, a move retail investor groups say is contrary to the ""one share, one vote"" principle. The minimum ""free float"" or amount of a company's shares or in public hands would be cut from 25% to 15%.
Hill also recommends liberalising listing rules for special purpose acquisition companies or SPACs, whose flotations in New York have surged over the past year, with Amsterdam also attracting some recently.
The prospectus, used by companies to set out their initial or secondary offer of shares, should also be fundamentally reviewed to make listing a company faster and simpler, Hill has recommended.
Hill said regulators in Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and the EU have an objective to maintain competitiveness of their financial sector and this would be helpful for Britain's Finanancial Conduct Authority as well.
There should also be an annual ""State of the City"" report form the finance minister to parliament on the financial sector's competitive position.

""Continuing to evolve the UK listings regime is key to providing flexibility for companies who want to list in London while maintaining high standards of corporate governance,"" said David Schwimmer, chief executive of the LSE Group.

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 02:45AM ET</span>","Pandemic-era investment rules pose hurdles for sovereign funds, report says","By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Sovereign wealth funds will have to navigate growing regulatory scrutiny across some of their favoured areas for investment such as pharmaceuticals, infrastructure, technology and logistics, a new report said on Wednesday.
Infrastructure was their top investment by sector, accounting for 26% of total deal volume from July 2019 to September 2020, followed by services and technology, according to the Sovereign Wealth Funds report, a collaboration between IE Center for the Governance of Change and ICEX-Invest in Spain.
Pharmaceuticals, software and biotech attracted the largest investment by industry, accounting for about 19% of deals over the same period, the report said.
Regulators have focused more closely on some of those areas in the aftermath of the pandemic.
Governments of about 50 countries have imposed rules on exports of products used in the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to U.N. data cited by the report.
""An increased focus on critical infrastructure, and health care infrastructure, in particular, highlights a trend that is likely to accelerate post COVID-19: enhanced scrutiny of foreign investment, and increased time and costs associated with regulatory review of such transactions,"" the report said.
Among last year's notable pharmaceutical deals, Singapore's sovereign fund Temasek and other investors injected $250 million into German biotech company BioNTech, which developed a vaccine against the coronavirus with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE).
Warehouses and the wider logistics sector have also been a growing investment destination for sovereign funds in the past year, accounting for about 40% of their real estate exposure by deal value, the report said.
Sovereign funds also had to be cautious in this area as governments scrambled to base more of their supply chains at home to avoid trade disruptions during the pandemic, the report said.

1599,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 02:15AM ET</span>",Analysis: Spike in bond yields dented some hedge fund February returns,"By Maiya Keidan
(Reuters) - A sharp spike in bond yields last week caught some hedge funds unaware, and saw macro and long-short funds in general give back February profits to end the month modestly up, several market participants said.
Hedge funds, which target returns that outperform the markets, take positions in a variety of assets such as bonds, currencies and equities, depending on the strategy employed. 
The sharp rise in yields - which saw ten-year Treasury yields hit a one-year high of over 1.6% on Thursday - came after a tumultuous January when some funds got burned by holding short positions in stocks caught up in the GameStop (NYSE:GME) trading frenzy.
""The pace and the degree of the move in yields was a bit more aggressive than people thought,"" said Brooks Ritchey at $10.7 billion hedge fund solutions group K2 Advisors, which invests client money in hedge funds.
Long-short equity hedge funds don't take bets in the bond market but many failed to anticipate the spillover from the bond market, which shaved $2 trillion from global equities, said several fund-of-funds.
Troy Gayeski, partner and co-chief investment officer at SkyBridge Capital, which runs $3 billion in its main fund, said that equity funds went from having a ""monster month"" up 4-6% with one as high as 11%, to only gaining 2-3%.
""Very similar to the back half of January, many of the longer-bias long-short managers, or equity-focused event funds gave back a large portion of their gains from earlier in the month,"" said Gayeski.
Comprehensive data on performance for the month is not expected until mid-month. However, HFRX data, which is made up of a small group of global funds and can be an early indicator of industry performance showed that equity-focused hedge funds ended Friday up 1.5% for the month, after gains of 4.1% in the first 19 days of February. 
Meanwhile, the HFRX macro index ended the month up 1.3% on Friday after performance of 2.7% between Feb. 1 and Feb. 19, the data showed. Macro hedge funds bet on macroeconomic trends, often using currencies, bonds and commodities.
The tougher February came after a challenging beginning to the year. Hedge funds began 2021 up a modest 0.9% on average in January after several stocks, led by videogame maker Gamestop were targeted by retail investors, showed data from industry tracker Hedge Fund Research (HFR).
Macro-focused hedge funds posted even smaller gains of 0.2% in January while long-short strategies made 0.78%, according to the HFR data.
Long-short ""alpha"", or outperformance, also showed a fall in performance amid the sharp rise in bond yields, reaching as high as 2.7% for the first 19 days of the month before falling in the last week of February, according to a note from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) seen by Reuters. Goldman did not respond to a request for comment. 
The yield spike came on expectations that an economic rebound would force the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary conditions sooner than anticipated. Yields have since retreated. 
Darren Wolf, global head of investments, alternative investment strategies at Aberdeen Standard Investments, who manages $13 billion in hedge fund assets, said that hedge fund managers ""had a ‘don’t fight the Fed’ mentality, and didn’t have short rate bets on in much size,"" meaning the yield spike didn't benefit them.
Wolf said last week wasn’t a huge event for the macro managers in Aberdeen's portfolio, but added that they were up 1% to 2% on average in February after the strategy made gains of 2.3% for the entirety of 2020, according to HFR data.

""Some of our managers thought that the U.S. 10-year might trade near 1.5% sometime this year,"" said K2's Ritchey. ""Some others thought that by year-end, rates might be 1.7%. But it was faster, farther than even the bond bears thought.""

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen edging higher at the open Wednesday, as attention turns to the annual U.K. budget statement and the country’s taxation and spending plans.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.5% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.5% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.6%.
Britain has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. It has suffered the biggest death toll in Europe and the restriction measures put in place to combat the virus resulted in the mainly services-based economy shrinking by 10% last year, its worst slump in three centuries.
Against this backdrop, Finance Minister Rishi Sunak has been tasked with steering the country through what the government has said will be the final stages of these restrictions, while avoiding any further damage to battered public finances.
Sunak has already announced that his furlough scheme, aimed at keeping people paid and in jobs while businesses are closed, will be extended until the end of September, even with the benefit of Europe's fastest vaccination program.
Elsewhere, China’s services sector activity grew at its slowest pace in ten months in February, according to the Caixin services purchasing managers’ index, following another Covid outbreak at the start of the year. By contrast, India's grew at its fastest in a year.
February services PMI data for much of Europe are expected later in the session, and are also expected to suffer a step backwards given the restrictions currently in place throughout the continent.
In corporate news, earnings come from the likes of Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY), Stellantis NV (MI:STLA), Prudential (NYSE:PUK) and  Persimmon  (LON:PSN).
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday, shrugging off a sharp rise in U.S. inventories, amid cautious optimism about returning demand as global vaccination programs ramp up. 
Thursday sees the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, get together to discuss global supply. The market widely expects them to raise output, probably by around 1.5 million barrels per day, given the recent price rises and generally positive oil market outlook.
At the same time, the American Petroleum Institute reported U.S. crude stocks rose surprisingly by 7.4 million barrels in the week to Feb. 26. The figures reflect the closure of many refineries last week due to the cold snap.
Official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration are due later in the session.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $60.00 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.5% to $63.02. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,731.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2086.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China fined on Wednesday five community group-buying platforms owned and backed by the likes of Meituan,  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD), Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY),  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and Didi Chuxing, citing ""improper pricing behaviour"".
The State Administration of Market Supervision said it had decided to fine the registered firms behind Didi-owned Chengxin Youxuan, Pinduoduo's Duo Duo Maicai, Meituan Select, and Nicetuan 1.5 million yuan ($230,000) each, and that of Shixianghui 500,000 yuan. Nicetuan and Shixianghui respectively count Alibaba and Tencent as investors.
These platforms had issued since the second half of 2020 a large amount of price subsidies which disrupted market order, the regulator said. Some of them also used false or misleading price tactics to ""trick"" consumers into buying from them, it added.
Duoduo Maicai and Chengxin Youxuan said on Wednesday that they attach great importance to the issues and will carry out rectifications.
The other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In China, community group buying refers to a practice of allowing groups of local residents to get discounts by buying together in bulk. Last year the regulator said internet platforms were competing for market share with unreasonably low prices.
China has vowed to strengthen oversight of its big tech firms, which rank among the world's largest and most valuable, citing concerns that they have built market power that stifles competition, misused consumer data and violated consumer rights.

TOKYO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Asian shares edged higher on Wednesday as investors shrugged off concerns that stocks may have rallied too far too fast in the past year, and focused instead on optimism that more imminent U.S. stimulus will energise the global economic recovery.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 1.12%. Australian shares were up 0.82%, while Japan's Nikkei stock index rose 0.45%. Shares in China gained 1.27%.
E-mini S&P futures were up 0.36%.
The pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures were up 0.35%, German DAX futures were up 0.36%, and FTSE futures were up 0.55%.
Wall Street retreated overnight after beginning March with a bang, with the S&P 500 staging its best one-day rally in nine months on Monday. 
But some analysts warned that worries that stock prices may be frothy, a fear echoed by a top Chinese regulatory official on Tuesday, may make it harder for equity markets to hang on to gains. Fears that last week's sell-off in U.S. Treasuries, which rattled stock markets, could resume may also put a lid on stock prices, they said.
""While markets have stabilised..., the tone remains tenuous as investors continue to fear a further sell-off in rates,"" analysts at TD Securities said in a note.
The cautious mood weighed on the U.S. dollar, which has benefited in recent days from investor hopes that the United States will enjoy a faster economic recovery, and that the U.S. central bank will be more tolerant of higher bond yields. 
The U.S. dollar index stood at 90.787, nursing a 0.2% loss from the previous session.
The Australian dollar, which has benefited from bets on an acceleration in global trade, was supported after stronger-than-expected economic growth in the fourth quarter fuelled hopes for a V-shaped recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
Benchmark U.S. government bond yields dipped again for the third consecutive day as investors paused a recent sell-off ahead of a slew of U.S. economic data that will be released later this week. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes stood at 1.4086%, down from last week's high of 1.614%. 
The U.S. stock market was roiled last week when benchmark yields spiked to a one-year high on investor bets that a strong U.S. economic rebound amid ultra-loose monetary conditions could fuel inflation.
U.S. Federal Reserve officials have said that inflation concerns are premature, however, and warned that rising yields could tighten financial conditions and constrain an economic recovery.
MSCI's broadest index of global stocks edged up by 0.19%.
Oil prices bounced slightly from a two-week low overnight on expectations that OPEC+ producers will ease supply curbs at their meeting later this week as economies start to recover from the coronavirus crisis.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.15% to $59.85 a barrel, while Brent futures rose 0.33% to $62.91. 

Cryptocurrency bitcoin erased early losses and rose 0.96% to $48,979. The digital asset is up 69% so far this year as it gains more acceptance in mainstream financial circles.

1603,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 01:15AM ET</span>","U.S. coffee roasters weigh price increases, cite shipping inflation","By Nivedita Balu and Marcelo Teixeira
(Reuters) - Coffee processors in the United States, the world's largest consumer of the beverage, are reporting significant cost increases in their operations, mostly related to transportation, and expect to raise retail prices soon.
Mid-sized and smaller roasters, particularly specialty coffee companies, have been hit hardest, company executives said, but even larger companies such as Peet's and JM Smucker (NYSE:SJM) Co say they are coping with higher costs.
Other U.S. business sectors also face shipping inflation. Market intelligence provider S&P Global Platts reported that freight may have added nearly $10 billion to corporate costs on U.S. inbound routes in the fourth quarter of 2020, a bill that could grow.
Last week, transportation backlogs helped push coffee prices to their highest in more than a year. 
""We're currently signing contracts for delivery in the summer and fall, and those prices have gone up quite a bit, about 15% increases on everything,"" said Oliver Stormshak, chief executive at Olympia Coffee Roasting, based in Olympia, Washington. 
""I'm trying to decide right now whether we eat the costs or restructure our pricing and raise it"", he added.
Coffee executives said higher demand for shipping services as more consumers shop online and extra safety procedures during the pandemic are increasing costs in the United States.
""There are supply constraints, not because of production, but simply hurdles brought upon us by COVID-19 and safety guidelines. It is a systemic issue,"" said Jorge Cuevas, an executive at Sustainable Harvest Coffee Importers in Portland, Oregon.
""It is now more expensive than in the last five to 10 years to bring coffee to the consumer,"" Cuevas said.
Coffee companies also said costs on transoceanic shipping are rising due to imbalances in the flow of containers caused by the pandemic. On some routes, demand for containers is increasing, while others are less-traveled, causing an uneven flow and raising costs.
""The container cost is a major issue in the coffee market,"" said Rabobank's analyst Carlos Mera, adding that routes from Southeast Asia to Europe and the United States are seeing higher prices due to container shortages. ""Even if you are willing to pay, you may not find availability.""
Commodities including coffee, cocoa, cotton and refined sugar are usually transported in containers, while others such as soybeans, corn and raw sugar use bulk carriers.
Roasters reported delays for receiving coffees from Africa and some South American nations. 
Lee Harrison, a senior director at New York-based Joe Coffee Company, said one coffee cargo from Burundi scheduled to arrive at the beginning of the year has been pushed back to March. He said he would likely substitute that origin.
JM Smucker, owner of brands such as Folgers and Dunkin, said in a statement: ""Like others in the industry, we have experienced some recent coffee supply chain challenges.""
Smucker added: ""While we regularly evaluate costs to determine appropriate actions, we do not have any imminent planning to share at this time.""
Large coffee companies boosted stocks last year as a precaution during the pandemic. 
""We are not worried about supplies, as we have good inventory positions,"" said Eric Lauterbach, president & chief operating officer at Peet's, who said the company had encountered shipping issues in the United States and Asia.

Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), the largest U.S. coffee retailer, did not respond to a request for comment.

1604,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2021 12:40AM ET</span>",Proxy adviser ISS backs shareholder proposal for Toshiba investigation,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp shareholders should vote in favour of a proposed independent investigation into allegations that investors were pressured ahead of last year's annual general meeting, an influential proxy adviser has recommended.
The recommendation has the potential to tip the balance of power towards Effissimo Capital Management and other activist shareholders in their long-standing row with Chief Executive Nobuaki Kurumatani and management of the scandal-hit industrial conglomerate. 
The vote will take place at a shareholders' meeting on March 18 and activist investors are estimated to hold about 25% of Toshiba's shares.
Singapore-based Effissimo, which is Toshiba's biggest investor with a 9.9% stake, made the proposal after investor complaints about the last AGM. Reuters has reported the Harvard University endowment fund had been told by a Japanese government adviser that it could be subject to a regulatory probe if it voted against management.
As a result, the fund abstained from voting and later learnt there was no basis for any probe, sources have said. 
Toshiba has conducted its own investigation into the matter and found it was not involved in any effort to pressure the Harvard fund. It did not reach a conclusion as to whether there had been any pressure.
Effissimo has also asked that allegations of miscounting of votes at the AGM be further looked into. Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank Ltd has acknowledged it made mistakes in the counting but Effissimo says some irregularities have not been accounted for.
In a report seen by Reuters, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) called that probe ""one-sided"" and said it was difficult to escape the impression that Toshiba conducted a perfunctory investigation. 
Toshiba declined to make immediate comment. ISS also declined to comment.
At the last annual general meeting, Kurumatani kept his job with just 57% of the vote. That compared with 99% the previous year in a country where CEOs usually get overwhelming support.
Toshiba has been dogged by years of scandals including accounting misdeeds and a huge writedown for its U.S. nuclear business that it eventually withdrew from.
In its report, ISS, however, recommended against a different proposal from Farallon Capital Management, Toshiba's second largest shareholder, which seeks to force the board to present a five-year capital policy plan or make certain returns to shareholders.

It said the U.S hedge fund's proposal was ""overly prescriptive, particularly given its five-year duration, to warrant support.""

The planned lay-offs equate to about 7% of its 4,000-strong workforce in the city-state, the company said in a statement. It follow similar announcements in recent months from fellow oil majors Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc and  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX), which are also cutting positions in Singapore.
See also: Exxon to Cut 14,000 From Global Workforce Due to Oil Slump
Exxon said in October that it would slash its global workforce by 15%, or about 14,000 people, by the end of 2022. The oil industry was hit hard by the collapse in prices last year due to the coronavirus, while it also faces longer-term challenges as fossil fuels are gradually replaced by cleaner alternatives. Southeast Asian refiners, meanwhile, may also come under pressure from massive plants being opened in China.
Shell said in November that it would cut oil-processing capacity at the Pulau Bukom complex in Singapore by half, resulting in hundreds of job losses over the next three years. Chevron may cut 10% of its workforce in the city-state, the Business Times reported in November, citing an unidentified spokesman.
Big Oil is shedding thousands of jobs globally. BP (NYSE:BP) Plc plans to slash 10,000 positions, Shell will cut as many as 9,000 roles, and Chevron has announced about 6,000 reductions.
The job losses in Singapore are due to a reorganization that was accelerated by the pandemic, and the changes will enhance long-term competitiveness, Exxon said in the statement. A spokesperson in Singapore confirmed the plan followed from last year’s announcement of global workforce reductions.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) plans to cut its workforce in Singapore, home to its largest oil refining and petrochemical complex, by about 7% amid the ""unprecedented market conditions"" resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, it said on Wednesday. 
About 300 positions out of 4,000 current jobs will be impacted by the end of 2021, the company said in a statement.
The Singapore layoffs come weeks after Exxon announced its plan to close its 72-year-old Altona refinery in Australia and convert it to an import terminal. The top U.S. oil producer, once America's most valuable company, posted a historic annual loss for 2020 after the coronavirus pandemic slashed energy demand.
Exxon's announcement also follows European major Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa)'s decision in November to cut 500 staff and halve its crude processing capacity in Singapore as part of a global strategy to reduce carbon emissions.
Exxon Mobil's Singapore complex has the capacity to refine about 592,000 barrels per day of oil and includes its biggest integrated petrochemical production site. 
The city-state will remain a strategic location for the company, it said.
""This is a difficult but necessary step to improve our company's competitiveness and strengthen the foundation of our business for future success,"" said Geraldine Chin, chairman and managing director, ExxonMobil Asia Pacific Pte Ltd.

Last year, Exxon said it remained committed to a multi-billion dollar expansion at the Singapore complex amid an ongoing review of its projects globally.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up Wednesday morning, over receding worries that global shares have rallied too far too fast during the past year. Investors’ focus is now on the U.S.’ $1.9 trillion stimulus package, with hope growing that it will stimulate the global economic recovery from COVID-19.
China’s Shanghai Composite rose 1.05% by 10:12 PM ET (3:12 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component edged up 0.20%. China released February’s Caixin services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) earlier in the day, which stood at 51.5 against January’s 52 figure.
The country’s Caixin manufacturing PMI, as well as the official manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs, were released earlier in the week.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 1.64% and South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.45%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.35%. Japan’s own services PMI for February was 46.3, higher than January's 46.1 reading.
In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.80%. The country’s GDP grew 3.1% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2021, higher that the 2.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but lower than the 3.3% growth recorded in the third quarter. The GDP shrank 1.1% year-on-year, which was less than the forecast 1.8% contraction and the third quarter’s 3.7% drop.
Treasury yields retreated on Tuesday, amid comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard that bond-market volatility could further delay any pullback in the Fed’s asset purchases.
Valuations have become a point of focus after hopes for a massive U.S stimulus package drove a run up in risk assets.
Investors also continued to digest a stark warning from Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.
“From a banking and insurance industry’s perspective, the first step is to reduce the high leverage within the financial system,” Guo said during a Tuesday briefing in Beijing.

Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, disclosed messages from the board members in a securities filing stating their reasons for effectively resigning.
After complaining about high fuel prices, Bolsonaro has appointed Joaquim Silva e Luna, a retired military officer who had been running the Itaipu hydroelectric dam on the border with Paraguay, to replace Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco. 
The move revived old concerns over government interference in Petrobras and its fuel pricing policy, as has happened under previous administrations.
Branco will officially step down at a shareholders meeting, whose date has yet to be set. The four board members would also step down at that time.
Two of the board members said they could not accept reappointment because of personal reasons, while another said his term was being ""interrupted unexpectedly"" without explanation. 

A fourth board member said that he would not continue because of ""upper management changes,"" which he said weren't in-line with best management practices.

1609,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 09:50PM ET</span>",Japanese and Swiss central bank shares soar in exuberant markets,"By Danilo Masoni and John Revill
(Reuters) - The listed shares of the Japanese and Swiss central banks rose sharply this week, without any apparent reason, possibly reflecting high levels of investor exuberance in markets awash with cash.
Shares in the Bank of Japan (BOJ) hit their upper trading limit for a third session on Wednesday, taking gains over 4 sessions to 71%. Swiss National Bank (SNB) shares rose around 10% in two days. 
While both central banks have made big gains on their stock and bond holdings this year, the unusual strength of the share rallies suggested retail investors were piling in.
The BOJ and the SNB set monetary policy in economies with the world's most popular funding currencies. Their peculiar ownership structures and low free float can exacerbate moves in their share prices.
Shareholders' rights in both banks are also severely limited, which should theoretically narrow their investment appeal.
""BOJ shares might have surged on its upbeat earnings but the bank's business objective is not to post profits, its purpose is to stabilise BOJ notes,"" Hiroyuki Kubota, a financial analyst, tweeted. 
""...we have to be cautious that BOJ shares are attracting speculative money,"" Kubota added. 
BOJ shares climbed to 47,000 yen ($440), their strongest since May 2018. The government owns more than half of the stock.
Veteran investors were reminded of the late 1980s when Japan was experiencing an asset-price bubble and BOJ shares became the target of speculative trading, rising 40-fold in four years. 
SNB shares built on Monday's strong gains after the bank posted a net 2020 profit of 20.9 billion Swiss francs ($22.8 bln).
Traders in Zurich said retail investors were most likely driving the move but volumes remained thin.
The SNB declined to comment on its share price move.
UNORTHODOX
The last sharp rise in SNB shares was in April 2018, when they climbed from below 2,000 Swiss francs to a record 9,760 francs in less than a year. That surge came after blogs in Germany compared the SNB's shares to ultra-safe perpetual bonds. 
Voting rights in SNB are subject to restrictions, with most of its shares held by the country's cantons and regional banks. The central bank has been listed since its foundation in 1907, and 40% of its shares are held by the public. 
SNB-watchers said the legal limit on dividends, at 6% of the share capital, also conflicted with the stock gains. 
""A change in the SNB's dividend policy is not in the cards, fundamentals stay the same,"" said UBS economist Alessandro Bee. 
The pullback in the Japanese yen and Swiss franc against the U.S. dollar this year, however, bodes well for the central banks as the value of hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of overseas assets on their balance sheets rises.
Both central banks are known for their large portfolio holdings. The SNB's 914 billion francs of foreign investments are bigger than the Swiss economy. 
The Swiss central bank is a significant investor in U.S. tech stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) In and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, while the BOJ has huge holdings in the local share market, which recently scaled a 30-year high.

TreeHouse said it shares a ""common perspective"" with Jana, which has said the stock remains undervalued nearly three years into a turnaround. The company said its current share price does not reflect the progress it has made.
Jana, which owns 7.4% of TreeHouse's shares and has a history of pushing for change in the food and beverage industry, in late January nominated three directors to the TreeHouse board.
John Gainor, who was nominated by Jana, brings food industry experience and was most recently the CEO of International Dairy Queen. Kenneth Tuchman has decades of experience as an investment banker having worked at Bank of Montreal Capital Markets and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
""I look forward to working with John, Ken and the rest of the board to focus on accelerating our momentum and achieving a stock price that reflects the true value of our business,"" TreeHouse CEO Steve Oakland said in a statement.
TreeHouse, which makes private label food and beverages across North America and Italy for retail grocery, food service and industrial customers, is valued at $2.8 billion.
Its share price has climbed 18% since January and closed trading at $49.34 on Tuesday, but is still well below prices over $100 in mid-2016.
Jana previously pushed for change at Pinnacle Foods which was sold to Conagra and at Whole Foods which was sold to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
After settling, Barry Rosenstein, Jana's managing partner, said in a statement; ""We are encouraged by the steps the Company has been taking, including these director additions, and by the ongoing commitment to unlocking stockholder value.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - Tractors and Farm Equipment Limited, the largest investor in AGCO Corp, on Tuesday again pressed the agricultural machinery maker to refresh its board and consider strategic alternatives as it risks falling further behind its rivals.
Indian tractor manufacturer Tractors and Farm Equipment, known as TAFE, said in a U.S. regulatory filing that it made a presentation to the company in which it outlined AGCO's weakening long-term competitive position and urged immediate action.
""We believe that material risks exist for AGCO's shareholders in the inevitable cycle downturn and that the Board should proactively focus on minimizing such risk now,"" TAFE, which is AGCO's largest shareholder with a 16.2% stake, said in the presentation.
AGCO was not immediately available for comment. 
TAFE is calling on the company to appoint three new independent directors to the board, appoint a new lead independent director with strong board experience and form a committee to oversee the execution of a strategic plan.
AGCO's recent stock price gains have been fueled by macro economic tailwinds in the agricultural sector but mask the company's weakened stature compared with rivals like John Deere (NYSE:DE) and Kutoba, TAFE said.
AGCO, which is valued at $9.6 billion and is headquartered in Duluth, Georgia, has seen its stock price surge 103% in the last 52 weeks and closed trading at $129.11 on Tuesday. 
""Strategic missteps have resulted in a deteriorating market position in Brazil, continued sub-scale presence in North America (a key market) and an unsuccessful investment initiative in China,"" TAFE said in the presentation, which was attached to the regulatory filing.

TAFE, which has previously raised similar concerns with AGCO, has been an owner for seven years and paid an average $48.13 for its stake.

Japanese carmaker Toyota, which has its U.S. headquarters and a factory in Texas, said it was looking into the move by Governor Greg Abbott to roll back the mask mandate, and it doesn't contemplate any immediate changes.
Abbott's executive order lifts all mask requirements statewide and forbids any local jurisdiction from penalizing residents for not wearing a face covering.
""The early read is – no change for us,"" Toyota spokesman Scott Vazin said.
Toyota's plant in San Antonio builds full-size pickup trucks. The company has about 7,000 employees in Texas, including 4,400 at its Plano headquarters.
GM, which employs about 13,500 people in Texas, said it would also maintain status quo in the state, with regards to its employees wearing masks.
""We'll keep our COVID-19 safety protocols in place to ensure we continue to protect our employees,"" GM spokesman Patrick Morrissey said.
Target will continue requiring guests to wear masks in all of its stores, the company's spokesman said, adding that the big-box retailer also required all store team members to wear masks at work, and provided them with reusable and disposable masks.
Department store operator Macy's said its policy of needing customers and workers to wear masks in stores was going to remain unchanged.
""Relaxing common-sense safety protocols like wearing masks is a mistake,"" Jason Brewer, vice president of Communications and State Affairs at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said, adding that going back on safety measures will ""unfairly put retail employees back in the role of enforcing guidelines still recommended by the CDC and other public health advocates.""

As of Monday, 35 U.S. states, along with the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, mandate that residents wear face masks in public. Iowa, Mississippi, Montana and North Dakota have lifted mask orders imposed last year.

Although some of the merchandise did not reach the shelves on time, the upscale department store chain reported a smaller-than-expected fall in quarterly revenue powered by online sales and its off-price business.
Nordstrom's focus on e-commerce, as consumers shift to shopping online in the wake of the health crisis, and the growth of its off price channel helped it bring in sales even amid restrictions. 
Total revenue fell 19.7% to $3.65 billion in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, compared with estimates of $3.60 billion. 
""The quarter was not without its challenges, and there were unanticipated headwinds ... We also exited the quarter with excess inventory that we are working quickly to address,"" Chief Financial Officer Anne Bramman said. 
Nordstrom expects some pressure in gross margin as it aligns inventory in its first quarter, the time it expects its off-price Rack stores to return to normal inventory levels. 
""There is no denying that their (Nordstrom) Q4 results were impacted, as fewer consumers go to offices and formal events,"" said Hilding Anderson, head of retail strategy at consulting firm Publicis Sapient.
""We expect apparel sales to rebound in the second half of 2021 as the vaccine rollout continues."" 
Sales at Rack decreased 23%. Digital sales of about $2 billion accounted for 54% of the retailer's business.
Nordstrom's shares were down about 2%. 
For the holiday quarter, net income fell 83% to $33 million, largely hurt by higher markdowns and COVID-19-induced labor and shipping expenses. 

On a per share basis, it earned 21 cents, beating the estimate of 14 cents, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv IBES.

In a research note published on Tuesday, Guggenheim Global Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd said using sine regression analysis of 10-year rates since the 1980s, yields were seen potentially bottoming at -0.5% by early 2022, bounded by a two-standard deviation range of 1.0% and low of -2.0%.
The driving force is the surge in broad M2 money supply, which has driven short rates practically to zero, but is likely to continue to work its way out the curve.
""As stimulus payments and tax refunds are distributed and more money looks to be put to work, investors will extend maturities on their bond portfolios in a 'reach for yield',"" he wrote.
Minerd cited Nobel Prize-winning economist Eugene Fama's Random Walk theory where a securities price can stumble left and right like a ""drunk man in the snow"" and still maintain a general direction, which for Treasury yields is down.
""The foregone conclusion today is that long-term rates are on an uninterrupted trajectory higher. History tells us something different.""

The 10-year yield closed Tuesday at 1.3982%, having reached its highest in a year at 1.614% last week. The rate bottomed at 0.318% in March last year as the coronavirus pandemic began to impact the global economy.

Simon Thompson will step down as chairman following next year's annual general meetings, while non-executive director Michael L'Estrange will also retire from the board after this year's meetings, Rio said in a statement. 
""I am ultimately accountable for the failings that led to this tragic event,"" Thompson said in the statement on Wednesday.
The destruction of the 46,000-year-old Juukan Gorge rock shelters last year sparked a public and investor uproar that led to the resignation of then CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques and two deputies.
Thompson and L'Estrange have come under pressure to leave after what was seen as the board's mishandling of an investigation into the destruction that found no single person accountable.
Thompson came under more pressure last month after elders of the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people accused him of breaking a personal promise.
The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI) welcomed the board change in recognition of accountability for cultural and operational failures, which it said also offered a chance for board renewal.
""The destruction of the Juukan caves resulted in a devastating cultural loss. Today's announcement is a step towards the company rebuilding relationships with Traditional Owners,"" ACSI CEO Louise Davidson said. 
""In particular, investors would like to see the Board increase its connection with Australian operations and communities, as well as an increase in mining experience.""
Rio Tinto's board last year chose Danish businessman Jakob Stausholm for the top job, although some Australian investors had pushed for a leader with strong experience of local Indigenous issues. Stausholm joined Rio as its Chief Financial Officer in 2018 and will be based in London.
Last month, Rio's remuneration committee handed chunky payouts to all three executives forced to leave.
Jacques, who stepped down from his role at the end of 2020, received total remuneration of 13.3 million pounds ($18.6 million) under Australian accounting rules, up from 7.1 million pounds a year earlier.

Independent directors Sam Laidlaw and Simon McKeon will lead the search for the new Chair, Rio said.

(Reuters) - Heavily shorted mortgage provider Rocket Companies saw its stock surge on Tuesday, in an eye-popping move reminiscent of the rallies that powered GameStop (N:GME) and other so-called meme stocks earlier in the year. 
Shares of Rocket, the parent company of Quicken Loans, closed up 71.2% at $41.60 after being halted several times for volatility. More than 367 million shares changed hands in the stock's busiest trading day ever. 
The outsized move puts Rocket among the stocks that have experienced wild gyrations after becoming a focus of investors on sites such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets, where mentions of the company have multiplied in recent days. The company's market cap rose by more than $34 billion to $82.6 billion.
Shares of Rocket Companies are also heavily shorted, leaving them vulnerable to a phenomenon known as a short squeeze, where investors betting against a company's shares are forced to unwind their positions after a rally in the stock price. 
A short squeeze, sparked in part by retail investors coordinating on WallStreetBets, helped fuel a more than 1,600% run in GameStop's shares in January, before they pared much of those gains the following month. 
""This feels very much like a retail-driven move and also probably a short squeeze,” said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Mark DeVries. 
The value of Rocket shares shorted stood at $1.2 billion as of Monday's close, accounting for nearly 46% of the float, compared with 35.5% at the beginning of February, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.
The position makes Rocket the fifth largest short in the banking sector, behind JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), S3 data showed. 
The firm issued a report titled ""Rocket Shorts are Crashing and Burning"" and Dusaniwsky referred to the trading activity as ""GameStop-esque.”
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Ryan Carr on Feb. 25 raised his price target on the stock to $30, from $27.50, after the company reported fourth-quarter results that handily beat Wall Street expectations.
While Rocket has been growing quickly, some experts have warned that the U.S. housing market could experience a slowdown later in 2021, even as low interest rates fuel refinancings. 
As a result, some investors have snubbed the initial public offerings of mortgage lenders. Rocket had to slash the size of its offering by about a third due to lackluster demand when it debuted in August. 
Rocket's Chief Executive Officer Jay Farner is due to participate in  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s Technology, Media & Telecom conference on Wednesday morning. 
Mentions of Rocket on WallstreetBets have shot higher in recent days, according to website SwaggyStocks.com, which tracks comments on the forum. 
Meanwhile shares in another mortgage company, UWM Holdings, closed up 19.7% at $9.13 with trading volume exceeding five times the 10-day moving average. 

Other stocks followed closely by retail investors were lower Tuesday, with shares of GameStop closing down 1.8% while headphone maker Koss Corp tumbled 14.6% and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) fell 2.7%.

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 06:10PM ET</span>",Boeing cites risks in design of newest Airbus jet,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co has raised concerns over the design of arch-rival Airbus' newest narrow-body jet, the A321XLR, saying a novel type of fuel tank could pose fire risks.
The U.S. plane giant's intervention is not without precedent in a global system that regularly allows manufacturers to chime in whenever safety rules are being interpreted in a way that might affect the rest of the industry.
But it comes at a pivotal moment as Boeing emerges from a two-year safety crisis over its competing 737 MAX, and Airbus faces its own crucial test of the tougher mood expected from regulators worldwide following the MAX's 20-month grounding.
In a submission to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Boeing said the architecture of a fuel tank intended to increase the A321XLR's range ""presents many potential hazards.""
The debate surrounds the hot-selling A321XLR's main marketing point - the longest range of any single-aisle jet.
In most jets, fuel is carried in wings and central tanks.
To meet demand for longer routes, Airbus has already added optional extra fuel tanks inside the cargo bay of some A321s.
For the A321XLR, Airbus plans to eke out more space for fuel by moulding one tank directly into the fuselage, meaning its shape would follow the contours of the jet and carry more fuel.
The concept caught the attention of EASA which in January said it would impose special conditions to keep passengers safe.
""An integral fuselage fuel tank exposed to an external fire, if not adequately protected, may not provide enough time for the
passengers to safely evacuate the aircraft,"" it said.
In comments to EASA first reported by Flightglobal, Boeing cited risks if a jet veers off a runway or its wheels fail.
""Public consultation is part-and-parcel of an aircraft development programme,"" an Airbus spokesman said, adding any issues raised would be tackled together with regulators.
COMMERCIAL STAKES
Such technical exchanges rarely capture attention. But a battered aerospace industry is on edge after the MAX crisis, compounded by COVID-19, shook confidence in aviation.
Commercial stakes are also high. 
One industry source familiar with the project warned any extended wrangle over certification could delay the A321XLR's service entry from ""late 2023"" to 2024 or beyond.
Should that happen, sources say Boeing is expected to encourage airlines to wait a few years longer for a potential all-new model that insiders say would leapfrog the A321XLR.
While insisting they never compete on safety, Airbus and Boeing have a record of goading each other in the past over issues like novel flight computers on the Airbus A320 or European claims that four engines were safer than the 777's two.
Fuel tanks have provoked particularly sharp disagreement.
In 2001, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration triggered changes to the design of fuel tanks worldwide, five years after a Boeing 747 exploded in mid-air. 

Investigators said TWA 800 was brought down by a fuel-tank explosion in the presence of unwanted oxygen, but Airbus officials maintained their own jets were less at risk.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Robinhood, the online brokerage used by many retail traders to pile in to heavily shorted stocks like  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), has made an ambitious push into loaning out its clients' shares to short sellers as it expands its business.
The broker had $1.9 billion in shares loaned out as of Dec. 31, nearly three times the $674 million a year earlier, and it was permitted to lend out $4.6 billion worth of securities under margin agreements, around five times bigger than the prior year, according to an annual regulatory filing late on Monday. 
The size of the jump highlights Robinhood's rapid growth over the past year as the number of retail investors has soared in the work-from-home environment during the pandemic and as retail brokers have largely eliminated trading fees, a model Robinhood helped pioneer.
Menlo Park, California-based Robinhood is expected to go public this year with a valuation of more than $20 billion.
Securities lending is common among brokerages, which can earn income by lending shares to hedge funds and others, who then sell the shares back into the market, betting the share prices will drop so they can buy them back at a lower price when it is time to return them, pocketing the difference.
Shares that are in heavy demand from short sellers, like GameStop, which had 140% short interest in January, command the biggest premium from the lender.
What makes Robinhood notable is that many of the stocks its users invest in are among the most sought-after by people who want to bet against them, said one senior financial executive involved with hedge funds.
It was unclear how great a benefit the securities lending was to Robinhood's revenue and income, which it does not disclose. 
Robinhood declined to comment.
The brokerage does not allow short selling on its platform.  
In January, retail investors coordinated through trading forums on social media in an attempt to punish hedge funds by buying up shares of GameStop and other heavily shorted names, like AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), driving up their prices and forcing short sellers to close out positions at big losses.
On Jan. 28, at the height of the retail trading mania, Robinhood, along with several other brokers, restricted the buying of GameStop and other so-called meme stocks due to a massive spike in collateral requirements needed to clear the trades, angering many of its customers. 
On Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden's pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission promised a thorough review of issues raised by the GameStop saga, as well as other issues related to retail brokers and investors.
The trading restrictions had already sparked congressional hearings, regulatory probes and placed greater scrutiny on short selling.
In response, Vlad Tenev, Robinhood's chief executive officer, called for shorter stock settlement times, which would reduce clearing collateral requirements. 
He also said the idea that more shares of a stock can be shorted than there are available to trade, as was the case with GameStop, is a ""pathology"" that could destabilize the financial markets. 
Robinhood positioned itself for growth in securities lending in October 2018 by launching its own clearing broker, which acts as a go-between with the clearinghouse that settles its trades, and allows it to hold its customers' assets. The broker can then lend out securities its customers buy on margin. 

At present, less than 3% of Robinhood's funded accounts are margin-enabled, Tenev recently told Congress.

Investing.com - Shares of  Lyft  surged in after-hours trading on Tuesday after upgrading its outlook on performance, citing a return to stronger rideshare demand sooner than expected.
LYFT (NASDAQ:LYFT) was up more than 2% on the news.  
The adjusted EBITDA loss in the first quarter of 2021 was expected to be $135 million, an improvement from the prior outlook of between $145 million and $150 million. The company attributed the improvement in its outlook for reduced operating expenses and to the contribution of margin, which is expected to be at the top end of the previously provided range.
In February, average daily rideshare rides increased 4.0% month-over-month relative to the average daily rideshare ride volume in January 2021. Rideshare ride volume during the week ending February 28th reached a new record level for 2021 and was the company’s best week since March 2020.
Looking ahead, the company expects rideshare ride volume beginning the week ending March 21, 2021, to show positive year-on-year growth. ""This growth trend is expected to continue through the duration of 2021 barring a significant worsening of COVID-19 conditions,"" it added."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Many Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc hourly workers will collect bigger paychecks on the U.S. east and west coast markets where the cost of living is higher and competition for labor among retailers is more intense, the company told Reuters on Tuesday.
The world’s biggest retailer also said it has seen a slight increase in job applications for digital and stocking roles, mostly internally. “(This) tells us that we're becoming more competitive for this type of work,” said Drew Holler, Walmart’s head of people operations.
Walmart said last month that it plans to raise average pay for U.S. hourly workers to at least $15.25 an hour, focusing on digital fulfillment and stocking workers who will receive a starting wage of $13-$19 an hour from March 13, as America’s biggest private employer looks to retain labor to support its fast-growing online business.
“Not everywhere in the nation is the same from a pay perspective ... Where we’re competitive is on the coast,” Holler said. “In the middle of the country, to be competitive, it’s a little bit different.”
The “majority” of Walmart’s digital and stocking workers on the east and west coast will be paid a minimum of between $15 and $19 an hour, depending on their role, he said. The company previously said it is raising wages for 425,000 U.S. stocking and digital workers, who fulfill local online and curbside pick-up orders.
A nationwide movement to increase the minimum wage has gathered new momentum with President Biden reiterating his support for a base wage hike. 
Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) said last week that it is raising the minimum wage for its hourly staff to $16. 
Walmart is often criticized for paying less than rivals including Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Kroger (NYSE:KR) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT), which pay workers at least $15 an hour nationwide. Walmart has also taken heat for years because thousands of its workers are under the poverty line.
When asked to comment on its critics, Walmart said some of its workers make as much as $30 an hour, and that its competitive edge is in benefits like training, academic opportunities, and medical and dental insurance. The company has 1.5 million associates in the United States.
Drew Board, an online pick-up worker who lives 45 minutes from Charlotte, North Carolina, received a raise and will get $1 more than the $13.15 an hour he is currently paid.

“If I was in another position, Walmart would be less attractive to me, considering that Target and Amazon are already paying $15 an hour,” said Board, 23, who drives nearly an hour each day to a Walmart Supercenter in  Albemarle  (NYSE:ALB), North Carolina, from Salisbury. An hour in the other direction is an Amazon Sort Center that has, in the past, lured Board’s colleagues away from Walmart.

(Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower on Tuesday, pulled down by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), while materials stocks climbed as investors waited for the U.S. Congress to approve another stimulus package.
Following strong gains in the prior session, technology shares dipped in the resumption of a rotation by investors out of stocks that outperformed due to the coronavirus pandemic and into others viewed as likely to do well as the economy recovers. The S&P 500 materials and consumer staples sector indexes rose. 
Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bonds have stabilized after hitting a one-year high last week.
""Part of it is just because technology went up so much last year, and if interest rates are on the rise then the value of their future cash flows is diminished,"" said Tom Hainlin, global investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. 
The S&P 500 on Monday logged its best day since June as markets cheered approval of a third COVID-19 vaccine in the United States and the U.S. House of Representatives' green light for a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.
The U.S. Senate will start debating President Joe Biden's relief bill this week when Democrats aim to pass the legislation through a maneuver known as ""reconciliation,"" which would allow the bill to pass with a simple majority.
Apple dipped and Tesla declined, with the two companies contributing the most to the S&P 500's loss for the day. 
The S&P 500 technology sector index dropped, extending a pullback from late last month after a selloff in the U.S. bond market sparked fears over highly valued stocks.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.46% to end at 31,390.47 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.81% to 3,870.36. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.69% to 13,358.79. 
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies declined, trimming its gain in 2021 to about 14%, compared with the S&P 500's rise of under 4% in the same period. 
Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) rose after it posted holiday-quarter results beyond market expectations on a boost in online sales and as the company reined in costs.

TV ratings provider Nielsen jumped after it sold its advanced video advertising business to television streaming platform provider  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU). Shares of Roku dropped.

Merck & Co Inc will help make rival Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s single-shot COVID-19 vaccine in a partnership set to be announced on Tuesday by U.S. President Joe Biden, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.
J&J's vaccine production has been slower than promised, and the Biden administration pushed the deal to try to improve output.
""As soon as we learned about the fact that Johnson and Johnson was behind in the manufacturing steps and efforts, we took steps to ensure we can expedite that and partner them with one of the world's biggest manufacturers,"" Psaki told a White House briefing.
Psaki said the U.S. government will invoke the Defense Production Act in order to equip Merck's plants to be able to produce the J&J vaccine.
She said Biden should provide more detail later on Tuesday. He is scheduled to speak on COVID-19 at 4:15 p.m. (2115 GMT)
More doses sooner could speed the U.S. vaccination effort considerably, because as a one-dose vaccine it is possible to inoculate twice as many people with the same number of shots. The other two U.S.-approved vaccines - from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc - require two doses. 
Under its contract, J&J was supposed to deliver 12 million doses by the end of February, but had less than 4 million ready to ship when the vaccine was authorized on Saturday.
It expects to be able to deliver another 16 million doses by the end of the month - still well short of its previous commitments - but will not ship any next week. The company has said it will be able to provide the full 100 million doses it has agreed to supply by its original midyear deadline.
The next shipments are waiting on regulatory approval of new manufacturing operations run by its partner, contract drugmaker Catalent (NYSE:CTLT) Inc, J&J Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels said in an interview on Monday. 
J&J did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Merck arrangement. 
Merck's collaboration with J&J comes after Merck scrapped development of its own COVID-19 vaccine candidates in January, Merck last month said it was working on a deal to open up its manufacturing capacity to other vaccine makers. 
The partnership is the latest example of large drugmakers working together to help produce COVID-19 vaccines to meet the global demand. 

Swiss drugmaker Novartis signed an agreement in January to fill vials for Pfizer and BioNTech's shot, while French drugmaker  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) SA will help fill and pack millions of doses of Pfizer's vaccine starting in July.
Merck will dedicate two U.S. facilities to J&J's vaccine, according to a report in the Washington Post, which first reported the news of the arrangement on Tuesday. (https://wapo.st/304E8ZQ)
""Merck remains steadfast in our commitment to contribute to the global response to the pandemic,"" the company said.

1629,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 01:46PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Venezuelan intelligence monitored Citgo executives in U.S. - court testimony,"By Luc Cohen and Brian Ellsworth
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan intelligence services monitored six U.S.-based executives of state-owned refiner Citgo Petroleum for a year on U.S. soil to determine their involvement in a deal the government deemed fraudulent, leading to their 2017 arrest in Caracas on corruption charges, according to court testimony.
The executives, known as the Citgo Six, were sentenced by a Venezuelan court in November to between eight and 13 years in prison for corruption in a procedure the U.S. State Department labeled a ""kangaroo court"". Five of the men are naturalized U.S. citizens.
The trial documents reviewed by Reuters include testimony provided by a senior Venezuelan military official, Ramon Balza, about the monitoring. The testimony has not been previously reported.
Balza, who was serving in 2017 as director of operations for Venezuela's military counter-intelligence directorate (DGCIM), said intelligence services sent information collected over the course of a year to Public Prosecutor Tarek William Saab, whose office used it to open a criminal investigation.
Reuters was unable to contact Balza. The DGCIM did not respond to a request for comment.
Saab's office and Venezuela's information ministry also declined to respond to questions from Reuters.
""Ever since that company (Citgo) became Venezuelan, the company and its board members have been monitored by this country's intelligence services,"" Balza said in Aug. 11 testimony at a Caracas appeals court.
Balza, who conducted the arrests, signed a criminal investigation report entered into evidence at the trial and reviewed by Reuters. The document stated the six men signed a July 2017 refinancing contract by Citgo that prosecutors alleged was unfavorable to Venezuela's interests.
When asked by a defense attorney for one of the men how he obtained the information, Balza said intelligence services had ""telephony"" and ""things that follow these people"", without providing specific details.
""That is how intelligence agencies function,"" he said. ""Everyone knows that and every country does it.""
The United States brands Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro a dictator and has imposed sanctions on state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). It has also indicted senior Venezuelan officials on charges of corruption and drug trafficking.
In December, it imposed sanctions on the judge and prosecutor in the Citgo case, saying that media and rights groups were denied access to the trials.
Benjamin Gedan, deputy director of the Wilson Center's Latin America program and a former South America director at the White House National Security Council, said any violation of U.S. laws by Venezuelan intelligence services could provide an opportunity for Washington to ""crack down.""
""If they're violating U.S. laws then they're justifiably at risk of U.S. prosecution and we're always looking for excuses to investigate members of this regime,"" Gedan said.
U.S. federal law prohibits wiretapping of telephone calls without a warrant and requires any non-diplomatic foreign agents to register with the Department of Justice, according to Steven Cash, counsel at the Day Pitney law firm and a former prosecutor.
""If they were intercepting and wiretapping in the United States, that would be a crime,"" Cash said.
It was not clear from the testimony if Venezuelan intelligence services violated either of those laws. The Department of Justice declined to comment on whether the monitoring would trigger any action.
U.S. intelligence services also routinely gather ""human intelligence"" on countries where the United States has strategic interests, four former CIA officers told Reuters https://reut.rs/2OcdhIA in a 2019 story. [https://reut.rs/2OcdhIA]
The trial documents show that defense attorneys repeatedly said the prosecution presented no evidence linking the Citgo executives - Jose Pereira, Jose Luis Zambrano, Alirio Jose Zambrano, Jorge Toledo, Tomeu Vadell and Gustavo Cardenas -to the refinancing transaction.
""Once we heard (Balza) confessed what they did, we requested a mistrial and a criminal investigation against those responsible,"" a defense attorney for Vadell said in a statement, referring to both the intelligence services' monitoring and testimony by Balza that the men were arrested before a warrant was issued by a court, potentially violating their right to due process.
Defense attorneys for the other detainees declined to comment.
'POLITICAL CURRENCY'
The men are widely viewed by U.S. analysts and U.S. officials as potential bargaining chips for Venezuela to extract concessions from the United States. Last month, Maduro alleged the men were CIA agents, without providing evidence, and excluded the possibility of their release as a concession to the administration of President Joe Biden.
""Maduro's latest allegation is nothing but a callous attempt to leverage the lives of American citizens as political currency,"" a State Department spokesperson said at the time.
In the testimony, Balza and Rafael Franco - who in 2017 served as the DGCIM's special director for criminal investigations - said military counterintelligence detained the Citgo Six on orders from prosecutors even though the DGCIM was not in physical possession of a warrant.
However, Balza and Franco gave divergent testimony on the crucial question of whether a judge had approved a warrant before the men were arrested – without which the detentions potentially would have been illegal.
Balza said prosecutors requested an arrest warrant from a judge after the group was detained. Franco testified that the prosecutor who instructed him to detain the men said a judge had issued an arrest warrant already, even though the DGCIM had not yet received it.
Franco was the DGCIM official responsible for liaising with the judicial system but did not carry out the arrests himself.
Reuters was unable to reach Franco for comment.
In his testimony, Balza said the DGCIM believed the six men were due to fly out of Venezuela that afternoon.
""What we did was detain them preventatively, without it rising to the level of illegal detention,"" Balza said in his testimony.
Magaly Vasquez, a Venezuelan criminal procedure expert at Andres Bello Catholic University, said Venezuelan law would allow officers to detain suspects on orders from prosecutors in cases of ""exceptional need and urgency"" if an arrest warrant already exists, and the prosecutor informed officers of the warrant.
Detaining suspects before such a warrant exists would be illegal, she said.

Washington imposed sanctions on Franco in July 2019 for alleged involvement in the torture and death of Venezuelan Navy Captain Rafael Acosta Arevalo.

(Reuters) -  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) will invest $4 billion annually over the next several years as the big box retailer upgrades stores and strengthens its online business, hoping to cement gains made during the pandemic that led to blowout holiday quarter results.
Shares, up 80% for the year before Tuesday's announcement, fell as much as 6.8% on the expected hit to margins.
Target's push over the last year to use its retail outlets as fulfillment centers for online orders has drastically cut delivery times and enabled it to swipe market share from smaller rivals who rely more on their store traffic.
Sales through the company's same-day deliveries and store pick-up services more than tripled, while total revenue rose 21.1% to $28.34 billion in the quarter.
""We're in a position to play offense and lean into the opportunity to build on last year's momentum,"" Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke said. 
The company expects to remodel 150 stores in time for the holiday season to cater to same-day fulfillment, as it seeks to better compete with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.
Walmart, another retail winner of the health crisis, in February forecast higher investments this year in areas like supply chain and automation.
Target estimated the investments to cause this year's operating margin rate to fall below the 7% recorded in 2020 but remain above 6%.
The company said it plans to launch 30 to 40 stores each year, compared with 30 in 2020, with new small format outlets in New York City, Los Angeles and Portland. 
While Target refrained from providing sales and earnings forecasts for fiscal 2021, it expects to benefit from new stimulus money but unsure by how much. 

Comparable sales rose 20.5% in the fourth quarter, comfortably beating estimates for a 16.4% rise, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

1631,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 01:30PM ET</span>",Exclusive: French bankers seek EU law to move euro clearing from London - sources,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - France's banking industry body wants a new European Union law that would force non-EU banks to shift swathes of euro derivatives clearing from the City of London to Frankfurt, people familiar with the matter said.
Since Britain fully left the European Union in December the City of London finance industry has lost access to its biggest market and trading in euro shares and swaps have moved to the EU. Brussels is now targeting euro clearing and last week began a fact-finding mission by meeting with banks.
Sources told Reuters that the French Banking Federation (FBF) does not believe it would work if non-EU banks were asked voluntarily to move trillions of euros in interest rate swaps positions from the  London Stock Exchange 's (L:LSE) LCH clearing arm to the bloc.
The FBF had no immediate response.
LCH clears around 90% all euro swaps, but only a quarter of the 83 trillion euros total are held by EU counterparties.
The FBF believes that forcing relocation of just this EU portion would undermine efforts to deepen EU capital markets, the sources said.
Existing EU legislation only gives the bloc's regulators a say over the swaps positions held by EU counterparties.
The FBF wants a new EU law to make possible ""forced relocation"" of euro clearing by non-EU banks, the sources added.
Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, which regulates LCH, said last week he would resist ""very firmly"" any attempt to force non-EU banks to relocate clearing from London to the bloc. 
The French industry body also wants a ""roadmap"" combining such new legislation and other steps to relocate euro clearing by force, the sources said. This would be aligned with efforts by Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn)'s Eurex clearing arm in Frankfurt to broaden its service.
The FBF has suggested a phased approach to relocation, starting with short-term interest rate swaps, the sources said.
The FBF believes that markets would need at least a year to implement a roadmap before the end of LCH's ""recognition"" or permission to continue clearing for EU customers.

LCH currently has permission from Brussels to clear EU clients on a temporary basis until June 2022, but the LSE has said it is hoping to obtain long-term access.

1633,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 01:20PM ET</span>",U.S. budget airlines plot pandemic breakthrough,"By Tracy Rucinski
PALM COAST, Fla. (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the global travel landscape and U.S. no-frills carriers are pouncing.
As legacy airlines shrink to contain costs, budget carriers  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE), Allegiant Travel and privately-owned Frontier Airlines are resuming pilot hiring and expanding networks to seize turf dominated by larger rivals.
The three airlines' combined U.S. market share, which barely topped 10% before the pandemic, could grow by 10 percentage points this year alone, said René Armas Maes of UK-based consultancy MIDAS Aviation.
""Ultra low-cost carriers want to attack head-to-head; they believe they're in a better position to rebuild travel demand,"" he said.
Las Vegas-based Allegiant has told prospective pilots whose hiring was halted as the pandemic unfolded: ""We have recalled all of our furloughed pilots and are now planning for exciting growth opportunities.""
Spirit and Frontier have posted pilot job ads and are taking delivery of Airbus A320neo jets that could open longer routes, including coast-to-coast flying traditionally controlled by legacy, or full-service, carriers.
By contrast, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) has gone from hiring 100 pilots a month before the pandemic to threatening 1,850 furloughs without fresh government assistance on labor costs.
Allegiant also stands to benefit if Congress approves a third round of COVID-19 payroll relief for U.S. airlines, but ""would be just fine without it,"" Chief Financial Officer Greg Anderson told Reuters.
""The leading indicators suggest that there is a nice growth trajectory for Allegiant,"" said Anderson, citing Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) searches, indices that track changes in city populations and infection and vaccination trends from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.
He said customer surveys also show an increased preference for smaller airports and non-stop flights, cornerstones of budget carriers' business models.
TRIAL AND ERROR
Ultra low-cost carriers, or ULCCs, offer a no-frills experience at rock-bottom fares and charge heavily for extras like bags. They wage fare wars and are pervasive in Europe's fragmented market but have lagged in the United States.
ULCCs are a tier below carriers like Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), which pioneered the low-cost concept in the 1970s and has grown to become the leading domestic airline. It provides free beverages and checked bags but keeps costs low in part by flying a single fleet-type of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737s.
U.S. mainline legacy carriers American, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines have diverse fleets that include expensive wide-body jets geared for the kind of business and international travel that has suffered most in the pandemic. 
American's unit costs excluding fuel, a key metric of efficiency, were $0.18 per available mile in 2020, more than double that of budget rivals like Allegiant, according to data compiled by financial services firm Raymond James.
This means Allegiant, which primarily uses second-hand planes and only flies on peak travel days like weekends, can more easily profit on discount fares. 
And whereas legacy carriers use a hub-and-spoke network that shuttles people through costly big-city airports, the ULCC business model is based on point-to-point travel to smaller airports where they outsource much of their infrastructure.
Allegiant's fixed costs account for just around a quarter of its total.
That flexibility helps budget carriers open new routes on a trial-and-error basis. During the pandemic, for example, they have pivoted toward beach and mountain destinations. 
""Then if the route is not performing, they won't hesitate to shut it down,"" said George Dimitroff of consultants Ascend by Cirium.
But there are risks.
American, United and Delta have also shifted flights during the pandemic to pick up leisure demand and their market power and geographical reach remain formidable.
Competing with them can lure upstart airlines into relaxing cost discipline - a move described as a ""path to hell"" by budget airlines entrepreneur Bill Franke, who championed the ULCC model.
Together the three large airlines control around 60% of domestic travel and could chase away rivals on smaller routes if they choose, industry critics said.
But they are more burdened by debt than the ULCCs and continue to burn through millions of dollars every day, hampering their ability to grow, the critics said.
BUDGET SHIFT
Budget airlines with low debt are also using the crisis to snap up bargains on used planes hitting the market from bankruptcies abroad, traders said, allowing them to extend their cost advantage.
Allegiant, with an average fleet age of 14 years, is eyeing deals on aircraft between eight and 12 years-old, Anderson said, noting: ""Prices are well-discounted off pre-COVID.""
Beyond low fares, experts said the pandemic has given budget carriers a fresh argument for previously wary customers.
Traditional airline perks like catering services have lost their luster in an era of masks, and budget airplanes feature the same hospital-grade aircraft filtration systems as others.
And they could benefit from more cost-conscious small and medium sized businesses changing travel policies to favor lower-cost airlines, albeit constrained by their more limited flying through large hubs.
""More price-sensitive travel will be the new normal for the next couple of years at least,"" Armas Maes said.
Even so, today's outsiders will face a competitive cycle.

After the last downturn, low-cost carrier JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) grabbed market share from American on the U.S. east coast. Now it is grappling with competition from ULCCs and is teaming up with its old rival.

1636,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 12:45PM ET</span>",Loeb's Third Point hires Goldman research analyst Heath Terry,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb has hired a prominent tech research analyst from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to reinforce the team that handles venture investments at his Third Point (NYSE:SPNT) LLC hedge fund, sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
Heath Terry, the technology, media & telecom business unit leader for Global Investment Research at Goldman, will join as a managing director at Third Point Ventures working from the firm's New York offices. He worked at Goldman for nearly a decade.
Terry did not respond to a request for comment.
Loeb announced the hire on a call with his colleagues just hours after Third Point completed the first round of fund raising for its first-ever dedicated venture capital fund.
Third Point, which oversees $16 billion, has invested in start-ups for decades but this is the first time the firm, known for activist campaigns at companies ranging from Nestle to Yahoo, has raised a standalone venture fund. 
It had hoped to raise $300 million for the new fund and is expected to exceed the target at its first close, a source said. 
Terry will report to Loeb and work with Robert Schwartz, who has spearheaded venture investments at Third Point Ventures since 2000.
While Third Point has rarely mentioned the business, Loeb recently began highlighting the team's contributions to the firm's overall success.
""Today, we are ideally situated with a purview of both public and private markets, a long track record, a strong reputation in helping build businesses, and the rationalization of valuations in the private space,"" Loeb wrote to his investors about the venture business late in 2020.
Since 2015, Third Point's venture investments have ""generated returns that place us in the top decile of 2015 venture funds,"" Loeb wrote.
He pointed to investments in online lending market place Upstart and cybersecurity startup SentinelOne, where Schwartz sits on the boards, as examples of the team's work. 
Looking ahead, Loeb said in the same letter that even though there may be some later stage investments, the bulk of the team's work will concentrate on Series B expansion stage opportunities in building a venture into a company and sitting on its board.
While venture investing has long been part of the DNA at investment firms Tiger Global and Coatue Management, some hedge fund clients have objected to the long lock-ups and preferred their managers to focus on public company investments.
That reluctance may now be ebbing, giving managers like Loeb an opportunity to dig deeper into the sector to create new sources of return.

Third Point's Third Point Offshore Fund finished 2020 up 20.6%, its best return since 2013, when it gained 26%. In the first two months of 2021, it gained 4.1%.

1638,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 11:55AM ET</span>","Analysis: U.S. bond derivatives signal calm, but economic fundamentals could spur more sell-offs","By Kate Duguid and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - After a sharp sell-off last week, U.S. Treasuries have stabilized with bond market indicators and derivatives positioning pointing to near-term calm, but an improving economy could trigger another slide in their prices. 
The benchmark U.S. Treasury yield hit a one-year high of 1.614% on Thursday in what investors called a ""tantrum without the taper,"" as the market sold off on expectations that an economic rebound would force the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary conditions sooner than anticipated. Yields have since retreated. 
While yields could spike again, analysts and investors pointed to moves in inflation breakevens, swap spreads and put options on Treasury debt exchange-traded funds as evidence of temporary calm. 
""The selloff may have run its course,"" said Jabaz Mathai, head of U.S. rates strategy at Citi, pointing to inflation breakevens backing down. The decline in breakevens, as well as tightening swap spreads, are the strongest signals yet that U.S. Treasury yields have peaked, said Mathai.
""I would not say the bear market in Treasuries is over at this point, but there is the prospect of a near-term pullback,"" said Mathai. ""You should see some stability in the 10-year around these levels."" 
The U.S. 10-year inflation breakeven rate, the implied inflation rate at which an investor would break even buying either an inflation-adjusted 10-year note or a traditional 10-year Treasury note, declined to 2.16% on Monday, from 2.24% in mid-February.
The peak in Treasury yields is also evident in narrower U.S. swap spreads, a barometer of hedging activity against rate rises. 
The spread on 10-year U.S. interest rate swaps over Treasuries fell to 7.5 basis points on Monday, from 9.75 basis points, the 11-month high hit last week. 
""If swap spreads continue to roll over, that would suggest that hedging against higher rates may have peaked and another indication that rates would be stabilizing from here,"" said Mathai.
Graphic: U.S. swap spreads - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkplzywmpb/US%20swap%20spreads.png
Meanwhile, the trading volume of put options in BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NASDAQ:TLT) Exchange-Traded Fund, which investors use to bet on Treasury prices, had fallen by nearly 80% on Monday from last week's highs.
The decline in the trading volume of put options - which increase in value when prices fall - suggests some investors believe the bearish trend is over for now, said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group. 
""When you see that record put volume, sometimes that can be a sign of capitulation,"" he said. ""Particularly if a lot of it is investors closing puts, which is what we think was happening on Thursday.""
The implied price volatility on TLT has fallen since peaking on Thursday, another indication investors are expecting a calmer market. 
Still, there is continued evidence of data showing inflation and other aspects of the economy are on the rise, bolstering the case that upward pressure on yields could persist. Manufacturing data reported Monday showed the strongest growth in three years. The data also showed that prices paid by manufacturers were the highest since July 2008.
Signs of stress also remain, implying more episodes of turmoil - or ""tantrums"" as they have become known - lie in wait over coming months.
But some investors maintain that higher yields don't necessarily create problems for the Fed if markets don't panic in response.
""(The Fed) knew they were going to be dovish while at the same time we were getting better news,"" said Ritchie Tuazon, fixed income portfolio manager at Capital Group.
Investors will be closely watching remarks from Fed Chair Powell on Thursday at the Wall Street Journal's Jobs Summit, his last scheduled public speech before the FOMC's policy meeting on March 16-17. 
Harley Bassman, managing partner at Simplify Asset Management, expects yields to rise slowly, with the 10-year yield moving as high as 4% within the next three to four years.

""Over the near term, I do think there is a big congestion between 1.5% and 2%. We spent six months at this level between mid- to end-2019.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. oil production will likely see ""very little growth"" in the future after remaining largely flat in 2021 at around 11 million barrels a day, Scott Sheffield,  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) Co chief executive officer, said at a conference on Tuesday. 
The coronavirus health crisis slashed global fuel demand and sent oil prices plummeting last year before economic stimulus measures and COVID-19 vaccine rollouts helped the industry regain footing in recent months.
Still, U.S. shale oil production is lower than pre-pandemic levels and Sheffield and other industry experts said during CERAWeek by IHS Markit that it was unlikely to recover to its peak more than 13 million barrels per day.
""I see U.S. production flattish this year at around 11 million barrels a day with very little growth in the future,"" Sheffield said.
The decline in oil comes as public policy, investors and energy companies increasingly focus on producing clean energy to fight the effects of climate change. 

Sheffield said Irving, Texas-based Pioneer was working to electrify its fracking fleet to help reduce emissions in its oil production.

1640,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 11:11AM ET</span>",How private equity squeezes cash from the dying U.S. coal industry,"By Tim McLaughlin
BOSTON (Reuters) - Private equity firms are proving there’s still plenty of profit in the U.S. coal industry despite a decade of falling demand for the fossil fuel. They are spending billions of dollars buying coal-fired plants on the cheap - and getting paid even when they are not providing power.
Since the end of 2014, at least five U.S. private equity firms have bought coal plants in markets where regulators pay them to be on standby to provide emergency power when demand surges with extreme hot or cold weather, according to a Reuters review of U.S. regulatory disclosures and credit-rating agency reports.
The lucrative investments illustrate how fossil fuels will remain an important part of the energy mix - and continue spinning off cash for investors - even years after demand for them peaks as the world transitions toward cleaner energy sources.
The need for reserve power was on display during the utility crisis this month in Texas - the only U.S. grid system that operates without such an emergency system. A cold snap knocked out several of the state’s generating plants and triggered widespread blackouts, leaving a wake of human suffering including several dozen deaths.
The so-called capacity payments are given out in most U.S. power markets, and regulators tend to favor coal-fired generators that store heaps of coal on site when other power sources might be disrupted. In the Pennsylvania, Jersey, Maryland Power Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) (PJM), which has the largest standby market, capacity revenue payments average more than $100 per megawatt per day - an insurance policy that costs about $9 billion a year and aims to make sure the grid’s 65 million customers avoid blackouts during heat waves and Arctic blasts.
“The capacity power market is a certain source of revenue for coal plants that might otherwise be uneconomical,” said Sylvia Bialek, an economist at New York University’s Institute for Policy Integrity.
The administration of former President Donald Trump, a Republican, encouraged capacity market incentives for coal-fired generators. But President Joe Biden, a Democrat, is likely to change those policies in the coming years as part of an effort to slash nearly all of the U.S. power sector’s reliance on fossil fuels by 2035.
In the meantime, private equity firms are in a good position to compete for capacity payments because traditional utilities are under pressure from activist shareholders to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to limit debt.
The private equity owners of Ohio’s Gavin Power Plant in the PJM grid, for example, have squeezed hundreds of millions of dollars out of the facility since buying it four years ago, even though it only runs about 60% of the time.
Lightstone Generation LLC - a joint venture between Boston’s ArcLight Capital Partners LLC and New York-based Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc - took on $2.1 billion in debt from Wall Street banks to buy the plant and three much smaller gas-fired units from  American Electric  Power Company Inc (NASDAQ:AEP) in 2017, according to term sheets viewed by Reuters.
From 2018 to 2020, Lightstone’s power plant operations produced about $1.1 billion in operating profit, according to estimates from Moody’s Investors Service. Up to 50% of Gavin’s cash flow comes from being on standby for emergency power, according to several economists and credit analysts.
About 18 months after the Gavin acquisition, ArcLight and Blackstone went back to Wall Street to finance most of a $375 million special dividend they paid to themselves, according to credit rating agencies. Such dividends are a way for private equity firms to lock in profits and shift risk to their debt-holders, which are often mutual funds. If the business does well, the debt gets paid off at a premium. But if the business fails, the debt-holders end up with equity stakes in plants of declining value.
ArcLight did not respond to requests for comment. Blackstone declined to comment.
The private equity firms' backers have also been making money on the investments, according to filings. The state of Connecticut’s retirement plan, for example, invested $85 million in ArcLight’s Energy Partners Fund VI, which holds stakes in the Gavin plant along with other energy investments, and has seen returns of about 8%.
Meanwhile, mutual funds that invested in Lightstone's debt are receiving payments pegged to a floating interest rate that has ranged from 4% to 6% - far higher than about 1.4% on the U.S. benchmark 10-year yield.
‘ABSOLUTELY VITAL’
Other private equity firms have also been betting on coal power capacity payments.
Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Holdings, for example, led a joint venture to buy New Hampshire’s Merrimack Station coal plant in 2018, the centerpiece of a $175 million acquisition of generators from New England-based utility Eversource Energy (NYSE:ES).
Atlas declined to comment.
The coal plant hardly runs but has been eligible to receive up to $188 million in capacity payments from the New England ISO between 2018 and 2023, according to disclosures by regulators. Workers at Merrimack Station see their mission as a matter of life and death. They keep boilers warm and the plant in a constant state of readiness, said Tony Sapienza, business manager for Local 1837 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical workers.
""The capacity market is absolutely vital,"" Sapienza said. ""And without Merrimack Station, people might die in the winter or during really hot weather. It's really that simple.""
The reserve coal plants create good jobs. Private-equity owned coal plants can pay their staff about $100,000 a year for keeping the facilities on standby and firing them up when needed, according to Shawn Steffee, business agent for the Boilermakers Local 154 union in Pennsylvania. He said coal plants in the state ""ran like a freight train"" during the recent cold snap.
In another profitable investment, private equity firm Riverstone Holdings LLC paid $1.8 billion in late 2016 to buy the remaining stake in electricity producer Talen Energy Corp. The take-private deal included stakes in several coal plants, including ones receiving PJM capacity payments, an “important component” of gross profits, according to an SEC disclosure. About a year later, Talen paid its owners, including Riverstone, a special $500 million dividend. Riverstone did not return messages seeking comment.
WITH REWARD COMES RISK
Private equity ventures into coal-fired power don’t always turn out well, with some deals getting caught up in the broader decline of the coal industry. A credit fund run by private equity firm KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc in 2015, for example, took a big stake in Longview Power LLC - whose major asset is a West Virginia coal plant plugged into the PJM electric grid - as part of a bankruptcy restructuring.
But in April 2020, Longview filed for bankruptcy protection again, wiping out some $350 million in debt, as coronavirus lockdowns cut electricity demand. KKR declined to comment.
Analysts and economists expect Biden’s administration to crack down on rules that prolong the lifespan of dirty coal plants as part of sweeping measures to fight climate change. Biden has named Richard Glick, a Democrat, as the new chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Under a Republican majority on the commission, Glick had been critical of FERC rules he contends unfairly favor coal over renewable energy sources in capacity power markets, saying they ""would have made the Kremlin economists in the old Soviet Union blush.”
FERC did not respond to requests for comment, and the White House declined to comment.
“I’m confident, in the next couple of years, FERC will order changes,” said Ari Peskoe, director of the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard Law School.
Policy changes could make it harder for highly-leveraged private equity owners of coal plants, like Lightstone, to refinance their debts, according to Richard Donner, a credit analyst at Moody’s Investors Service. About $1.7 billion in the company’s debt comes due in 2024.
Even so, Lightstone’s creditors are the ones with the greatest risk, according to Peskoe. 

“Somehow the private equity guys always make out OK,” Peskoe said. “It’s everyone else who doesn’t.”

(Reuters) - Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) posted holiday-quarter profit and sales beyond market expectations on Tuesday, as it reined in costs and Americans loaded their online shopping carts with not just essentials but also leisure goods.
As consumers bought everything from leggings and sweatshirts to kitchen electrics, the company's digital sales surged to account for 42% of net sales in the fourth quarter.
The COVID-19 pandemic has hobbled many non-essential retailers including JCPenney and Stein Mart Inc, but Kohl's has managed to survive it by doubling down on its online business. 
It has also entered into partnerships with PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH)'s Calvin Klein and LVMH-owned beauty chain Sephora to attract younger crowds to its stores.
Kohl's is also betting on the rise in demand for activewears such as running shoes and workout clothes as more people turn to health and wellness during the pandemic. 
The company is planning to increase the space for such products in its outlets by adding brands such as Eddie Bauer and expanding those offered from HanesBrands Inc's Champion.
""We see this as really instrumental to driving overall top line given the productivity of those categories especially in our stores,"" Chief Executive Michelle Gass said on an earnings call.
Overall net sales declined 10% to $5.88 billion in the quarter, but was above expectations of $5.86 billion.
Costs fell 8%, helping Kohl's earn $1.07 per share on an adjusted basis, above $1.01 expected by analysts.
In 2021, the mid-priced chain expects to earn between $2.45 to $2.95 per share and net sales growth of mid-teens percentage range, both largely in line with Wall Street estimates.
However, some analysts were skeptical about the forecast.
""Kohl's and other department stores have a history of over-promising and under-delivering. The forecast Kohl's provided today is overly optimistic,"" CFRA Research analyst Camilla Yanushevsky said.

The company said it would buy back shares worth between $200 million and $300 million.

Investing.com -- Cruise lines stocks are looking attractive according to Macquarie analysts, who upgraded the sector to outperform from neutral, citing positive catalysts.
With Covid cases dropping and vaccinations on the rise, the worst of the pandemic could be in the rear view mirror for cruise operators, wrote analyst Paul Golding. Cruises have been sidelined during the pandemic, but government restrictions could start lifting in the coming months.

It has ""the most ships slated for sailings by this date relative to fleet size, but the latest avg. initial start date based on our proprietary itinerary dataset,"" the note said. Golding rates it outperform and raised his price target to $40 from $18.

Wolfram's appointment comes as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen increases the department's focus on fighting climate change, a shift that includes the addition of another high-level climate ""czar"" position.
Wolfram, an expert in climate and energy economics, has done research on energy efficiency investments in the United States and the electricity sectors in Kenya, Ghana and India.
The Treasury said it also named Jose Murillo as deputy assistant secretary for international tax affairs as the department seeks to re-engage with an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development effort to reach a new global agreement on taxing multinational companies and digital services.
Murillo served in the Treasury's Office of Tax Policy during the Bush-Cheney and Obama-Biden administrations and for the past 11 years has been a partner at Ernst & Young.
Neil Mehrotra, a Federal Reserve Bank of New York economist, was named Treasury deputy assistant secretary for macroeconomics in the Office of Economic Policy.

The Treasury said William Fields, a senior associate at Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Sidewalk Labs urban innovation firm, will return to the department as a senior adviser to Yellen.

AIB, one of two dominant banks in the concentrated Irish market, said in December it was in talks with a number of parties to plug gaps in life, savings and wealth products and expected to finalise the transactions in 2021.
AIB said it acquired the entire share capital of the firm for an enterprise value of 82 million euros alongside around 56 million euros excess cash on Goodbody's balance sheet.
The bank sold Goodbody, a leading Irish provider of wealth management, corporate finance and capital markets services, for around 24 million euros in 2011 when it had to be rescued by the state, which still holds a 71% stake in the lender.
Irish financial services firm FEXCO owned a 51% stake in Goodbody, with the remainder held by the stockbroker's staff and management.
AIB, which last month struck a deal with NatWest to buy around 4 billion euros of corporate and commercial loans as the British lender exits the market, said on Tuesday it will continue to explore further life and pensions opportunities.
Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said he consented to a request from AIB to allow bonus structures in Goodbody remain in place. The approval is subject to a ringfencing of Goodbody from the rest of the AIB group, which will remain under a state-imposed ban on bankers pay and bonuses, he said.
""It is important to stress that there have been no changes to the government policy in relation to banking remuneration as a result of this transaction,"" Donohoe told a news conference.

LONDON (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks headed for a subdued start on Tuesday as investors paused to gauge if a jump in bond yields had run its course before dipping back into riskier assets.
Among the standouts,  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc jumped about 10% after the company said it expects millions of people to continue using its video-conferencing platforms to work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.
U.S. stock futures were slightly softer.

A warning from China overnight about market bubbles also dampened sentiment, leaving investors to swing risk-on, risk-off across markets in a disjointed way, he said. 
Weaker oil also weighed.
""We are all staring at our navels a little bit and the bond market is firmly in charge. The equity market has to decide whether it has got itself a little too frothy,"" Juckes said.
Investors will scrutinise speeches from U.S. Federal Reserve officials in coming days for messaging on trends in yields, starting with Lael Brainard at 1800 GMT on Tuesday.
U.S. stocks rallied on Monday, with the S&P 500 posting its best day in nearly nine months, as bond markets calmed after a month-long selloff.
A selloff in Treasuries last week pushed the 10-year Treasury yield to a one-year high of 1.614%. The 10-year yield was flat at 1.4462%.

1648,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 10:06AM ET</span>","Betting on death of petrol cars, Volvo to go all electric by 2030","By Nick Carey and Helena Soderpalm
LONDON (Reuters) - Volvo's entire car lineup will be fully electric by 2030, the Chinese-owned company said on Tuesday, joining a growing number of automakers planning to phase out fossil-fuel engines by the end of this decade.
""I am totally convinced there will be no customers who really want to stay with a petrol engine,"" Volvo Chief Executive Håkan Samuelsson told reporters when asked about future demand for electric vehicles. ""We are convinced that an electric car is more attractive for customers.""
The Swedish-based carmaker said 50% of its global sales should be fully-electric cars by 2025 and the other half hybrid models. 
Owned by Hangzhou-based Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, Volvo will launch a new family of electric cars in the next few years, all of which will be sold online only. 
On Tuesday it unveiled the first of those models, the C40, a fully electric SUV, which will have an initial battery range of around 420 kilometres (261 miles).
Volvo will include wireless upgrades and fixes for its new electric models - an approach originally pioneered by electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. This means the C40's range will be extended over time with software upgrades, Chief Technology Officer Henrik Green said.
Carmakers are racing to switch to zero-emission models as they face CO2 emissions targets in Europe and China, plus looming bans in some countries on fossil fuel vehicles. 
Last month, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said its lineup in Europe will be fully electric by 2030, while  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM) unit Jaguar Land Rover said its luxury Jaguar brand will be entirely electric by 2025 and the carmaker will launch electric models of its entire line-up by 2030.
In November, luxury carmaker Bentley, owned by Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), said its models would be all electric by 2030. 
Electrification is expensive for carmakers and as electric vehicles have fewer moving parts, employment in the car industry is expected to shrink.
Volvo CEO Samuelsson said that industry-wide, electrification will mostly affect engine plants and auto suppliers providing everything from oil filters to fuel injectors and spark plugs.
""Those are a lot of jobs of course,"" he said. ""But overall I don't think there will be a big difference.""
Volvo said it will ""radically reduce"" the complexity of its model line-up and provide customers with transparent pricing. 
The carmaker's global network of 2,400 traditional bricks-and-mortar dealers will remain open to service vehicles and to help customers make online orders.
So far Volvo has not been affected by a pandemic-fueled global semiconductor chip shortage that has temporarily shut a number of assembly plants, which Samuelsson said was thanks to constant communication with suppliers. 

""So far, knock on wood, we have not had to stop any assembly line,"" he said. ""But it could happen any day.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened modestly lower on Tuesday, correcting a little after posting their strongest day in three months on Monday.
By 9:55 AM ET (1455 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 39 points, or 0.1%, while the S&P 500 was down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.6%.
The most prominent moves came in technology where  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) stock rose 3.1% after posting quarterly results late on Monday that were much stronger than expected. By contrast, the ADRs of Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) fell over 7% after an update that showed widening losses. 
The market remains broadly supported by the passage of the $1.9 trillion stimulus package through Congress. The bill is being picked up by the Senate shorn of its provisions for a $15 national minimum wage, in order to ensure that it can pass quickly, without the need for support from Republican Senators.
The rotation into cyclical stocks continued, with chemicals giant LyondellBasell  (NYSE:LYB) stock hitting a new three-year high for the third day in a row.
Elsewhere, Hertz Global Holdings (OTC:HTZGQ) stock fell 22% after the company received a $4.2 billion proposal to buy it out of bankruptcy from two private equity groups, Knighthead Capital Management and Certares Management. The proposal, which values the group's equity at $2.3 billion, will need the approval of bondholders to convert $1.9 billion in outstanding claims into equity. The offer is an epilogue to one of the flashes of irrational exuberance shown by retail investors last year, who pushed the stock as $6.25 - five times its current level - as it fell into bankruptcy.
Kohls (NYSE:KSS) stock rose 1.0% after the department store chain said it would restart dividends and buybacks, while  Target  (NYSE:TGT) stock rose 2.6% after after the retail giant beat estimates for holiday quarter sales, powered by the company's same-day delivery and store pick-up services.
Financial stocks picked up again after a wobble in recent days over concerns that Senate Democrats, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, could pressure the Federal Reserve into reversing the relaxation of capital requirements that it allowed in the first phase of the pandemic. Bank investors have feared that the Supplementary Leverage Ratio could be restored as a binding constraint on bank balance sheets, restricting their ability to buy back stock and pay dividends."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a group representing major U.S. passenger airlines and a senior union official will make the case Tuesday to lawmakers for a third round of government assistance, according to testimony seen by Reuters.
Since March 2020, Congress has awarded passenger and cargo airlines, airports and contractors nearly $90 billion in government assistance and low-cost loans, including two prior rounds of payroll assistance for U.S. passenger airlines totaling $40 billion.
The $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package approved by the U.S. House last week includes another $14 billion for passenger airlines to keep workers on payrolls for an additional six months. It awaits action by the U.S. Senate.
Nick Calio, who heads Airlines for America, a trade group representing American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines and others, will tell the House Transportation and Infrastructure's aviation subcommittee that tens of thousands of aviation workers will ""lose their jobs — or experience reductions to wages and benefits — effective April 1.""
Calio's testimony adds that ""funding is an explicit recognition that the industry remains in dire straits, even before factoring in the certainty that it will be inundated with debt for years to come.""
In 2020, U.S. airlines saw passenger traffic fall by 60% to 368 million passengers, the lowest number since 1984 and reported pretax losses of $46 billion. They continue to burn ""an estimated $150 million of cash every day,"" Calio will say.
The current COVID-19 bill also includes $8 billion for airports and concessionaires and $1 billion for airline contractors.
Joseph DePete, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, will tell lawmakers that ""dismal long-term booking commitments and the near absence of business travel demand is leaving some carriers with too little certainty to reactivate and retrain furloughed or otherwise inactive pilots.""

The heads of the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, Congress and the National Business Aviation Association will echo industry calls for steps to spur the production of sustainable aviation fuels with tax incentives.

The company's U.S.-listed shares, up 41% through Monday's close, rose 1.5% in premarket trading on the Nasdaq.
After years of oversupply woes in Canada, cannabis producers are banking on the much larger U.S. market opening up soon as leading Democrats lend support to laws allowing easier banking access, decriminalization of marijuana and other favorable changes.
Canopy President and Chief Product Officer Rade Kovacevic told Reuters that the U.S. market is currently fragmented, presenting an opportunity for a larger company to scale up in the region.
Quatreau comes in four variants and would be available for online sales in U.S. states that permit consumption of cannabidiol (CBD), Canopy said.
A non-psychoactive compound derived mainly from the hemp plant, CBD is being researched for various medical applications and has found increased use as a relaxative.
While 36 U.S. states and four other territories have approved cannabis for medical use, 11 more have passed laws allowing the use of CBD extract, usually in oil form, with minimal or no tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Canopy said Quatreau is now the top-selling CBD beverage in Canada within months of its launch there, as demand for cannabis-infused edibles surged during COVID-19 lockdowns.

1657,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 07:11AM ET</span>","Some U.S. meatpackers announce vaccine plans, but many workers still waiting","By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - COVID-19 vaccines are making their way into the arms of U.S. meat and agriculture workers, but companies and union officials say progress needs to be faster after coronavirus outbreaks idled slaughterhouses and sickened thousands of workers.
Vaccinating food workers could help prevent further production disruptions that sent meat prices soaring in spring 2020 and forced retailers like Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co to restrict customers' purchases of ground beef and other products.
Nationwide, 22,000 meatpacking workers have been infected or exposed to the virus, and 132 have died, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) International union.
A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) committee in December recommended frontline food and agriculture workers receive access to vaccines ahead of people aged 65 to 74 and younger Americans with high-risk medical conditions.
But many states prioritized older residents, who account for the majority of U.S. COVID-19 fatalities, and other essential workers like teachers. 
Companies are constrained by limited supplies and regulations in individual states and cannot purchase vaccines directly from drugmakers. 
""Priorities have shifted in the past two months in a range of states, and that has lowered the priority status of our critical and essential employees,"" said Keira Lombardo, chief administrative officer for Virginia-based Smithfield Foods, the world's biggest pork processor.
South Dakota, where WH Group (OTC:WHGLY)'s Smithfield runs a massive pork plant in Sioux Falls, may not begin vaccinating food and agriculture workers until April, according to state plans. It will first give shots to teachers, funeral home workers and people under 65 with underlying health conditions.
More than a third of Smithfield's 3,700 employees in Sioux Falls had tested positive for the virus by mid-June 2020, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. BJ Motley, president of the local UFCW union, said workers are asking when they can be vaccinated, but the company has not provided information about scheduling shots.
""All we can do is keep pushing,"" he said.
Smithfield said it told employees the vaccine will be distributed at the Sioux Falls plant once supplies are available. 
Kim Malsam-Rysdon, South Dakota's health secretary, said the state's vaccine plan was developed in accordance with CDC guidelines. Vaccine allocation from the federal government is the biggest challenge facing states, she said.
'POTLUCK AT THE STATE LEVEL'
The U.S. Department of Agriculture told Reuters it is ""again contacting governors in each state to encourage they prioritize food workers for vaccinations, as public health agencies have recommended.""
The United States has been shipping millions of doses of vaccines to states each week, but demand so far has outpaced supplies. By the end of March, vaccine producers plan to ship tens of millions more shots. The supply will be further helped by Saturday's U.S authorization of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s one-shot vaccine.
 Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), the nation's largest meatpacker by sales, said on Monday that many of its 13,000 Iowa employees would start getting the vaccine this week. About 2,000 Tyson employees out of 100,000 hourly workers received vaccines as of Feb. 25.
Rival meat processor JBS USA plans to shut a beef plant in Greeley, Colorado, on March 5 and 6 for vaccinations, after almost 400 worker infections there. The local UFCW union that represents plant employees said the union secured on-site access to shots by working with the state and National Guard.
JBS and affiliated chicken producer Pilgrim’s Pride Corp said about 8,500 employees in eight states, including Colorado, will have access to vaccines this week.
Cargill Inc will work with healthcare providers to vaccinate employees at a beef plant in Kansas and at offsite locations in Nebraska and Michigan, according to the company. At chicken processor Perdue Farms, about 800 employees out of 21,000 had received one shot by Thursday. 
Julie Anna Potts, president of the trade group North American Meat Institute, said last week she would like the federal government to be more involved with getting vaccines to meatpacking workers. 
""Unfortunately it's just been kind of a potluck at the state level,"" she said.
Worker vaccinations are also progressing slowly in the wider food industry, said Mike Gruber, vice president of regulatory affairs at the Consumer Brands Association. The group represents food manufacturers like Kellogg Company (NYSE:K) and estimates 300 of its 1.7 million essential workers have received a shot.
Some state officials are also concerned about fruit and vegetable workers. 
North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler said temporary agricultural workers are beginning to arrive from Mexico and other countries under the H-2A visa program without being eligible for shots. They often live in group housing, which can facilitate the spread of the virus, and move from state to state to harvest seasonal crops.

""We really wanted to get these workers vaccinated before they were spread out across the state,"" Troxler said, ""but it doesn't look like that's going to happen.""

1658,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 06:59AM ET</span>","U.S. Futures Lower, Stabilizing After Monday's Strong Gains","By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Tuesday, handing back some of the previous session’s strong gains - although losses are limited as Treasury yields stabilize.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 55 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.3%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 44 points, or 0.3%.
Wall Street started the new month on a strong note Monday, with the broad-based S&P 500 index closing 2.4% higher, its best day since June, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 3%, their best trading days since November.
Investors have been generally confident of economic growth going forward as the vaccination program ramps up, the Federal Reserve continues with its easy money policies and the Biden administration pushes forward with its proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package. 
The U.S. Senate will begin debating the coronavirus relief bill this week, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Monday, after it made its way through the House of Representatives over the weekend. It will do so without any provision for raising the federal minimum wage to $15, a retreat that has angered the left wing of the Democratic Party.
Still, worries still exist that stock markets are over-extended as the prospect of persistent inflation has led to concerns that monetary policy may have to be tightened sooner than expected.
U.S. Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard will speak later Tuesday, as will San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly. .However, with their colleagues all expressing a lack of worry about inflation or asset prices, the potential for any upset looks limited.
For now, bond yields have stabilized at Monday’s levels, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield currently trading around 1.43%, lower than the 1.60% level that it briefly touched last week.
Meanwhile, in the corporate sector, retailers will be in focus Tuesday, with  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) publishing figures on Tuesday. Additionally, movie theatre chain AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) is likely to report bleak fourth-quarter numbers, while  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) will also be in the spotlight after it released stellar numbers late Monday. 
Oil prices weakened Tuesday, as traders turned their attention towards the upcoming meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, on Thursday.
These top producers are currently holding back some seven million barrels per day, or 7% of global supply, from the market, but could sanction the return of some of this to the market given the recent rises in oil prices.
Also of interest will be U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the session.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $60.59 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.2% to $63.55. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,727.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2030.

World stocks have seen two heavy weekly falls since late January as bets on a strong post-COVID rebound in the global economy have pushed U.S. government bond yields, the main driver of borrowing costs, up roughly 50%.
""We still believe the new nominal will support equities and risk assets over the next six to 12 months,"" BlackRock's Investment Institute economists said, referring to an expectation the world's leading central banks will keep bond yields low.

In recent weeks, the fund giant, which manages nearly $9 trillion worth of assets, mainly in passive funds, has turned ""overweight"" equities on a ""strategic horizon"" due to ""a better outlook for earnings amid moderate valuations"".

1660,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 06:40AM ET</span>",UK gilt issuance to be second-highest on record at almost 250 billion pounds: Reuters poll,"By Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is likely to sell nearly 250 billion pounds ($347 billion) of government bonds in the coming financial year - the second-highest total on record - to help power an economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, a Reuters poll of dealers showed on Tuesday.
The survey of all 15 wholesale primary dealers, or banks tasked by the government with creating a market for its bonds, pointed to gilt issuance of about 247.2 billion pounds for the 2021/22 financial year starting in April.
Such a sum marks a sharp drop from the 485.5 billion pounds of gilts that the United Kingdom Debt Management Office (DMO) plans to issue in the current 2020/21 year to finance the economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak is due to deliver his budget around 1230 GMT on Wednesday, after which the DMO will publish its 2021/22 gilt issuance remit.
Sunak has said he would not rush to fix the public finances as he readies a budget, which will add more borrowing to almost 300 billion pounds ($418 billion) of COVID-19 spending and tax cuts.
In November, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast borrowing in 2020/21 would reach 393.5 billion pounds, or 19% of GDP, a peacetime record. The latest official data suggests borrowing will fall below this, partly because more taxpayers than expected have opted against deferring payments to 2021/22.
The poll showed Sunak is expected to announce a budget deficit forecast for 2021/22 of 180 billion pounds, 16 billion pounds more than the OBR had predicted in November.
""Our current estimate is that the latest lockdown will 'cost' around 16 billion pounds in terms of additional fiscal support,"" said RBC economist Cathal Kennedy.
He cited the fact that more workers are now furloughed than the OBR had assumed in November, as well as expanded support for self-employed people and business grants announced in January.
In addition to the budget deficit, the government must also refinance 79.3 billion pounds of gilts due to mature in 2021/22.
As in the current year, much of the issuance will be soaked up by the Bank of England's asset-purchase programme, which is due to buy around 100 billion pounds of government debt during the next financial year. 
The poll suggested the government will finance borrowing almost entirely through gilts in the next financial year, rather than additional issuance of T-bills or via the government's retail investment arm.
The DMO is likely to ramp up its issuance of inflation-linked gilts in 2021/22 to around 14% of the total, compared with 7% in the current financial year, the poll showed.
The DMO reined in sales of index-linked gilts through most of 2020 due to uncertainty caused by a review into the future of the retail prices index measure of inflation, which is used to price the bonds.
""Given pent-up demand, we think that this target is achievable,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts Sanjay Raja and Panos Giannopoulos.
The dealers did not expect much change in the split between short, medium and long-dated gilts. Britain already has a longer average maturity for its debt than any other major economy, but the recent jump in global bond yields has prompted some commentators to say the DMO should do more to lock in low rates.

The government has also said it will issue the first ""green gilts"" - bonds to finance environmentally friendly projects - in 2021/22. Most respondents expect one or two bonds to be issued, of around 10 billion pounds in total.

1661,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 06:36AM ET</span>",BlackRock Warns of Whipsawed Emerging Markets After Taper Scare,"(Bloomberg) -- There’s no immediate end in sight for bond investors getting tugged between risk-on rallies and selloffs that rekindled nightmares of the 2013 taper tantrum, according to the world’s largest money manager.
Sergio Trigo Paz, the London-based head of emerging-market debt at BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., said he’s bracing for a repeat of January and February, when developing-nation assets vacillated from several weeks of a “Goldilocks scenario” to several weeks of turmoil fueled by a spike in U.S. Treasury yields.
“It’s like a half-pipe,” or u-shaped chute used by snowboarders to perform jumps, said Trigo Paz, who practices the sport in the Swiss Alps in his spare time. “It’s counter-intuitive, but at the moment of most Goldilocks you have to sell risk and at the moment of greatest taper you need to buy.”
BlackRock is among a cadre of investors and strategists from Ashmore Group Plc to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) who say that emerging-market bonds won’t suffer the same fate as in 2013, even after enduring their worst week since September.
There are several notable differences, said Trigo Paz. For one, the asset class isn’t the crowded trade it was back then. Secondly, the economic fundamentals in the so-called Fragile Five, which suffered the most eight years ago, have generally improved. Meantime, fiscal stimulus will drive demand for commodities, oil prices may climb and the U.S. dollar could weaken, he said.
Troublesome Trio in Emerging Markets Face Yield Spike Scare
With that backdrop, Trigo Paz said he’s betting on high-yield bonds from oil exporters like Angola, Gabon and Russia against their counterparts in Argentina and Ecuador, which both underwent debt restructurings last year. He also favors South Africa over Brazil, Mexico over Colombia and Poland over its regional peers. Another strategy is to buy developing-nation currencies, funded with the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, euro or Swiss franc.
Trigo Paz helps oversee portfolios including the $1.6 billion BlackRock Strategic Funds - Emerging Markets Flexi Dynamic Bond Fund. It has returned 8.1% in the past year, bettering 95% of peers. The fund has an annualized return of 6% over the last half decade, which is better than 78% of its counterparts.
“Last year, we went through a very, very violent hurricane hitting all countries,” he said. “The fragile countries either defaulted or restructured. All the others went through a crash test and either made it, are still struggling or are in a better position today. In the next year, the jury will be out for most.”

1662,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 06:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: RBI restricting banks from raising stakes in insurance firms - sources,"By Nupur Anand and Swati Bhat
MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's central bank wants banks to limit ownership stakes in capital intensive insurance companies at a maximum 20%, less than half of what the current regulations permit, three sources with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rules allow banks to hold up to 50% stakes in insurers and on a selective basis equity holdings can be higher but must eventually be brought down within a certain period.
The sources, who asked not to be named as the discussions are private, however said the central bank in 2019 unofficially advised banks seeking to acquire stakes in insurers, to limit such stakes to a maximum of 30%, and more recently directed them to cap stake purchases in insurers at 20%.
""Unofficially, banks have been told that the regulator is not comfortable with lenders increasing their stakes because the insurance business is seen as a money guzzler,"" one source said.
The RBI wants banks to focus on their main areas of business instead of locking away capital in non-core sectors. The central bank did not respond to a request seeking comment.
The unofficial push suggests the RBI is looking for uniformity around ownership rules for lenders with exposure in the sector, following suggestions made in a working paper by an internal group released in November. 
Some lenders such as Kotak Mahindra Bank and State Bank of India have wholly-owned or majority owned insurance subsidiaries, and the paper had suggested that if any lender had more than a 20% stake in an insurer, they should follow a non-operative financial holding company (NOFHC) structure which will ring fence ownership.
Most lenders are not keen to adopt such a structure on concerns it will hurt shareholder value and limit their capital raising ability, one of the sources said.
Recommendations made by the working paper are under consideration by the RBI and it is not clear when the central bank will act on or implement the suggestions. In light of this, the sources said the RBI was likely to stall on any requests by banks to boost or acquire new stakes in insurers.
The move comes at a time when India is keen to woo foreign investment in its insurance sector. Last month, the government said it would allow foreign direct investment of up to 74% in insurers, up from 49%. Many foreign insurers are expected to explore the opportunity as insurance penetration continues to be low in India.
With fears that banks' bad loans could double amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the RBI does not want banks to lock up money in capital intensive businesses, the sources said.
The RBI may have reservations about banks having more than 20% stakes in any non-core companies, one of the sources said.
Federal Bank, which sought permission from the RBI to increase its stake in Ageas Federal Life insurance after its board approved the deal about a year ago, has still not received RBI approval, one of the sources said.
Federal Bank did not respond to a request seeking comment.
Last year, the RBI had also rejected Axis Bank's application to directly purchase a 17% stake in Max Life. 
The transaction was only approved after Axis restructured it and agreed to purchase the stake with two subsidiaries, bringing down the bank's direct ownership share to less than 10%.

Axis Bank did not respond to a request seeking comment on whether it restructured the deal on the advice of the RBI.

1663,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 06:15AM ET</span>",Bond selloff eases but risk gauges flash orange,"By Saikat Chatterjee and Thyagaraju Adinarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - The recent violent selloff in the $20 trillion U.S. government bond market has eased, but it isn't over.
Signs of stress are in fact everywhere; they imply that more such episodes of turmoil -- or ""tantrums"" as they have become known -- lie in wait over coming months. 
Ten-year Treasury yields, the main reference rate for global borrowing costs, are now around 1.4%, having spiked last week to 1.6%, a whopping 130 basis point rise from March 2020 lows.
The brutal spillover into stock markets shaved $2 trillion last week from the value of global equities, which are trading on exalted valuations following a decade-long rally.
Volatility could return if U.S. economy continues to surpass expectations and President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion spending plan says Salman Ahmed, global head of macro at Fidelity International, noting ""risks emanating from the impending fiscal dominance that will drive a notch-up in cyclical inflation"".
Here are some indicators that show bond market stress is by no means over:
1/ VIX TO FOLLOW THE MOVE?
The global bond slump boosted the volatility index to near April 2020 highs, but it contrasts with a similar index in the equity market which is trading half of the levels seen in April.
Graphic: MOVE index versis VIX - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/jznpnogkqvl/Pasted%20image%201614609859645.png
2/ WIDENING SPREADS
Signalling more stress for the bond markets is the widening bid-ask spread in U.S. Treasuries, an indicator of shrinking liquidity in the deepest bond market in the world.
Data from Tradeweb, a trading platform, showed wider spreads were a feature across the yield curve, pushing them to their highest levels since the March 2020 pandemic-fuelled selloff.

Graphic: Stress Signals - https://graphics.reuters.com/US-YIELD/nmovazrgjpa/chart.png
3/ EXPLODING TREASURY ETF TURNOVER
A major reason why spreads widened as volatility jumped has been a marked change in the composition of market participants in the bond market in recent years. 
Traditional participants like banks have ceded market share to algorithmic trading in major markets with some estimates putting the share of algorithmic trading in U.S. Treasuries at nearly 90% compared to 50% at the start of the decade.
And as the computer-share driven trading models have become more widespread, turnover in futures and exchange traded funds have exploded while volume in cash markets have stagnated.

4/ NASDAQ-UST, A DEADLY COMBO?
A 60% Nasdaq and 40% US 10 year U.S. bond portfolio showed one of the largest bi-weekly declines since the global financial crisis.

The $31.2 billion was the lowest monthly figure since August and compares with $52.5 billion net inflows in January.

Of the flow to equities, $7.8 billion - or 93% of the total - went to Chinese stocks. The $0.6 billion net inflows to the other emerging markets was the lowest reading since outflows of over $6 billion in October for the region, according to IIF data.
""The positive momentum at the beginning of 2021 has scaled down, hurting equity flows particularly,"" the IIF said in a statement.

On the debt side, flows to China totaled $9.3 billion, the lowest in 10 months, while the rest of EM funneled $13.5 billion, just above the $12.1 billion average over the previous 12 months.

1665,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 06:05AM ET</span>",UK banks face savings glut on road to pandemic recovery,"By Iain Withers and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's big four banks amassed more than 200 billion pounds ($277.52 billion) of new deposits last year as customers reined in spending through pandemic lockdowns, far outstripping extra lending to struggling businesses and households.
Full-year earnings reported by HSBC,  Barclays  (LON:BARC), Lloyds (LON:LLOY) and NatWest last month revealed the extent to which lenders' finances have been upended by the crisis.
The banks now face a glut in savings, a Reuters analysis of the banks' results show, as domestic customers of the four lenders deposited 221 billion pounds of extra cash.
By contrast, despite banks doling out billions of pounds of state-guaranteed finance to companies since the pandemic hit, their net lending growth in the UK overall was 53.4 billion pounds - a quarter of the growth in deposits.
The more limited lending growth can be explained by a fall in appetite for some lending, particularly consumer credit, where separate Bank of England data has shown Britons paid back 13.8 billion pounds in the last year.
More deposits help shore up bank finances, but are not necessarily good news for lenders when central bank interest rates are near zero, making it hard to lend profitably.
That explains the heavy focus on wealth management in banks' strategy updates last month, as they race to earn more from fees to compensate for low lending margins. 
Banks have said they expect a customer spending splurge as Britain comes out of its latest lockdown in the coming months, which may go some way to eating into the deposits pile. 
Graphic: UK deposits grew much faster than lending in 2020 https://graphics.reuters.com/BRITAIN-BANKS/bdwvknmzdpm/chart.png
The bulk of UK bank profits are made on the difference between the interest gained on lending and paid out on deposits.
The crunch in consumer credit therefore severely dented lender income, compounded by the fact the Bank of England cut benchmark rates to an all-time low of 0.1%.
This double whammy can be seen in sharp drops in income at the two domestically-focused banks - NatWest and Lloyds - where income fell 24% and 16% respectively last year.
The fall was a more modest 10% at HSBC, which benefited from a more international footprint and exposure to markets in Asia that proved more resilient over the year.
Barclays bucked the trend entirely, with income overall edging up 1% thanks to a stellar year for its investment bank in pandemic-driven volatile markets that offset woes in retail.
Graphic: Bank income crunched, Barclays lifted by trading arm https://graphics.reuters.com/BRITAIN-BANKS/yxmvjxwbkvr/chart.png
The big unknown for the banks remains how severe a hit the crisis will deal to their loan books, once government stimulus packages to support consumers and businesses are phased out.
The four banks have set aside nearly 19 billion pounds worth of provisions between them for loans expected to go bad due to the crisis.
These provisions were largely front-loaded in 2020, with the bulk taken in the first half of the year - as lenders are required to book ahead of time under forward-looking accounting rules known as IFRS9.
Despite the torrid economic backdrop, the provisions in the last two quarters were back to pre-crisis levels at at least some of the banks - a reflection of the impact of ongoing government stimulus.
Britain's Finance Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to extend support again on Wednesday when he lays out his annual budget plan that is expected to pile more borrowing on top of almost 300 billion pounds of COVID-19 spending and tax cuts.
Banks know there is a great deal of delayed pain to come and it is unclear whether their provisioning to date is sufficient.
Graphic: Bad loan provisions were frontloaded in 2020 https://graphics.reuters.com/BRITAIN-BANKS/jznvnogxjpl/chart.png 
Solving this conundrum will be key to jump-starting British banks' share prices, which have languished in recent years over fears about Brexit and near-constant restructuring that has crimped profits.
Optimism over vaccine rollouts has seen the lenders' shares climb back towards pre-pandemic levels since the autumn, but that still leaves them near 12-year lows.

1666,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 06:00AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Boohoo Struggles to Rid Itself of Slave Labor Taint,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com --  Boohoo 's (LON:BOOH) past is catching up with it, again.
The U.K.-based fast fashion chain saw its stock fall over 7% at one point on Tuesday after Sky News reported that the company faces a possible import ban into the U.S. over past allegations of using slave labor in its supply chain.
The NGO Liberty Shared, which campaigns against perceived corporate abuses, has presented two petitions to U.S. authorities in the last month to start investigating allegations of illegally low pay and other abuses at a string of factories in Leicester, England. The city is home to the U.K.’s biggest concentration of people originating from the Indian subcontinent, some 10,000 of whom work in mostly precarious conditions in the textile industry.
An import ban from the U.S. would be a severe blow to the company, which has invested heavily in growing its presence there after the acquisition of the Nasty Gal and Pretty Little Thing brands. The U.S. accounted for over 20% of global revenue last year and that share is rising. Such diversification away from the U.K. market has been one of the main factors behind the share’s performance, helping it through a period when U.K.-focused stocks carried a hefty Brexit-related discount.
The shares recovered later in the morning after the company issued a statement playing down the risk of U.S. action against it. By 5:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), they were down 4.3%, just off a new low for the year.
Reuters quoted Boohoo as saying that it hasn’t been notified of any investigation into it by the Customs and Border Protection Service, which is responsible for ensuring that products made with  slave labor don’t enter the U.S. 
“Auditors and investigators who are forensically examining suppliers in Leicester have found no evidence of modern day slavery,” Reuters quoted Boohoo as saying, adding that Boohoo said it hasn’t been notified of any investigation by the CBP.
“We are confident in the actions that we are taking to ensure that all of the group’s products meet and exceed the CBP criteria on preventing the product of forced labour entering the U.S.,” it said.
The latest development comes only a few weeks after the company claimed to be making good progress in implementing the recommendations of a review into its practices by a senior lawyer, Alison Levitt. Levitt had absolved the company of knowingly using slave labor in the past but had called it slow to address concerns that had been brought to its attention.
It has hired a former judge, Brian Leveson, to check its implementation of the policies recommended in Levitt’s review.
The petitions from Liberty Shared nonetheless ensure that Boohoo has a unique governance problem that rivals appear to have avoided. The shine has gone off its shares in the last year, despite its online-only distribution model being better suited to the pandemic than Next. It’s up barely 10% over the last 12 months, while Asos stock is up 91% and Next stock is up over 22%.  
An unequivocal OK from the CBP could conceivably trigger a rerating, but as long as this issue remains unresolved, it’s hard to see that recent underperformance changing - however many teenagers want to anticipate the end of lockdown by splashing out on some new party outfits."
1667,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 05:55AM ET</span>","Adevinta, eBay to sell UK units to secure $9.2 billion tie-up","By Terje Solsvik
OSLO (Reuters) - U.S. e-commerce group eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Norway's Adevinta planned to sell three smaller British units in order to secure regulatory approval for a long-planned tie-up of their global classified ads businesses, the two firms said on Tuesday.
Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said last month Adevinta and eBay would have to resolve the watchdog's concerns before proceeding with their $9.2 billion deal.
In response, Adevinta and eBay said on Tuesday they had proposed to sell each company's primary classifieds operations in Britain, namely Shpock, Gumtree and Motors.co.uk. 
The CMA told Reuters the move ""may address the competition concerns our investigation raised"". It said it had until April 29 to decide whether to accept the proposal and could extend that to June 28 if there were special reasons for doing so. 
On a combined basis, the British businesses would have represented less than 5% of total consolidated revenue for the merged classified ads company, Adevinta and eBay said.
Under a deal struck last July, Adevinta will acquire eBay's classified ads business in return for $2.5 billion in cash and 540 million shares, making the U.S. firm Adevinta's largest shareholder with a 44% stake and 33.3% of the vote. EBay will also get two seats on Adevinta's board.
The CMA's review of the eBay-Adevinta deal is the latest probe of large digital mergers. The CMA said last month Viagogo must sell StubHub's international business after its $4.05 billion purchase of eBay's ticket-reselling business.
Ebay and Adevinta said on Tuesday they aimed to close the transaction in the second quarter of 2021, subject to final ratification by the CMA and regulatory approval in Austria.

Adevinta's share price, which fell last month on news of the CMA's objections to the deal, got a small boost in early trade on Tuesday before retreating to stand 0.2% higher by 1011 GMT.

Sky News said U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has seen sufficient evidence to launch an investigation after petitions from lawyer Duncan Jepson, who runs Liberty Shared, a campaign group against modern-day slavery.
It quotes Jepson as saying Boohoo is not doing enough to stop forced labour in the factories in Leicester, central England, which supply many of its clothes.
Shares in Boohoo were down 5.7% at 0907 GMT.
Last September Boohoo accepted all the recommendations of an independent review which found major failings in its supply chain in England after newspaper allegations about working conditions and low pay, and set out steps to tackle the problems.
The group, which sells own-brand clothing, shoes, accessories and beauty products targeted at 16- to 40-year-olds, said that over the past eight months it has been working closely with UK enforcement bodies.
""It is important to note that auditors and investigators who are forensically examining suppliers in Leicester have found no evidence of modern day slavery,"" it said in a statement.
Boohoo said it has not been notified of any investigation by U.S. CBP.
""We are confident in the actions that we are taking to ensure that all of the group’s products meet and exceed the CBP criteria on preventing the product of forced labour entering the U.S.,"" it said.
""We will work with any competent authority to assure them that products from our supply chain meet the required standard.""
In November Boohoo appointed retired judge Brian Leveson to independently check its ""Agenda for Change"" programme, which implements the recommendations of the independent review.

""The group continues to make excellent progress as it works to implement the review’s recommendations and improve our supply chain in Leicester,"" it added.

BEIJING (Reuters) -  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Ant Group founder Jack Ma has lost the title of China's richest man, a list published on Tuesday showed, as his peers prospered while his empire was put under heavy scrutiny by Chinese regulators.
Ma and his family had held the top spot for China's richest in the Hurun Global Rich List in 2020 and 2019 but now trail in fourth place behind bottled water maker Nongfu Spring's Zhong Shanshan, Tencent Holding's Pony Ma and e-commerce upstart  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD)'s Collin Huang, the latest list showed.
His fall out of the top three comes ""after China's regulators reined in Ant Group and Alibaba on anti-trust issues,"" the Hurun report said.
Ma's recent woes were triggered by an Oct. 24 speech in which he blasted China's regulatory system, leading to the suspension of his Ant Group's $37 billion IPO just days before the fintech giant's public listing.
Regulators have since tightened anti-trust scrutiny on the country's tech sector, with Alibaba taking much of the heat; the market regulator launched an official anti-trust probe into Alibaba in December.
Chinese regulators also began to tighten their grip on the fintech sector and have asked Ant to fold some of its businesses into a financial holding company to be regulated like traditional financial firms.
Ma, who is not known for shying away from the limelight, then disappeared from the public eye for about three months, triggering frenzied speculation about his whereabouts. He re-emerged in January with a 50-second video appearance.
China's current richest man, Zhong, made his first appearance at the top spot largely thanks to the share price performances of Nongfu Spring and vaccine maker Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise, which he also controls.
Tencent's Ma saw his wealth swell 70% over the year to 480 billion yuan ($74.16 billion) while Pinduoduo's Huang's fortune grew 283% to 450 billion yuan, the list said. In comparison, the wealth of Ma and his family grew 22%, to 360 billion yuan.
Zhang Yiming, founder of TikTok owner ByteDance, broke into the top five rankings among Chinese billionaires in Hurun's Global Rich List for the first time, with an estimated personal wealth of $54 billion.

Newly-appointed Prime Minister Mario Draghi met with the transport, economy, industry and labour ministers on Monday and was pushing for a speedy resolution but not at all costs, the paper said. The cabinet office declined to comment. 
Under Draghi's predecessor, Giuseppe Conte, Rome had earmarked 3 billion euros for a new airline, dubbed ITA, to replace Alitalia, which has been run by state-appointed administrators since it was declared bankrupt in 2017.
According to La Repubblica, ITA will acquire all of the airline's aviation business, including aircraft and employees, and would start before the end of April to take advantage of the upcoming summer season. 
Il Sole 24 Ore said the plan was to get the revamped airline flying from June 1. 
Daily Il Giornale said the new Alitalia might start with 43-45 planes and 2,500-3,000 employees and could get between 1-2 billion euros in state aid. 
A state-supported flag carrier, however, requires approval from the European Commission, which has asked for an open tender of Alitalia assets and is pressing for the new airline to forsake the old brand and some of its airport slots. 
The government, which last week said it wanted to press ahead with nationalisation of the carrier, is due to meet with officials in Brussels on Friday, the papers added. 
Alitalia could not be reached immediately for comment.

1672,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 03:58AM ET</span>",European Stocks Mixed After WHO Warning,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded mixed Tuesday, with investors digesting a fresh warning about the coronavirus as well as an abundance of corporate news.
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.2%.
The number of new coronavirus infections globally rose last week for the first time in seven weeks, the World Health Organization said on Monday. 
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that it was too early for countries to rely solely on vaccination programs and abandon other measures. This warning comes with European countries discussing the timing of when their mobility restrictions, in place to combat the virus, should be lifted.
German retail sales fell sharply in January, dropping 4.5% on the month, showing the continued impact of these restrictions on Europe’s largest economy.
Also weighing on sentiment in Europe Tuesday were losses in the heavyweight oil sector on falling crude levels, with Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), BP (NYSE:BP) and Total all dropping between 1% and 2%..
In corporate news, Danone stock rose 0.5% after the French food group separated the chairman and chief executive roles held by Emmanuel Faber, and launched the search for a new CEO following calls from several shareholders to shake up governance. 
In the U.K.,  Taylor Wimpey  (LON:TW) stock rose 3.4% after the housebuilder said it would reinstate its dividend after a year in which profit before tax at the firm fell by two thirds. The announcement makes an interesting backdrop to the U.K. budget on Wednesday, which is reportedly likely to include further tax breaks for housebuyers.
 Travis Perkins  (LON:TPK) stock, by contrast, fell 1.6% after the builders merchant plunged into a loss last year, weighed by restructuring and Covid-related costs. Elsewhere, Boohoo (OTC:BHOOY) stock fell 7% after a report saying that it faces a possible import ban in the U.S. due to past allegations that it used slave labor in its English factories.
Global equity markets posted hefty gains on Monday, helped by positive news about another Covid-19 vaccine as well as progress in the U.S. $1.9 trillion stimulus bill. 
That said, investors continue to debate whether many markets are over-extended following huge stimulus injections to counter the impact of the pandemic. The prospect of faster inflation as the world economy recovers has led to concerns that monetary policy may have to be tightened sooner than expected. 
Oil prices weakened Tuesday, as traders turned their attention towards the upcoming meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, on Thursday.
These top producers are currently holding back some seven million barrels per day, or 7% of global supply, from the market, but could sanction the return of some of this to the market given the recent rises in oil prices. Data out on Tuesday showed that Russian production actually fell in February due to the prolonged spell of extreme cold weather, stopping it from making use of the output increase it had secured at the last meeting.
Also of interest will be U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the session.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% lower at $60.11 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1% to $63.08. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,720.25/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.2020.

The deal marks the third takeover by CEO Oliver Steil since TeamViewer, headquartered in Goeppingen, was floated in Sept. 2019 by private equity backer Permira. Terms were not disclosed for the transaction.
Steil said in an interview that the Upskill takeover would strengthen TeamViewer's presence in the United States, its largest market by billings. He was still in the market for deals that would widen its range of products.
""We are interested in complementary teams with complementary capabilities,"" Steil said. TeamViewer recently raised a 300 million euro ($360 million) loan, has cash on hand and strong cash flow that can be put to work, he added.
Steil had flagged his interest in expanding into augmented reality and smart devices when TeamViewer reported annual results last month, and forecast that its business would grow by around a third this year.
With the acquisition of Upskill, TeamViewer acquires the ability to support workers using smart glasses and handheld devices to inspect factory equipment, as well as a client list that includes Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Merck KGaA.
""Our existing customers will benefit from an accelerated product development roadmap, global reach, and additional solutions and features within the TeamViewer portfolio,"" said Upskill CEO Brian Ballard.

Flipkart has already expanded online grocery sales to more than 50 Indian cities and intends to reach over 70 locations in the next six months, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.
The Bengaluru-based firm said its grocery service had grown ""exponentially"" in the past year when many Indians began buying essential supplies online due to the health crisis. 
""Grocery continues to be one of the fastest-growing categories,"" said Manish Kumar, senior vice president at Flipkart, adding that the company had seen increased demand for the service from smaller cities in 2020.
Reliance Industries-owned JioMart last year became the latest big entrant to India's e-grocery market, a sector that also includes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), BigBasket and several smaller players. Indian conglomerate Tata is reported to be buying a majority stake in Alibaba-backed BigBasket.
Reliance, backed by India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, raised over $20 billion last year from global investors including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google for its digital arm, which is expected to support JioMart.
India's broader retail industry is also witnessing a high-stakes legal battle between Reliance and Jeff Bezos-led Amazon on the Future Group's $3.4 billion sale of its retail assets to Reliance, which Future's partner Amazon is contesting.

1680,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2021 01:45AM ET</span>",Spanish unions cry foul as Inditex shuts stores,"By Victoria Waldersee and Clara-Laeila Laudette
MADRID (Reuters) -  Inditex  (MC:ITX) staff in Spain say they are being forced out as the owner of fast-fashion brand Zara rolls out its plan to shut up to 1,200 stores worldwide, despite a company agreement with Spanish unions to project jobs.
The world's biggest clothes retailer is closing smaller outlets while expanding flagship stores and the Spanish closures are the first of up to 700 expected this year in Europe, as well as 100 in the Americas and 400 elsewhere in the world.
Under a December agreement, seen by Reuters, with two Spanish unions, Inditex aims to provide all affected staff with new vacancies matching their old contracts and seniority within 25 km (16 miles) of where they used to work.
But unions and staff say it's not going to plan.
In an internal report seen by Reuters, the UGT union analysed vacancies offered by Inditex and found 40% of the new positions were outside the province where the worker in question had worked, in some cases on the other side of the country.
The report said one in four workers offered new positions in Spain so far had quit.
""If workers who used to work 40 hours are offered 12-hour jobs, hours away, that's not preserving employment,"" said Cristina Estevez, UGT's retail representative.
UGT, the second-biggest Spanish union within Inditex, signed the deal with the company along with the leading syndicate CCOO.
An Inditex spokesman said in an email to Reuters that it was complying with the union agreement and that relocations respected, ""all its principles, wording and spirit, which is to prioritise the maintenance of jobs"".
The company was offering more than one vacancy for every job lost, the spokesman said, pointing out that 75% of workers had been successfully relocated so far.
MORE NEW JOBS 
Clothing sales at Inditex and rivals such as H&M and Next recovered towards the end of last year from record lows when the COVID-19 pandemic first struck, boosted by online shopping and a quick rebound in China. 
But the retail industry's recovery in the western world has been frustrated by lockdowns extending well into 2021 and slow vaccine rollouts in some countries.
While most retail jobs lost in the first quarter of 2020 in the United States and Europe have been reinstated, the number of people employed in the sector remains well below pre-pandemic levels, according to data from Eikon Datastream and Eurostat.
In the United States, the shortfall is about 400,000 jobs while in Europe it's nearly 350,000, the data showed.
Inditex said in June it would close 1,000 to 1,200 of its smaller, less profitable stores worldwide by the end of 2021. The pandemic tipped the company into a loss for the first time though Inditex attributed the closures to strong results from its integrated online and in-store model.
So far, Inditex has announced the closure of 114 stores in Spain affecting 986 jobs, CCOO said, with unions expecting a further 186 outlets to shut this year. 
The number of vacancies offered so far is equivalent to 126% of jobs affected, the Inditex spokesman said.
'LAUGHING AT US'
Six Spanish unions contacted by Reuters, including CCOO and UGT, said the high proportion of offers in different regions for fewer hours and more evenings and weekends was beyond the scope of what they had expected.
Some workers said the options offered to them would have meant cutting their weekly hours from 30 to 40 to below 20, with shifts moved to evenings and weekends, as shown by documents seen by Reuters listing the new vacancies.
""They're basically inviting us to leave,"" said one Zara worker in Guadalajara near the capital Madrid, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions in her career. 
""The vacancies they offered in our store were eight or 16 hours weekly, always on weekends, or even just Sundays, when almost all the staff used to do 20, 40 hours weekly. They're laughing at us,"" she said.
The spokesman for Inditex said it had offered workers in Guadalajara the best alternatives available in the vicinity.
Under the December agreement, Inditex committed to reimburse transport costs up to 90 euros a month when relocation within 25 km was impossible, and cover relocation expenses if staff had to move house. Otherwise, workers could opt to leave, receiving compensation proportionate to their years with the firm.
Some workers in Barcelona were offered vacancies in Santander (MC:SAN), a seven-hour drive away, the UGT union said. The CGT union in Madrid, said one worker was offered a position in Melilla, an autonomous Spanish city in North Africa.
""These are disguised layoffs,"" CGT secretary for Zara in Madrid, Anibal Maestro, said. ""When you propose such moves, you're forcing the workers to quit.""
BLANK CHEQUE
The Inditex spokesman said its agreement with the unions accounted for the fact that vacancies further away may be attractive to some staff, citing examples of five people who had asked to relocate long distances.
The fashion retailer, the world's largest by revenue, expanded its global store network by a net 1,942 stores from 2012 to hit a peak of 7,199. But only 450 stores will open between 2020 and 2022, the company has said, as it seeks to boost the proportion of its online sales to 25% from 14%.
Elsewhere in Europe, negotiations over closures are still underway, according to UNI Global Union, which is overseeing the process with national unions across the region. 
In a videoconference with the company's European Works Council (EWC) in June, Inditex assured them that staff affected by closures would all receive alternative job offers.
""Both parties agree that safeguarding work, training staff in order to tackle the new functions derived from digital transformation and labour organisation ... constitute the keys in the work plan,"" Inditex and the EWC said in a joint statement on Dec. 21.
The Inditex spokesman said maintaining employment for existing workers was a priority wherever there were closures.
But workers on the ground remain fearful, especially those associated with unions that did not sign the agreement.

""That agreement was a blank cheque for the firm,"" said Zara worker and AST union member Jose Angel Parejo, adding that he feared his 13 years at the company would end when his store in central Madrid closes this month. ""They committed to an equivalence in quantity of vacancies, but not quality.""

A SPAC is a blank-cheque company that raises money through an initial public offering (IPO) with the intention of merging with another firm, allowing that business to list more quickly. 
Most SPACs so far have listed in the United States. They raised $60 billion in the first two months of 2021, Dealogic data showed, already more than 70% of 2020's annual deal value.
Hong Kong's markets regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and exchange operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) briefed a forum of top financial leaders in the city about latest developments in SPACS on Monday, according to the statement issued that evening. 
The Financial Leaders Forum, which is chaired by Hong Kong's Financial Secretary, Paul Chan, had asked the two organisations ""to explore suitable listing regimes to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong as an international financial centre, while safeguarding the interests of the investing public."" 
Chan said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Tuesday that the government was seriously looking into allowing SPACs. 
Several Hong Kong tycoons, including Richard Li, the son of Hong Kong's richest man Li Kashing, have set up SPACs already or are working on doing so. 

Even without SPACs, Hong Kong was the second most popular listing venue in the world in 2020 with deals worth $31.2 billion, compared to Nasdaq's $51.3 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

BOSTON/TOKYO (Reuters) - An American father and son accused of helping former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd Chairman Carlos Ghosn flee Japan while awaiting trial on financial charges were handed over to Japanese prosecutors on Monday for extradition from the United States, their lawyer said.
The development followed a months-long battle by lawyers for U.S. Army Special Forces veteran Michael Taylor and his son, Peter Taylor, to avoid being sent to Japan to faces charges they helped Ghosn escape the country in a box. 
The U.S. Supreme Court last month cleared the way for the extradition of the Taylors, who have been in U.S. custody since their arrest in May. Paul Kelly, their lawyer, confirmed they were en route for Japan aboard a flight from Boston scheduled to arrive in Tokyo around 1600 local time (0700 GMT).
""This is a sad day for the family, and for all who believe that veterans deserve better treatment from their own country,"" he said in a statement.
The U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. State Department declined to comment. The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, which will handle the case, also declined to comment.
The two men will not be indicted immediately, but will likely faces charges once an investigation, which will start when they arrive in Japan, is concluded. 
Japanese prosecutors have declined to say where the pair will be detained. One potential location is the Tokyo Detention House, the city's main jail where Ghosn was held after his arrest.
The Taylors are alleged to have helped Ghosn flee Japan on Dec. 29, 2019, hidden in a box and on a private jet before reaching his childhood home, Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.
Ghosn was awaiting trial on charges that he had engaged in financial wrongdoing, including by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements and enriching himself at his employer's expense through payments to car dealerships. Ghosn denies wrongdoing.
Prosecutors said the elder Taylor, a 60-year-old private security specialist, and Peter Taylor, 27, received $1.3 million for their services.
The Taylors, with the aid of a collection of high-powered lawyers and lobbyists, for months waged a campaign to press their case against extradition in the courts, media, State Department and White House.
The Taylors' lawyers argued that their clients could not be prosecuted in Japan for helping someone ""bail jump"" and that, if extradited, they faced the prospect of relentless interrogations and torture.

Under Japanese law, suspects can be held for up to 20 days before being charged or released, and are not allowed to have their lawyers present during questioning by prosecutors. Once charged, defendants are often refused bail by courts.

(Reuters) - A manager at Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) sued the online retailer for discrimination on Monday, saying it hires Black people for lower positions and promotes them more slowly than white workers, and that she was subjected to harassment.
The lawsuit from Charlotte Newman, a business development head at Amazon Web Services who is Black, said the company suffers from a ""systemic pattern of insurmountable discrimination,"" despite its pledge to fight racism and statements of solidarity from Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos.
Seattle-based Amazon said it was investigating the claims. It said it strives for an equitable culture and has no tolerance for discrimination: ""These allegations do not reflect those efforts or our values.""
The complaint was filed in Washington, D.C., federal court.
Newman, a Harvard Business School graduate and former adviser to U.S. Senator Cory Booker, said Amazon delayed by 2-1/2 years her rise to senior manager by hiring her in 2017 for a more junior role for which she was overqualified, a ""de-leveling"" that reduces awards of company stock.
She also accused a male supervisor of using racial tropes by calling her ""aggressive,"" ""too direct"" and ""just scary,"" and another male co-worker of sexually harassing her and once pulling on her braids while saying, ""You can leave this behind.""
Both men were also named as defendants, and according to the lawsuit the supervisor was required to undergo training while the co-worker was terminated. The co-worker's lawyer could not immediately be identified. 
Newman is seeking compensatory and punitive damages. She is represented by Douglas Wigdor, who also represented women suing the former movie producer Harvey Weinstein and Fox News over alleged harassment or discrimination.
Amazon has worked to show support for the Black Lives Matter movement. In September its cloud computing chief Andy Jassy, who will succeed Bezos as Amazon CEO, gave the keynote address at a Black Employee Network entrepreneurship conference.
The news site Recode last week reported allegations of racial disparities in Amazon promotions and performance reviews.

Amazon also faces lawsuits claiming it mistreated workers in its handling of the coronavirus pandemic at its facilities.

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Zoom was a relative upstart founded by a former Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) executive that had gone public on a promise to make video conferencing software easier to use.
However, businesses around the globe took to the company's video conferencing services during the virus outbreak. Zoom has since seen a meteoric rise over the last year, with investors keen on knowing if the firm can maintain this level of growth.
Eric Yuan, founder and chief executive officer of Zoom, said the firm was ""well positioned for strong growth"" in the coming year.
The company forecast current-quarter revenue between $900 million and $905 million, compared with estimates of $829.2 million, according to IBES Refinitiv data.
Zoom has seen its user numbers surge in the past year, while its shares more than quadrupled during the same period. The platform said it has 1,644 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue, more than double from a year earlier.
The company reported quarterly revenue of $882.5 million, compared with estimates of $811.8 million. On an adjusted basis, Zoom earned $1.22 per share, beating estimates of 79 cents per share.

The company's shares, which closed up 9.6% on Monday, were trading at $452 after the bell.

Investing.com -- The market has done so well in the last few days, it has some analysts wondering whether gains for the full year are already locked in.
The indexes surged again on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and NASDAQ Composite notching triple-digit gains, and the S&P 500 having its best day since June.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)’s one-dose Covid vaccine, which just got emergency use authorization from the government, will pour onto the market in the coming days, lifting hopes for a swifter recovery. The Senate now takes up the $1.9 trillion stimulus plan put forward by the Biden administration, another potential jolt to growth.
The reopening trade is lifting shares of airlines and travel-related companies.  Boeing Co  (NYSE:BA) got a boost Monday after getting more orders for its 737 Max jets.
But other stocks have benefited from the stay-at-home trend over the last year and continue to do so.  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:ZM) jumped after hours when it unveiled better than expected earnings and a rosy outlook for this year. DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG) also jumped 10% earlier on Monday on expectations more states will allow online sports betting.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow: 
1. Theater chain screens its fourth quarter results
AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC)reports its fourth quarter numbers on Tuesday and it’s expected to be a bleak picture. Movie theaters including AMC -- the largest chain operator -- have struggled to stay afloat, unable to completely reopen in key markets like New York City until recently. But things are looking up for the theater sector now that vaccines are rolling out and restrictions are being lifted. 
Analysts, who expect AMC to report a loss of $3.49 a share, will be listening to hear what AMC’s outlook is for the immediate future. AMC has also been one of a handful of so-called meme stocks caught in a curious trading frenzy stoked by Reddit forum members using Robinhood as their trading weapon of choice. It will be interesting to hear what AMC management has to say about that, if anything.
2. Kohls and  Target  profit and outlook
We also hear from two big retailers on Tuesday, Kohls and Target. Both are in a position to benefit from the $1,400 in stimulus checks that could be headed to individuals this month if the Senate approves President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus plan. The House has already approved it.
 Kohls Corp  (NYSE:KSS) is expected to report earrings of 99 cents on revenue of $5.9 billion. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is expected to report EPS of $2.55, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. That’s on revenue of $27.3 billion.
3. Two medicine-related IPOs
There are two closely watched stock debuts this week. Online health insurer Oscar Health is aiming to raise $1 billion at $32 to $34 a share for a $7.7 billion market value, listing under the ticker OSCR. 
Senior care provider InnovAge Holding is aiming to raise $300 lion, for a $2.4 billion market cap. The company provides care to over 6,600 seniors in 17 centers across five states.

(Reuters) - GameStop (NYSE:GME) and other “meme stocks” mounted a late-day rally on Monday, with shares of the video game retailer climbing nearly 32% at one point on little apparent news. 
Shares of the videogame retailer, along with other stocks favored by retail investors congregating in online forums such as Reddit’s popular WallStreetBets, have roared back in recent sessions after a wild ride in which they soared in late January and tumbled early last month. 
Along with GameStop, which pared gains to close up 18.3%, cinema chain AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) finished up 14.6% and headphone maker Koss added 13.4%.
At one point, GameStop, which closed at $120.40, reached a session peak of $133.99. Its low for the day was $99.97.
Some analysts said a tick higher in short positioning from last week may have provided some fuel for the rally. A short squeeze - in which a flurry of buying forces bearish investors to unwind their bets against the stock - was a key catalyst behind GameStop’s late January run, when it gained as much as 1600% before reversing. 
The number of GameStop shares shorted stood at 17.74 million, analytics firm S3 Partners said on Monday, with short interest accounting for about 32.6% of the float, compared with about 26% a week earlier, according to S3 Partners. Short interest peaked at 142% in early January, S3 data showed. 
""We're definitely seeing some of the shorts who came on over the past week probably covering and it's helping boost today's rally,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3. ""Looking at today's price movement, I'm sure these big red numbers are going to be chasing out quite a few shorts out of their positions.""
GameStop short sellers were down $331 million in mark-to-market losses on Monday, bringing year-to-date mark-to-market losses to $5.1 billion, according to Dusaniwsky. 

More than 48 million shares in GameStop changed hands, with volume surpassing the 10-day moving average. So far the stock is up 539% year-to-dated. However, it was still below its Jan.28 peak of $483.

He had been registered as an agent for MML Investors Services LLC, the broker-dealer arm of MassMutual. 
MML Investor Services filed the termination request for Gill with FINRA on Friday, stating that an internal review of his ""outside activities"" was ongoing. A spokesperson for MassMutual did not respond immediately to a request for comment. 
Gill's last date of employment with the firm was Jan. 28.
A FINRA spokeswoman said a person's registration is terminated when he or she is no longer employed by a registered firm. She declined to comment on specific individuals.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's U.S. extradition hearing resumed in a Canadian court on Monday with defence countering prosecutors' claims that Meng misled HSBC about the Chinese telecom company's relationship with its affiliate while doing business in Iran.
As five days of hearings in the British Columbia Supreme Court started, the defence drilled into the alleged sanction violations that led to Meng's arrest. The daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei is accused by the United States of misleading HSBC about her company's business arrangements in Iran, causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions.
Meng, 49, was arrested at Vancouver's airport in December 2018 on a U.S. warrant and has been living under house arrest in one of the city's wealthiest neighbourhoods while her case makes its way through Canada's courts.
Defence lawyer Frank Addario kicked off a new phase of hearings with an assertion that HSBC's global client relationship manager, tasked with overseeing its dealings with Huawei Technologies, knew that Huawei controlled Skycom Tech Co Ltd's accounts.
U.S. prosecutors allege Skycom operated as a Huawei affiliate in Iran and that Meng misrepresented this relationship. Meng allegedly made statements suggesting Skycom was sold to an arms-length third party, according to the prosecutors, when it was in fact sold to a parent company controlled by Huawei.
Addario countered that HSBC employee emails show that information about Huawei's control of Skycom was shared freely before and after this relationship was first reported in the press by Reuters.
Addario said that U.S. prosecutors’ evidence that HSBC made decisions based on Meng’s statements ""is very misleading in that it underplays the global relationship manager’s knowledge.”
As a result, they demand the extradition case should be overthrown.
Following testimony from Canadian border officials and police officers involved in the case in late 2020, the latest hearings will also focus on Trump's alleged interference in the case, as well as outstanding issues from witness testimony and other abuses of process arguments.
Meng's arrest caused tensions between Beijing and Ottawa, and soon afterward, China detained two Canadians, who continue to have limited access to legal counsel or diplomatic officials.

Meng's case is scheduled to wrap in May.

Faber will remain in the dual position until a new CEO is found and then become nonexecutive chairman. 
The world's biggest yoghurt maker is trying to draw a line under growing pressure from investors over the firm's share price and strategy, which had led to unease at the board level too, people familiar with the group have said. 
Faber was the person who put forward to the board the proposals to separate the CEO and chairman roles and to start the search for a new CEO, according to a statement from the company.
Now in his seventh year as chief executive, Faber has pursued a strategy centred on diversifying into fast-growing products featuring probiotics, protein and plant-based ingredients to mitigate slower growth in dairy.
In recent months and with speculation around an incursion by activist investors growing, Faber announced a plan to cut 2,000 jobs, trim product ranges and sell some assets, including the group's business in Argentina and the Vega plant-based brand.
But U.S. investor Artisan Partners (NYSE:APAM) Asset Managers Inc, now Danone's third-largest shareholder, recently joined activist BlueBell Capital Partners in urging the firm to find a new CEO and speed up efforts to boost returns.
The board on Monday pledged its support for Faber to continue at the helm in the meantime, but said it fully supported a ""local first"" overhaul he had championed to give business units around the world more autonomy, a move that had previously divided some executives. 
Decisions at the board meeting on Monday evening were all unanimous, the company said.
The CEO search could go quickly, a source familiar with the discussions said, and up to eight names of potential candidates were already circulating among board members. 

""It's not something for 2022,"" the person said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.9%, or 603 points. The S&P 500 was up 2.4% and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 3.0%. 
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine received approval from the Food and Drug Administration over the weekend, with about 20 million doses expected to be rolled out this month and 100 million by June. The approval provided a boost to the pace of vaccinations across the U.S., stoking expectations for a stronger reopening just as progress continues to be made on the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill.
The $1.9 trillion fiscal package, which includes $1,400 stimulus checks, was passed by the House of Representatives over the weekend. It is destined for a vote in the Senate.

(Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) on Monday named activist investor Jeffrey Ubben and former Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) executive Michael Angelakis to its board amid a push by prominent shareholders for it to focus more on clean energy and improve its financial performance.
Exxon has fended off attempts in the past to get it to change its policies and leadership, but pressure has mounted since the top U.S. oil producer posted a historic annual loss for 2020 after the coronavirus pandemic slashed energy demand.
The company responded by reducing the value of its shale gas properties by more than $20 billion, cutting spending on new projects by nearly a third, laying off workers and adding $21 billion to its debt to cover spending.
Ubben founded activist investment firm ValueAct and now runs social impact investment firm Inclusive Capital, while Angelakis had served as Comcast's chief financial officer and now runs strategic investment company Atairos.
Exxon said their appointments increased the size of its board to 13 directors, 12 of whom are independent. Earlier this year, Exxon named Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin, a former chief executive officer of Malaysian state energy firm Petronas, to the board.
Exxon said in a statement that Ubben and Angelakis would help the company as it ""advances plans to increase shareholder value by responsibly providing needed energy while playing a leadership role in the energy transition.""
Exxon, which was once America's most valuable company but now has a market value of only $240.6 billion, has faced fresh pressure from investors since late last year. The company is scheduled to hold its annual Investor Day this week.
While running ValueAct, Ubben had long been viewed as a collaborative director who would work behind the scenes instead of publicly calling for the CEO to be fired. 
For the last three years, he has served as a director at energy company AES (NYSE:AES) - he resigned on Monday because he was joining the Exxon board - where he helped the once coal-heavy power generator transition more to renewable energy. AES' share price more than doubled during his time on the board between early 2018 and now.
Industry analysts generally welcomed the board appointments, but some criticized them for not going far enough. 
""It remains to be seen how receptive Exxon’s management will be to this pressure,"" said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst with Raymond James, adding that ""not all board members share Ubben’s focus.""
The move ""looks like a missed opportunity,"" said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at Ceres, a nonprofit organization that works with institutional investors and companies. ""While the two candidates are impressive on their own, their appointments don't do anything to fill the gaps in experience on the Exxon board that have so concerned investors.""
FOCUS ON EMISSIONS
Engine No. 1, a newly formed activist firm, publicly said it is trying to place four new directors on Exxon's board and prominent hedge fund D.E. Shaw said it is working behind the scenes to force change at the company. While best known as a fund that focuses on quantitative analysis, D.E. Shaw has pushed for change at Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) Cos and Emerson (NYSE:EMR) Electric. Engine No. 1's Charlie Penner was involved in many activist campaigns at Jana Partners.
The California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) pension fund is backing Engine No. 1, and other investors formed a coalition to push Exxon into making more sweeping changes.
In the face of that pressure, which some shareholders say will continue even as the new board members begin to advise the company on how it spends its money and focusing more on renewable energy, Exxon has cut its spending plans and disclosed updated emissions targets.
D.E. Shaw said it welcomed the steps Exxon had taken in identifying cost savings and adding Ubben and Angelakis to the board, saying they will bring ""significant capital markets and capital allocation experience to the boardroom and will provide meaningful value to the Company.""
Engine No. 1 said: ""We remain confident our nominees bring the right experience and skills to help put ExxonMobil on a path to sustainable, long-term value creation for the benefit of all shareholders.""
Exxon's shares, which have lagged those of its closest rival  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) by a wide margin in the last five years, jumped 4.9% in trading to $57.02. The shares are up about 40% so far this year.
Since December, Exxon has said it would reduce the intensity of its oilfield greenhouse gas emissions by 15% to 20% from 2016 levels. It did not set an overall emissions target, however, and reducing intensity means that emissions still could rise if oil and gas output grows.

It also announced plans to commercialize technology that helps reduce carbon emissions and disclosed its Scope 3 emissions, a large category of greenhouse gases emitted from fuels and products it sells to customers, such as jet fuel and gasoline.
