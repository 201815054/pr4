0,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 03:37AM ET</span>",Huawei to give staff $286 million bonus for helping it ride out U.S. curbs,"SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies said on Tuesday it will hand out 2 billion yuan ($286 million) in cash rewards to staff working to help it weather a U.S. trade blacklisting. 
The world's largest telecoms equipment provider has said it has been trying to find alternatives to U.S. hardware after the United States all but banned it in May from doing business with American firms, disrupting its ability to source key parts.
The cash is a mark of recognition for work in the face of U.S. pressure, Huawei's human resources department said in a notice to staff seen by Reuters. It will also double pay this month for almost all its 190,000 workers, a company spokesman said. 
The cash rewards will likely go to research and development teams and those working to shift the company's supply chains away from the United States, the spokesman said. 
Details of Huawei's plan were first reported by the South China Morning Post on Tuesday.
Many in the U.S. government believe that Huawei's equipment, particularly its 5G networks, pose a security risk, because of the company's allegedly close ties to the Chinese government. Huawei has denied the Chinese government plays any role in its operations. 
Although granted reprieves from much of the U.S. exclusion, Huawei had been working to find alternatives after it witnessed the crippling effect of U.S. sanctions on its smaller Chinese rival ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063) in early 2017. 

The company is also the world's second largest maker of smartphones and a surge in shipments of devices helped it to report a 27% rise in third-quarter revenue last month.

1,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 03:26AM ET</span>","L'Oreal, Nestle score big at Alibaba's Singles' Day shopping fest","By Brenda Goh and Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI/HANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - Chinese shoppers snapped up food supplements, facial masks and baby milk powder at the world's largest shopping festival, with brands such as L'Oreal (PA:OREP) and Nestle (N:NESN) among the biggest winners,  Alibaba  (N:BABA) data showed.
The Chinese e-commerce giant's annual Singles' Day shopping blitz on Monday brought in a record 268.4 billion yuan ($38.38 billion) in sales, more than six times the amount of online sales made in the United States on Black Friday last year.
It kicked off this year's 24-hour shopping bonanza with a live performance by U.S. pop star Taylor Swift followed by the live-streamed marketing of over 1,000 brands.
Alibaba said on Tuesday that 299 brands surpassed 100 million yuan in gross merchandise value, including LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Givenchy, home appliance manufacturers Dyson and Philips (AS:PHG) and sportswear maker  Under Armour  (N:UAA).
Fifteen brands made over 1 billion yuan in sales, it said. These included Huawei Technologies, Apple (O:AAPL),  Nike  (N:NKE),  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810) and Fast Retailing's (T:9983) Uniqlo.
Food supplements were the most popular import product, while sales of makeup, diapers and face wash were also strong.
Sales growth for the annual shopping festival this year eased to 26%, the weakest since the event started in 2009, in a reflection of how e-commerce sales in China have been slowing.
Analysts, however, said the growth rate had slightly beaten their expectations, saying that more aggressive promotions, a focus on attracting more customers from rural cities, and even the overall slowing economy might have helped as people sought to buy goods at discounted prices.
Citic Securities had predicted a 20-25% expansion, while Daiwa Capital Markets had an estimate of 23%.
""What's happened is that you've had a lot of consumers this year being a little bit more careful about their purchasing because the economy's slowing down,"" said Ben Cavender, managing director of consultancy China Market Research Group.
""I think this year especially, people were kind of waiting for Singles' Day and kind of waiting to make some of those medium-sized purchases that they didn't want to pay full price for.""
The event has been replicated at home and abroad, with Singles' Day promotions found at rivals such as China's JD.com (O:JD) and  Pinduoduo  (O:PDD) as well as South Korea's 11thStreet and Singapore's Qoo10.
JD.com, which started its sales campaign on Nov. 1, said transaction volume exceeded 204.4 billion yuan over the eleven days.
Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing said the online event also boosted visits to its physical stores, of which it has 700 across China, adding that its Heattech thermal underwear and Ultra Light Down jackets were among its most popular items.

 Vodafone  (LON:VOD) raised its profit guidance for the fiscal year ending in March after returning to profit in the three months to September.
The telecoms company reported organic service revenue growth of 0.3% in the first half and forecast adjusted core earnings for the year of 14.8-15.0 billion euros ($16.3-$16.5 billion), up from a previous forecast of 13.8 to 14.2 billion. Excluding one-offs, earnings would be at the top of the prior range.
However, the company also trimmed its free cash flow forecast to “around” 5.4 billion euros from “at least” 5.4 billion earlier, due to potential liabilities arising from legal issues in India.
CEO Nick Read said he expected the trend of revenue growth to continue in the second half, citing an “improved consistency” of its performance and the rapid integration of its Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA) acquisition.

Broadcaster   ITV   (LON:ITV) said it's on track to meet its full-year targets after a strong third quarter. That means advertising revenue will be down around 2% from 2018, partly offset by growth of over 10% in online revenue and growing revenue from its Direct to Consumer business.
The Rugby World Cup helped create a strong start to the fourth quarter with a peak audience of 12.8 million watching England lose the final against South Africa. The company also said it has already reached its 2021 target of 30 million registered users on  ITV  (LON:ITV) Hub ahead of plan.
CEO Carolyn McCall said ""we are confident that we will deliver at least 5% growth in  ITV  (LON:ITV) Studios' total revenues at a margin of 14% to 16%."" The company also upheld its forecast of a dividend of at least 8p per share, a yield of just under 6% at current prices
· 
DCC (LON:DCC) raised its dividend by nearly 10% after posting a 14% increase in adjusted operating profit in the first half of its fiscal year.
Adjusted earnings per share rose 3.0% to 110.2 pence, while the interim dividend rose to 49.5p from 45 pence.
The group upheld its full-year forecast, saying all its divisions are delivering good profit growth, despite what it called the “more difficult economic and market backdrop in the U.K.”
It also said it acquisition of U.S.-based Ion Laboratories is a “material step to build a business of scale in the world’s largest health supplements and nutritional products market.” 

Credit scoring company Experian (LON:EXPN) narrowed its guidance to the top end of the forecast range for the fiscal year ending in March, after posting a 7% rise in organic revenue growth in the first half.
Software firm Aveva (LON:AVV) reported revenue growth of 17% to 391.9 million pounds in the six months to September.
Some 62% of total revenue came from recurring revenue, which was up 42% on the year.
Aveva raised its interim dividend 11% to 15.5 pence per share from 14.0 pence earlier, as it swung to a pretax profit of 24 million pounds from a loss of 5.5 million a year ago.
Engineering group  Meggitt  (LON:MGGT) raised its revenue guidance after a strong third quarter but said its operating margin would remain at the lower end of its expected range of 17.7%-18.2%.
Overall organic revenue grew 11% on the year, “driven by all end market segments and a particularly strong performance in defense.”
It now expects full-year organic revenue to grow between 6%-7% this year, up from a previous range of 4%-6%.

""We see strong demand for digitalization and industrial software within the industries we serve and remain confident in the outlook,"" CEO Craig Hayman said.

Profit before tax rose to $480 million from $470 million a year ago. While basic earnings per share rising to 39c from 35.3c and the dividend rising to 14.5c from 14c.

4,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 02:09AM ET</span>",Giant Aramco listing a critical test for young Saudi exchange,"By Marwa Rashad and Davide Barbuscia
RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - The imminent listing of oil giant Aramco will be a pivotal moment for Saudi Arabia's young and untested Tadawul stock exchange.
The Tadawul has said it has been preparing for years and is primed for the long-awaited share sale in coming weeks. But hosting possibly the biggest initial public offering in history represents a huge leap into the big league for a 12-year-old exchange that only admitted foreign investors four years ago.
Mega-IPOs have a record of causing technical glitches on stock markets as they can lead to a surge in trading orders that swamp an exchange's system and can prevent investors from buying or selling stock. 
Facebook's (O:FB) 2012 listing on Nasdaq, for example, was hit by widespread delays and problems processing the huge volume of orders. And that was a smaller IPO than Aramco's is expected to be, on a marquee exchange with more than four decades of experience; the Nasdaq Composite index today hosts more than $13 trillion worth of shares, according to Refinitiv data, about 27 times the Tadawul's roughly $500 billion. 
Any technical or liquidity problems could deal a blow to the Tadawul's credibility, industry experts say. 
""You have to have really robust technology in order to support the spike that's expected with a high-profile IPO,"" said Spencer Mindlin, an analyst at Aite Group.
For an exchange in an emerging market like Saudi Arabia, the Aramco IPO arguably carries more risk than for an exchange in a country with a more developed capital markets infrastructure, because the IPO will set the tone for the market, he added.
The Tadawul did not respond to a request for comment on its preparedness for the sale.
The exchange might argue though that it has learned from missteps made elsewhere in big listings like Facebook's.
It brought in a new trading platform developed by Nasdaq in 2015, while last year Saudi Arabia's Capital Market Authority introduced a price stabilization mechanism to prevent large share price drops in newly listed companies.
Nonetheless, uncertainty around the exchange's ability to digest the bumper listing represents another potential hazard for investors already rattled by a September attack on Aramco's facilities that underlined the geopolitical risk associated with the state oil company.
Some advisers working on the IPO say the Saudi stock market's ability to handle the deal was one of the main questions coming from investors. 
""They're asking who are the cornerstones, is there liquidity in the market, how much will be leveraged, is there any potential risks with margin calls?"" said one banker, who asked not to be named as he is not authorized to speak publicly. 
ARAMCO FLAGS RISKS
Share sales of the world's most profitable company will begin on Nov. 17, according to the IPO prospectus published on Saturday.
Aramco could offer 1%-2% of its shares, raising as much as $20 billion to $40 billion, sources have told Reuters. A deal over $25 billion would top the record IPO of Chinese retail titan  Alibaba  (N:BABA) on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014. 
The Saudi exchange has been bullish, with its boss Khalid al-Hussan saying this month that it was ""ready to receive the largest listing in the history of financial markets"". 
But Aramco itself has warned the transaction could disrupt trading on the exchange, where the largest listing so far has been worth $6 billion. 
In its IPO prospectus, the company said recent changes to trading mechanisms, to modernize the platform and align with international standards, were ""untested and there can be no assurance that they will adequately facilitate the listing of and expected high trading volume in the shares"".
The changes mean there is now a smaller window between when a company's shares are priced, sold and then admitted to trading, which could risk a delay to the listing, the prospectus said.
The past two years have seen several major investment banks join the exchange as members including Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and Citi (N:C), meaning they can broker and deal there, providing more outlets to help investors to trade.
But volume on the market this year so far is sluggish. 
In 2015, when foreign funds started buying Saudi stocks, the average daily traded value was $1.8 billion. After a sell-off in Saudi stocks in October 2018 following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, volume dwindled, with average traded value in 2019 at $900 million a day. 
""They (the Tadawul) have been working over the past couple of years on improving the market and making it ready for Aramco's IPO, however I don't think they have done stress tests yet,"" said Saudi economist Fadl Alboainain.
'PLENTY OF DRY POWDER'
To avoid the risk of a slew of sell orders hitting the exchange following the IPO - companies listing usually aim for a bounce on their debut followed by relatively steady trading - Aramco plans to grant bonus shares to Saudi retail investors who keep the stock for six months. The Saudi government has also committed not to sell any more shares for at least a year. 
Retail investors, who could snap up as much as a quarter of the shares put up for sale, say they have been preparing for months by saving money, selling land plots and exiting other stocks.
Their attitude could be crucial to how the stock trades as it is still unclear how many international funds will take part in the listing. 
Saudi Arabia's inclusion in the MSCI developing-economies equity benchmark this year has failed to pull in active emerging-market funds because of high valuations and reputational risks, an analysis by Copley Fund Research showed.
One reason investors kept their distance was the murder of Khashoggi, said Steven Holden, CEO of Copley Fund Research.

However, he added: ""The massive underweight does imply there is plenty of dry powder in emerging market portfolios to deploy on Aramco.""

""The offer price of 41 euros per share in cash represents an appropriate valuation of the company from the point of view of the boards,"" the company said in a statement.
Shareholders have until December 5, 2019 to accept the offer, Osram said. 
In the fiscal year ended in September Osram posted a 343 million euros ($377.99 million) net loss, down from a 188 million euros profit in the year-earlier period. 
""Osram does not expect global automobile production to recover in the short term,"" the company said, unveiling plans to cut 220 million euros in costs between 2017 and 2021.
As a result of the downturn, Osram took a 171 million euro goodwill impairment on its Osram Continental joint venture. Osram said it would achieve its medium-term targets two years later. 
Osram said job cuts, efficiency measures and costs related to the takeover resulted in charges of 131 million euros. 
Further job cuts are planned, Osram said, adding that employees at German locations are protected from merger-related layoffs until the end of 2022. 
AMS renewed its takeover attempt of Osram earlier this month, hoping its latest offer would convince investors with a lower acceptance rate and concessions to the German lighting group's management and trade unions.

7,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 12:57AM ET</span>",Quant Funds Exit Japanese Bonds in Worst Sell-off Since 2013,"(Bloomberg) -- Quantitative hedge funds are being blamed for the worst sell-off in Japanese government bonds since 2013 and the evidence is stacking up against them.
Data comprising of open interest positions, fund flow and yields suggest that so-called Commodity Trading Advisors -- funds synonymous with trend-following quant strategies -- could have been cutting their large long positions in Japanese 10-year bond futures.
“We see the recent sharp sell-off in JGBs as driven by CTAs’ substantial selling of JGB futures,” said Koichi Sugisaki, a strategist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) MUFG Securities Co. in Tokyo.
Japan’s 10-year bond yields jumped 12 basis points last week, the most in more than six years. Here’s a look at the evidence against the quants:
Futures-Lead Losses
The recent sell-off looks to have been led by futures, the preferred weapon of choice for CTA funds. The 7-year maturity JGB -- the section underlying the futures -- rose 12 basis points last week and was the worst-performing bond in the yield curve.

Long Positions
Japan’s bond futures 90-day rolling correlation to Hedge Fund Research Inc’s Macro/CTA index reached its highest on record in September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 2013. This close relationship suggests the funds had established a long position in the contracts before the recent sell-off.
Foreign Flow Data
Weekly purchases data from the Japan Exchange Group show that after heavy buying spells in June and August, foreign funds sold the most in six months in the week ending November 1.
Falling Open Positions
Over the past month, the amount of open futures positions has dropped by more than 10,000 contracts, as the price of the securities declined. This would indicate that investors holding long positions in the futures have been selling out.
“The fact that open interest is still declining meanwhile suggests that CTAs have yet to fully unwind their longs,” said Sugisaki. There is “potential for a wave of further selling in JGB futures, irrespective of valuations, depending on how technical signals pan out.”

9,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2019 07:59PM ET</span>",Alibaba's Singles' Day sales hit record $38 billion; growth slows,"By Josh Horwitz
HANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - Chinese retailer  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd's sales for its 24-hour Singles' Day shopping blitz hit a record $38.4 billion, more than U.S. rival Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's haul last quarter from online store sales.
But sales growth for the annual shopping festival eased to 26%, the weakest since the event started in 2009, held back by a slowing e-commerce industry in China as the country's economic expansion heads toward a historic low.
The event https://tmsnrt.rs/2WTFm7V, a gauge of Chinese consumer sentiment, has also become a shop window this year for Alibaba as it plans to sell $15 billion worth of shares in Hong Kong this month. The U.S.-listed firm has spent big to diversify its business yet still earns over four-fifths of revenue from e-commerce.
Alibaba turned China's informal Singles' Day into a shopping event in 2009 and built it into the world's biggest online sales fest, dwarfing Cyber Monday in the United States which took in $7.9 billion last year. The name is a play on the date, Nov. 11, rendered 11/11 - or Double Eleven, as the event is also known.
The event has since been replicated at home and abroad, with Singles' Day promotions found at rivals such as China's JD.com Inc and Pinduoduo Inc as well as South Korea's 11thStreet and Singapore's Qoo10.
Alibaba said on Monday its gross merchandise volume or GMV for the whole event came in at 268.4 billion yuan ($38.4 billion), up 26% from last year but below Citic Securities' forecasts for a 20-25% expansion. 
In 2018, it posted a 27% sales increase. 
CELEBRITY START
The Chinese retail juggernaut, with a market value of $486 billion, kicked off this year's 24-hour shopping bonanza with a live performance by U.S. pop star Taylor Swift followed by live-streamed marketing of over 1,000 brands.
The firm said 84 brands including those of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), L'Oreal SA and Fast Retailing Co Ltd's Uniqlo each made over 100 million yuan in sales in the first hour.
Over half of merchants on its Tmall marketplace used live streaming to sell products during the event, and sales generated through the medium surpassed 10 billion yuan at 8.55 a.m. (0055 GMT), Alibaba said.
""Nearly all our brands have opted for livestreaming promotions some time this year,"" says Josh Gardner, who helps overseas companies sell products on Tmall as CEO of Kung Fu Data. 
""It's more entertaining than browsing through a product detail page. Traffic from livestreaming is easy to convert into transactions, and Tmall has supported stores that run livestreaming activities with resources.""
One vendor, New Zealand-based nutritional supplement maker Clinicians, broadcast livestreams from a booth set up on Alibaba's campus. According to Carlos Zhao, China market manager, the company has seen a 40% jump in sales after it started livestreaming in China six months ago.
""This is a product form from new Zealand, everything is in English, and so many people are selling similar products, so customers wonder, 'Which one do I choose from?'"" he told Reuters. ""Having a livestreamer can help to break those barriers.""
Tmall has said it expects over 500 million users to make purchases this year, about 100 million more than last year. It has also put more emphasis this year on promotions targeting areas outside of China's massive first- and second-tier cities.
""The younger generation is buying more, and the customer from rural areas, the customers from lower-tier cities, they are buying imported products,"" Tmall General Manager Alvin Liu told reporters.
Singles' Day is known to be a stressful time for Alibaba employees with workers sleeping at the office to keep up with orders.
This year, at Alibaba's campus in Hangzhou, workers bustle around in red t-shirts with the slogan 'Make 11 happen'. 
Percussion echoes through halls as departments bang large drums each time a sales record is broken. Pink rice cakes – dingshenggao, or 'victory cakes' eaten by Yue Army soldiers during the Song Dynasty - fill the office snack bars.

This is the first time Alibaba's Singles' Day is being held since its flamboyant co-founder Jack Ma resigned as chairman in September to ""start a new life"".

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Burger King on Monday rolled out a meat-free version of its Whopper burger in 25 European countries, using patties made by  Unilever  Plc (L:ULVR) to strengthen its foothold in the exploding market for plant-based food served in restaurant chains.
Heightened concerns about health and the environmental impact of industrial animal farming are pushing plant-based proteins into restaurant menus and chilled meat aisles in stores. Companies from  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND) to Impossible Foods Inc are competing fiercely for deals with fast-food makers, as plant-based mania spreads across Europe and the United States.
Unilever's meat-free brand The Vegetarian Butcher, which had yet to strike a deal with a major restaurant chain, will supply patties for the ""Rebel Whopper"" to over 2,500 stores in countries including Germany, Spain, Poland and Italy. The burgers will be Burger King's biggest ever product launch in Europe.
Demand for plant-based products has increased over the last couple of years and trying to meet that is crucial, said David Shear, who heads Burger King operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Shear said in an interview that this initial rollout would eventually expand elsewhere in the region.
The Rebel Whopper will be priced similarly to its beef counterpart in Europe - a departure from the norm in North America, where plant-based burgers typically cost $1-$1.50 more than meat patties. For instance, the plant-based Whopper that Silicon Valley-based Impossible Foods makes for Burger King costs $5.59, vs. $4.19 for a beef Whopper. The company, which is owned by Brazilian-controlled 3G Capital via its majority stake in Restaurant Brands International Inc (TO:QSR) said prices may vary between franchises.
Restaurant Brands said last month that the Impossible Whopper had become one of Burger King's most successful launches ever.
Burger King began testing a different version of the Rebel Whopper in Sweden this summer, tying up with Dutch faux meat maker Vivera BV. That contract will eventually be transferred to Unilever, Shear said. Burger King this month starts selling another plant-based Rebel Whopper throughout Brazil, made by meatpacker Marfrig Global Foods SA (SA:MRFG3) in partnership with commodities trader Archer Daniels Midland Co (N:ADM)."
11,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2019 07:09PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Occidental seeks up to $700 million for Anadarko assets in Wyoming, Colorado - sources","By Jennifer Hiller and David French
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) is soliciting bids for oil and gas properties in Wyoming and Colorado that it acquired when it purchased Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), hoping the assets will fetch up to $700 million, according to people familiar with the matter.
Occidental offered about 200,000 acres in the Denver-Julesburg Basin of Wyoming and Colorado that produce $66 million a year in cash flow, mostly in mineral royalties, according to marketing documents. 
RBC Capital Markets is handling the sale, with bids due next month.
Occidental separately has offered its own Midland, Texas, campus, according to a real estate listing https:// The facility was valued at $45.7 million last year, according to county tax records. Spokeswoman Melissa Schoeb said Occidental plans to move its Midland staff to offices Anadarko was building prior to the acquisition. She declined to comment on the sale of Wyoming and Colorado assets.
The two are among a string of smaller asset sales to further reduce the debt load of about $40 billion that Occidental took on with the Anadarko purchase. It has raised about $10 billion so far through sales of properties including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique and production in Africa.
Still, Occidental recently put on hold plans to divest its pipeline unit after failing to attract an attractive offer. It also needs the cash the unit generates, analysts said. 
Selling minerals, smaller assets and real estate ""may help"" analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt wrote in a note on Monday. ""But we believe additional color from management would go a long way in helping the market ascertain how the company plans to bring down absolute leverage in a meaningful way.""
Occidental risks its dividend without ""meaningful and quick deleveraging,"" said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones.
Last week, it said it would cut 2020 capital spending by about 40%, reducing spending in Colorado and Texas.
Shares have slid more than 40% since its interest in Anadarko became public. It closed at $38.90 on Monday, down 3%.
The drilling acreage offered is mostly in Wyoming and includes minerals, properties Occidental operates and some land leased to other producers. People familiar with the offer valued the properties at between $500 million and $700 million. 

Occidental is the largest private landowner in Wyoming, said Pete Obermueller, president of the Petroleum Association of Wyoming. It hold 1 million acres and is mainly focused on development in the Powder River Basin.

The same amount has been offered to the victims by a rival group of noteholders led by Pacific Investment Management Co and Elliott Management Corp, according to the report https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/pg-e-offering-13-5-billion-in-compensation-to-wildfire-victims.
PG&E sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January after massive wildfires struck Northern California in 2017 and 2018, which were blamed on its equipment.
A lawyer for the committee of wildfire victims said last month their claims may be worth $13.5 billion, Reuters reported.
PG&E had previously proposed to provide $8.4 billion in compensation, but the victims sided with the noteholders in the hopes of getting more money.
PG&E and the victims were in talks on Monday, Bloomberg reported.

PG&E did not immediately respond to Reuters request for a comment.

13,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 11, 2019 06:45PM ET</span>",A Record $173 Billion Is Flowing From Korea Into Riskier Assets,"(Bloomberg) -- A hunt for yield is prompting South Korean investors to pile tens of billions of dollars into unconventional assets abroad, raising risks of losses on unfamiliar products.
Holdings of overseas alternative assets such as real estate, infrastructure, private equity and debt, and hedge funds by investors in Asia’s fourth-largest economy rose to at least about 201 trillion won ($173 billion) this year, a record, according to data compiled by Samsung (KS:005930) Securities Co. and Korea Investors Service Inc. That compares with 158 trillion won held by fund managers, pension funds, insurers and brokerages at the end of 2018 and 118 trillion won in 2017.
Korean investors are joining peers around the world in putting more money in alternative assets as equity and bond returns sag. The global amount of such products under management has risen more than three-fold over the past decade to $9.5 trillion in 2018, and it’s forecast to grow to $14 trillion in 2023, according to Preqin data. The assets can expose buyers to bigger risks than conventional securities, because they are often less liquid with less information about them available to the public.
Some signs of trouble are already emerging.
An Australia real estate fund sold by KB Securities Co. is trying to retrieve its investments after a dispute with a local partner, according to a spokeswoman at the brokerage. Institutional investors put 236 billion won in the fund and retail investors parked 90.4 billion won in it.Some derivative-linked securities tied to a German real estate fund sold by Shinhan Investment Corp. extended their maturities because of problems with the underlying assets, a Shinhan spokesman said. About 380 billion won of such securities were sold.Lime Asset Management Co., Korea’s biggest hedge fund firm, said last month it had frozen $710 million in withdrawals from its funds, some of which invested in collateralized loan obligations repackaging trade finance assets.Korean brokerages have more overseas alternative assets on their books that they haven’t been able to sell, and that could pose risks for them, a local ratings firm warned in September. Unsold assets that big brokerages have held for more than six months jumped to 1.3 trillion won at the end of June from about 500 billion won in 2018.“We should learn from those examples and set up an adequate process to mitigate risks,” said Andy Kim, a credit analyst at Samsung Securities. “Selecting asset classes is getting more important among alternative assets due to fierce competition for the products and high valuations.”
Kim expects demand for infrastructure investment to rise further and recommended 5G facilities and European renewable energy projects because those assets are less affected by swings in the economic cycle.
Korean institutions need to boost returns on their investments to help provide for an aging population, and the national pension fund has 708 trillion won in assets. But with a global economic slowdown and sliding interest rates dragging down returns, there are signs that some investors have grown less cautious when opportunities to earn extra yield arise.
Skepticism Needed
Lee Do-yoon, chief investment officer at the Police Mutual Aid Association in Seoul, said that his staff recently suggested that the fund invest in a power plant in New York state because the potential return was high.
“I asked him if he visited the site or if he even knew where the plant was located exactly, and he said no,” said Lee, whose organization oversees about 2.6 trillion won in assets. Lee rejected the proposal.
Lee said he doesn’t think all alternative investments are bad but that fund managers should avoid indiscriminate investment in unfamiliar assets. He said it’s “just nonsense” that funds that avoid junk-rated bonds have no objections to putting their money in direct lending with no credit ratings because it’s considered an alternative investment."
14,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 11, 2019 06:44PM ET</span>",How Trump’s Stock Market Record Stacks Up,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s been three years now since Donald Trump was elected president, which means it’s been three years of listening to Donald Trump bragging about how great the stock market is doing. Contrary to one now-infamous pre-election prediction, it has done quite well.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and other market indices are of course imperfect economic indicators. They reflect investors’ beliefs about how well publicly traded corporations are doing and will do in the future, not necessarily the reality of how publicly traded corporations are doing — or of how well the rest of us are doing. The indices most cited in the media also mainly reflect the fortunes of the largest corporations; even as the Dow and S&P 500 have been setting new records lately, the small-cap Russell 2000 is down 9% from its peak in August 2018.
Still, the advantage of the S&P 500 as a performance indicator is that it is (1) frequently updated, (2) available back to 1926(1) and (3) not subject to measurement error in the way that, say, the unemployment rate or GDP are. Investors might turn out be wrong, but the index itself simply is what it is.
So here’s the total return on the S&P 500, adjusted for inflation, for the first three years after the initial election of every president since Herbert Hoover:
Some prefer to track stock market performance from Inauguration Day, and CNN has a handy online tracker that already does this for Trump and the last few presidents. Trump argues that one should measure from Election Day, and while he surely does so mainly because it makes him look better, he also happens to be right. Market indices are forward-looking metrics, and were already reflecting investors’ opinions on a Trump presidency on Nov. 9, 2016.
Using this approach left the question of how to measure performance under Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson, who took office after the deaths of their predecessors and were subsequently elected. I decided to go with performance from Election Day, but I think the other approach would be equally valid. As for Gerald Ford, he was neither elected nor served for three years, so there was no place for him in this ranking.
Total return measures how much an investment in the companies in the S&P 500 Index would grow if dividends were reinvested in those companies as they were paid out. Dividends were a much bigger part of investor returns before World War II, and even before the 1990s, so any comparison that excludes them overstates market performance under recent presidents. Any comparison that ignores inflation, meanwhile, understates the awfulness of the 1970s stock market and overstates the goodness of the 1980s market.
Stock market performance in first three years since Trump’s election, then, ranks fourth among the 14 elected presidents since Herbert Hoover. That’s pretty good! It’s worth noting, though, that there’s not a whole lot separating him from John F. Kennedy, Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush. A bad week or two, and he could easily fall to eighth place. On the other hand, falling to ninth would take some work, as would catching up to Dwight Eisenhower for third. Put into letter grades, I’d give the market’s performance since Trump’s election a solid B.
What really stands out from this list is how great the 1950s were for stock market investors. The three-year return was higher for Franklin Roosevelt than for Eisenhower and Harry Truman, but prices had just fallen 80% in the four years before he was elected, and they began falling again in 1937. The 1950s bull market, the great market chronicler John Brooks wrote in 1958, “was by practically any statistical standard the greatest boom on record.” If you go by total return and adjust for inflation, perhaps it still is.
(1) That's when Standard Statistics started the daily market index that was the precursor to the S&P 500. Yale economist Robert Shiller has constructed a monthly S&P 500 Index going back to 1871, and it is thus possible to construct rough estimates of total return going back to the Rutherford Hayes presidency, but it would take a lot more work on what is a borderline-silly exercise already, so …"

1. Fed Jawboning on the Menu
Ahead of key testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell due later this week, remarks from trio of Fed speakers due Tuesday will be closely watched for more insight into the central bank’s thinking at a time when many the FOMC to stand pat on rates for the year. 
And President Donald Trump will weigh in on the economy when he speaks to the Economic Club of New York at a Tuesday luncheon. The remarks will be closely scrutinized for information about the U.S.-China trade deal. 
 
Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida is due to speak at 5:30 AM ET (10:30 GMT) followed by  Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker at 1 PM ET and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari at 6 PM ET.
Clarida’s speech will focus on monetary policy, price stability and bond yields.
Powell is scheduled to testify before the Joint Economic Committee on Wednesday and the House Budget Committee on Thursday.
Following the Fed rate cut last month, Fed speakers have largely continued to back the central bank’s decision to ease despite claims that the domestic economy remains in good shape.
2. Weed Stocks in Focus as  Cronos , Tilray Report Earnings
 Cronos  (NASDAQ:CRON) reports third-quarter earnings after the closing bell Tuesday, with the theme of rising sales against soaring costs likely to be on display again as the cannabis producer continues to ramp-up spending to support growth. 
In its previous quarterly report, the company said operating losses would likely widen amid efforts to increase in its investments in R&D, sales and marketing programs.
In August, Cronos announced the acquisition of Redwood’s four operating subsidiaries for $300 million as it looks to break into the hemp-derived CBD (cannabidiol) market.
Cronos is expected to report a loss of 3 cents per share on revenue of $10.41 million.
Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) will also report earnings after bell, with analysts forecasting a loss of 3 cents share on $49.4 million in revenue.
Sentiment in the broader cannabis industry has soured somewhat as the legalization of cannabis in Canada has not delivered the rapid growth many had expected. 
""A psychological shift has take place from everyone wanting to own (cannabis) to everyone involved now feeling burned,"" said Richardson GMP portfolio manager Chris Kerlow. “I think many investors are now over (cannabis).""
3. Tyson Foods Earnings Due
  Tyson Foods   (NYSE:TSN) reports fiscal fourth-quarter results before the market opens.
The company, however, has tempered expectations for the quarter ahead of results after recently cutting its earnings forecast, citing short-term challenges.
Slower-than-expected operational improvements in the chicken segment, margin compression and a fire in one of its beef processing plants were some of the key challenges identified,
Tyson has said it expected full-year earnings in a range of $5.30 and $5.70 per share, 43 cents below previous guidance.
Tyson is expected to report earnings of $1.30 per share on revenue of $11 billion."

The S&P 500 fell 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite was off 0.13%, while the Dow Jones industrials rose 0.04%.
The Dow's gain came because Boeing (NYSE:BA) jumped 4.6% after saying it believes its 737 Max will win recertification from the Federal Aviation Administration by the end of the year, with deliveries reportedly starting in December. It would take two months or so before the planes -- new and grounded -- could go into service.
Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) rose 5.1% on a Bloomberg News report that buyout giant KKR was considering offering to take the company private.
The two stocks alone added nearly 129 points to the blue-chip index by themselves A 0.6% gain for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) added another 14 points with a 0.8% gain, but the other Dow components, especially 3M (NYSE:MMM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS), pulled back enough to offset the first three.
The reason for the pullback for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq was more worries about a U.S.-China trade deal. There was nothing announced Monday, and all traders had to work with were comments last week from President Donald Trump. The first came on Friday when he said he hadn't signed off on rescinding tariffs, set to take effect on Dec. 15. And, while he tweeted Saturday talks were ""progressing nicely,"" that wasn't enough for traders and their computers.
For the past few weeks, the market has been treated with mostly positive news about a deal with a first phase deal signed next month.
The lack of news hasn't threatened the short-term rally that began in September. But it did seem to limit upside gains on Monday after record closes for the major indexes on Friday. In addition, there were no economic reports on Monday because of the Veterans Day Holiday.
Only Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) hit new highs among the Dow stocks on Monday. 
Others hitting new intraday highs on Monday were farm-equipment maker Deere (NYSE:DE), Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI),   Toyota   (NYSE:TM), autoparts maker BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA),   United Rentals   (NYSE:URI) and specialty vehicle maker Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK).
Oil prices moved lower as well. Oil traders believe a deal will boost global oil demand and cut inventories of crude oil in the United States and abroad. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 38 cents to $56.86 a barrel. Brent crude, the global benchmark, dropped 33 cents to $62.18. Both have risen about 5% since the end of September as traders have expected a trade deal. 
Gold futures tumbled in New York$1,459.50 an ounce, down $3.40 an ounce. Also lower were farm commodities like soybeans, wheat and corn. 
The U.S. government bond market was closed Monday for Veterans Day.
Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), Boeing (NYSE:BA), Viacom (NASDAQ:VIAB) and home builder DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) were among the top-performing S&P 500 stocks on Monday. 
Consumer products company Newell Brands (NASDAQ:NWL), casino operator Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), utility company CenterPoint Energy (NYSE:CNP) and copper-and-gold producer Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) were the weakest S&P 500 performers. "

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq stock indexes fell from record highs on Monday as uncertainty about progress in U.S.-China trade talks again rose to the fore following comments by President Donald Trump, while a jump in Boeing shares helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average eke out a slim gain.
Investor hopes of a ""phase one"" trade deal have been a key factor supporting stocks recently, but Trump said on Saturday that the United States would only make a trade deal if it was the ""right deal"" for America, adding that the talks had moved more slowly than he would have liked.
Violence in Hong Kong during protests also cast a shadow on sentiment after the three major averages posted all-time closing highs on Friday, and the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) tallied its fifth week of gains in a row.
""You had negative headlines that were a reason for consolidation after five weeks in a row where stocks moved higher,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee.
""The biggest risk right now is excessive optimism,"" Delwiche said. ""And so if we can have a few days of consolidation where it eases some of that, then that’s a healthy development for the market overall.""
Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors, said that ""a lot of good news is priced into the stock market,"" including the Federal Reserve's interest-rate cuts, third-quarter earnings topping low expectations, signs of a bottoming of economic data, and enthusiasm about a potential resolution to trade tensions.
Investors will be watching for any trade commentary from Trump on Tuesday, when he is expected to speak at The Economic Club of New York.

Boeing shares are the biggest weight in the 30-component, price-weighted Dow, helping the blue-chip index tally another record close on Monday.
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA) shares gained 5.1% after Bloomberg reported that KKR & Co (N:KKR) had formally approached the drugstore giant for what could be the biggest-ever leveraged buyout.

21,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2019 04:08PM ET</span>",WeWork begins search for a new CEO: sources,"By Sheila Dang and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - WeWork has started a search for a new chief executive following the departure of co-founder Adam Neumann, people familiar with the matter said on Monday, as the U.S. office-sharing start-up seeks to reverse its widening losses.
WeWork's current co-CEOs, Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, have only been in place since September, but talks indicated SoftBank Group (T:9984), WeWork's majority owner, is eager for a fresh change after a botched effort to go public this year.
WeWork has been in talks with a number of potential CEO candidates, including U.S. wireless carrier T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) CEO John Legere, the sources said. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Legere's talks with WeWork about the CEO job.
WeWork and T-Mobile declined to comment.
Legere is not a leading candidate for the WeWork CEO role, one of the sources said. Ongoing talks with WeWork could represent a conflict, given that Legere is seeking to renegotiate with SoftBank the $26 billion merger of T-Mobile and Sprint Corp (N:S).
The deal is currently awaiting regulatory approval, and Legere said last week talks were ongoing with Sprint to extend their merger agreement. He declined to rule out requesting that the $26 billion price be reduced.
SoftBank last month spent around $10 billion to take control of WeWork, rescuing the company from potential bankruptcy after it failed to complete an initial public offering, which also led to Neumann's departure.
Neumann, who attracted criticism for his erratic management style, was replaced as CEO by Minson and Gunningham, but speculation has been rife that the pair are only a stopgap solution.
Since taking control of WeWork, SoftBank has already installed its chief operating officer, Marcelo Claure, as the executive chairman of WeWork parent The We Company.
SoftBank has talked about the need to return to WeWork’s core business of renting out trendy office space to freelancers and enterprises. That would pull the company back from the fringe activities Neumann had forayed into, such as education.
In a presentation published last week, WeWork said it also plans to divest seven non-core businesses - Conductor, the Wing, Managed by Q, Meetup, SpaceIQ, Teem and Wave Garden. The units organize meetings, provide facilities and workplace management and marketing.

22,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2019 03:37PM ET</span>",Southwest will speed up inspections of 38 used 737 airplanes after FAA concerns,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) said Monday it will complete inspections on 38 737 airplanes it acquired from foreign air carriers by Jan. 31 that may not meet all U.S. aviation safety requirements.
The planes are part of 88 pre-owned Boeing (N:BA) 737 aircraft Southwest bought between 2013 and 2017 from 16 foreign carriers. The speedier checks come after inspections of 39 used planes turned up previously undisclosed repairs and incorrectly completed fixes. Southwest used multiple contractors to conduct the reviews of the planes' maintenance records when they bought the planes.
""We have a plan in place to inspect the 47 remaining aircraft, nine of which are currently in heavy checks, no later than January 31, 2020 – five months earlier than the original FAA accepted completion date of July 1,"" Southwest said in a statement on Monday.
Southwest said its inspections to date ""did not stem from any suspected safety concerns with the aircraft."" It added its ""continuous assessment of the ongoing inspections has revealed nothing to warrant the expedited timeline"" but will meet it nevertheless.
In 2018, Southwest agreed to conduct a complete physical inspection on each of these pre-owned aircraft over a two-year period after a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) safety inspector in May 2018 discovered discrepancies in records for some of 88 aircraft.
Since then, Southwest said it has completed the nose-to-tail inspection of 41 aircraft without any findings that suggested an ""adverse impact on continued safe operation.""
An Oct. 24 memo from H. Clayton Foushee, director of the FAA Audit and Evaluation Office, made public on Monday said the Southwest inspections turned up at least 30 previously unknown repairs and 42 major repairs that were found ""not to meet FAA airworthiness requirements."" Some required ""immediate corrective action to bring the aircraft back into compliance.""
The memo added ""the data collected to date would indicate that a majority of"" the planes to be inspected do not meet FAA airworthiness requirements.
The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee noted on Monday that the 2018 discovery prompted a full records review by Southwest Airlines of all 88 aircraft that found 360 major repairs previously unknown to the airline because they were not disclosed in the contractors' initial review.
Foushee's memo said Southwest grounded 34 planes in November 2018 for inspections. The committee said as a result some planes were grounded ""for immediate maintenance to bring them into regulatory compliance as a result of these newly discovered prior major repairs.""
The FAA then sent an Oct. 29 letter to Southwest seeking additional information about the uninspected planes and questioned whether they suffered specific damage items. It also raised concerns about Southwest's ""slow pace in completing the evaluation of aircraft.""
Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Roger Wicker said in an Oct. 30 letter to the FAA that its concerns about Southwest's used planes correspond ""to concerns that have been brought to my attention by whistleblowers as part of my investigation into aviation safety.""
The committee said the FAA allowed Southwest to continue to operate these aircraft and as a result ""Southwest Airlines appears to have operated aircraft in unknown airworthiness conditions for thousands of flights.""
The FAA said Monday that after receiving Southwest's response it determined the airline has ""met the requirements for immediate inspection and risk assessments on these aircraft.""

The FAA added it ""is requiring more frequent updates on the progress of completing all the requirements.""

23,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2019 03:36PM ET</span>",Twitter wants your feedback on its deepfake policy plans,"By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) - Social media platform Twitter (N:TWTR) on Monday unveiled its plan for handling deepfake videos and other manipulated media, and called for feedback from the public.
In the run-up to the U.S. presidential election in November 2020, social platforms have been under pressure to tackle the threat of manipulated media, including deepfakes, which use artificial intelligence to create realistic videos in which a person appears to say or do something they did not.
Twitter's new proposal, laid out in a blog post, said it might place a notice next to tweets sharing ""synthetic or manipulated media,"" warn people before they like or share such tweets, or add a link to a news story showing why various sources think the media is synthetic or manipulated.
The company also said it might remove tweets with such media if they were misleading and could threaten physical safety or lead to other serious harm.
It proposed defining synthetic and manipulated media as any photo, audio or video that has been ""significantly altered or fabricated in a way that intends to mislead people or changes its original meaning."" This would include either deepfakes or more manually doctored ""shallowfakes.""
Twitter last year banned deepfakes in the context of intimate media: its policy prohibits images or videos that digitally manipulate an individual's face onto another person's nude body.
While there has not been a well-crafted deepfake video with major political consequences in the United States, the potential for manipulated video to cause turmoil was demonstrated in May by a clip of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, manually slowed down to make her speech seem slurred.
After the Pelosi video,  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg was portrayed in a spoof video on Instagram in which he appears to say ""whoever controls the data, controls the future."" Facebook, which owns Instagram, did not to take down the video.
In July, U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff wrote to the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's  Google asking for the companies' plans to handle the threat of deepfake images and videos ahead of the 2020 elections.
Twitter has opened its new proposal up for public input through a survey and tweets with the hashtag #TwitterPolicyFeedback until Nov. 27. 

Last month, Amazon Inc's (O:AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS) said it would join Facebook and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) in their ""Deepfake Detection Challenge,"" a contest to spur research into the area.

26,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 11, 2019 01:28PM ET</span>",StockBeat: Nvidia off Lows on Wall Street Upgrade Ahead of Earnings,"Investing.com – Nvidia rose slightly Monday, despite overall tech weakness, after some on Wall Street upgraded their outlook on the chipmaker ahead of its quarterly report due later this week.
  Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn) raised its price target on Nvidia to $190 From $160 and maintained its hold rating on expectations that the chipmaker will continue to maintain the high momentum in its rapid growth sectors. 
Nvidia shares were up 0.3%.
""Looking past this quarter/guide, we remain impressed with NVDA's ability to address a wide array of rapidly growing sectors (artificial intelligence, data center, gaming, advanced driver assistance systems/audio-visual, etc.) and expect optimism on these vectors to remain high heading into fiscal 2021,"" Deutsche analyst Ross Seymore said. 
But Seymore tempered expectations for significant upside, warning that even if the chipmaker delivers solid quarterly results later this week, it may only result in an incremental upside as most of the “goodness is already reflected in the shares.”
Deutsche Bank was not the only one on Wall Street talking up the growth prospects of the chipmaker.
UBS lifted its price target on Nvidia to $240 from $195, highlighting the potential growth from the launch of new products next year, which are expected to be in high demand. 
""Performance-focused customers like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are waiting for this product, and others are building it into their 2020 road maps both on cloud and HPC/enterprise sides of the business,"" UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri wrote. 
The latest price upgrades on Nvidia from Deutsche and UBS come after others on Wall Street recently turned more bullish amid expectations that a pickup in data center spending will underpin chip sales. 
Nvidia is up 56% for the year and reports fiscal third-quarter results on Thursday."
27,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2019 01:27PM ET</span>","Smaller, thinner, less sweet snacks? Mondelez makes health drive","BERLIN (Reuters) - Snack maker Mondelez (O:MDLZ) will offer more treats in smaller portions and with less sugar, as the company behind Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate responds to consumer demands for healthier products, underlined by a survey released on Monday.
Under pressure from governments and health advocacy groups in recent years, chocolate companies including Mondelez and Nestle (S:NESN) have raced to develop products with less sugar, in smaller pack sizes and with prominent portion suggestions.
But sugar content in many products is still relatively high against the World Health Organization’s (WHO) suggestion that people should only consume 50 grams of total sugars each day. 
The online survey of 6,068 adults in 12 countries by the Harris Poll for Mondelez showed that 80% of consumers were looking for healthy, balanced snacks, although the same percentage was also still keen on indulgence.
""We know consumers want options which is why we offer a range of products that taste great from wholesome to indulgent,"" Chris McGrath, vice president and chief of global impact, sustainability and wellbeing, told Reuters.
""Consumers appreciate choice and the majority agree there is a time and a place for healthier snacks and a time and a place for indulgent ones,"" she said. ""There is room for both and we see that as a growth opportunity for us.""
In July, Mondelez launched a version of its popular Cadbury Dairy Milk with 30% less sugar in Britain, which McGrath said was selling well and was being extended into India.
The bar still has about 39 grams of sugar per 100g, with six squares accounting for nearly 16% of the WHO daily recommendation. 
Mondelez lifted its 2019 sales forecast last month after reporting a 1.1% rise in third-quarter revenue, driven by higher demand in emerging markets where it has been investing heavily.
It sells a thin version of its Oreo cookies with a third less sugar and a thinner, crispier version of Ritz crackers, which it markets as a healthier option to potato chips.
The Mondelez survey showed 6 in 10 people prefer to eat many small meals rather than a few large ones, with the trend toward snacking even stronger among younger consumers.
""We know consumers are on the go more and more and snacking delivers on the convenience they seek,"" McGrath said.
Mondelez has pledged to put 20% of its products in portion-controlled packs of 200 calories or less by 2025, from more than 15% now, and has also been encouraging customers to snack in a more ""mindful"" way, savoring each mouthful.

To that end, it has given advice to nutritionists and health care professionals on promoting ""mindful eating"", such as putting a portion in a bowl, not eating while also looking at a screen, and eating with your non-dominant hand.

29,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2019 01:04PM ET</span>",Boeing says 737 MAX should resume commercial flights in January; shares jump,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co on Monday said it expected U.S. regulators to approve the return to commercial service of its grounded 737 MAX jet in the coming weeks, and its shares jumped as investors grew more hopeful the planemaker had addressed software problems at the heart of two fatal crashes.
Boeing said it expected the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to issue an order approving the plane's return to service next month, but added it now expected commercial service to resume in January. Boeing shares rose 5% on the company's outlook.
As recently as last week, Boeing said it expected flights could resume by the end of December. On Monday, the company said it was possible that resumption of MAX deliveries to airline customers could begin in December but said getting approval for training changes would take more time.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) said Friday they were pushing back resumption of 737 MAX flights until early March. Major airlines have said they will need at least a month to complete training and install revised software before flights can resume.
""We expect the Max to be certified, airworthiness directive issued, ungrounded in mid-December. We expect pilot training requirements to be approved in January,"" said Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe. 
He added that ""our airline customers will need more time to return their fleets to service and to train all 737 pilots, therefore they have announced schedule updates into March.""
The FAA reiterated that the agency has ""set no timeframe for when the work will be completed.""
Last week, Reuters reported that U.S. and European regulators had not been able to complete a software documentation audit because of significant gaps and substandard documents. The FAA must complete that audit before a key certification test flight can be scheduled.
""We are taking the time to answer all of their questions,"" Boeing said Monday. ""We’re providing detailed documentation, had them fly in the simulators, and helped them understand our logic and the design for the new procedures, software and proposed training material to ensure that they are completely satisfied as to the airplane’s safety.""
Boeing also said it has completed one of five milestones needed: a multi-day eCab simulator evaluation with the FAA to ensure the software system performs as intended even if there is a system failure.
On Friday, the FAA told U.S. lawmakers a preliminary review by a blue-ribbon panel found Boeing's design changes to a key safety system to be safe and compliant with regulations.
The next step will be a multi-day simulator session with airline pilots from the around the world.

The FAA said previously it will need 30 days from the time of the certification flight before it could unground the plane and flights could resume.

Dara Khosrowshahi was backtracking from comments he made in an interview with ""Axios on HBO"" aired earlier in which he compared the Washington Post columnist's murder by Saudi agents inside the kingdom's Istanbul consulate to a fatality caused by one of his company's self-driving cars.
""It's a serious mistake. We've made mistakes too, with self-driving, and we stopped driving and we're recovering from that mistake,"" Khosrowshahi said in the interview. ""So I think that people make mistakes. It doesn’t mean they can never be forgiven. I think they’ve taken it seriously...""
Khosrowshahi later said on Twitter: ""There's no forgiving or forgetting what happened to Jamal Khashoggi & I was wrong to call it a 'mistake.'""
""I said something in the moment I don't believe. Our investors have long known my views here & I'm sorry I wasn’t as clear on Axios.""
Khashoggi's killing sparked a global uproar, tarnishing the image of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
The CIA and some Western governments have said they believe the crown prince ordered Khashoggi's killing. Prince Mohammed has denied that but said he bore ultimate responsibility as the country's de facto leader.
Asked about the CIA's assessment of the crown prince's involvement, Khosrowshahi said: ""I didn't read that part of the CIA report ... but I think from a Saudi perspective, they're just like any other shareholder.""

Also referred to as “Double 11” because it falls on Nov. 11, it’s closely watched by investors keen to gauge how willing Chinese consumers are to spend as economic growth threatens to slip below 6%.
Tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to fuel uncertainty and roil global commerce. Among China’s largest corporations, Alibaba is expected to better ride out the storm, thanks to booming online consumption in the world’s No. 2 economy. On Sunday, Alvin Liu, a Tmall general manager, said Alibaba doesn’t expect any impact on its cross-border import business from an ongoing trade spat.
“Alibaba will probably be the one that will be able to circumvent and come out from the trade war in better shape” versus Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). and Tencent Holdings Ltd., Richard Wong, head of ICT for the Asia Pacific at Frost & Sullivan, told Bloomberg Television. “The current sentiment and confidence in terms of spending is still relatively high.”
While Alibaba and its rivals routinely trumpet record sums in the event’s aftermath, it’s unclear how much Nov. 11 sales actually will contribute to the bottom line given the enormous discounting involved. A good result however could bolster Alibaba’s effort to raise as much as $15 billion in a landmark Hong Kong share sale this month, according to people familiar with the matter.
Singles’ Day emerged as a uniquely Chinese antidote to the sentimentality surrounding Valentine’s Day. Emerging on college campuses across the country, it takes its name from the way the date is written numerically as 11/11, which resembles “bare branches,” a local expression for the unattached.
It’s now become an excuse for people to splurge. Last year, sales at Alibaba climbed 27% to 213.5 billion yuan, equivalent to $30.7 billion at the time. This time, purchases grew 26% from the year earlier. More merchandise is sold online over the 24-hour period than during the five-day U.S. holiday buying spree that begins on Thanksgiving and ends on Cyber Monday.

But the company faced stiff competition this year from smaller platforms including JD.com Inc. and Pinduoduo Inc. -- the aggressively expanding upstart that’s encroaching on the market leaders’ turf. They vied for the wallets of Chinese shoppers particularly in relatively untapped rural areas. All employ heavy discounting and hard-sell tactics in the run-up to and during the 24 hours in a bid to best the previous year’s record.
“Overall, we think this year will likely see a more competitive Double 11 period,” Ella Ji, an analyst at China Renaissance Holdings Ltd., said in a report. “We anticipate each platform will spend more on subsidies.”
Daniel Zhang, who took over as Alibaba chairman from billionaire Jack Ma in September, pioneered the show in its present form in 2015. The Singles’ Day impresario passes the baton this year to Jiang Fan, president of e-commerce marketplaces Taobao and Tmall, and a potential successor to Zhang himself.
“Over the years, we’ve seen consumers become more diverse and younger. Each generation of consumers needs their own peers to serve them,” Zhang said in a post on Alibaba’s blog. “I think this young team is the future.”
The 2019 edition came with slight twists to the formula. Alibaba, stung by criticism it harmed the environment by shipping an estimated 1 billion packages in a single day -- has enjoined its logistics arm Cainiao to set up recycling centers at 75,000 locations. It says it will also work with courier companies to pick up used boxes and wrapping.
An expansion into Southeast Asia and less-developed areas in China plus newer services -- such as transactions on food delivery site Ele.me, grocery store chain Hema and travel service Fliggy -- bolstered the total. The company also brought in livestreamers including Kim Kardashian to appeal to younger buyers.
Other aspects remained the same. Singles’ Day has always been an opportunity for Alibaba to test the limits of its cloud computing, delivery and payments systems. Leaving little to chance, Alibaba sent teams across the nation ahead of Nov. 11 to help myriad outlets prepare for the festival. Some 200,000 brands had been expected to participate in 2019‘s edition of the festival.
“Singles’ Day is becoming popular outside of China, especially in the ASEAN region,” said Patrick Winter, Ernst & Young Asia Pacific managing partner. “You’re also seeing how it’s growing in smaller cities in China.”"

KUALA LUMPUR/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Monday downgraded Malaysia's air safety rating, restricting the country's airlines from adding new flights to the United States.
The FAA's safety rating is based on Malaysia's aviation oversight regime and is an assessment of the country's civil aviation authority. Reuters reported the downgrade earlier on Monday, citing sources. The downgrade does not affect existing flights.
At present, the only Malaysian airline route to the United States is AirAsia X Bhd services from Kuala Lumpur to Honolulu via Osaka, Japan.
The Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM) said in a statement it regretted the decision that stemmed from an April 2019 FAA review but asked the U.S. agency to reassesses its operations within the next year.
The FAA said the rating means that CAAM is deficient in one or more areas, ""such as technical expertise, trained personnel, record-keeping, and/or inspection procedures.""
CAAM said ""in carrying out its duties as an aviation regulator, some shortcomings exist. We wish to emphasize that the assessment only covered CAAM's role as an aviation regulator.""
CAAM said ""plans are already well underway to address the findings of the audit"" with the goal of getting its Category One rating restored.
CAAM added that its chief executive submitted his resignation on Nov. 1 and an executive committee is overseeing its operations in the interim.
A U.S. official told Reuters the U.S. government was working with the CAAM and would help the Southeast Asian country achieve international standards that would give it the top Category 1 rating. 
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he was not aware of the details of the downgrade.
""If there is anything wrong with our civil aviation authority, we will take measures, we will correct the situation,"" he told reporters. 
The new rating means Malaysian airlines are restricted to current levels of any existing service to the United States. They would also be subject to additional inspections at U.S. airports.
Under Malaysia's Category 2 rating, the FAA will also not allow reciprocal code-sharing arrangements between U.S. carriers and Malaysian airlines. 
The downgrade places Malaysia in the same FAA category as neighbor Thailand, which was downgraded to Category 2 in December 2015 and has since tried unsuccessfully to restore its Category 1 rating.
Other countries in Category 2 include Bangladesh, Ghana and Costa Rica.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS (S:UBSG) was fined HK$400 million ($51.09 million) by Hong Kong's securities regulator for overcharging up to 5,000 clients for nearly a decade, the watchdog said on Monday.
The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said in a statement that an investigation found UBS had overcharged clients on 'post-trade spread increases' and charges in excess of standard disclosures and rates between 2008 and 2017.
The fine is the equal to the largest ever levied on a bank in Hong Kong. In 2017, HSBC's (HK:0005) private banking unit was also fined $HK400 million over the sale of Lehman Brothers structured products to customers for five years from 2003. 
THE SFC said the investigation exposed 'serious systemic internal control failures' at the bank. UBS had failed to disclose conflicts of interests and had overcharged some clients in 'opaque' trades, it said.
The overcharging affected 5000 Hong Kong managed client accounts in about 28,700 transactions, it said.
UBS has also agreed to repay the clients HK$200 million, the SFC said.
The regulator said the over-charging occurred in the bank’s wealth management division on bond and structured notes transactions. 
UBS was found to have increased the spread charged after the execution of a trade without the clients' knowledge, it said.
In the statement, the SFC said UBS was also found to have falsified some account statements which were issued to financial intermediaries who were authorized to trade for the clients to ""conceal the overcharges"".
UBS said the issues were 'self-reported' to the SFC and the results found were against the bank's standard practice.
""The relevant conduct predominantly relates to limit orders of certain debt securities and structured note transactions, which account for a very small percentage of the bank's order processing system,"" the bank said in a statement.
SFC chief executive Ashley Alder said while each ""overcharge represented a fraction of each trade"" the bank's ""misconduct involved decisions and a pervasive abuse of trust resulting in significant additional revenue for UBS to which it was not entitled"".
In March, the SFC banned UBS from leading initial public offerings in Hong Kong for a year after it found the bank, and some of its rivals, had failed to carry out sufficient due diligence on a number of deals.
UBS was fined HK$375 million while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) was fined HK$224 million, Merrill Lynch HK$128 million and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) (StanChart) HK$59.7 million, all for failures when sponsoring, or leading, public market floats.

Kalanick, 43, a director at the ride-hailing company, sold 20.3 million shares worth about $547 million that were held in a trust, according to a regulatory filing on Friday.
The trades came after a 180-day lockup period restricting insider and early investor sales following May’s initial public offering. They were among the large stake disposals last week that pushed the stock down to an all-time low.
Uber has underwhelmed investors in the public markets so far. Its shares have tumbled 40% since the IPO, dropping the San Francisco-based firm’s value from almost $76 billion at its listing to about $46 billion as of Friday.

The oil behemoth said over the weekend in its offering prospectus that as much as 0.5% of the stock will be allocated to individual investors, while leaving potential buyers in the dark about the size of the stake it plans to sell and the pricing range.
Were the company to fetch a valuation of $1.5 trillion -- lower than the range aimed for by Saudi Arabia, but closer to estimates by foreign investors -- the portion set aside for individuals could be $7.5 billion. Some locals have been selling part of their equity portfolios recently to raise cash for Aramco stock, according to analysts and investors.
Before the massive IPO was confirmed, locals had already been consistent net sellers this year, stepping up their disposals during times of heightened geopolitical concerns, such as the aftermath of September drone attacks on oil facilities. Foreigners, on the other hand, have been steady buyers, followed by local institutional funds. This flowed mostly from the kingdom’s promotion to major emerging-market equity benchmarks, which triggered passive buying by global funds."

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Latin America, long a safe haven for Uber, was the biggest weak spot in the money-losing company’s latest financial results, registering just 2% growth, the worst of any region.
The main culprit: Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride-hailing behemoth that has grown rapidly in Latin America. 
Both Uber (N:UBER) and Didi are backed by the same investor - SoftBank Group (T:9984) - highlighting how the Japanese conglomerate's investments sometimes clash, especially in Latin America, where it has pledged to invest billions of dollars in a blossoming tech sector.
The infighting is nowhere more pronounced than in Mexico, where Uber is facing its first serious competitor in Didi, which has grabbed about 30% market share in the cities where it operates since launching in the country last year, according to former Didi employees. Market share fluctuates, and Didi's falls above and below that mark in some cities.
Uber Eats, the company's food delivery service, faces fierce competition from Colombia's Rappi, which SoftBank pumped $1 billion into earlier this year. 
Didi also has a significant presence in Brazil, where it bought local ride-hailing company 99 last year and operates under that brand. But in Mexico, investors see a key test of Didi’s ability to build an international operation from scratch and Uber’s ability to defend its turf, said James Cordwell, a London-based analyst with Atlantic Equities. 
“What happens in Mexico has global significance,” he said.
Didi said in a statement that it sees ""tremendous opportunity for growth"" in Latin America.
""Currently, less than three in 10 Mexicans use ride-hailing, and barely one in 10 are using food delivery,"" Didi said. ""We’re really excited about where we are at after just 18 months here.""
Spokesmen for Uber and Softbank each declined to comment. 
Investors are also studying how SoftBank manages those competing investments. The conglomerate is still reeling from the fallout from its investment in shared workspace provider WeWork, which recently pulled its initial public offering.
Spanning 32 cities, Didi’s presence in Mexico is its largest outside of China under the Didi brand. The toll its growth has taken on Uber is plain. 
During the first three quarters of the year, Latin America was Uber's worst performing region, although a weakening of the Brazilian real and economic weakness also hit results, Cordwell said. 
The competition among SoftBank's investments extends even to food delivery, where Didi is also launching a service in Mexico. Despite the presence of both Uber and Rappi, the market has reached just 14% of Mexicans, Daniel Serra, a city manager for Didi Food, said in an interview. 
Competition, aside from taxis, is a new phenomenon for Uber in Mexico. Prior to Didi’s arrival, Uber held 87% of the Mexican ride-hailing market, according to an August 2017 study from Dalia Research, a Berlin-based consumer research firm. Its market share exceeded 90% in some cities, according to a former employee.
Now, Uber, long the premier destination in Mexico’s tech scene, has lost not just market share but also a steady stream of talent to companies such as Didi, Rappi and India's Oyo Hotels and Homes, a SoftBank-backed hospitality startup, according to a review of LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profiles. Even Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick’s CloudKitchens startup has hired at least one former Uber executive in the region, people with knowledge of the matter say. 
The blows from Didi have stung most. The company has systematically pursued its rival’s business, deploying its employees to hail Uber rides to recruit drivers and planting its centers for driver assistance beside Uber’s. In the central city of Toluca, where Didi made its debut, the company sought to place its driver center in the same shopping complex as Uber, but Uber blocked the move, according to two former Didi employees.
As it plotted its entry into Mexico, Didi decided to compete on price, offering lower fares to consumers and better earnings to drivers, former employees say. The company identified 30% market share as a key milestone at which it could have a critical mass of both riders and drivers. It handily made the goal in most markets, the former employees said. 
Yet Didi has also taken care to avoid a price war. Didi’s launch in the western city of Guadalajara was delayed, and when it finally occured, it enjoyed pent-up demand from both riders and drivers, according to two former employees. The company’s market share soared to well over 30% in less than a month, prompting Uber to counter with a generous promotion for drivers. 
Didi responded by matching Uber’s promotion, rather than exceeding it, trying to signal that it did not want a fight, according to the former employees. From there, both companies gradually reduced their discounts in that market. 
Still, even in Didi’s gains, there is some upside for Uber. Reflecting the tangled web of connections between the companies, Uber also holds a stake in its rival, a term of its 2016 deal to cede the Chinese market to Didi. 
“Uber would like to win in Latin America itself, but if it does lose share to Didi at least there’s some offset,” Cordwell said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shares around the globe fell on Monday, buffeted by escalating violence in Hong Kong that pushed Asian stocks to their worst day since August and stoked demand for the safe-haven yen and gold. 
In the 24th straight week of pro-democracy unrest, Hong Kong police shot and wounded a protester as the Chinese-ruled territory saw rare working-hours violence.
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, slipped 0.2%, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (HSI) falling 2.6% and leading losses across Asia. 
There, MSCI's widest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 1.2% from six-month highs to set a course for its worst day since late August. Chinese blue chips (CSI300) dropped 1.8%.
The nerves spread to Europe, too. 
The broad Euro STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.4%, with London shares (FTSE) losing 1.1%. Wall Street futures gauges also suffered, suggesting losses of around 0.4% (ESc1).
Some investors said markets could be affected by any further escalation of the violence in Hong Kong, where protesters are angry about what they see as police brutality and meddling by Beijing in the freedoms guaranteed to the former British colony.
""At some stage I think it is likely that there will be a more fully-fledged crackdown,"" said Stéphane Barbier de la Serre, a strategist at Makor Capital Markets. 
""And if you see a crackdown, you could see markets collapsing.""
The violence sent investors running for assets perceived as safe havens and away from riskier currencies. 
Gold rose 0.5%, rebounding from a three-month low touched on Friday to reach $1,465.36 per ounce. 
The Japanese yen , which often strengthens in times of global political or economic turmoil, strengthened 0.3% against the dollar. China's yuan, in contrast, weakened 0.3% to 7 per dollar in offshore trade . 
Sterling  gained 0.3% against the dollar after figures showed that Britain's economy had dodged a recession - but grown at its slowest annual pace in almost 10 years.
It was last trading at $1.28. 
The GDP data compounded a warning from Moody's on Friday that it might cut its rating on Britain's sovereign debt again, as it lowered the outlook on Britain's current rating to negative from stable. 
TRADE WAR 
Investors were also focused on the U.S-China trade talks. 
After a bout of optimism last week over prospects that Washington and Beijing could reach an initial deal to alleviate their 18-month old dispute, doubts gnawed at markets again. 
On Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump said talks had moved more slowly than he would have liked. He said reports that the United States was willing to lift tariffs were incorrect, adding that Beijing wanted a deal more than he did.
Still, some market players said Trump's comments fitted an established pattern of optimistic rhetoric being followed by a more skeptical tone. 
A deal was still likely, they said. 
""It's the usual two steps forward and one step backwards,"" said Adam Cole, head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
""We are probably still moving in the direction (of a deal), and that's the way the market is priced on balance.""
The uncertainty over trade weighed on commodities markets commodities. 
Oil lost 1.3%, with concerns over trade and worries about oversupply weighed on the market. Brent crude was down 82 cents to $61.88 by late morning. 
In Europe, Spanish government bond yields held their ground after a weekend election delivered a fractured parliament and set the stage for difficult talks to form a ruling coalition.
The far-right surged in the poll, the fourth in as many years. Spain's 10-year bond yield was flat at 0.40% (ES10YT=RR). 
Most other major bond yields across the euro zone were little changed, holding below highs reached on Friday as investors showed scant appetite for risk in the wake of the Hong Kong violence. 

U.S. bond markets were closed for the Veteran's Day holiday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Two years after a fire killed 71 people at London's Grenfell Tower, insurance premiums for building contractors, architects and surveyors have surged by as much as several hundred percent, risking future projects, industry sources say. Combustible materials used to refurbish Grenfell were central to the chain of events in June 2017 that turned an ordinary kitchen fire into an inferno, an official inquiry said last month.
As a result, insurers are increasingly excluding cladding from professional indemnity (PI) policies which protect construction professionals against negligence claims.
""Professionals are finding it harder to access cover in the UK market and premiums are rising,"" said one PI insurer, adding that ""the range varies wildly - from 10% to well in excess of 100%"".
David Stocks, construction PI broker at Gallagher, said that for building contractors, rate increases could vary from 10% to 300-400%, though the average was 50-100%.
A spokeswoman for the Royal Institute of British Architects said ""a doubling or tripling of premium is not uncommon"".
The difficulties of finding insurance could affect refurbishment and construction projects, including government targets to increase housebuilding, the sources said.
""We are reaching a point where I am really fearful that if a building has fire-resistant cladding issues, professionals will be reluctant, or even unable, to become involved,"" said chartered surveyor Peter Vinden, chief executive of The Vinden Partnership.
A review of building regulations and fire safety in England in 2018 said the regulations were ""not fit for purpose"" and called for a ""radical rethink"" of the system.
Scotland and Australia are also reviewing building regulations.
Insurers are nervous about the interpretation of building regulations as a result, leading them ""to question what they are actually insuring the construction sector for,"" said Laura Hughes, manager, general insurance at the Association of British Insurers.
Some insurers have pulled out of the PI insurance market this year after several years of losses. The shortage of insurers has contributed to the rise in prices, sources said.
Britain's International Underwriting Association last week set up a construction committee to work with the industry, government and regulators to address the lack of PI cover.
A spokeswoman for Britain's housing ministry said the government was ""exploring potential solutions"" to the problem, but said she was unable to give more details ahead of UK elections next month.
HIGH-RISE
The government introduced a ban in December 2018 on the use of combustible cladding in new or refurbished buildings above 18 meters high.
But insurers have shown caution, looking beyond high-rise buildings. They brought in broad exclusions last year for the type of combustible cladding used at Grenfell, and extended the exclusions this year to non-combustible cladding and other aspects of fire safety, insurance sources say.
Insurers are asking clients to fill in more detailed questionnaires about cladding, and are in some cases cutting the limits of the cover they will provide or increasing the excess clients must pay.
In property insurance, the impact has been less severe but premiums for buildings with combustible cladding have risen 25-50% this year, compared with an average rise in property insurance rates of 5% or less, said David Williams (NYSE:WMB), managing director for underwriting and technical services at AXA Insurance."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Airbnb, Chobani, Western Union and a dozen other companies are urging the withdrawal of a Trump administration proposal to slow down the work permit approval process for asylum seekers.
The companies - joined by Uniqlo, Ben & Jerry's, DoorDash and others - spoke out against a recently proposed regulation in a letter sent to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on Friday.
""We are concerned that the proposed rule would hurt our ability to attract and retain talent,"" they wrote. ""Many of the undersigned companies already have asylum seekers in our workforce and many will have need to hire members of this population in the months ahead.""
The proposed regulation is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to crack down on asylum seekers. The president and his top officials have argued that most migrants who request asylum in the United States lack valid claims and seek the status for economic reasons.
Asylum seekers can apply for a work permit 150 days after making a claim for protection in the United States. Under existing regulations, immigration officers must approve or deny such a request within 30 days.
But the administration argues the requirement for a quick turnaround monopolizes resources that could be used elsewhere. In September, USCIS, the agency that handles the applications, proposed a regulation https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/09/09/2019-19125/removal-of-30-day-processing-provision-for-asylum-applicant-related-form-i-765-employment to eliminate the 30-day deadline.
A USCIS spokeswoman said she could not comment on the companies' letter due to the ongoing regulatory process. Acting USCIS Director Ken Cuccinelli said in September the proposed change would allow for better vetting and security procedures.
Adding to the barriers for asylum seekers, the administration announced https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/11/14/2019-24366/us-citizenship-and-immigration-services-fee-schedule-and-changes-to-certain-other-immigration on Friday in a separate proposal that it will publish a regulation that would impose a $50 fee on certain asylum applications.
The charge would be the first of its kind for U.S. asylum requests. An analysis by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security found that only three countries - Australia, Fiji and Iran - charged a fee for initial asylum applications.
At the same time, the administration proposed raising fees for U.S. citizenship applications to $1,170, an 83% increase.
Christopher Miller, an activism manager with Ben & Jerry's, said in a statement that the company opposed the fee changes.
""These policies are disappointing but not surprising from an administration that is doing everything it can to build walls and keep people out,"" he said."

The spin off comes as America's biggest solar power developers, including SunPower, have been stockpiling panels to meet the increased demand from a 30% federal tax credit to buyers that will start phasing out next year.
SunPower is majority owned by French energy giant  Total  SA (PA:TOTF).
The companies will be called SunPower and Maxeon Solar Technologies, SunPower said, adding that it will maintain its corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley and that Chief Executive Officer Tom Werner will continue in his position.
Jeff Waters, chief executive officer of SunPower's Technologies business unit, has been appointed head of Maxeon Solar that will be headquartered in Singapore.
At the time of separation, expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2020, the two businesses will enter into a multi-year exclusive supply agreement covering sales within the United States and Canada of products manufactured by Maxeon Solar.
As part of the deal, SunPower's long-time partner Tianjin Zhonghuan Semiconductor Co, Ltd will make an investment of $298 million in Maxeon Solar.
The separation is expected to occur through a spin‐off of all the shares of Maxeon Solar held by SunPower to SunPower shareholders, followed by the TZS investment."

BEIJING/LONDON (Reuters) - China's Jingye Group is in talks to buy British Steel, it said on Monday, in a deal estimated to be worth 70 million pounds ($90 million) that could protect thousands of British jobs.
Any agreement would be of major political significance in Britain as it prepares to elect a new government on Dec. 12. The lack of opportunities in northern England, where British Steel is based, is an election issue, as the social gap between north and south widens.
A deal is not yet finalised, Jingye told Reuters following a BBC report of an imminent 70 million pound ($90 million) agreement.
A spokeswoman for Hebei-based Jingye Group, a private company, said she was unclear about the value and whether further details would be announced this week.
Gareth Stace, director general of industry lobby group UK Steel, also told Reuters nothing had been finalised.
""I would be surprised if it did not get finalised,"" he said. ""But it's not a done deal.""
No-one from British Steel was immediately available for comment.
The company was put into compulsory liquidation on May 22 after Greybull Capital, which bought the firm for one pound from  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC) three years ago, failed to secure funding to continue its operations.
Its closure would impact 5,000 jobs in Scunthorpe and a further 20,000 jobs in the supply chain.
EMBRACE CHINA
Turkey's military pension fund OYAK said in August it had reached a provisional agreement to take over British Steel but that deal has not been finalised.
Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, set up to boost the economy in the north of England, said a rescue deal would be ""very welcome news"".
He said it was time to embrace cooperation with China, which is extending its international reach through its Belt and Road global development strategy. Chinese companies have also bought a steel plant in Serbia and its sole copper mine.
Chinese ownership is contentious, especially in the steel industry. The European Union, which does not include Serbia, has sought to protect its own steel industry from competition from cheap Chinese imports.
Britain has said it will leave the economic and political bloc, but has yet to agree a departure deal.
An advantage of Jingye, a multi-industry business specialized in iron and steel, is that it knows the industry and has the ability to invest, industry sources say.
With 23,500 employees and registered capital of 39 billion yuan ($5.58 billion), Jingye Group ranks 217th among the top 500 enterprises in China."

Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to meet his Brazilian counterpart in Brasilia this week -- their second meeting in less than a month -- during a summit of the BRICS group which also includes Russia, India and South Africa.
“I am confident in terms of the cooperation between China and Brazil over 5G technology”, China’s Ambassador to Brasilia Yang Wanming said in reply to emailed questions. Brazil “will take into account its own development interest” when it analyzes Huawei’s bid, he added.
Yang said that Brazil’s attitude toward Huawei has remained objective and rational amid a campaign of “bad faith and defamation” from the U.S.
Security Concerns
U.S. officials have warned their allies against relying on Huawei components in their 5G networks, saying this would facilitate spying by Beijing. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reiterated the warnings in a speech in Germany on Friday, saying the company can’t be fully trusted, since it is under the thumb of China’s ruling communist party.
For the past decade, China’s vast appetite for raw materials such as iron and soy beans have made it Brazil’s top trading partner. Chinese companies also invest heavily in Latin American nation, which is seeking foreign companies to participate in Bolsonaro’s program of privatizing hundreds of billions of dollars of state assets.
At the same time, Bolsonaro is a close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, and Washington has warned that it could downgrade security cooperation with Brazil if it gives the Chinese technology company the go-ahead.
Xi will hold a separate bilateral meeting with Bolsonaro this week during the BRICS summit. Huawei is expected to bid in Brazil’s 5G auction next year.
In the email interview, the Chinese Ambassador also ruled out any change in Beijing’s support for Nicolas Maduro’s administration in Venezuela. Brazil has requested its allies to instead recognize National Assembly president Juan Guaido as the legitimate president."

LONDON (Reuters) - British banking heavyweights HSBC (L:HSBA) and RBS (L:RBS) are launching new digital banking platforms, as competition for digitally savvy customers steps up in the face of a wave of online startups.
HSBC rolled out a new app-based business banking service - previously known internally as 'Project Iceberg' and now named 'HSBC Kinetic' - in beta testing mode on Monday, while RBS is putting the finishing touches to its new digital bank Bo ahead of a public roll-out later this month.
Britain's high street lenders are investing billions of pounds in new or refreshed digital services to meet growing customer demand. But they are playing catch-up when it comes to matching the technology of fast-growing startups like Monzo, Starling and Tandem.
HSBC Kinetic will offer small businesses mobile-managed current accounts, overdrafts and spending and cashflow insights generated by the app crunching data on a company's spending habits.
Peter McIntyre, head of UK small business banking for HSBC, said the bank hoped to sign up hundreds of thousands of customers to Kinetic and to roll it out to other countries where HSBC operates.
The service has been developed by around 150 staff in London working away from HSBC's Canary Wharf corporate headquarters.
McIntyre said he was undeterred by launching Kinetic in choppy economic conditions in Britain, with recent official data showing company insolvencies hit a five and a half-year high in the third quarter this year.
""I think this is the best time to do it, to bring more financial insight to customers at a difficult time,"" he said.
A full launch of the service, which links into HSBC's existing back-end banking system, is expected in the first half of next year.
RBS's standalone bank Bo is preparing for a public launch this month from offices in London's West End.
The Bo app is designed to encourage customers to budget and save better, alerting them if they overspend.
It is targeted at the 16.8 million Britons with less than 100 pounds ($128)of savings.
RBS hopes it will bring in lower cost deposits than the bank's main retail brands as it is built on a leaner banking platform, with an estimated cost per consumer of 80 pounds a year, rather than 150-200 pounds at RBS."
59,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2019 06:13AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Hedge fund Whitebox places big bet on gunmaker Remington,"By Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Whitebox Advisors LLC, a credit-focused hedge fund, has been quietly capitalizing on Wall Street's ambivalence toward gun manufacturers by replacing some banks as a lender to Remington Outdoor Company.
Whitebox, whose assets under management have grown from $2 billion to $6 billion in the last six years, became a major lender to Remington this year, according to people familiar with the transactions that allowed it to build its position. 
Minneapolis-based Whitebox refinanced a $193 million loan to Remington that had been provided by seven banks, according to the sources. Many of the banks have been under pressure from their customers and some politicians to sever ties with the gun industry.
Remington, the maker of an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle used in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting of six adults and 20 children in 2012, filed for bankruptcy in 2017 amid declining gun sales. It exited bankruptcy last year, but still faces a lawsuit from the families of the Sandy Hook victims in the U.S. Supreme Court over its role as a gun manufacturer.
Whitebox's investment in Remington illustrates how some hedge funds, whose investors include pension funds, financial institutions and high-net-worth individuals, do not share the same reputational concerns as many banks. It also underscores the emergence of hedge funds as ""shadow banks,"" replacing traditional lenders to companies.
""Given the baggage of these particular loans for banks that are public companies, it is an invitation to hedge funds to get in and relieve the bank of an asset they don't really want to hold,"" said Campbell Harvey, a professor finance at Duke University. ""A hedge fund is a private entity, it doesn't need to answer to public shareholders."" 
Whitebox, which was a creditor of Remington before it filed for bankruptcy, first stepped in to replace Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) as a lender last year, according to the sources.
The bank had vowed it would stop financing ""military-style"" weapons during Remington's bankruptcy, after a former student of a Parkland, Florida, high school massacred 17 people with an assault rifle in February 2018.
Whitebox bought Bank of America's $43.2 million portion of a $193 million asset-backed loan to Remington at a discount to its face value, one of the sources said. That left six other banks still participating in the loan.
Whitebox doubled down on its investment this spring, helping Remington refinance the asset-backed loan, the sources said. The loan, which Remington arranged as part of its bankruptcy last year, had a three-year maturity, and it is not clear why Remington pursued the refinancing.
The loan that WhiteBox extended has dibs on Remington's assets, protecting Whitebox in any future debt restructuring, one of the sources said.
Whitebox is now the only holder of that loan, that source added.
Whitebox declined to comment.
Previously,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, as well as regional banks Synovus Financial Corp, Regions Financial Corp (NYSE:RF), Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) and BB&T Corp (NYSE:BBT), had held portions of the loan.
A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment specifically on Remington, but said ""the bank has not picked a side in the gun violence prevention debate like some of its big bank peers."" 
""We do not believe that the American public wants banks to decide which legal products consumers can and cannot buy,"" the Wells Fargo spokesman said.
Deutsche Bank, Bank of America, Regions Financial, Synovus Financial, Fifth Third and BB&T all declined to comment. Remington did not respond to a request for comment.
Some 30 potential lenders turned down Remington for bankruptcy financing in 2017, many citing public backlash against firearms as the reason, according to a bankruptcy court document at the time. 
Private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, which lost control of Remington in the bankruptcy, had promised to divest the company following the Sandy Hook shooting, but ended up only allowing some of its buyout fund investors to exit their position.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management and Franklin Templeton Investments, which were previously Remington's biggest creditors, became its owners following the bankruptcy.
WHITEBOX ASSETS 
Whitebox has not financed a gunmaker other than Remington, one of the sources said. The hedge fund has been stepping up its bets on distressed debt, and has been involved in the restructuring of Puerto Rico's debt, department store Sears' bankruptcy and gaming company Caesars Entertainment Corp. 
Whitebox's longest-standing fund has seen annualized returns of more than 16% since inception, according to one of the sources. Its founder, Andy Redleaf, stepped down this year, passing the baton to senior portfolio managers Rob Vogel and Paul Twitchell.
Remington still makes AR-15-style weapons that are lightweight and known for their ""hair-splitting"" accuracy, according to its website. Some of the guns are marketed for hunters of coyotes, foxes and bobcats.

The gun company continues to face a challenging retail environment, with one of its biggest outlets for sales, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, saying this year it would stop selling ammunition for handguns and some assault-style rifles in its stores.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - More than two years ago,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) told investors it would find $5 billion in fresh annual revenue by 2020. Now, the bank may move away from that goal to focus on a wider range of metrics.
The new targets, to be outlined by Chief Executive David Solomon's management team in January at Goldman's first-ever investor day, could include a broad efficiency ratio and profitability measures, four sources familiar with the matter said.
They could also include narrower items, such as goals for Goldman's fledgling retail bank, Marcus, according to some of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The change of focus signals that Goldman wants to match rivals that disclose progress toward broader targets, and satisfy demand among investors for transparency across all the bank's businesses, according to the sources, who cautioned that plans for the investor day are still taking shape and could change.
The shift also illustrates how, under pressure from investors unhappy with a near-20% fall in its share price since March last year, Goldman is having to overhaul the way it communicates with shareholders.
""Right now the story is we're Goldman Sachs, trust us and we'll generate good returns. The collective investment community is saying that doesn't cut it,"" said  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Mike Mayo. ""They need to provide something that increases confidence so, for the first time ever, they're going to lift the curtain behind the scenes at Goldman Sachs.""
Goldman declined to comment on the $5 billion goal or what new targets might be unveiled at the investor event in January. It referred Reuters to an interview on Tuesday in which Solomon said there would be no major disclosures.
""We've got very, very good businesses that we're very proud of and we'd like to evolve those businesses a little bit. I wouldn't expect any big reveal,"" he told Bloomberg TV.
The $5 billion target was at one time a crucial benchmark for whether Goldman could transform itself from a Wall Street trading house with stalling profits into a more diversified bank with potential to grow, analysts said.
In the early days of his tenure it was also an important metric for Solomon, who took the reins from longtime CEO Lloyd Blankfein in October 2018. The 57-year-old was a key architect of Goldman's overhaul plan in his prior role as operating chief, sources within the bank said.
Goldman executives said a year ago that the bank was ahead of schedule on the $5 billion goal.
There is a lot of appetite among investors for information about Goldman's progress reducing its reliance on unpredictable trading revenues and growing more stable businesses, some analysts said.
Solomon had initially planned to launch a strategic update in the spring of 2019. But he postponed it until January, saying he wanted to get it right rather than rush it.
Goldman has had little choice but to re-invent itself.
The bank's profits were stifled by tougher regulations after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, changing customer preferences and technology shifts that made some businesses less profitable.
Goldman was also more skewed than its rivals toward trading, and it has seen pretax earnings in that part of the business fall 84% from 2009 to 2018, according to regulatory filings. Those profits are down another 7% so far this year.
Goldman shares are trading at 0.9 times the value of its assets, among the lowest of the biggest U.S. banks."

  BP   Plc, (LON:BP) Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc, (NYSE:RDSa)   Total   SA (PA:TOTF) and Vitol Group are among companies taking stakes in a new ICE-operated crude futures exchange in Abu Dhabi, according to people familiar with the matter.
Intercontinental Exchange Inc. Chairman Jeffrey Sprecher confirmed the partnerships, speaking on Monday to reporters in Abu Dhabi. Other partners in the emirate’s oil exchange are Petrochina Co., Inpex Corp. and JXTG Holdings Inc. of Japan, PTT Pcl of Thailand, and South Korea-based GS Caltex Corp., Sprecher said.
Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. will join major international oil companies, traders and customers as founding partners in a platform operated by ICE (NYSE:ICE) for the trading of futures contracts in Abu Dhabi’s flagship Murban crude, Adnoc Chief Executive Officer Sultan Al Jaber said in a speech earlier Monday. Murban futures will allow buyers to hedge in the open market, he said.
Although oil producers across the Persian Gulf pump about a fifth of the world’s oil, they have never had a region-wide, exchange-traded crude benchmark. Adnoc wants the new Murban futures contract to eventually serve that function. The platform will be based in Abu Dhabi’s financial district.
Murban is Adnoc’s most plentiful grade, at about 1.7 million barrels a day, and accounts for more than half of the crude pumped in the United Arab Emirates. Abu Dhabi holds most of the oil in the U.A.E., the third-largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

64,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2019 05:13AM ET</span>","Adidas to close German, U.S. robot factories","BERLIN (Reuters) - Adidas (DE:ADSGN) plans to close high-tech ""robot"" factories in Germany and the United States it launched to bring production closer to customers, saying on Monday deploying some of the technology in Asia would be ""more economic and flexible"".
The Adidas factories were part of a drive to meet demand for faster delivery of new styles to its major markets and to counter rising wages in Asia and higher shipping costs. It originally planned a global network of similar factories.
The German sportswear company did not give details for why it was closing the facilities, which have proved expensive and difficult to extend the technology to different products.
Martin Shankland, Adidas head of global operations, said the factories had helped the company improve its expertise in innovative manufacturing, but applying what it had learnt with its suppliers would be ""more flexible and economic"".
Adidas started production of shoes largely by robots at its ""Speedfactory"" in the southern town of Ansbach near its Bavarian headquarters in 2016 and opened another near Atlanta in 2017.
Founded by German cobbler Adi Dassler in 1949, Adidas has shifted most of its production from Europe to Asia and now relies on more than 1 million workers in contract factories, particularly in China and Vietnam.
However, Adidas said on Monday production at the two factories would be discontinued by April 2020 at the latest as it focuses instead on using the technologies they pioneered to produce shoes at two of its suppliers in Asia.
The suppliers would use the techniques to make a broader range of products with a short production time, not just running shoes, while Adidas will keep testing manufacturing processes at its so-called adiLab site in Scheinfeld in Germany.
It said it would continue to work with Oechsler, the German company which operates the two factories, in other manufacturing areas, such as producing soles for its springy Boost shoes, as well as soles for soccer shoes and advanced 3D printed soles."
65,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 11, 2019 05:11AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Trade Fears, HK Violence Hit HSBC, StanChart, Luxury Names","Investing.com -- The escalation of violence in Hong Kong over the weekend has cast a pall over European stock markets on Monday, reinforcing a “risk-off” move that was already underway thanks to comments from the U.S. playing down the chances of a mutual reduction in import tariffs with China.
By 5:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), it seemed that the setback on trade counted for more than the use of live ammunition by police against protesters: mining stocks in the FTSE 100 lost between 2% and 3.2%, while the western luxury groups to whom Hong Kong’s retail sales matter so much were down, mostly, by less than 1%.
  Antofagasta   (LON:ANTO),   Glencore   (LON:GLEN),   Rio Tinto   (LON:RIO) and   Anglo American   (LON:AAL) were all lower by over 2%, as was BHP Billiton (LON:BHPB), which appeared to gain no benefit from spelling out its commitment to oil production for the next couple of decades at a time when it’s increasingly under pressure from activist shareholders to reduce its exposure to Climate Change risk.
The violence in Hong Kong had more of an effect on U.K.-listed stocks than on others logically exposed to the same risk. HSBC (LON:HSBA) and   Standard Chartered   (LON:STAN) fell 2.4% and 2.0% respectively, while   Burberry   (LON:BRBY) was the biggest loser among European luxury names, falling 2.4%.
By contrast,  Hermes International  (PA:HRMS) and the two big French spirits houses   Remy Cointreau   (PA:RCOP) and   Pernod Ricard   (PA:PERP) were all in positive territory – the latter as a result of rising hopes U.S. tariffs won’t materialize. Even Cartier owner   Richemont   (SIX:CFR), which last week reported a large impact on its quarterly sales from the trouble in Hong Kong, was only down 1.4%.
LVMH (PA:LVMH) and Gucci owner   Kering   (PA:PRTP) were both down less than 1%.
More broadly, the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 index was down 0.2% at 404.48, while the U.K. FTSE 100 underperformed with a loss of 0.6% and the German DAX fell 0.4%. Spain’s IBEX 35 also fell 0.3% after the fourth election in as many years failed again to produce a clear path to a majority government. Bank stocks Santander (MC:SAN), Caixabank (MC:CABK) and BBVA (MC:BBVA) were among the biggest losers.
The upsurge in violence had earlier sent the Hang Seng stock index down 2.6%, its biggest one-day fall in over three months, with property stocks among the hardest hit. Volatility there threatens to affect the valuation that   Alibaba   (NYSE:BABA) could get in its mooted $10-$15 billion secondary offering.
More relevantly for western investors, the violence threatens to complicate the trade talks between the U.S. and China, as any sign of violent repression would make it harder for the U.S. to make trade concessions without also damaging its self-image as leader of the free world. Both President Donald Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross have pointed to Hong Kong as one of the factors influencing their thinking in the trade dispute."

LONDON/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -  Prosus  (AS:PRX) held firm on its $6.3 billion offer to buy  Just Eat  (L:JE) on Monday as it argued the merits of its bid versus one from Takeaway.com for the British online takeaway delivery firm.
The one change in the offer published on Monday by the Dutch arm of South African internet giant Naspers (J:NPNJn) was an acceptance threshold lowered to 75% from 90%.
""We actually believe that financial markets are under- estimating the cost of implementing the transformation Just Eat requires to protect its market position and to capitalize on its long-term opportunity,"" Prosus CEO Bob Van Dijk said.
Prosus has weighed in with an unsolicited cash offer of $6.3 billion, or 710 pence per share, for Just Eat.
That's higher than the 4.7 billion pound all-share deal that Just Eat's board has agreed with Takeaway.com whose shares have fallen since it made its initial bid in July.
Combined with the impact of a stronger British pound versus the euro, the value of the Takeaway.com shares offer has fallen to 609 pence. 
Just Eat shares closed at 738 pence on Friday, signaling investors believe a higher offer from one of the suitors is likely.
Just Eat on Monday said the unchanged Prosus offer ""significantly undervalued"" it, both as a standalone company and in combination with Takeaway, and it continued to recommend shareholders to reject it.
Last week Takeaway, which initially proposed an agreed deal with Just Eat, changed its proposal to a formal bid with a 75% threshold. 
Takeaway's offer could also go forward with simple majority approval from Just Eat shareholders, if British regulators agree.
Prosus and Takeaway.com each talked up the merits of their respective bids on Monday. 
Prosus CEO van Dijk told journalists on a conference call that Takeaway's modest investment in delivery capacity might be a viable strategy for now in the Netherlands and Germany, but it would not work in London and many other markets.
Takeaway CEO Jitse Groen said his bid offered superior future growth opportunities to both groups of shareholders. 
He argued that the delivery side of the online food ordering businesses may never become profitable, while Takeaway's focus on becoming the dominant order platform has led to better growth in operating results.

67,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2019 03:51AM ET</span>",Investors wary as social unrest spreads from Hong Kong to Santiago,"By Rodrigo Campos
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Social unrest worldwide is alarming some global investors, who say protests from Hong Kong and Lebanon to Chile are forcing them to be more cautious even though the impact on financial markets has been spotty so far.
Investors at the Reuters Global 2020 Investment Outlook Summit last week were particularly concerned about Hong Kong, where pro-democracy protests have been raging over the past six months. Some said they saw a theme building up with factors such as the impact of globalization, wealth inequality and climate change creating political uncertainty over the next five to 10 years that would influence markets.
""It is a risk that is with us and at these quite stretched financial market valuations it causes us pause and leads us to be more cautious in markets than we would be otherwise,"" said Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at PIMCO, one of the world's largest asset managers.
For him, ""this more extreme global political friction is here to stay."" Michael Novogratz, the hedge fund manager turned crypto-currency and blockchain investor, said global protests have a unifying theme. ""Globalization was the global narrative that we all bought into up until 2015,"" Novogratz said at the Summit in New York.
""Then with Brexit and (the U.S. election of nationalist Republican Donald) Trump and now the insurrection in Chile and Hong Kong ... all of this is happening because we lost true north as a planet. And we're waiting till the new narrative shows up.""
Wealth created since the Great Recession has disproportionately gone to those who rely on their money to make more money, while those who must work for it have stagnated. In market-speak, return on capital has been much higher than return on labor, widening the gap between those who have and those who don't.""Trump got elected, Brexit happened, because the bottom half got gutted, the middle class got gutted,"" said Novogratz. ""To me it means we're going to need more redistribution, somehow, some way.""
To be sure, the reaction from financial markets to the unrest has so far been patchy.
Chile's stock market (SPCLXIGPA), for example, posted in October its largest monthly decline in nearly two years. Over the weekend, President Sebastian Pinera acknowledged ""abuses"" in the handling of massive social protests that have shaken the country for three weeks.
Some Lebanese bond yields recently hit record highs before retreating amid nearly month-long protests against a political establishment widely regarded as corrupt and inept.
Meanwhile, the major U.S. stock indexes closed Friday at all-time highs.That is because the relatively small economies with conflicts have not yet forced a widespread modification of strategies among the largest investors.
Absent a violent crackdown from China in Hong Kong, the current situation is not ""enough to influence the major economies, the major-goods trades going on,"" said Anne Mathias, a senior strategist for global macro, rates and foreign currency at Vanguard.
Mathias said the idea of these protests as a harbinger of a global movement does not worry her. ""I respect everything that is going on. I would worry, I think, if the Chinese did something aggressive in Hong Kong.""
Other investors said the protests have long-term implications.
""We are concerned about the social impact of what has occurred since the global financial crisis,"" said Mark Konyn, chief investment officer of insurer AIA, at the Summit in Hong Kong.

""That is a long-term theme that does concern us, and ultimately it must have an impact on corporate governance, the role the companies have within the broader community,"" he said.

The two daily return flights will help AirAsia X deploy its Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A330s for more hours of the day, allowing it to boost revenue, the carriers said. The services will also give passengers from China, India, Japan and Korea better connections from its Kuala Lumpur hub to Singapore.
Using the widebodies rather than AirAsia's narrowbody Airbus A320s also doubles capacity in those slots on the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore route, the world's busiest international route by frequency of services, according to aviation data provider OAG.
AirAsia and AirAsia X said they would share the operating profits from the slots on a 50-50 basis, with 2.42 million ringgit ($584,823.59) expected in the first year taking into account operational costs. The low-cost carrier will continue to operate several other daily flights on the route using its A320s.
The deal comes after AirAsia rivals Malaysia Airlines and Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) signed an expanded codeshare agreement.
AirAsia X in August posted a 207.6 million ringgit loss for the quarter ended June 30, its largest since 2015, due to aircraft disposals and a weak ringgit.

73,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 11, 2019 01:36AM ET</span>","China’s Consumer Inflation Could Hit 5% in January, Analysts Say","(Bloomberg) -- China’s consumer inflation will continue rising and could peak at around 5% or even 6% in January before gradually falling back, according to economists.
The consumer price index rose to a 7-year high of 3.8% in October due to soaring pork prices, and the demand from the Spring Festival in late January will push it higher to at least 5%, according to economists from  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., and Bank of China International Ltd. Huachuang Securities Co. said the headline number could even hit 6%.
Inflation will then likely slow down from that January peak, according to China Merchants Securities Co. While non-pork price rises remain benign for now, the brokerage house warned that the cost of eggs, seafood and cooking oil are most likely to rise, based on previous periods of pork price inflation.
The rising prices will complicate monetary policy, with markets closely watching how the People’s Bank of China balances the competing demands from rising consumer prices and falling producer prices over the rest of the year.
The demand-supply imbalance of pork will “likely become acuter” and push pork inflation to a near-term high around Chinese New Year, Yu Xiangrong, an economist at Citigroup in Hong Kong wrote in a note. “The window for further policy easing will open wider,” when consumer inflation starts to decline after the new year.

74,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 11, 2019 01:36AM ET</span>","Emerging Markets Well Placed for Next Shock, Balance Sheets Show","(Bloomberg) -- Emerging markets now have stronger balance sheets that could serve them well in times of stress after years of buying overseas assets and shifting their foreign liabilities more to equities than debt, according to Oxford Economics.
Many developing nations’ external balance sheets contain assets that are denominated in dollars, so countries benefit from weakness in their own currencies, economists led by London-based Guillermo Tolosa, an adviser at the firm, wrote in a report.
“This can mitigate the negative impact of a strong dollar on commodity prices, world trade, and capital flows,” the authors said.
This shift may be crucial as external vulnerabilities and currency mismatches had been the trigger of EM crises in the past. In a scenario of exchange-rate devaluation, these dollar-denominated assets can become more valuable domestically and create wealth, helping stabilize domestic activities, according to the report.
Risks still abound for many emerging markets, the authors noted. In places like Argentina and South Africa where external positions have improved, there are still considerable sovereign risks.

The Hang Seng Index dropped as much as 2.4%, with local landlords including Sun Hung Kai Properties Co. and Wharf Real Estate Investment sinking more than 3.5%. Signs that optimism over a potential U.S.-China trade deal has been overdone added to the bearish sentiment.
The abrupt drop -- by far the worst in Asia -- follows a half trillion dollar rally that drove a measure of buying momentum to its highest level in almost nine months and pushed the Hang Seng Index above 200-day moving average.
The shootings came as protesters called for a city-wide strike following the death of a student who fell from a parking garage amid a police dispersal operation. The city’s railway operator suspended parts of some lines amid mass vandalism and universities canceled classes.
“Hong Kong safety is now a big question,” said Jackson Wong, asset management director at Amber Hill Capital. “Some people are worried that today’s event would escalate the protest. There’s also conflicting messages from the U.S. and China over the trade deal. Last week people were pricing in a successful deal.”
The local dollar was little changed at 7.8297 per greenback after its best week since mid-September.
Concern is also rising that Hong Kong’s bleak economic situation has yet to fully filter through to its stocks. Faced with its worst business outlook since the 2008 financial crisis and a plunge into recession, a chill may be coming for Hong Kong’s corporate earnings. He Qi, a fund manager with Huatai Pinebridge Fund Management Co. who called the rally in mid-August, says he’s preparing to sell.
“Hong Kong’s gains are just part of a global risk-on rally amid a flood of liquidity, and the short-term gains are way too strong,” said He.
While President Donald Trump said late last week that trade talks with China were moving along “very nicely,” he added that reports about how much the U.S. was ready to roll back tariffs on China were “incorrect.” Those reports had helped fuel the risk-on rally that sent a gauge of global stocks to its highest level since early 2018.
China’s largest brokerage Citic Securities Co. earlier this month trimmed its earnings growth forecast on the Hang Seng gauge to 4% this year from a previous estimate of as much as 8%. The continuing protests in the city and the impact on commercial property, retail and tourism industries has gone beyond expectations, strategists led by Yang Lingxiu wrote in a note dated Nov. 4.
To be sure, traders can still find opportunities in a market where many firms rely on the mainland for earnings. China’s A shares are about 27% more expensive than their Hong Kong listed peers, compared with a long-term average of 20%. “There are so many bargains left on the table,” said Sean Darby, a global strategist at Jefferies Hong Kong.
Still, the recession will likely make its presence felt in earnings for this year and in the first quarter of 2020, said Ken Chen, a Shanghai-based strategist with KGI Securities Co.
“There’s no end in sight to the local unrest and expectations of an economic recovery next year remain low,” he said. “Hong Kong is just rising along with global markets, and the gains will pause when the global rally weakens.”"

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's auto industry executives met with government officials over the weekend to discuss ways to promote higher car sales in rural areas, sources familiar with the matter said.
The country's car manufacturers are grappling with the pressures of falling sales in the world's largest car market and are seeking new policies.
A senior official at the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), Zeng Guang, confirmed to Reuters that the meeting had been organized in Beijing by the association's magazine Auto Review.
He declined to provide details of the discussions but said participants had agreed that the current sales decline was normal give how China's car market was still developing.
Sources told Reuters the meeting was titled ""cars for the rural areas"", emphasizing the need to target sales outside of the country's cities where sales have been especially weak.
China's state planner had issued a series of measures in June to revive a slump in car sales but these had fallen short of automakers' expectations and done little to spur sales.
Sources with knowledge of the meeting said government officials told participants they were considering policies to expand the second hand car market in rural areas and to improve vehicle retirement policies. They also urged firms to develop electric vehicle models that are suitable for the rural market.
However, government officials warned that short-term stimulus policies would hurt the industry's long-term development and was not a route Beijing was keen to pursue. They did not make any commitments during the meeting, the sources said.
A senior official at CAAM told Reuters last month auto sales in China may drop around 8% to 26 million this year but were ultimately still on track to hit 30 million by 2023 with further headroom.
Government officials from the National Development & Reform Commission (NDRC), Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and Ministry of Commerce attended the meeting, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

Also referred to as the “Double Eleven Festival” because it falls on Nov. 11, the event has become a ritual for Alibaba, although it is not clear if the event provides huge profit to the company given the enormous discounting involved. 
 
Everything from iPhones and coffee machines to snacks are on huge sale online, and on average more merchandise is sold online on Nov. 11 in China than during the five-day U.S. holiday buying spree that begins on Thanksgiving and ends on Cyber Monday.
 
Last year, sales at Alibaba climbed 27% to 213.5 billion yuan, or the equivalent to $30.7 billion at the time. 
 
Analysts are paying close attention to the whole event this year to gauge how willing Chinese consumers are to spend as economic growth threatens to dip below 6%. "

Tyson, chairman and chief executive officer of not-for-profit health insurer Kaiser Permanente, died unexpectedly in his sleep on Sunday, aged 60, the company said in a statement.
Tyson, who held the top job since 2013, was Oakland, California-based Kaiser Permanente's first black chief executive and a strong proponent for affordable and accessible healthcare.
The company did not give a cause of death. A company spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
A day earlier on Saturday, the San Francisco native took to Twitter to post about ""high-tech and high-touch"" healthcare. 
Tyson was described by colleagues in a company statement as ""an outstanding leader, visionary and champion for high-quality, affordable health care for all Americans.""
In response to Tyson's death, the National Union of Healthcare Workers postponed a five-day strike by 4,000 mental health professional that had been set to begin on Monday at more than 100 Kaiser clinics across California.
""Our members dedicate their lives to helping people through tragedy and trauma, and they understood that a strike would not be appropriate during this period of mourning and reflection,"" union president Sal Rosselli said in a statement.
The union, locked in a contract dispute its leaders say centers on demands for improved retirement and health benefits for Kaiser's mental health clinicians, has yet to reschedule the strike, he said.
Kaiser's annual operating revenue as of June was nearly $80 billion, up from about $53 billion in 2013 when Tyson took over as CEO, according to the company's website.

The company, which serves more than 12 million people across the United States and was founded in 1945, named Gregory Adams, executive vice president, as interim chairman and CEO.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 2.1% by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component both fell 1.3%. 
Political unrest continued in Hong Kong, as two protesters were shot by police during the morning commute while services on some train and subway lines were disrupted.
Riot police were deployed near stations and shopping malls. Police fired live rounds at protesters on the eastern side of Hong Kong island, Cable TV and other Hong Kong media reported, noting that two protesters was said to be wounded when police opened fire.
According the media in Hong Kong, protesters are angry about what they described as police brutality and meddling by Beijing in Hong Kong. 
The latest violence came after a student died in hospital last week following a high fall during a protest. 
Zhang Xiaoming, China’s top official overseeing Hong Kong affairs, said in a post on the agency’s website that only people loyal to Beijing will become Hong Kong’s chief executive. 
On the Sino-U.S. trade front, U.S. President Donald Trump said on the weekend that negotiations are moving along “very nicely,” stressing that China wanted a deal “much more than I do.”
The president described recent reports about how much the U.S. was ready to roll back tariffs on Chinese goods as “incorrect.”
“If we don’t make that right deal, we’re not going to make a deal,” Trump told reporters on Saturday. “A lot of positive things are happening.”
His comments contracted with remarks made by a spokesman for China’s Ministry of Commerce last week, who said negotiators had discussions and “agreed to remove the additional tariffs in phases as progress is made on the agreement.”

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) co-founder Steve Wozniak joined in the online debate over accusations of gender discrimination by the algorithm behind the iPhone maker's credit card, fuelling scrutiny of the newly launched Apple Card.
The criticism started on Thursday, after entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson railed against the Apple Card in a series of Twitter posts, saying it gave him 20 times the credit limit his wife received.
The much anticipated titanium credit card, part of a broader effort by Apple to derive greater revenue from services after years of heavy reliance on iPhone sales, was launched in August, in partnership with  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS).
In an email, Goldman said Apple Card applicants were evaluated independently, according to income and creditworthiness, taking into account factors such as personal credit scores and personal debt.
It was possible for two family members to receive significantly different credit decisions, the bank said, but added, ""We have not, and will not, make decisions based on factors like gender.""
Hansson, who is the creator of web-application framework Ruby on Rails, did not disclose any specific income-related information for himself or his wife but tweeted that they filed joint tax returns and that his wife had a better credit score.
On Saturday, Wozniak chimed in with a similar experience, saying he got 10 times more credit on the card, compared with his wife.
""We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets,"" Wozniak said on Twitter, in reply to Hansson's original tweet.
""Hard to get to a human for a correction though. It's big tech in 2019.""
New York's Department of Financial Services said it was beginning an inquiry into Goldman Sachs' credit card practices.
""New York law prohibits discrimination against protected classes of individuals,"" Linda Lacewell, the superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, wrote in a blog post. That barred an algorithm, like any other method of determining creditworthiness, from disparate treatment based on individual characteristics such as age, creed, race, color, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, among others, she added.
""We know the question of discrimination in algorithmic decisioning also extends to other areas of financial services.""
Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Sunday."

""We're doing this because it's the responsible thing to do,"" Qantas' Chief Executive Alan Joyce said in a statement, calling climate change concerns ""real"".
IAG last month became the first major airline group to make the net zero by 2050 commitment, leading the way amid intense pressure from climate change activists such as Extinction Rebellion and teenager Greta Thunberg. 
The high-profile debate has spurred increasing numbers of environmentally conscious travellers and investors, putting pressure on the aviation industry.
The broader industry has committed to halving emissions by 2050 compared to 2005 levels.
Qantas said it was looking to cap net emissions at 2020 levels and will invest A$50 million ($34.3 million) over 10 years to develop sustainable fuel to help lower carbon emissions by 80% compared with traditional jet fuel.
Australia's national carrier has already experimented by flying a plane from Los Angeles to Melbourne using mustard seed biofuel.
""So we know the technology's possible,"" Joyce told Australian Broadcasting Corp. ""It's to actually do it commercially and to do it on scale and not impact the other environmental concerns like taking away from food crops or increasing the cost of food crops. That's why it'll take some time to get there.""
Qantas' pledge coincided with an outbreak of deadly bushfires along Australia's east coast, which experts have linked to climate change.
Qantas said it operates the largest carbon offset program in the aviation industry, with around 10% of customers choosing to offset their flights through conservation and environmental projects. The airline said it would now match every dollar spent on offsets, effectively doubling the number of flights offset.
Air France and British Airways last month said they would offset all emissions on their domestic flights from 2020.
'FLIGHT SHAMING'
Airline companies are finding it harder to ignore growing scrutiny of their climate change policies by investors. 
Fund managers, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and others are showing greater care when investing in companies, and have started limiting exposure to oil, gas and coal stocks.
In coordination with the International Air Transport Association, which represents nearly 300 airlines, the aviation industry is launching a campaign it hopes will counter a 'flight shaming' movement that has gained momentum as travellers become more concerned about their environmental impact.
The aviation industry has already cut carbon emissions from each plane traveler in half since 1990, largely thanks to more fuel-efficient aircraft. 

Plane and engine makers are also working on plans for hybrid or all-electric engines to help lower emissions in the future.

The company said in a statement that Didsbury had tendered his resignation to avoid any conflict with his role as chair of the Northern Express Group, a private consortium.

In a series of Twitter posts starting on Thursday, David Heinemeier Hansson railed against the Apple Card for giving him 20 times the credit limit that his wife got, Bloomberg reported on Saturday.
Hansson, who is the creator of web-application framework Ruby on Rails, didn't disclose any specific income-related information for himself or his wife but said they filed joint tax returns and that his wife had a better credit score, the report said. New York's Department of Financial Services confirmed that an investigation was being conducted. Andrew Williams (NYSE:WMB), a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to comment on whether Hansson had contacted Goldman regarding the concerns raised on Twitter because the bank does not discuss matters involving individual customers publicly. 
The Apple Card, launched in August, is Goldman's first credit card. The Wall Street investment bank has been offering more products to consumers, including personal loans and savings accounts through its Marcus online bank.
The Department of Financial Services ""will be conducting an investigation to determine whether New York law was violated and ensure all consumers are treated equally regardless of sex,"" a department spokeswoman told Reuters in a statement.
""Any algorithm that intentionally or not results in discriminatory treatment of women or any other protected class violates New York law.""

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA) will kick off its annual 24-hour shopping extravaganza on Monday with deals and deep discounts galore, and a performance by American popstar Taylor Swift to top it all, as it pushes to rake in another record Singles' Day sales.
This year's Nov. 11 bash comes as the $486 billion Chinese retail juggernaut navigates through a major turning point, the resignation in September of its flamboyant co-founder Jack Ma as chairman, and looks to raise up to $15 billion via a share sale in Hong Kong as early as this month.
Akin to Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the United States, Singles' Day, a shopping fest originally promoted by Alibaba Chairman and CEO Daniel Zhang in 2009, has since grown rapidly to become the world's biggest online sales event.
Alibaba saw sales worth $30 billion on its platforms on Singles' Day last year, dwarfing $7.9 billion U.S. online sales for Cyber Monday. Yet, the 27% sales growth was the lowest in the event's 10-year history, spurring a search for fresh ideas. 
""This year will be the 11th 11.11 festival, with more than 200,000 brands participating, one million new products on offer and over 500 million users are expected to participate – about 100 million more than last year,"" Alibaba said in a statement. 
Taylor Swift, whose latest album ""Lover"" has broken records in China, will headline this year's opening gala alongside local celebrities like Jackson Yee. Swift also performed at Prime Day concert for rival Amazon.com (O:AMZN) earlier this year.
Alibaba's Singles' Day celebrations have featured U.S. singer Mariah Carey and musician Pharrell Williams (NYSE:WMB) in the past.
Livestreamers are also set to play a prominent role in product promotions this year, as Alibaba increasingly turns to online video influencers to increase engagement on its app.
It has partnered with Kuaishou and Douyin, two popular Chinese video apps, to help it broadcast product promotions, and in the run-up to the show even roped in U.S. celebrity entrepreneur Kim Kardashian, who launched a Tmall stream to promote her KKW line of beauty products.

INTENSE COMPETITION
Its heavy marketing campaign underscores intensifying competition with smaller rivals such as  Pinduoduo  (N:PDD) which have outsmarted Alibaba in second- and third-tier cities with deep discounts and group-buying deals.
Alibaba has been trying to expand its customer base beyond its core first- and second-tier city shoppers to less developed areas to combat slowing retail sales growth, describing it as a key strategy for the firm this year. 
Pinduoduo will be also holding its own ""Singles' Day"" events on the same day. 
The e-commerce upstart has signalled its intentions to break Alibaba and rival JD.com's (O:JD) stronghold on wealthy Chinese shoppers, saying that half of the app's users now hail from first- and second-tier cities.
Alibaba also faces challenges of a regulatory crackdown and a slowing economy, hurt by U.S.-China trade tensions. 

Ahead of the Nov. 11 event, China warned Alibaba and JD.com (O:JD) to stop practices that could be deemed as monopolistic, state media reported earlier this month.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi state oil giant Aramco will sell up to 0.5% of its shares to individual retail investors and will be restricted from issuing additional shares for a year after the initial public offering (IPO), its prospectus said on Saturday.
Aramco fired the starting gun on what is likely be the world's largest listing on Nov. 3 after a series of delays. The offering, set to rank it as the world's most valuable company, will begin on Nov. 17, the prospectus said.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is seeking to sell the shares to raise billions of dollars to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil by investing in non-energy industries.
Bankers think the long-awaited IPO will value Aramco around $1.5 trillion.
The more than 600-page prospectus published on Saturday did not include details of how much of the company would be floated in total or of any commitments from cornerstone investors.
Sources have said the company could sell 1%-2% on the Saudi stock market. If the government sells 2% of Aramco shares, the retail offering could account for 25% or $10 billion of the deal size at the top valuation of $2 trillion.
The prospectus, which revealed few details, did not say how the government will use the proceeds from the sale.
The prospectus said that among the risks for investors were the potential for terrorist attacks and the potential for encountering antitrust legislation, as well as the right of the Saudi government to decide maximum crude output and direct Aramco to undertake projects outside its core business.
Aramco may also change its dividend policy without prior notice to its minority shareholders, it said.
""Apart from the oil price, of course, the main risks are the degree to which Aramco needs to shoulder the burden of OPEC Plus output restraint, allocation of capital into projects which maximise value for Saudi overall as opposed to Aramco minority shareholders, physical security risks and the dividend payout ratio in the long-term,"" said Hasnain Malik, head of equity strategy at Tellimer.
""Valuation at the time of the IPO will depend on how much of demand is made up by subscribers who are prepared to overlook these factors in favour of Aramco’s low depletion rate ... and its very low cost of extraction versus peers.""
Aramco's oil facilities were targeted on Sept. 14 in unprecedented attacks that temporarily shut 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of output - more than 5% of global oil supply.
LOCKUP PERIOD
The prospectus said the government will have a ""statutory lockup period"" for disposing of any shares after the listing for six months, and a contractual lockup period for 12 months.
Aramco cannot list additional shares for a period of six months after trading starts, and will also be restricted from issuing additional shares for 12 months.
The offering for institutional investors will begin on Nov. 17 and end on Dec. 4, while retail investors will be able to bid for the shares from Nov. 17 to Nov. 28, the prospectus said.
""Aramco IPO is an opportunity that shouldn't be missed, the largest company in the world....holding Aramco shares is an absolute gain,"" a Saudi with a twitter handle named Abdulrahman wrote.
Potential investors had told Reuters they had been preparing for months — saving money, selling land plots and exiting other stocks. Saudis flooded banks with phone calls asking how to participate after Aramco announced bank mandates. Online adverts promoting the IPO to locals have gone viral.
Aramco has been in talks with Gulf and Asian sovereign wealth funds and wealthy Saudi individuals to secure top investors of the IPO, but no cornerstone investor is yet to formally agree to a deal.
The Russia-China Investment Fund is working to attract Chinese investors for Aramco's planned IPO, the head of Russia's RDIF sovereign wealth fund said on Thursday.
Bankers have told the Saudi government that investors will likely value the company at around $1.5 trillion, below the $2 trillion valuation touted by Prince Mohammed when he first floated the idea of an IPO nearly four years ago.
Initial hopes for a 5% IPO on domestic and international bourses were dashed last year when the process was halted amid debate over where to list Aramco overseas.
Aramco said the timetable was delayed because it began a process to acquire a 70% stake in petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp.
The prospectus said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was named as stabilizing agent for the deal.
Analysts from banks working on the Riyadh listing have projected a wide valuation range between $1.2 trillion to $2.3 trillion.
At the top valuation of $2 billion, Aramco could potentially raise $40 billion, topping the record-breaking $25 billion raised by Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) in 2014.
The valuation would be almost twice that of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), currently the world's most valuable listed company, and seven times that of  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), the biggest listed oil major by market capitalisation."

It left potential buyers in the dark about the size of the stake it plans to sell and the pricing range.
The Saudi stock exchange rules prohibits the oil giant from listing additional shares for six months after the start of trading, according to its more than 650-page prospectus. Also, the Saudi government, the company’s sole owner, won’t offer any additional shares during the 12-month period after listing, but retains the right to sell to foreign governments or investors affiliated with foreign governments.

The kingdom cut taxes on Aramco for a third time, revealed incentives for investors not to sell shares and is considering boosting dividends further.
While the prospectus includes Aramco’s profits for the first nine months and details of the company’s operations, it doesn’t include any indication of what valuation the government hopes to achieve. Price guidance for the share sale is expected next week, but people familiar with the deal have told Bloomberg that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman would be satisfied with a valuation of between $1.6 trillion and $1.8 trillion.
‘Lack of Clarity’
“This lack of clarity in the prospectus shouldn’t alarm us as it’s a book building exercise and let’s be clear Saudi will do whatever it takes to make this IPO successful because so much hinges on it,” Nasser Saidi, president of Nasser Saidi & Associates said in an interview on Bloomberg TV on Sunday. “This is part of an overall privatization program, which has often been delayed so now we’re getting to the beginning of that program.”
Aramco earned net income of $68.2 billion in the first nine months compared with $83.1 billion a year ago. Revenue slipped to $217 billion from $233 billion.
Saudis and China
With the Aramco IPO, there’s a lot at stake for Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, and his Vision 2030 plan to overhaul the economy. He proposed the offering in 2016 as a way to expose the state-owned firm to the rigors of the market and raise money for the sovereign wealth fund.
The richest Saudis are being pressed to commit large sums to the IPO, according to people familiar with the matter. Among those considering sizable purchases are the Olayan family and Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the billionaire investor who was held for several weeks in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton Hotel during 2017’s declared corruption crackdown.
China, the world’s largest oil importer, may commit as much as $10 billion through sovereign wealth funds and other state-owned enterprises, according to people familiar with the situation. An investment would be a hedge against rising oil prices and chime with the objectives of Beijing’s ambitious Belt and Road program.

Kaeser's statement sparked a lively debate on social media, with the Siemens CEO later seeking to clarify his comments.
In an exchange with a journalist from a business daily, Kaeser said in a tweet on Saturday that there was no need for wild speculation and efforts to draw references to Busch's remark about Musk.
""This is NOT AT ALL about Mr. Busch and/or Mr. Musk,"" Kaeser said, adding that his aim was rather to draw attention to entrepreneurial spirit in Germany and the declining relevance of German companies.
Musk provoked a Twitter storm last year after briefly smoking marijuana on a live web show with comedian Joe Rogan.
In September Siemens promoted Busch to deputy CEO, putting him in pole position to replace Kaeser as head of the German engineering giant.
On Oct. 31, Busch tweeted, ""Great to meet w/ @elonmusk, a true visionary of our times. Talked about #FutureofMobility, rapid deployment of car charging enabling #electric mobility, advanced manufacturing & rocket engineering. We're proud @Siemens’ #technology is supporting Elon's most exciting dreams.""
At the company's annual news conference this week, Busch said Musk's electric car maker Tesla and SpaceX, which makes rockets, are big customers for Siemens' digital industries businesses."

The estimate was in a confidential document presented to the board of state-controlled EDF at the end of July, it said.
EDF declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
Each reactor would cost 7.5 billion to 7.8 billion euros, based on building the reactors in pairs with financing over about 20 years, Le Monde reported.
The EPR model is the latest generation reactor being built by EDF, with complex engineering and enhanced safety features put in place after the Fukushima nuclear meltdown in Japan.
However, the Flamanville EPR reactor under construction in northern France has been plagued by cost overruns and a series of technical problems resulting in years of delays.
EDF, in which the state has an 84% stake, said in October the project which began in 2006 would cost 1.5 billion euros more than previously expected, raising the total cost to 12.4 billion euros.

AXA, the second-largest European insurer after Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG), has been gradually divesting from EQH to raise funds to pay for its $15 billion acquisition of Bermuda-based rival XL last year.
AXA said in a statement on Friday it had sold 144 million EQH shares at $21.80 per share to Goldman Sachs (N:GS), the sole underwriter in a secondary public share offering expected to close on Nov. 13.
EQH has agreed to repurchase 24 million shares at the same price.
AXA said that proceeds from the deal would boost the group's Solvency II capital requirements ratio by six points and that no significant net income impact was expected.
After the deal, the French group will retain only a 9.6% stake it needs to redeem an AXA bond maturing in May 2021 that has to be exchangeable in EQH shares."
94,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 09, 2019 06:18AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here are three things that flew under the radar this week.
1. Local Fed Forecasts See 4Q Growth Struggling
The New York Federal Reserve’s GDP forecast dipped this week, pointing to fourth-quarter 2019 annual growth well below 1%.
The New York Fed’s Nowcast came in at 0.7% Friday, down from its previous measure of 0.8%.
“Negative surprises from lower than expected exports and imports data accounted for most of the decrease,” the Fed said.
Business inventories also had a negative impact, while the Institute of Supply Management’s services measure helped.
Meanwhile, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecast, also out Friday, had growth coming in at 1%, the same as its previous measure.
2. Whales’ Really Are Behind The Big Moves in Bitcoin, Research Finds
A sea of red washed over bitcoin Friday, sending some into a frenzied search for fundamental reasons for the move. More often than not, a clear reason for price swings has been found to be lacking, leading many to lay the blame at the feet of traders with sizable bitcoin holdings, bitcoin whales, able to move prices in a single swoop.
But the role that the whales play in the crypto market may have been underestimated.
New findings suggest that a single trader was responsible for the surge in bitcoin to nearly $20,000 two years ago.
Finance professors John Griffin and Amin Shams at the University of Texas and Ohio State University claimed that bitcoin’s value between March 2017 and March 2018 was manipulated through large-volume trades.
""This one large player or entity either exhibited clairvoyant market timing or exerted an extremely large price impact on bitcoin that is not observed in aggregate flows from other smaller traders,"" they wrote in a paper, which was shared with Bloomberg ahead of its publication in the Journal of Finance.
But the professors are not the only ones shinning a light on the whales’ manipulation.
Whale Alert, a site that keeps tables on moves in wallets for cryptocurrencies worth more than $50 million, identified a high number of high-value transactions that could explain the 20% downturn in bitcoin between October 21 and October 22.
Underscoring the impact of whales on the price of bitcoin, Whale Alert co-founder and CEO Frank van Weert highlighted an address, inactive since 2011 and boasting 80,000 in bitcoin, that could “crush the market completely” if they decide to sell.
Against the backdrop of overburdening pressure by the whales, some have suggested that an influx of new investors is needed to level the playing field.
Institutional investors have been long courted by crypto markets, with many believing that Wall Street’s participation is needed for the next major rally.
Products like bitcoin futures were launched to make crypto accessible to Wall Street.
But that has brought in another class of whales, who reportedly were responsible for the reverse in bitcoin from its all-time high.
A letter from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco released in last year in May, suggested the slump in bitcoin from near $20,000 was largely driven by institutional investors following the launch of bitcoin futures.
“The advent of blockchain introduced a new financial instrument, bitcoin, which optimistic investors bid up, until the launch of bitcoin futures allowed pessimists to enter the market, which contributed to the reversal of the bitcoin price dynamics,” the San Francisco Fed said.
3.  Disney  Promises Transparency on Subscriber Numbers
Walt Disney's (NYSE:DIS) much-anticipated Disney+ streaming service debuts next week and there is some good news for investors looking to value the company’s shares.
The company plans to supply granular information on how the service is performing, including subscriber numbers, a metric that will be very closely watched.
Disney will provide subscriber numbers “on a go-forward” basis, Chief Financial Officer Christine Mary McCarthy said during the company’s post-earnings conference call.
“(W)e intend to be very transparent as it relates to our (direct-to-consumer) business and the sub counts are going to be something we know people will be interested in,” McCarthy said. “So we will be providing by the different platforms subs by those platforms and because we'll be launching domestically, obviously we expect Disney+ domestically to have a head start on any of the international markets.”"

(Reuters) - Ben & Jerry's has been sued by an environmental advocate who said it deceived consumers by touting that the milk and cream it uses to make ice cream came exclusively from ""happy cows.""
In a complaint filed last week, James Ehlers said Ben & Jerry's ""breached consumer trust"" by representing that the milk and cream were sourced from cows on Vermont dairies that participate in its ""Caring Dairy"" program.
Ehlers said less than half the milk and cream actually came from ""happy cows,"" with the rest coming from ""factory-style, mass-production"" dairy operations.
He said the deception enabled Ben & Jerry's and its parent  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) Plc to charge premium prices, unjustly enriching themselves and violating a Vermont consumer protection law.
The proposed class action filed on Oct. 29 in the federal court in Burlington, Vermont seeks damages for ice cream purchasers nationwide and in Vermont, and to stop Ben & Jerry's from claiming its milk and cream came from ""happy cows"" on ""Caring Dairy"" farms.
Ben & Jerry's spokeswoman Laura Peterson said the company does not discuss pending lawsuits, but was ""committed to building a resilient, regenerative dairy supply"" and considered its Caring Dairy program ""the most progressive in the industry.""
According to Ben & Jerry's website, the Caring Dairy program requires participating farms to meet a variety of standards to ensure the humane treatment of cows (https://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/2016/caring-dairy-standards).
Ben & Jerry's was founded in 1978 in a renovated gas station, and has long positioned itself as socially conscious.
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food company, bought Ben & Jerry's in August 2000.
Ehlers was a candidate for governor of Vermont last year, but lost in the Democratic primary.
The case is Ehlers v Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc et al, U.S. District Court, District of Vermont, No. 19-00194.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - WeWork owner The We Company disclosed data on Friday that showed expansion of its office-sharing business was almost doubling in size from a large pipeline of leases even as the money-losing company plans to slash costs and reduce its headcount.
WeWork divulged a presentation it gave prospective creditors in October about two weeks before SoftBank agreed to a $9.5 billion bailout to keep the company afloat before cash on hand was expected to run out some time in November.
The data showed that as of the third quarter WeWork planned to add 450,000 desks through leased locations that have not yet opened, which would represent almost a doubling in size from the 520,000 desks already up and running.
The Oct. 11 presentation said that ""despite the noise,"" an allusion to the intense media focus after We withdrew its plans to go public in September, ""we have continued to perform.""
The 49-page presentation highlighted changes underfoot to emphasize a renewed focus on WeWork as its core business. The presentation also showed the company distancing itself from the much-criticized leadership of co-founder Adam Neumann, who relinquished control under the deal with SoftBank.
Going forward WeWork plans a ""disciplined focus on profitable market-share expansion"" instead of growing the business ""prior to funding commitments,"" which the presentation said occurred from 2017 to September 2019 under Neumann.
A 90-day game plan included reducing headcount in administrative operations, WeWork's venture capital arm and in growth-related functions, a likely reference to the teams dedicated to designing and constructing new office sites.
No numbers were provided for layoffs. Marcelo Claure, the SoftBank executive who was named chairman of WeWork last month, has said layoffs are expected but has not said how many.
The presentation said WeWork plans to divest seven non-core businesses - Conductor, the Wing, Managed by Q, Meetup, SpaceIQ, Teem and Wave Garden. The units organize meetings, provide facilities and workplace management, and marketing.
The presentation also said plans divulged to investors in October to close RISE, the company's wellness centers, are now under reevaluation.
Just over half of WeWork's Naked Hub locations in China were what the company calls mature, or sites that have been open for more than 24 months, yet China's occupancy rate was only 76%.

WeWork shelved its plans to go public on Sept. 30 after investors grew wary of its losses, business model and corporate governance. Neumann had resigned the previous week.

97,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2019 08:25PM ET</span>","Southwest and American pull 737 MAX until early March, nearly a year after grounding","By Tracy Rucinski and David Shepardson
CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc said on Friday they are extending Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX cancellations until early March, just shy of the one-year anniversary of an Ethiopian Airlines crash of the jet that led to a worldwide grounding. 
Southwest and American, the two largest U.S. operators of the aircraft, have had to scale back growth plans and are together canceling more than 300 flights a day, taking a hit to profits as they manage slimmer fleets without the 737 MAX. 
Southwest, which has bet its entire growth strategy on Boeing's newest single-aisle aircraft, had previously canceled all its 737 MAX flights until Feb. 8 and now expects a return to service on March 6, though it warned that the timeline could get pushed back again. 
 Boeing Co  is facing increasing hurdles in obtaining approval to return the plane to service before the end of this year as it has targeted.
American said it planned to resume commercial flights on the 737 MAX on March 5, and expects to run test flights for American team members and invited guests before that date, once the aircraft is certified.
United Airlines, the other U.S. 737 MAX operator, had thus far canceled flights into January, although it may yet have to extend that time frame. Reuters reported this week that U.S. and European regulators will need to return to a Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL) facility in Iowa to complete an audit of Boeing's software documentation after regulators found gaps and substandard documents. Boeing has confirmed it must submit revised documentation.
That has thrown into question when Boeing would be able to complete a certification test flight. The Federal Aviation Administration has said it would not unground the planes until 30 days after that flight occurs.
The 737 MAX, Boeing's best-selling plane, has been grounded since March after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people. 
Two U.S. officials told Reuters it is extremely unlikely - if not impossible - that Boeing will be able to win approval to return flights to service before the end of December.
Just two days ago, American Chief Executive Doug Parker said he was hopeful that the aircraft would ""get certified in the near future.""
RISING COST
American has estimated that the 737 MAX grounding has cut 2019 earnings by $540 million, while Southwest estimated the total hit to its earnings between January and September at $435 million.
That toll will only rise the longer the MAX remains parked. Boeing is discussing compensation with airlines but no agreement has been reached.
Southwest had 34 MAX jets at the time of the March 13 grounding and was expecting delivery of another 41 jets this year. It said on Friday it still hopes to receive seven MAX deliveries in the current quarter, with the remaining shifting into 2020.
But without clarity on the MAX timeline, Southwest said it could not update a previous forecast for first-quarter capacity to grow between 2% and 3%.

98,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2019 08:25PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court to consider blocking Booking.com trademark,"By Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to consider a bid by a federal agency to prevent the popular hotel reservation website Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG).com, a unit of Booking Holdings Inc, from trademarking the site's name, contending that it is too generic to deserve legal protection. 
The justices will hear an appeal by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office of lower court decision allowing the trademark because by adding "".com"" to the generic word ""booking"" it became eligible for a trademark. 
The online reservation service, based in Amsterdam, began using its name globally in 2006, and filed several trademark applications in 2011 and 2012.
A tribunal of the Patent and Trademark Office in 2016 rejected those applications, saying Booking.com referred generically to the common meaning of booking lodging and transportation and cannot be used exclusively through a federal trademark registration. 
Under U.S. law, only terms that distinguish a particular product or service from others on the market can be trademarked. 
The agency noted that federal courts have rejected trademarks for other similar names, such as hotels.com, mattress.com and lawyers.com.
Booking.com appealed, presenting a survey that showed that 74% of consumers identified Booking.com as a brand name. The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the company last February because the name as a whole is understood by the public to refer to a business.
The company, asking the Supreme Court to let the 4th Circuit ruling stand, called itself ""one of the best-known travel and accommodations services in the United States."" 

Appealing to the Supreme Court, the Patent and Trademark Office said that the addition of "".com"" to a generic word does not render it distinctive.

99,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2019 08:09PM ET</span>",Bond stayed for ex-Twitter employee accused of spying for Saudi Arabia,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - A ruling by a U.S. judge granting bond on Friday to a former Twitter (N:TWTR) employee accused of spying for Saudi Arabia was stayed after U.S. prosecutors said they appealed the decision. 
Magistrate Judge Paula McCandlis, of the U.S. District Court in Seattle, granted Ahmad Abouammo, 41, bond with travel restrictions while he awaited trial. But the ruling was stayed after prosecutors lodged an appeal, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office for the Western District of Washington said in an email.
Abouammo' lawyer, Chris Black, earlier said that an appeal would mean his client would remain in detention until a District Court judge made a ruling on McCandlis' decision. 
Abouammo was arrested on Tuesday and indicted on spying charges the next day, along with Ali Alzabarah, 35, another former Twitter employer, and Ahmed Almutairi, 30, who worked for the Saudi royal family.
The indictment points a public finger at Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally with warm ties to President Donald Trump despite what Amnesty International calls its restrictions on human rights and the ""extrajudicial killing"" of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The charges put Silicon Valley companies in the spotlight over how they protect user information, including from employees with no reason for accessing the data.
According to the complaint, Abouammo repeatedly accessed the Twitter account of a prominent critic of the Saudi royal family in early 2015. In one instance, he was able to view the email address and telephone number associated with the account. Abouammo also accessed the account of a second Saudi critic to get information.
Twitter uncovered Alzabarah's unauthorized access of private data and placed him on administrative leave in late 2015, but not before he had tapped data from over 6,000 accounts, 33 of which Saudi authorities submitted law enforcement requests on, the complaint said.
Almutairi is accused of acting as a go-between for the Saudi government and the Twitter employees. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Todd Greenberg told the court that Abouammo, a dual citizen of the United States and Lebanon, presented a flight risk due to large sums of money he had access to from the alleged co-conspirators. 
Black, the defense lawyer, said Abouammo, a Seattle resident, no longer had ties to the other two men and he should be allowed to live at home for the wellbeing of his family. 
In a letter presented to the court, Abouammo's wife, Zeina, said he homeschooled their children, who suffered from depression and anxiety after being bullied at school.

Arrest warrants have been issued for Alzabarah and Almutairi, who are believed to be in Saudia Arabia.

100,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2019 06:42PM ET</span>","WeWork, ex-CEO Neumann, Softbank sued over botched IPO, plummeting value","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - WeWork officials, including co-founder and former Chief Executive Adam Neumann, are being sued by minority shareholders to recoup losses as the shared workspace provider pulled its initial public offering and saw its value plunge more than 87%.
In a proposed class action filed this week in San Francisco Superior Court, former WeWork employee Natalie Sojka accused the company's board of directors of breaching its fiduciary duties to minority shareholders like her.
The San Francisco resident faulted the board for letting Japan's SoftBank Group rescue WeWork by boosting its stake to a potential 80% from 29% at a ""fire-sale"" price, and granting Neumann a $1.7 billion exit package.
Softbank and its chairman, Masayoshi Son, are among the 10 named defendants in the Nov. 4 complaint, which also accuses them and Neumann of self-dealing.
""WeWork believes this lawsuit is meritless,"" a spokeswoman said on Friday. Softbank, its outside representatives, and Sojka's lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.
The lawsuit is a new hurdle for WeWork, whose New York-based parent, the We Company, shelved its IPO on Sept. 30 after investors grew wary of its losses, its business model and its corporate governance. Neumann had resigned the previous week.
Estimates of WeWork's valuation have sunk to as little as $5.9 billion, based on the value of Softbank's proposed $9.5 billion rescue, from $47 billion in August.
WeWork on Friday revealed plans to divest all non-core businesses and cut jobs, and Neumann's former chief of staff sued him last week for pregnancy discrimination.
Though shareholder lawsuits are often associated with publicly traded companies, WeWork's private status ""has no bearing"" on the merits of a case, said Michael Klausner, a corporate law and governance professor at Stanford Law School.
He also said a self-dealing claim ""is something a court will look at very carefully, and can be difficult for defendants to dismiss.""
Sojka said she was a WeWork shareholder while employed there for 1-1/2 years.
She said that following her voluntary departure, she exercised stock options after being told WeWork intended to go public soon and the value of its stock would rise significantly.
Instead, Sojka said the defendants caused a big drop in the stock's value, and threatened ""irreparable harm"" from the Softbank rescue and other transactions.
The lawsuit seeks to block WeWork from rubber-stamping further transactions with Softbank and Neumann, and restrict stock repurchases from minority shareholders. It also seeks punitive damages.
Softbank's proposed rescue included $3 billion to repurchase WeWork shares from existing shareholders, including as much as $970 million from Neumann.
The case is Sojka v Neumann et al, California Superior Court, San Francisco County, No. CGC-19-580474."

The market managed to shrug off President Donald Trump's comment in the morning that he hadn't decided whether to rescind tariffs on Chinese goods. Stocks initially fell back on Trump's comment, with the Dow Jones industrials falling nearly 96 points before a recovery set in.
The S&P 500 was up 0.26%. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48%. The Nasdaq 100 Index rose 0.44%.
The Dow rallied to a tiny gain of 0.02%, or 6.44 points, on the way to a record close at 27,681.24.
For much of the day, the Dow was held back by weakness in Boeing (NYSE:BA) after Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) said it doesn't expect to be able to fly 737 MAX planes before March. Boeing was off 1.77% and subtracted nearly 43 points from the Dow.
Disney gave the Dow a big boost after reporting strong quarterly results after Thursday's close. The shares were up an index-leading 3.76% and added nearly 34 points to the blue-chip index.
Health and technology stocks were the market sector leaders. Energy, utilities and real estate were the laggards.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) both hit all-time intraday highs. Microsoft closed up 1.2%, reaching an intraday high of $145.99. Apple, up 0.27% on the day, hit an all-time high of $260.44.

Much of the gains were built on hopes that a U.S.-China trade deal is all but done. Reports suggest the deal would include holding back on the December tariffs and perhaps tariffs imposed in September. Japan's Nikkei 225 index hit a 52-week high on trade hopes as well.
 
Interest rates moved up again, with the 10-Year Treasury yield at 1.942%, up from Thursday's 1.922%. The yield jumped as high as 1.973% on Thursday, its highest level since the end of July.

But a team of quants argues they’ve just been caught flat-footed by slumping interest rates -- and there’s a fix.
Holding low-dividend stocks during an era of rock-bottom borrowing costs and reducing portfolio turnover help explain why active-manager performance has “collapsed” since 2018, according to Nomura Instinet LLC analysts led by Joseph Mezrich.
Depressed rates lift high-dividend shares at the expense of the low-dividend peers favored by equity pickers, the team argues in new research this week. Throw in a trend toward reducing portfolio churn to save on transaction costs and it’s a poisonous cocktail for active management.
“Much of the poor active manager performance of recent years can be traced to how funds have been positioned for interest rate movements and how funds have reduced portfolio turnover, presumably to reduce costs,” the team writes. “Importantly, there may be remedies.”
With rates set to stay lower for longer and pressure on fees growing across the industry, managers should look to high dividend yielders, according to Nomura. They should also boost portfolio turnover to avoid “momentum traps,” or hanging on to winners long after they’ve stopped winning. Momentum factor “optimization” or “hedging” can also help, the team said.
Headwinds
Last quarter was another to forget for large-cap managers, with just 21% outperforming their benchmarks after fees, according to Nomura Instinet. That echoes recent findings from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
Thanks to their status as bond proxies, high dividend payers have outperformed amid the central bank-induced global slump in borrowing costs. That’s been bad news for active managers, whose biggest overweights tend to be low-dividend-yielders, according to Nomura.
Meanwhile, rising borrowing costs tend to coincide with stronger performance for smaller firms, which have greater sensitivity to the state of the economy. When small-caps do well, “market diversity” increases, providing managers “a larger pool of alpha opportunities,” the quants write.
That pool has been awfully shallow in recent years as the opposite has been true -- the performance of small companies has lagged as growth slowed and rates were lowered to support the economy."
106,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 08, 2019 04:26PM ET</span>","Mega Auction a Flop? Petrobras Investors Are Doing Fine, Thank You","(Bloomberg) -- Brazil’s largest-ever sale of oil prospects frustrated those waiting for strong dollar inflows and cast doubt on foreign appetite for the country’s assets, but state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA’s investors seem unfazed by the auction’s outcome.
Preferred shares of the oil giant -- which initially sold off on the view that the bigger-than-expected bid for the Buzios field would hurt the company’s ongoing deleveraging process -- are up more than 3% since the auction, while Petrobras’s $2.75 billion of bonds due 2028 are little changed in the period.
“The auction result was positive for Petrobras,”  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG’s Regis Cardoso wrote in a Nov. 7 report. “Buzios is one of the very best pre-salt fields, with proven high productivity wells and low breakevens,” said Cardoso, who has an outperform rating for the company’s American depositary receipts.
Banco Bradesco BBI,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Banco Itau BBA also reiterated buy-equivalent ratings for the stock, calling the oil giant’s investment accretive, offsetting a higher cash expenditure. Asset-management firm Dogma Capital said this week’s event doesn’t change its bullish view for Petrobras. Most importantly, analysts say, the lack of participation by oil majors isn’t necessarily a sign of bad capital allocation.
“There was a significant asymmetry in favor of Petrobras in the auction,” Cardoso wrote, citing the compensation to be paid to Petrobras for investments it has already made. “The company already operates in these areas and taking the surplus volumes allows for many synergies with the existing operations.”
Petrobras’s Chief Executive Officer Roberto Castello Branco said in an interview that regulatory uncertainties and the amount of money bidders would have to commit upfront were the culprits for the absence of most major oil companies. He said the firm can develop the Buzios field it won on its own without compromising financial discipline. Even though Petrobras needs to pay $17 billion by year-end just in licensing fees, leverage levels “will stay fairly stable” in the fourth quarter compared with net debt at 1.96 times Ebitda in the third quarter, he said.
“While the investment is more expensive and impacts Petrobras’s ability to cut down debt in short term, the asset is pretty good,” said Ray Zucaro, the chief investment officer at RVX Asset Management in Miami. “At the end of the day, the company is acquiring assets in one of the more premium areas,” said Zucaro, who owns Petrobras shares."

It may be the start of a longer malaise.
Losses in Chile’s dollar-denominated bonds have accelerated this month as the economic cost of three weeks of protests and riots becomes increasingly apparent. Investment has stalled, shops are closed and tourists are staying away amid the biggest social uprising since the return of democracy in 1990.
The dollar notes due in 2050 and 2047 posted the first and third worst returns among all 74 emerging and frontier markets in the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Emerging Markets Sovereign Index. Chilean bonds handed investors a loss of 3.1% in the first seven days of the month, while the benchmark fell 0.3%.
Chile’s political and economic landscape has been turned on its head by the unexpected explosion of social rage. Twenty people have been killed and more than a quarter of all supermarkets have been vandalized, ransacked or burnt to the ground. It has come as a shock to the system for a country that was regarded as the most stable and well-managed in Latin America.
“Chilean markets, the economy, social-political system are undergoing regime shift,” said Arthur Budaghyan, the chief emerging-market strategist at BCA Research Inc. in Montreal. “As investors, we have to be open to the idea that this will entail new macro policies that will be more populist.”
Still, the nation’s credit risk is the lowest in the region and among the smallest in emerging markets. The cost of hedging against a Chilean default over the next five years is half that of Mexico and a third of that in Brazil.
Rising Cost
President Sebastian Pinera has announced a social agenda costing $1.2 billion, including a minimum monthly income of 350,000 pesos ($470) that will benefit more than half a million people as he tries to end the disturbances.
“This shock will deteriorate economic activity and investment,” said Felipe Labbe, an economist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) based in New York. “Subsidies and required reforms included in the recent social agenda will impact the fiscal position and create more deficit.”
Yet, if Pinera he has any hope of quelling the unrest, he will have to go further. Protesters are demanding better pensions, healthcare, education and public transport, as well as a new constitution. They also want Pinera to go.
Finance Minister Ignacio Briones has cut the government’s growth forecast for the year to about 2% from the 2.6% predicted in September. He estimates the direct costs of the riots at between $2 billion and $3 billion.
As the protests go on and the pressure on Pinera builds, Budaghyan says Chilean assets are likely to underperform for six months to a year and he recommends shorting the peso versus the U.S. dollar and downgrading allocation to Chilean stocks from overweight to neutral.
Market Impact
Capital Economics economist Quinn Markwith says there is a good chance that protests will lead Chile’s gross domestic product to contract in the fourth quarter.
The benchmark IPSA stock index has fallen 10% since the troubles started on Oct. 18. The index hit a two-and-a-half year low on Wednesday.
The peso has been little better. The currency was the worst performer of 24 emerging-market currencies in October after the Argentine peso, reaching a 16-year low on Tuesday.
Even external bonds, which had been more resilient, started to decline this month as foreign investors turn more cautious. Chile’s dollar-bond spreads have widened over the past week after narrowing earlier this year.
But as protests drag on and an end to the clashes seems out of sight, even foreign investors are turning more cautious.
Technical analysis also doesn’t favor a rebound in Chilean bonds. The nation’s most liquid notes were trading at all-time highs before the protests erupted and some analysts say they continue to be expensive even after the recent correction. Bonds due in 2050 were traded at around 102.6 cents on the dollar on Friday, from a peak of 115 cents in early September. The bonds due in 2028 were worth 105 cents from 109 cents two months ago.
“The limited stock of USD bonds and relatively good fundamentals have benefited Chilean bonds valuations, but now investors are assessing the long-term impact of changes in the economic agenda,” said William Snead, an analyst at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA in New York. “Even after the recent repricing, Chilean bonds look fairly valued to overvalued when compared to some Gulf Cooperation Council countries as Saudia Arabia, Qatar.”

The bank’s London desk was long on French bonds and short on German debt, betting the spread would narrow, said Bernard Field, an official at the Autorite des Marches Financiers. But the opposite scenario played out as Greece’s impasse with creditors deepened, causing the desk to lose $6 million on June 15, 2015 and an extra $8.7 million at market open the next day, Field said.
To narrow its losses and avoid hitting a $20 million loss-limit set by Morgan Stanley’s management, the London desk allegedly acquired futures on French and German bonds on June 16, 2015, with the sole objective of increasing the market value of French and Belgian bonds before “massively and instantaneously” selling the latter, Field said at a Paris hearing.
“This was clearly a pump and dump strategy,” added Camille Dropsy, another AMF official speaking on behalf of investigators. “Morgan Stanley consciously fooled the market.”
‘High Standards’
Morgan Stanley said in an emailed statement it “absolutely and categorically rejects the AMF’s allegations.” It said it was dismayed on learning investigators are seeking a 25 million-euro fine ($28 million). “The firm will continue to defend vigorously its integrity and high standards of professional behavior.”
The AMF enforcement committee assesses market-abuse cases ranging from insider trading to publishing misleading information. It has the power to impose civil fines and bans and typically issues decisions several weeks after hearings.
According to AMF investigators, Morgan Stanley’s tactic enabled the London desk to avoid about 5 millions euros in losses, said Field, who added that French and Belgian bonds are considered interchangeable.
Field, who plays the role of a devil’s advocate in the case, disagreed with investigators on several points. In particular, he said the case should focus only French bonds traded on a platform regulated by the AMF, narrowing the loss Morgan Stanley is accused of unfairly avoiding to 1.7 million euros.
‘No Impact’
Stephane Benouville, a lawyer for the bank, said the accusations don’t stand up to scrutiny. He said the futures the London desk bought had no impact on French bonds and complained that AMF investigators hadn’t bothered trying to prove any effect.
“When you listen to the prosecution it seems we’re being told that Morgan Stanley should have sat on its positions,” Benouville said. “If we weren’t allowed to deal German futures, French futures or French bonds what were we allowed to do? Sit tight as losses piled up?”
Benouville said any decision to fine Morgan Stanley would send a message that market makers aren’t allowed to hedge themselves and exit risky positions. Ciaran O’Flynn, a managing director speaking on behalf of the bank at Friday’s hearing, went further.
“As a market maker and like all market makers, we must provide a price to clients when they want it. We do not control when that will happen,” O’Flynn said. “All market makers, to provide that function, need to know that at a certain point they will be able to exit the risk. It is fundamental to the provision of liquidity to begin with. Any suggestion otherwise exhibits a poor understanding of the basis function of market making.”"

Trump announced the formation of a new group -- “Black Voices for Trump” -- on Friday in Atlanta to recruit and engage African-American voters after launching a Hispanic outreach campaign earlier this year. Both efforts will rely heavily on the president’s economic record -- primarily the decline in unemployment among minorities during his tenure.
“We’re going to campaign for every last African American vote in 2020,” Trump said. “We’re going to make 2020 a year of change in black communities all across the country.”
But it’s not clear whether job gains will be enough to overcome damage from his own divisive rhetoric on race, such as saying there were “very fine people” on both sides of a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that erupted in violence and left one person dead, and recently calling himself the victim of a “lynching” in the House impeachment inquiry.
Republicans have long trailed Democrats among minority groups, but Trump has taken that disparity to new levels. A September poll by the Associated Press and NORC at the University of Chicago showed that 92% of African Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of race relations.
The survey results reflect multiple controversies that left critics accusing him of enabling a resurgence of white supremacists and nationalists.
Deep ‘Hostility’
Polling data suggest that many African-American voters view Trump’s comments on race as showing “hostility” that’s “so deep and profound that perhaps it is preventing him from finding points of commonality that he might be able to find if his racial rhetoric was different,” said Keisha Lindsay, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.
The issue surfaced again at his own rally in Louisiana on Tuesday.
Eddie Rispone, Louisiana’s GOP gubernatorial nominee stood alongside Trump and said: “We have a president here that has had the lowest unemployment for minorities in the history of the United States and they’ll call him a racist?”
The unemployment rate for blacks dipped to a record low 5.4% in October from nearly triple that level a decade ago. Among whites, the rate is lower at 3.2%. The gap between the two has remained, though has tightened this year as more black workers are brought in from the sidelines.
Still, Rispone’s comments illustrate how steep a climb Trump faces in winning over minority voters. On top of actively courting those votes, he must first combat perceptions and claims from critics that he is racist.
Impeachment Inquiry
The new push with minorities comes as Trump tries to face down the House impeachment inquiry, which has delivered a series of damaging blows to his popularity and crushed the prospect of pushing any major new initiatives through Congress before the election.
But for Trump, it’s less about winning than narrowing his wide margin of loss among black and Hispanic voters, who accounted for 21% of the electorate in 2016. He would also benefit by simply quelling enthusiasm in those groups to get to the polls and vote for Democrats.
His re-election path runs through swing states and potentially vulnerable strongholds with large non-white populations. Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina have significant black communities; Arizona, New Mexico and Texas have major Hispanic communities; and Trump’s new home state of Florida has both.
Trump’s primary argument thus far has been economic. He consistently points to record-low unemployment among blacks and Hispanics, and his campaign is looking to the new group to spread that message to minority communities across the country. He argues that Democrats -- who have won the lion’s share of black votes since the 1964 Civil Rights Act -- have failed their communities. Asking for black voters’ support in 2016, Trump said: “What the hell do you have to lose?”
Trump’s Rhetoric
But Trump’s own rhetoric has repelled the groups he’s now trying to attract.
In addition to his divisive comments about the 2017 Charlottesville violence, Trump has described places such as Haiti and African nations as “sh--hole” countries. He labeled Baltimore -- a black-majority city -- a “disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.”
Trump has regularly attacked the legacy of Barack Obama, who still enjoys wide support among black voters. More recently, Trump said four Democratic congresswomen who are minorities should “go back” to where they came from. This summer, he declined to recant his claim that the Central Park 5 -- young black men wrongly convicted for a crime -- should have faced the death penalty.
Last month, Trump said the House’s impeachment inquiry against him amounted to a “lynching,” invoking a violent period of racism in America’s history. His campaign quickly responded with past instances of Democrats, including Joe Biden, employing similar rhetoric as Bill Clinton faced impeachment.
But Trump, who rejects claims that he’s racist, has made gestures on race that have ranged from meaningful policy to what critics have considered superficial, including inviting Kanye West to the White House and sending a hostage negotiator to help rapper A$AP Rocky, who had been arrested in Sweden after getting into a street brawl.
Reducing Prison Sentences
Trump points to other actions his administration has taken, such as the First Step Act, which reduces prison sentences. He’s announced he wants to expand federal funding for faith-based historically black colleges. And his tax overhaul included an opportunity zones program targeting inner-city communities.
Ja’Ron Smith, a deputy assistant to the president and one of the administration’s highest-ranking black officials, said: “When President Trump talks about forgotten communities, he’s talking about those low-income communities that still look the same since almost the riots of the late ‘60s and have been decimated by trade policies that have chased middle class opportunities away from those communities.”
He said Trump’s approach is that every community should get “a chance at the American dream.”
But Corey Fields, a sociology professor at Georgetown University and author of “Black Elephants in the Room: The Unexpected Politics of African-American Republicans,” said the Trump campaign “is not talking to black people in ways that are resonating.”
“The likelihood that it’s going to move black voters at all is not very likely,” Fields said.
Mixed Signals
There are mixed signs that 2020 will be closer. A New York Times poll published this week showed that each of the three democratic front-runners -- Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders -- have smaller leads over Trump among blacks and Hispanics than Hillary Clinton carried in 2016.
In a statement, the Republican party said it continues to engage black voters. “Our permanent, data-driven ground game allows us to expand upon our presence in black communities from previous election cycles and connect with voters in their communities about issues they care about,” they said.
Georgetown’s Fields said the messaging could also be aimed at white voters who are uncomfortable with Trump’s suggestion that criticisms of his race relations are invalid because he’s praised by Diamond and Silk, the African American Trump supporters and social media stars. Last month, after Trump’s “lynching” comments, the duo backed the president.
“They want us to follow the law, but they want to do everything they can to railroad a sitting president and I’m sorry, it’s the truth, it’s a political lynching. Our president is being lynched and we are not going to stand for it,” Lynnette “Diamond” Hardaway said.

(Reuters) - Gap Inc (N:GPS) said on Friday it was sticking with plans to spin off its Old Navy brand into a separate company, as Wall Street analysts questioned its commitment to the project following the surprise exit of Chief Executive Officer Art Peck.
Gap shares fell 5.5% on Friday after Thursday's shock announcement, which came along with another weak batch of forecasts for quarterly sales and full-year earnings.
The abrupt change in leadership comes just before the year's main holiday shopping season, with merchandise already ordered and stores stocking up ahead of the unofficial kickoff over the late November U.S. Thanksgiving weekend. But analysts said the change in leadership would not impact the company either way.
Peck, who held the top job since 2015, planned to split the better-performing Old Navy brand from Gap and Banana Republic, and Gap in an email to Reuters said, ""The board continues to believe in the strategic rationale for the planned separation, and the preparation for separation continues as planned.""
It added that there would be a regularly scheduled meeting of its board next week and that any additional details on the company's attitude to the spin off would be provided in an earnings call on November 21.
Several Wall Street brokerages said the deal should be canned.
""It makes little sense to spin Old Navy until, at least, its sales have stabilized,"" David Swartz, an analyst with brokerage Morningstar, said in a note to clients, adding that Old Navy represented most of Gap's enterprise value as a company. 
Robert Fisher, the son of Gap's founders, has taken over as interim chief executive officer of the retailer. Fisher, who also serves as the company's chairman, is Gap's largest shareholder with a 12.5% stake, according to Refinitiv data.
For an interactive graphic, click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/32t4cN3 
The Gap brand, once a trend setter with its casual logo emblazoned hoodies and Khaki cargos, has struggled to keep pace with fast-fashion rivals such as Inditex's (MC:ITX) Zara and H&M (ST:HMb) and has experienced several years of falling sales. 
While the retailer has invested heavily in some of its most iconic categories like denim, its product assortments are still viewed by many as lacking newness and Gap needs to market more effectively to younger consumers as competition stiffens, analysts said.
Peck's successor will not be able to make needed change in time to holiday sales this season, several industry experts said.
""It's already too late, all the plans are set, everything's etched in stone, nothing's changing,"" said Jerry Storch, chief executive officer of consultancy Storch Advisors.
""If you brought in the most spectacular person imaginable and they had all the answers, they still couldn't change anything until probably as late as next fall.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Friday proposed delaying a new rule limiting foreign banks' credit exposure to a single counterparty, allowing non-U.S. regulators time to adopt similar regulations which foreign companies could opt to follow instead.
With the proposed 18-month delay, foreign banks would not have to comply with the new restrictions until July 1, 2021 for larger banks, and the beginning of 2022 for smaller firms.
The rule would apply to the combined U.S. operations under direct control of foreign banks, which are permitted to operate under their home country's similar rules.
The potential delay would not apply to intermediate holding companies established by foreign banks in the United States, which must adhere to the Fed's rule.
The rule, introduced under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law but still not effective, aims to prevent contagion risks that rocked many big banks during financial the crisis due to their large exposures to one another."

The Boeing (NYSE:BA) loss was the largest contributor to the Dow's small decline on Friday.


The airline is Boeing's biggest customer and had 34 of the planes in its fleet – 4.5% of the total – when they were grounded on March 13. In its 10Q SEC filing, Southwest said it was expecting a fourth-quarter Federal Aviation Administation approval to return the planes after upgrades to its systems and pilot retraining. For Southwest, that translated into service availability in early February. Now because of continuing uncertainty on when the approvals will come, Southwest is now targeting March 6. But even that date could be moved back, Southwest said.


The groundings also mean Southwest won't be taking delivery of seven more 737 Max planes this quarter and is supposed to get 34 more after that.


Southwest shares were off 0.2% Friday afternoon.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The outlook for the U.S. economy has brightened in recent weeks thanks to signs of progress on U.S.-China trade deal, giving big asset managers at this week's Reuters Global Investment Outlook 2020 Summit a fresh sense of confidence that recession will not come knocking for a year or longer.
While fund managers are showing signs of caution, the recent thawing in the trade-related tensions between the United States and China has helped soothe nerves.
DoubleLine Capital, the investment manager headed by Jeffrey Gundlach, has pared its view on the chances of a U.S. recession in the next year to 40% from 75% a few months ago, said Andrew Hsu, co-portfolio manager of the DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund (DBLTX).
With the spike in trade tensions between the United States and China earlier this year, there were sharp drops in manufacturing, CEO confidence and corporate capital expenditures, all of which pointed to a high likelihood of a recession, Hsu said.
Since then, however, several positive reports, including earnings, strong employment numbers and wage growth that is starting to peak out, have helped brighten the economic picture, Hsu said.
""All of those indicate that maybe there are still some legs left before there is a recession,"" he said.
The Federal Reserve's pivot over the past few months - going from hiking rates over the previous three years to cutting them three times in 2019 - has also helped allay concerns.
""I was concerned earlier last year when the Fed kept hiking that they would force us into a recession,"" said Anne Mathias, global rates and FX strategist at Vanguard.
""But the speed with which they walked back the December 2018 rate hike really led me to believe that they were extremely sensitive in terms of over-tightening,"" she said.
""I don't see a recession in the near term absent some unpredictable, idiosyncratic event,"" she said.
Dan Ivascyn, chief investment officer at bond giant Pimco, which has $1.9 trillion in assets under management, said he thinks the economic expansion ""can last a comfortable bit of time longer, even a lot longer.""
""You don't see the same type of end of cycle excesses that you typically see,"" Ivascyn said.
Investors across the across the Atlantic are also sanguine about the global economic outlook. Pascal Blanque, chief investment officer at Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager, considers a global recession unlikely, given markets' expectation for stimulus still to come from policymakers.
Georg Schuh, chief investment officer for EMEA at 752 billion euro German asset management firm DWS, said ""in a nutshell I would say I’m on the upper end of economic optimism. So the probability of a recession, be it in the U.S. or elsewhere, is very low.""
However, the fact that few investors expect a recession soon might be a contrarian indicator.
""Usually people are most optimistic at the peaks and most pessimistic at the bottoms. I believe there is more of a reversal at hand than the market anticipates,"" said Rupal Bhansali, CIO, International & Global Equities at Ariel Funds in New York.
The market takes a lot of comfort from the wave of quantitative easing around the world, she said.
""The reason I don't is that we have seen this playbook in Japan. Japan has tried all of these things for way longer and in way bigger size than any other country than we have witnessed,"" said Bhansali.
""The fact of the matter is that it did not help."""

In June, AT&T filed a bad faith complaint against nine individual station owners, which collectively pulled 20 stations in 17 cities from DIRECTV, DIRECTV NOW and/or U-verse. The nine station groups are either managed or controlled by Sinclair Broadcast Group, AT&T said. 
One of these owners controls three ABC, CBS, NBC or FOX affiliates; another has two, and five owners have one. AT&T said it has reached agreement with three of the nine broadcasters named in the complaint.
AT&T reached settlements with two of the groups, while the FCC said the seven remaining broadcast station groups ""violated the per se good faith negotiation standards"" and cited repeated delays by the negotiator for the owners in agreeing to talks. ""This is the most egregious example of delay that we have encountered since the good faith rules were adopted,"" the FCC said. 
Sinclair said the ""matter is between these licensees and the FCC. We have no involvement in these negotiations.""
AT&T said the ""FCC ruling that the broadcast station groups’ behavior was a violation of its rules shows again that the entire retransmission consent process is broken and demands immediate reform.""
The company added it was ""clearly one of the more egregious examples of how broadcasters routinely hold consumers hostage into paying higher and higher retrans fees, rather than being stewards of the public airwaves.""
In October, Sinclair said it had reached a multiyear agreement across DIRECTV, AT&T TV and U-verse for continued use of Sinclair’s owned local broadcast stations and other programming, including the Tennis Channel and a regional sports network featuring Chicago Cubs games launching in 2020.
The dispute comes as Congress is considering whether to reauthorize the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act (STELAR), a law governing the retransmission of broadcast television by satellite companies. If the law is not extended, the FCC will lose authority to enforce ""good faith"" rules with regard to retransmission consent.
On Wednesday, the Senate Commerce Committee plans to take up the bill introduced by the panel's chair, Roger Wicker.

""If Congress does not renew STELAR this year, these broadcaster TV blackouts will increase in frequency,"" AT&T said.

UBS said it was taking ""a more cautious view on NAND pricing"" through next year and cut its earnings and revenue estimates on the company for 2020 and 2021. Micron fell 1.5%.
Micron has forecast adjusted earnings in the range of 39 cents to 53 cents a share on revenue of $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion for the first quarter of its new fiscal year, the holiday quarter. 
That was below estimates from Wall Street for earnings of 53 cents a share on revenue of $4.8 billion on average, according to FactSet.
Others seem to agree. Nomura said memory prices are continuing to slide and warned that ""the December-quarter outlooks of many of the broader-based chip companies suggest ongoing softness.""
But it’s not just Micron reeling under the pressure of falling memory prices.
Samsung (KS:005930) recently reported that semiconductor revenues declined 29% year over year to about $15 billion in the third quarter of the year, as margins were hurt by a sharp decline in both NAND and DRAM prices."
118,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2019 01:31PM ET</span>","U.S. CDC reports 'breakthrough' in vaping lung injury probe as cases top 2,000","By Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Tests of lung samples taken from 29 patients with vaping-related lung injuries suggest all contained Vitamin E acetate, a discovery U.S. officials described as a ""breakthrough"" in the investigation of the nationwide outbreak that topped 2,000 cases this week.
The discovery of Vitamin E acetate in lung samples offers the first direct evidence of a link with the substance and vaping-related lung injuries. The substance has also been identified in tests by U.S. and state officials of product samples collected from patients with the vaping injury.
In a telephone briefing on Friday, Dr. Anne Schuchet, principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), called Vitamin E acetate ""a very strong culprit of concern"" and referred to the discovery as ""a breakthrough"" in the investigation.
She cautioned that more work is needed to definitively declare it a cause, and said studies may identify other potential causes of the injuries as well.
Vitamin E acetate is believed to be used as a cutting agent in illicit products containing THC - the component of marijuana that gets people high.
Although the substance was detected in all 29 of the lung samples, which came from patients in several different states, more testing is needed to establish a causal link between exposure and injury, Schuchet said, adding that ""many substances are still under investigation.""
On Thursday, the CDC reported there have been 2,051 confirmed and probable U.S. lung injury cases associated with use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products in 49 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as 39 deaths.
Nearly 85 percent of lung injury patients in the nationwide outbreak have reported using products containing THC.
In the CDC analysis, THC was detected in 23 of 28 patient samples of lung cells, including from three patients who said they did not use THC products. Nicotine was detected in 16 of 26 patient samples.
The results were published on Friday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.
In a separate report in the same journal, the Illinois Department of Public Health found that compared to vapers who did not get sick, those who had a lung injury were significantly more likely to use THC-containing vaping products exclusively or frequently, and were nine times more likely to have purchased products from illicit sources, such as from on-line or off the street.
The vaping injury patients also had a higher rate of using ""Dank Vapes,"" a class of largely counterfeit THC-containing products, according to the study.
Together, the findings reinforce public health officials' recommendation that people avoid using e-cigarettes that contain THC or any products that come from illicit sources."

120,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2019 01:15PM ET</span>",Culture change is the cutting edge of mental health benefits at work,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Hartmut Braune comes to work in security communications at SAP, he never knows what emergency will land in his inbox. 
It is a challenging job, compounded by the fact that Braune also coordinates the company's global Lighthouse Core Team, which provides peer assistance to struggling employees, as well as a shoulder to cry on. 
""It's the difficult part, but sometimes tears help clear the situation,"" said Braune, who is based in Germany. 
Many companies offer employee assistance programs, mindfulness apps or in-office counseling. But experts say a culture shift toward openness, from the C-suite on down, is most effective. That translates to peer counseling, colleagues sharing their experiences and open dialogue. 
Companies take a myriad of approaches to this challenge. At SAP, considered a thought leader on employee mental health, the company calls its system the Employee Care Cycle. That starts with prevention and destigmatization, said Torsten Paul, SAP's director digital health & well-being. 
Indeed, Braune coached one woman who returned to work at SAP after a mental health leave, but had not been open with her manager and colleagues about why she took time off. 
""People have a tendency to hide what was happening – they feel shame,"" Braune said. 
Braune walked the woman through some tiny steps she could take, and eventually, she met with her manager. A week later, when Braune saw the woman, she was smiling.
Overall, depression causes an average of 40 days of absenteeism per sufferer at SAP, Torsten said. Serious cases might involve short- or long-term disability. But if a person returns to work and the same stress factors exist, they will just get sick again. 
One key offering for employees is a two-day immersive mindfulness program, so popular it has a waiting list of 9,000. The company also shares video testimonials on its internal website from colleagues who have overcome challenges. 
In addition, SAP encourages workers to do frequent self-assessments, and managers assess the organization itself. 
At Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), individuals at all levels share their own mental health experiences, in person, on social media and via podcasts. 
""We didn’t ask, but it has happened that many of our leaders stepped up and started telling their stories, their personal struggles or ones they’ve witnessed,"" said Sonja Kellen, senior director of global health and wellness at Microsoft. ""And it has naturally become pervasive in the culture.""
One employee who shared her story was 25-year-old program manager Beth Anne Katz, who detailed her battles with depression on YouTube videos and a company website (https://news.microsoft.com/life/a-safe-space-to-be-who-you-are/). 
""Being open about my suffering was the hardest thing I’ve done, but I am not afraid of who I am anymore. Depression isn’t something to be ashamed of,"" Katz tells her colleagues. 
Last May, Microsoft hosted several movie screenings about anxiety and suicide, followed by conversations with the people who volunteered their stories. A counselor stood by. 
""It’s been gratifying to see the sheer volume of people to speak up,"" said Kellen. 
Cost savings are not the key driver, even though mental healthcare is a top spend, Kellen added, noting that mental health breaks are one of the top reasons people go on leave at Microsoft, beyond parental leave. 
AN APP FOR THAT
Of course, there are apps for helping culture change. Technology is particularly good at crunching data from employee self-assessments to help companies figure out what services they need. 
London-based Unmind, for example, provides a workplace mental health platform, used by companies in 47 countries, including British Airways and Live Nation. Employers get data, such as how many people are stressed or feel ill because of stress, and information on how managers can help them be less stressed. Workers can access targeted educational material. 
Many companies also turn to web-based mindfulness apps, one of which is Raw Mind Coach, and app-based therapy delivery like Talkspace. These are helpful to those without access to in-person counseling. 
Consultants help companies develop a tailored strategy, such as Mind Share Partners, a non-profit consultancy, which recently published a report on mental health at work in partnership with SAP (https://www.mindsharepartners.org/mentalhealthatworkreport). 
""We’re not a benefits provider. We see our trainings as what’s needed to reduce stigma,"" said Kelly Greenwood, Mind Share Partner's founder and CEO.
Ken Dolan-Del Vecchio, a workplace mental health consultant, preaches the following message to companies, urging them to take action on mental health: ""The health of employees is correlated positively to business outcome. It would be foolish to leave that to chance.""

MILAN (Reuters) - An Italian court on Friday convicted 13 former bankers from  Deutsche Bank , Nomura and Monte dei Paschi di Siena over derivative transactions that prosecutors say helped the world's oldest bank conceal massive losses.
The verdict, read in court by lead judge Lorella Trovato, also ordered the seizure of 64 million euros ($70.5 million) from Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) and 88 million euros from Nomura (T:8604) as part of the sentence. 
Monte dei Paschi reached a settlement with the court over the case in 2016 at a cost of 10.6 million euros.
The case centres on two controversial derivatives deals - known as Alexandria and Santorini - that Nomura and Deutsche Bank arranged for Monte dei Paschi in 2009.
Prosecutors said the deals helped Monte dei Paschi, which was founded in 1472 and is Italy's fourth biggest lender, hide more than 2 billion euros of losses racked up after the costly acquisition of a smaller rival in 2008.
""We are disappointed with the verdict. We will review the rationale for it once it is published,"" Deutsche Bank said in a statement. Nomura had no immediate comment. 
The scandal, together with more losses suffered by the bank during the euro zone debt crisis, threatened to destabilize Italy's financial industry and forced the Siena-based lender to seek an 8 billion euro state bailout in 2017.
In the trial, which started in Milan in December 2016 and took 100 hearings to complete, the three banks and 13 defendants faced allegations of false accounting and market manipulation between 2008 and 2012.
Monte dei Paschi and its former top managers were also accused of misleading regulators.
All defendants have always denied wrongdoing and none of them will serve time in jail until the lengthy appeals process is exhausted.
Monte dei Paschi's former chairman Giuseppe Mussari, one of five former executives from the Tuscan bank on trial, was given the heaviest sentence of seven years and six months in jail. 
Deutsche Bank and Nomura were both convicted as institutions for failing to prevent wrongdoing by their employees.
All six defendants linked to Deutsche Bank and the two who once worked for Nomura were handed jail terms. 
They include sentences of four years and eight months each for Ivor Dunbar, former co-head of Global Capital Markets at the German bank, Michele Faissola, its former head of Global Rates, and Michele Foresti, its former head of Structured Trading. 
Nomura's former chief executive for the EMEA region, Sadeq Sayeed, was also given a sentence of four years and eight months while Raffaele Ricci, the former head of the bank's EMEA Sales, was handed a lighter jail sentence. 

Lawyers for the defendants said they expected to appeal the verdict once the full ruling is released.

Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House, did not give further details about the administration's regulatory plans or give a specific date for any announcements.
U.S. health officials have been sounding the alarm amid a nationwide outbreak of serous lung illnesses linked to vaping, and have raised concerns about the use of electronic smoking devices, particularly among youth.
Trump called on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration to study the issue in September, and said regulators planned to ban all flavored e-cigarettes.
Congress is also investigating the industry. Additionally, various U.S. states and localities have cracked down on the products, which have also faced numerous lawsuits.
""We have to take care of our kids most importantly so we're going to have an age limit of 21 or so,"" Trump said.
Still, he acknowledged the interests of the vaping industry and said the administration was also weighing the impact of any action on jobs.
""We're talking about the age, were talking about flavors we're also talking about keeping people working,"" he told reporters.
The use of flavors such as mint and fruit to make vaping more appealing has also faced criticism from public health advocates and others. On Thursday, e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc said it would immediately halt U.S. sales of its mint-flavored nicotine cartridges."

Inspectors raided the head offices of National Bank (AT:NBGr), Piraeus Bank (AT:BOPr), Eurobank (AT:EURBr),  Alpha Bank  (AT:ACBr), Attica Bank (AT:BOAr) and the offices of the Greek bank association, bankers said on Thursday.
They said the competition authority, which is an independent body, had carried out the unprecedented raids because it was looking into whether banks had colluded on transaction fees.
""The checks reflected the Competition Commission's concerns that the businesses under investigation may have been involved in anti-competitive practices of horizontal collaboration,"" the authority said in a statement on Friday.
It said the raids, which it had been planning for weeks, were preliminary steps in cases where there may be indications of anti-competitive practices.
""Conducting such probes does not prejudge that firms being investigated have indeed been involved in anti-competitive behavior, nor the probe's outcome,"" the authority said.
Some bankers told Reuters on Thursday that the raids were politically motivated.
Last month, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis urged banks to revoke increases in charges for a series of services.
On Friday, Development Minister Adonis Georgiadis said the government had nothing to do with the raids, saying the authority was an independent body.

Last month, members of the United Auto Workers ratified a new four-year labor deal, ending the strike that began on Sept. 16 over higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits.
Below are companies impacted by the strike:
MAGNA INTERNATIONAL INC
The Canadian auto parts maker said the labor strike at General Motors, its biggest customer, will potentially hit full-year sales by about $500 million.
The strike will also hit consolidated margins by about 30 basis points, the company said.
AMERICAN AXLE & MANUFACTURING HOLDINGS INC
The driveline and drivetrain systems maker said the strike reduced third-quarter sales by $57 million and also warned of an about $250 million hit to full-year revenue, prompting the company to lower its 2019 forecast.
APTIV PLC
The auto parts maker said the strike wiped off $70 million from the company's revenue and reduced profit by 10 cents per share in the third quarter.
The company's full-year forecast includes an estimated $250 million impact from the GM strike.
TENNECO INC
The auto parts maker expects the strike to have a negative impact of about $35 million on fourth-quarter EBITDA.
AK STEEL HOLDING CORP
The company cut its forecast for full-year earnings and flat-rolled steel shipments, citing the strike.
It predicted a reduction of flat-rolled steel shipments to between 5.3 and 5.4 million tons for the full year, citing the strike.
KAISER ALUMINUM CORP
The company said it had lower-than-expected automotive shipments in the third quarter, partly due to the GM strike, and flagged a potential $3 million to $6 million EBITDA impact.
PULTEGROUP INC
The U.S. homebuilder said it saw an impact on demand in many of Midwest markets from the lengthy labor dispute.
GENTEX CORP
The automatic-dimming rearview mirror maker said the GM strike hit third-quarter net sales by about 2%.
Gentex also lowered its full-year sales forecast, and said it expects about $7 million to $8 million in lost sales per week of the strike.
PAM TRANSPORTATION SERVICES
The U.S. truckload services provider said the GM-UAW strike impacted its quarterly earnings.
LINAMAR CORP
The Canadian auto parts maker said it estimated a profit impact of up to C$1 million ($761,035) per day due to a fall in orders from General Motors."

The country lost 1,800 jobs in October, Statistics Canada said Friday in Ottawa, versus economist expectations for a 15,000 uptick in employment. October marks the first month of job losses since July. Full-time positions fell by 16,100, while part-time increased 14,300.

The flat reading for employment in October doesn’t shift the view of a labor market that remains a bright spot for the Canadian economy despite concerns that trade tensions are slowing growth. Canada added almost 135,000 jobs in the prior two months.The question now is whether the month’s drop in employment is a blip or if it’s a sign of future weakness. The latter could pressure the Bank of Canada into cutting interest rates, something they opened the door to in October’s meetingWage gains quickened to 4.4% on the year, a sign that tightness in the labor market is boosting pay.

137,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2019 08:16AM ET</span>",Wall Street Weekahead: Small-cap shares poised to benefit from shift to value,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Beleaguered shares of small U.S. companies are set for a bump in performance as value stocks have risen, market analysts say, but small caps could quickly fade again with an economic setback.
The small-cap Russell 2000 index (RUT) has lagged the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) for much of 2019 and has yet to escape the bear market it confirmed last December. 
Still, so far this quarter, the Russell 2000 has risen 4.6%, edging out the 3.6% rise in the S&P 500. The Russell's outperformance is in tandem with the S&P 500 Value index (IVX), whose 5.2% quarter-to-date climb has outpaced the S&P 500 Growth index's (IGX) 2.3% advance over the same period.
Improving economic sentiment has prompted some investors to take a second look at undeperformers among both value stocks and small-cap shares. Value shares tend to be concentrated in economically sensitive sectors such as financials and energy. Shares of small-cap companies, which tend to be more domestically focused than their large-cap counterparts, often track investors' outlook on the U.S. economy. 
Reflecting growing economic optimism, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) has moved well off its early September lows, and the yield curve between 3-month bills (US3MT=RR) and 10-year notes has steepened. As a result, some investors believe U.S. small-cap stocks are set to rally.
The performance of financial shares, in particular, has improved as yields have risen, which could help boost small-cap shares. Financials make up 20% of the Russell 2000, as compared to 13% of the S&P 500.
""Higher rates tell us that you've got a stronger economy,"" said Gary Bradshaw, senior vice president and portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. ""Small caps, which have lagged the large caps, can certainly catch up (given) this rotation into value.""
In recent months, Bradshaw said, Hodges has added positions in small-cap value companies such as oil and natural gas companies  Matador Resources Co  (N:MTDR) and  Parsley Energy  Inc (N:PE) as well as  Brinker International Inc  (N:EAT), which owns Chili's restaurants.
Though some market analysts are skeptical that large-cap value shares will sustain their market leadership, the improving earnings backdrop for small-cap companies could nonetheless boost their shares.
Earlier this year, the earnings growth rate for small-cap companies lagged that of large-cap companies, in an aberration from usual patterns, said Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York. But since then, small-cap earnings growth has recovered.
""People like small caps because they offer superior earnings growth longer-term,"" she said. ""You couldn't really say that based on these stats at the beginning of the year, but now we look at these stats and the normal relationship is returning.""
Still, the outlook for small-cap shares is highly dependent on U.S. economic data, which suggest a slowdown. The Institute of Supply Management's widely followed manufacturing index, for instance, has indicated a contraction in U.S. factory activity for three straight months. A U.S.-China trade agreement would help bolster economic indicators in the manufacturing and industrial sectors, but it remains tentative.
Data on October U.S. industrial production and retail sales, along with the National Federation of Independent Business's monthly small business survey, are scheduled for release next week.

""If we don't get a deal on trade, if we get more indications that the U.S. economy is weaker, small caps are going to get crushed,"" said Steven DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies in New York. ""But I see (economic) growth holding up.""

138,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2019 07:54AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Boon for Hong Kong as Alibaba plans $15 billion listing in late November - sources,"By Scott Murdoch and Jennifer Hughes
(Reuters) - Chinese retail titan  Alibaba  (N:BABA) plans to list in Hong Kong in the final week of November, two people with direct knowledge said, aiming to raise up to $15 billion in a deal that signals a vote of confidence in the Asian financial hub.
The public offering by the e-commerce specialist, whose primary listing is in the United States, would take place at a pivotal moment for Hong Kong's future as the city has been wracked by months of anti-government protests. 
It also comes at a time when there has been a thaw in relations between China and the United States, which have been locked in a trade war that has buffeted financial markets.
Alibaba's bookbuilding and listing is due to take place in the week beginning Nov. 25, said the sources, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The company is first due to seek approval from Hong Kong's listing committee next week, on Thursday, two separate sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. 
An Alibaba spokesman declined to comment on the timing of the share offering.
The transaction would be the world's biggest-ever cross-border secondary listing, according to Dealogic data. Alibaba currently holds the crown for the world's biggest initial public offering for its $25 billion 2014 float in New York.
Alibaba has not said what it plans to do with the proceeds of the secondary listing, in which it aims to raise between $10 billion and $15 billion. 
However the company is looking to expand its Chinese customer base beyond its core market in big cities to less developed areas to combat slowing retail sales growth. 
It also faces rising competition from nimbler rivals such as  Pinduoduo  (N:PDD) which have outsmarted the retail juggernaut in smaller cities with deep discounts and group-buying deals. 
ALIBABA & ARAMCO 
The Hong Kong listing presages a year-end rush for global equity markets, with the Saudi government planning to sell 2% of oil giant Aramco in a deal that could raise up to $30 billion and topple Alibaba's own IPO record.
If both deals succeed, they could provide a shot in the arm for moribund capital markets, where investors have proved increasingly sceptical of the valuations sought by much-hyped tech start-ups such as ride-hailing giant Uber (K:UBER), which has fallen by about a third since its float in May.
More recently, office-space sharing startup WeWork was forced to drop its IPO plans and seek a cash injection from investor SoftBank Group (T:9984) as its valuation collapsed to $8 billion from $47 billion.
Companies have sold shares worth $429 billion via IPOs and follow-on sales so far this year – far short of the $604 billion in the whole of 2018, according to data from Refinitiv. 
HK BOURSE RESURGENT
Alibaba had initially been working on an August listing in Hong Kong but put the deal on hold as anti-government protests left the city mired in financial and political uncertainty.
The return of this deal would cap a resurgent market in Hong Kong, where a series of big floats since September have helped the bourse operator, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (HKEX) (HK:0388), become serious competition once more to the American players. 
So far companies in Hong Kong have sold shares worth $22.3 billion via IPOs this year, compared with $24.5 billion on Nasdaq and $22.6 billion via the NYSE, according to Refinitiv data.
Alibaba's decision in 2013 to drop plans for a primary listing in Hong Kong, and turn instead to New York, triggered passionate debate among bankers and officials, and resulted in rule changes that paved the way for this deal. 
Now bankers and investors are watching closely to see whether other U.S.-listed Chinese companies such as Baidu (O:BIDU) and JD.com (O:JD) might follow Alibaba's lead. 
The listing could yet be delayed, however, if the protests worsen once more. The demonstrations are in their fifth month and are frequently violent. The death of a student on Friday who fell from a parking lot is expected to spark fresh protests and fuel anger at police.
$30 BILLION IN A DAY
Alibaba will next week appoint more banks to help sell its shares in Hong Kong, the sources said. 
The deal is currently being led by China International Capital Corp (CICC) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). Major investment banks led by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are currently jockeying for the most senior positions behind those two. 
The new timing means the company will have an opportunity to show prospective investors its most recent sales figures after Monday's Singles Day, mainland China's largest annual online shopping day.
Alibaba's sales last year reached $30 billion on the day, which was more than three times as large as Cyber Monday, the equivalent shopping day in the U.S.
Alibaba last week reported second-quarter revenue increased by 40%, to 119.02 billion yuan ($16.91 billion) in the second quarter from 85.15 billion yuan in the previous year earlier, beating analysts' expectations.

139,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2019 07:54AM ET</span>",The Permian paradox: Texas shale players go green to drill more,"By Arpan Varghese
HOUSTON/BENGALURU (Reuters) - As the thirst for electricity to power drilling rigs in West Texas drives the state's energy needs to new highs, oil and gas companies are increasingly relying on wind and solar power to ensure that the shale boom continues.
Oil and gas firms operating in the Permian shale basin in West Texas, the nation's biggest, have been largely behind growth in the area's energy demand, according to Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which oversees most of the state's electricity grid.
Securing ample, reliable energy supply is critical to sustaining the shale boom that has helped the United States eclipse Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world's biggest oil producer. 
Wind and solar farms help oil and gas producers lock in a growing part of that supply in a way that can be easily tailored to their needs as they keep ramping up production, industry experts say. 
""Gas generation gets cheap if you're building at a large scale. But if you're trying to build to match your refinery or E&P (exploration and production) operations, you'd want to build something relatively inexpensive at a smaller scale,"" says Manan Ahuja, manager at North America Power Analytics at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Platts. 
""You can add more panels or windmills at a later point if your exploration and production grows.""
Graphic: Energy sources vs West Texas demand, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7930/7861/TexasEnergy.png
Building their own on-field wind or solar farms is one way to safeguard electricity supply, long-term supply deals with renewable energy firms is another.
One recent example is Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY), a major player in the Permian, which announced early last month the launch of a solar-powered facility to power an oilfield operation there. 
A unit of Occidental also signed a long-term power purchase agreement with a joint venture between Macquarie's Green Investment Group (GIG) and Core Solar LLC for 109 MW of solar energy, beginning in 2021.
""Use of solar energy is expected to reduce the cost and carbon intensity of Occidental's operations,"" the company said in a statement. 
Oil major  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM), which aims to boost its Permian output to more than 1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by 2024, last year also signed a multi-year supply contract with Danish renewable firm Orsted (CO:ORSTED) 
Under that deal, Orsted would make available about 500 megawatts (MW) split evenly between wind and power to fuel Exxon's Permian operations, with its Texas wind farm due to come online early next year, and the solar project due in 2021. 
Typically, energy firms will mix natural gas and renewables.
Houston-based  Apache Corp  (N:APA), for example, uses solar, natural gas and diesel to power its operations in the Permian basin at locations where they're not connected to a power grid.
Together, wind and solar power this year have nearly overtaken coal as the state's second-biggest source of electricity behind natural gas, according to ERCOT. The council expects West Texas electricity demand to keep growing by around 10% per year over the next five years.
Graphic: Operating versus planned wind and solar power generation in Texas, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7931/7862/Texaspower.png
The phasing out of federal tax breaks for wind and solar projects due to begin next year offers additional incentive to ramp up renewable projects and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects nearly half of wind projects scheduled for this year to come online in December. 
Oil major Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), said it has started using solar energy to power parts of their Permian operations this year, and that while it welcomed the tax incentives they were unlikely to be a decisive factor behind the industry's push into renewable technologies.
""Whether more oil and gas companies decide to transition into renewables likely hinges more on overall corporate strategy than a single tax provision,"" Shell spokeswoman Anna Arata said.
Environment Texas, an advocacy group that has sued major oil companies over air pollution, lauds the use of renewables to reduce carbon emissions during oil and gas drilling, but Executive Director Luke Metzger says eliminating those fuels altogether remains its ultimate goal.

""It is certainly ironic that oil and gas companies would use renewable energy to pump out more fossil fuels.""

ZURICH (Reuters) - The world's richest people became a little less well off last year, according to a report by UBS (S:UBSG) and PwC, as geopolitical turmoil and volatile equity markets reduced the wealth of billionaires for the first time since 2015.
Billionaires' wealth fell by $388 billion globally to $8.539 trillion, the UBS/PwC Billionaires Report found, with a particularly sharp decline in Greater China - the second-biggest home for billionaires after the United States - and the Asia-Pacific region more broadly.
Private banks including the world's largest wealth manager UBS have felt the effects of U.S.-China trade tensions and global political uncertainties, as clients last year shied away from trading and taking on debt in favor of hoarding more cash.
The net worth of China's richest dropped 12.8% in dollar terms on the back of tumbling stock markets and a weaker local currency and as growth in the world's second-largest economy slowed to its lowest level in nearly three decades in 2018, the report found, knocking dozens off the billionaires list.
Despite the drop, China continues to produce a new billionaire every 2-2.5 days, UBS's head of ultra-high net worth clients, Josef Stadler, said in the report released on Friday.
Worldwide, the number of billionaires fell everywhere except in the Americas, where tech entrepreneurs continued to buoy the ranks of the United States' wealthiest.
""This report shows the resilience of the U.S. economy,"" where there were 749 billionaires at the end of 2018, said John Matthews, head of private wealth management and ultra-high net worth business for UBS in the United States.
While a stock market recovery from a steep drop in late 2018 has helped wealth managers increase their assets, the world's richest families remain concerned about global affairs from trade tensions and Brexit to populism and climate change and are continuing to keep more of their money in cash.
""It is likely that billionaire wealth will go up again this year,"" said Simon Smiles, UBS's chief investment officer for ultra-wealthy clients, adding it would likely be a more muted increase than the wider financial market rally might suggest.

PARIS/TURIN, Italy (Reuters) -  Peugeot  maker PSA Group (PA:PEUP) and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) would retain all of their car brands if their planned $50 billion merger goes ahead, the would-be chief executive of the combined group said on Friday.
PSA CEO Carlos Tavares, seen as the architect of PSA's turnaround and in line to take the operational helm in the Fiat tie-up, said in a TV interview that the companies complemented each other well geographically and in terms of technology and brands. 
FCA derives 66% of its revenue from North America compared with only 5.7% for PSA, Refinitiv Eikon data shows. Europe remains the main revenue driver for PSA. 
""There's no doubt it's a very good deal for both parties. It's a win-win,"" Tavares told France's BFM Business, in his first interview since the French and Italian companies announced plans to create the world's fourth-largest auto maker last week.
Fiat Chrysler (FCA) Chairman John Elkann, who would chair the combined group, said on Friday at an event in Turin that the 50-50 share merger would help the Italian carmaker ""seize great opportunities.""
The deal, which would help the firms pool resources to meet tough new emissions rules and investments in electric and self-driving vehicles, as well as counter a broader downturn in car markers, is still at an early stage. 
PSA and Fiat have said they aim to reach a binding outline in the coming weeks, but still face questions over potential job losses, as well as scrutiny over whether the transaction favors one party more than the other. 
Tavares said the brands that would come under the combined group's umbrella - PSA's five passenger car labels include Citroen and Vauxhall, while FCA has nine, including Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Jeep - were all likely to survive. 
""As of today, I don't see any need to scrap any of the brands if the deal came to pass. They all have their history and their strengths,"" Tavares said. 
Few carmakers have as large a portfolio, with German rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) counting 10 passenger brands, if newer Chinese ones such as electric vehicle label Sihao are included. 
JOB CUTS?
The merger will also require approval from anti-trust authorities.
Tavares said he did not expect the companies to have to make major concessions to meet competition rules, but added they were ready to do so, without giving details. 
One of thorniest aspects of the deal are the potential job losses at stake in a group with a combined workforce of around 400,000, with governments in Rome and Paris as well as unions poring over the implications.
Tavares reaffirmed that the firms could reach billions of euros in annual cost savings without closing factories. But he did not rule out job cuts when pressed, only stating: ""That's the car industry, it's not about PSA.""
""Margins are continually under pressure and you have to permanently be looking for productivity gains,"" he added, pointing to stricter regulations on everything from safety to pollution. 
Answering a question on the merger being already a done deal, Elkann said a long time could pass between the announcement of a merger and getting it over the line.
Tavares, meanwhile, said the companies remained prudent, adding he'd seen transactions scuppered when parties got into the details, but that talks toward a binding agreement were evolving favorably. 
""Given all the necessary regulatory approvals that need to be granted, such a deal cannot be closed in less than a year,"" Tavares added. 

FCA abandoned merger talks with PSA's French rival  Renault  (PA:RENA) less than five months ago. ($1 = 0.9051 euros)

Semiconductors have been a major flash point in the ongoing trade war between the two countries, with U.S. officials criticizing what they say are state-subsidised efforts to undermine the U.S. chip industry. 
In recent years China has invested billions of dollars in its semiconductor industry, including contributions to a high-end Tsinghua Unigroup memory chip plant said to be worth $24 billion. Link https://www.reuters.com/article/china-semiconductors-fund/china-invites-overseas-investors-to-propel-local-chip-ambitions-idUSL3N1S234U
Tsinghua Unigroup chairman Zhao Weiguo said at a conference in Beijing on Friday that U.S. firms should ""relax and sleep well"", urging them not to be threatened by China's semiconductor ambitions, and to play a greater role in easing tensions. 
""On the one hand, they're earning lots of money here in China, and on the other hand, they're making malicious remarks about China to the U.S. government behind the scenes.""

China and the U.S. recently agreed to roll back tariffs as part of a pending ""phase one"" trade deal. Chinese negotiators have previously sought relief from 25% tariffs on a group of goods that include semiconductors.

Chinese officials said on Thursday that both sides had agreed to reduce tariffs, which the U.S. confirmed later in the day. But a divide remains in the White House over whether or not a tariff rollback is even a good idea, Reuters reported. 
Meanwhile, outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he didn't expect the U.S. to impose import tariffs on cars from the EU. The White House has until Nov. 13 to decide whether it will proceed with the threat it made back in the summer.

Thomas Cook's UK business and airline went into immediate insolvency when the company collapsed in September, and a court appointed an official receiver to liquidate its assets. 
EasyJet acquired 12 of summer slot pairs and 8 winter slot pairs at Gatwick, plus six summer slot pairs and one winter slot pair at Bristol, in the deal. The airline added that contractual terms had been concluded.
The acquisition by easyJet marks the first sale in relation to Thomas Cook's airports slot portfolio. London Gatwick was one of Thomas Cook's main bases, along with Manchester airport.
Last month Hays Travel bought Thomas Cook's network of British travel agent shops, while China's Fosun, which had been the largest shareholder of the group, bought the Thomas Cook brand last week.
The collapse of Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel company stranded tens of thousands of passengers as its UK business immediately stopped trading. 
Its Nordic business was rescued last month, while its German airline Condor is still operating.

147,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 08, 2019 05:43AM ET</span>",China Car Sales Keep Falling as Peak Season Fails to Deliver,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s car-market gloom continued in October as the traditional post-holiday demand peak failed to materialize, leaving automakers with few easy answers to attract buyers back to showrooms.
Sales of sedans, sport utility vehicles, minivans and multipurpose vehicles dropped 6% from a year earlier to 1.87 million units, the China Passenger Car Association said Friday. The decline was the 16th in the past 17 months, with the only increase coming this June as dealers offered large discounts to clear inventory.
The period known as “Golden September, Silver October” is typically strong for carmakers as consumers like to make big-ticket purchases during the harvest season. Not this year though, underscoring the depth of the historic slump the car industry is mired in.
Demand in the world’s biggest car market has been hurt by a slowing economy that’s made consumers curb spending. Measures by the government to boost consumption have yet to help, leaving automakers’ profitability challenged and prompting industry insiders to predict mergers and market exits.
Global carmakers such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and Honda Motor Co. have weathered the slowdown better than some other international brands, which are sputtering along with cheaper local companies due to the cooling demand. Deliveries of local brands fell 12% in October, the PCA’s secretary general Cui Dongshu said Friday.
Chongqing Changan Automobile Co., a local partner of France’s PSA Group, said last month it plans to sell all of its shares in a 50-50 joint venture after the assembler sold fewer than 4,000 DS cars last year in the country.
China’s hundreds of aspiring electric-vehicle makers are also struggling to convince buyers that it’s worth paying higher prices than opting for cheaper gas guzzlers. Electric-car sales fell for three straight months through September, as the government -- after spending billions of yuan to nurture the industry -- scaled back subsidies. The PCA said Friday that deliveries of new energy vehicles to dealerships slid 45% to 66,000 units last month.
Warren Buffett-backed BYD Co., the country’s biggest maker of new energy vehicles -- all-electric, fuel-cell and plugin hybrid cars -- last month reported an 89% slump in third-quarter earnings and warned profit could fall as much as 43% this year. BAIC BluePark New Energy Technology Co., China’s biggest maker of all-electric automobiles, also forecast a 2019 loss in a grim earnings update.
China’s Vehicle Inventory Alert Index stood at 62.4% last month, the second-highest level this year, signaling dealers face rising operational pressure, according to the China Automobile Dealers Association. A reading above 50% indicates high inventory.
Amid the gloomy picture, the silver lining lies with makers of luxury cars and Japanese brand vehicle makers such as Honda, which had a 6.5% sales gain in China last month. Sales by Volvo Cars surged 27% in October to 11,083 units, according to the company. Industrywide sales of luxury brands rose 14% last month, according to the PCA.
Some analysts are also predicting a gradual stabilization in the Chinese market as year-on-year comparisons become easier."
148,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2019 05:42AM ET</span>",Italy's Di Maio says 5-Star doesn't want new legal shield for ArcelorMittal,"ROME (Reuters) - The head of Italy's ruling 5-Star Movement said on Friday his party did not agree that a legal shield for steel giant ArcelorMittal should be reinstated, warning his coalition allies not to try to force the issue.
ArcelorMittal said this week it was withdrawing from a deal to buy Italy's Ilva steel firm, blaming its decision on a government move to scrap previous guarantees of legal immunity during a massive clean-up operation at its Taranto plant. 
With thousands of jobs on the line, the announcement sent shockwaves through Italian politics and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said the immunity could be revived to save the accord.
However Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, who heads the 5-Star Movement, said there was no agreement within his party to restore the shield, which critics say deprives pollution-hit residents of Taranto of their rightful legal redress.
""It would be a serious problem for the government if anyone in the coalition presents an amendment (to restore immunity) with a deal beforehand,"" Di Maio said.
The coalition Italia Viva party of former prime minister Matteo Renzi has already presented such an amendment to parliament.
Conte said on Thursday that while the government was ready to restore the legal shield, he did not think this was the real problem for ArcelorMittal. 

He told reporters that the main sticking point was that ArcelorMittal no longer thought its industrial plan for the company was workable and wanted to shed 5,000 jobs at Ilva, almost half its Italian workforce, to meet its financial goals.

149,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 08, 2019 05:35AM ET</span>",Alibaba Seeks to Raise Up to $15 Billion in Hong Kong Share Sale,"(Bloomberg) --  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. plans a listing hearing early next week and is seeking to raise as much as $15 billion in a Hong Kong share sale, people familiar with the matter say, moving ahead with the city’s largest first-time stock offering since 2010.
Asia’s largest company by market value is now preparing for a hearing as mandated by companies that list on the Hong Kong bourse, the people said, requesting not to be named discussing a private matter. Alibaba declined to comment in an email.
Alibaba’s listing will be a triumph for a Hong Kong stock exchange that lost many of China’s brightest technology stars to U.S. rivals. The Chinese e-commerce giant had aimed to list as early as over the summer before pro-democracy protests rocked the financial hub, while trade tensions between Washington and Beijing clouded the market’s outlook. On Thursday, the U.S. and China agreed to roll back tariffs on each other’s goods in phases as they work toward a deal.
Billionaire Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma is moving closer to his dream of listing closer to home -- a move that curries favor with Beijing and hedges against trade war risks. A successful Hong Kong share sale could also help finance a costly war of subsidies with Meituan Dianping in food delivery and travel, and divert investor cash from rivals like Meituan and WeChat-operator Tencent Holdings Ltd.
It could put the capital to work investing in new technologies such as artificial intelligence or fast-expanding affiliates such as Ant Financial. Courting investors closer to home also serves as a buffer of sorts should U.S.-Chinese tensions worsen. Already, U.S. lawmakers such as Senator Marco Rubio are agitating for measures to curb investment flows to Chinese companies, including the extreme option of tossing U.S.-listed firms off American bourses.
Alibaba -- which had roughly $57 billion of cash and equivalents as of June -- rode a national e-commerce boom that stemmed from an increasingly affluent middle class. But like arch-foe Tencent, it’s struggling to sustain growth as the world’s No. 2 economy slows, and China clashes with the U.S. over everything from trade and technology to investment.
At home, signs of strain are growing. China’s gross domestic product growth is expected to slump below 6%, which would be the economy’s slowest pace of expansion in three decades. Still, Alibaba last week reported a 40% surge in quarterly revenue, underscoring the resilience of consumer spending. The company on Monday will wrap up its most important sales event of the year -- Singles’ Day -- offering further clues on the health of consumption.
Alibaba’s decision to proceed came as Hong Kong’s stock exchange reported its worst slide in profit in almost three years."

The recent rally in value shares over momentum is among the biggest since 2002, according to  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. A sustained move in that direction -- representing a radical change in a market cycle that has lasted more than a decade -- would be an ominous occurrence for markets even if only a mild economic downturn followed, according to Doug Ramsey, the chief investment officer at Leuthold Group LLC.
“Times of major leadership change coincide with major market inflection points far more often than chance alone,” he wrote in a research note dated Nov. 5. “If the rotation here accelerates, we’d be surprised if the market didn’t suffer at least a short-term setback.”
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). - which has been a skeptic of the rebound - has warned that some stocks may be value traps, notably among financials, analysts including chief global equity strategist Robert Buckland wrote in a research note dated Nov. 4. They don’t recommend chasing the rally in banks.
However, firms including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA are bullish on the factor. Some investors that have been on the wrong side of the trade are coming back to the table. And quant investing pioneer Clifford Asness, founder of AQR Capital Management, weighed in with a blog post Nov. 7.
“If you believe, as we do, that value is a good long-term strategy, and an important part (not all) of an investment process, we would recommend a modest extra amount of value than the norm,” Asness wrote, adding that the trade had been a money-loser for the company for the last two years. “To the skeptics we would ask ‘If not now, when?’”
But many fund managers remain unconvinced. Crowding means that many stocks traditionally associated with the trade don’t even look that cheap any more, according to Sunny Ng, a multi-asset portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments LLC in Hong Kong.
“We’re playing it much more sector-wise than style-wise,” he said. “What you’re getting in value is a mixed bag.”
A preference for stocks that are trading on lower multiples, far from being a sign of bullishness, may still reflect worry that equities will suffer in the event of a recession, according to Olivier D’Assier, head of applied research for Asia-Pacific at Qontigo GmbH in Singapore.
A sustained rebound for value “would require not only a recovery in investors’ preference for risk but also the development of a reflationary environment,” Masanari Takada, cross-asset strategist at Nomura, wrote in a note to clients on Friday. So far, he said, there are only signs of a gradual recovery.
And there’s another strike against value: Warren Buffett, the most famous value investor of all, is hanging back. The legendary stock-picker and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc has complained that he can’t find enough acquisition targets, even though the company said this month it’s sitting on $128 billion in cash -- a new record."
151,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 08, 2019 05:32AM ET</span>",Alibaba Spends $3.3 Billion to Raise Stake in Delivery Arm,"(Bloomberg) --   Alibaba   Group Holdings Ltd (NYSE:BABA) will spend $3.3 billion to raise its stake in Cainiao, in an effort to exert more control over the logistics subsidiary that underpins its sprawling e-commerce empire.
The Hangzhou-based company will lift its stake in Cainiao to 63% from 51% by subscribing for newly issued shares in its latest financing round and buying existing stock from another holder, the company said on Friday.
Six-year-old Cainiao is the rapidly growing business that sits at the heart of Alibaba’s expansion -- both in China and abroad. It oversees a coterie of at least a dozen shipping partners, orchestrating deliveries carried out by millions of people across the country.
The increased stake could help Alibaba expand deeper into the business of setting up and controlling its own infrastructure, much like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). Billionaire Jack Ma said in May last year that he wanted to invest 100 billion yuan ($14 billion) in logistics without giving a time frame.
Cainiao’s revenue, after elimination of inter-company transactions, rose 48% to 4.8 billion yuan in the quarter ended September.
The logistics giant is expanding at a rapid clip, keeping pace with its parent’s online retail business. It’s developed a neighborhood delivery service with a combination of stations and self-pickup lockers, known as Cainiao Posts, a key to bolstering last-mile delivery. The daily package volume handled by Cainiao Post doubled in September, compared with last year, according to Alibaba’s filings.
Cainiao’s Guoguo app, which offers crowd-sourced parcel pick-up and delivery services, had 100 million annual users at of the end of August. Its parcel volume more than doubled in the September quarter, compared with last year, according to its filing.
Alibaba created Cainiao with the department-store chain Intime Retail Group Co. and industrial conglomerate Fosun International Ltd. The trio led an initial investment of 100 billion yuan into the company to build out its logistics network.
The company has since managed a delicate relationship with its delivery partners, as players jostled for business and valuable user data. Alibaba’s facing increasing competition in delivery from Pinduoduo Inc., China’s No. 3 platform. Pinduduo is seeking to take control of its own data by developing in-house shipping information technology."
152,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 08, 2019 05:30AM ET</span>",Foreign Funds Balk at Crown Prince’s Valuation for Aramco IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman may have lowered his valuation-target for Saudi Aramco as it prepares an initial public offering, but some of the world’s biggest investors say he’s not gone far enough.
Money managers including AllianceBernstein and Frankfurt-based Union Investment Privatfonds believe the energy giant is worth less than the figure of about $1.7 trillion that the prince is now said to be willing to accept, down from $2 trillion initially.
They’re concerned the Saudi government -- which may sell only about 2% of Aramco -- won’t give enough say to minority shareholders. Regional geopolitical risks, which were underscored when the company’s facilities were struck by missiles and drones in September, are also weighing on investors’ calculations.
While the bulk of the money is expected to come from Saudi investors as well as China, a failure to attract foreign cash or a slump in Aramco’s share price when it starts trading in Riyadh on Dec. 11 could backfire on the 34-year-old prince. The IPO is a key part of his grand vision to open up the kingdom’s economy to foreign investment and reduce its reliance on oil.
“If Aramco decides to significantly lower its overambitious valuation expectations and float the company on investor-friendly terms, these will be considered a sign of strength and wisdom rather than weakness,” said Slava Breusov, a New York-based senior analyst with the emerging and frontier equities team at AllianceBernstein, which manages almost $600 billion. “A successful IPO is one that makes money for investors, not the one that commands the highest valuation.”
Aramco is worth “way below $1.5 trillion,” according to Breusov, who said an analyst from one of the banks arranging the share sale failed to persuade him otherwise at a meeting on Wednesday. “I don’t think enough discount is assigned to any potential misalignment of interests between minorities and the state.”
Oil accounted for more than 60% of the kingdom’s fiscal revenue in 2017. Saudi Arabia is the most important member of the OPEC cartel with Aramco pumping around 10% of the world’s crude. The IPO money will go to the Public Investment Fund -- the sovereign wealth fund spearheading the prince’s economic-diversification plans.
“In terms of scale and quality of Aramco’s assets, they’ve got the world’s best, bar none,” said Dwight Anderson, the founder of hedge fund Ospraie Management. “But the decisions that they make are optimized to achieve the country’s objectives, not yours as an individual shareholder.”
Mercurial Asset
Analysts’ estimates for the listing, which may be the largest ever, even at a lower valuation, span from $1.2 trillion to $2.3 trillion. Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., which isn’t involved in the IPO, said a fair number is between $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion, based on metrics such as dividends and earnings forecasts.
“If I had to buy such a mercurial asset, I would seek to buy at the low end: $1.2 trillion to $1.3 trillion,” said Marcus Chenevix, an analyst at TS Lombard, a research firm in London. “The most concerning thing about the company is that its overriding priority is not to provide shareholder value or corporate stability, but to fund the Saudi state.”
Aramco’s appeal would lie in its ability to regularly pay dividends, said Colin Croft, a London-based portfolio manager at Jupiter Asset Management. Even so, it’s worth closer to $1.2 trillion than $2.3 trillion, he said.
Ekaterina Iliouchenko, a money manager at Union Investment Privatfonds GmbH, said she’d want a dividend yield of around 6.5%. That would would mean a market capitalization of $1.2 trillion, based on Aramco’s original promise for an annual payout of $75 billion, she said, adding that some Russian energy stocks have 9% yields.
As part of Prince Mohammed’s concessions, he’s now considering boosting next year’s dividend to $80 billion, according to people briefed on the matter. But even that would not be enough to raise the valuation much beyond $1.2 trillion if investors insisted on a 6.5% dividend yield.

“I don’t have any concerns at all about Aramco -- I’m an emerging-market investor,” said Iliouchenko, who oversees a fund covering Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “It’s just the valuation.”"

The flagship Hong Kong airline has taken a financial battering from a fall in demand due to months of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests in the Asian financial capital, and last month lowered its full-year profit guidance.
Cathay plans to maintain its A321neo delivery schedule, with the first of the planes being delivered next year.
Regional arm Cathay Dragon, which had initially been poised to receive all 32 A321neos, will get 16 between 2020 and 2022, Cathay said in a statement, adding the following 16 will go to HK Express from 2022 onward.
Cathay in July completed the purchase of HK Express from cash-strapped Chinese conglomerate HNA Group , giving the premium carrier its first foothold in a rapidly growing budget travel market in Asia.
Rivals Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) and Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) have long had budget arms to help defend market share against low-cost carriers like AirAsia Group Bhd (KL:AIRA).
Cathay is also continuing to take new widebody planes at its parent airline, despite the current drop in passenger demand from protests. It reaffirmed it would receive 12 A350s and 21 777-9s by 2024.
""We will continue to invest in each of our airlines, their products and services,"" Cathay Chief Executive Augustus Tang said in the statement on Friday."
154,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 08, 2019 05:16AM ET</span>",StockBeat: IAG's Hardly-Bearish Profit Warning,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Shares in International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:ICAG), which includes British Airways, Vueling, Iberia and Aer Lingus among its brands, should arguably be down this morning by more than they in fact are.
Ahead of an investor day Friday, the company cut its forecasts for per share earnings not just next year, but the two years after that as well, reflecting expectations that the group just won’t be expanding as quickly as it had thought. It had expected growth of 12% or more on average. Now it only expects 10%.
Whereas it had previously expected to be offering an average of 6% more in seat-kilometers every year between 2019 and 2023, it now expects only 3.4% average annual growth. Those figures don’t include any contribution from Air Europa, the Spanish-based airline it agreed to buy for 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) at the start of this week.
But the 1.5% drop in the share price – barely underperforming a FTSE 100 that was suffering from a trade-related reality check along with other European markets Friday morning – suggests investors aren’t panicking. And with reason.
Having fewer seats to fill is what airline investors have been praying for over the last year, as the trade war between the U.S. and China has hobbled European growth and left airlines furiously discounting to fill the planes that they ordered before the trade war erupted.
Tellingly, IAG (LON:ICAG) made no changes to its target for return on invested capital (155) and its operating margins (12%-15%).
Nor has the rest of the sector taken the news badly, in contrast to some of the dire warnings that have punctuated this year. Concerns about overcapacity have eased in recent weeks after both Thomas Cook and French-based Aigle Azur went into liquidation, while Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) CEO Carsten Spohr quickly damped down speculation this week that he wanted to prop up an Alitalia that still has far too many planes and staff to be sustainably profitable.
True, much of an overoptimistic capacity expansion is being held back due to external circumstances: Ryanair (LON:RYA) warned last week that it doesn’t expect its full quota of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX planes to be operating until well into next year due to the delay in regulatory approval for them to start flying again.
But the sector has clearly turned a corner. Almost all of the year-to-date gains in EasyJet and Ryanair shares have come in the last month; the only two major names not to rise more than 10% in that time frame have been Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ), which was already up 30% year-to-date by October, and Air France KLM (PA:AIRF), where the plans of new CEO Ben Smith disappointed some (IAG’s margin target of 12%-15% is well ahead of Smith’s 7%-8% range).
Elsewhere, as noted, it was a downbeat end to a largely positive week with almost all European bourses in the red except Sweden’s by 5 AM ET (1100 GMT). The Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.2% at 405.36 but was still on course for a weekly gain of 1.5%. Germany’s DAX, down 0.2%, was up more than 2.3% for the week while the Dutch AEX and Italian FTSE MIB were up 2.7% and 2.1% for the week, respectively."

LONDON (Reuters) - Uncertainty about the fate of the trade negotiations between the United States and China kept markets on their toes on Friday, with European stocks benchmarks mimicking their Asian peers and retreating from the previous session's highs. 
Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow and S&P 500 reached record closing highs on hopes of a truce to end the damaging tariff war but a Reuters report that the White House opposed aspects of a tentative deal limited the day's gains.
The pan-European STOXX 600 opened down 0.4% at 405 points, 10 ticks from its April 2015 record of 415. S&P 500 futures retreated 0.1% after the New York benchmark hit its highest closing level ever on Thursday.
""The trade deal is the predominant driver"", for markets at the moment said Lars Kreckel, global equity strategist at Legal & General Investment Management, noting that this morning dip in market was a just knee-jerk reaction to the latest news on the U.S.-China front. 
The mood contrasts with Thursday's surge of optimism in global markets on news Beijing and Washington had agreed to roll back tariffs as part of a first phase of a trade deal. 
Worries the pact could fall apart are now prompting some investors to sell heading into the weekend.
Chris Jeffery, head of rates and inflation at the British financial service group said the ""background music"" to the trade row, a Federal reserve easing monetary policy and macroeconomic indicators stabilising had helped the recent rally.
Germany's DAX, a gauge of investors' sentiment on trade, moved in synchronicity with the rest of the market and eased 0.4%.
German exports posted their biggest rise in almost two years in September, data showed on Friday, providing some relief amid widespread concern that Europe's largest economy will dip into recession in the third quarter.

159,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2019 03:35AM ET</span>",GE unit orders 25 Airbus jets including 12 Rolls-powered A330neo: sources,"PARIS (Reuters) - Leasing giant GECAS, the aircraft leasing subsidiary of  General Electric  (N:GE), has ordered 25 Airbus (PA:AIR) aircraft including a rare purchase of jets powered by GE's rival engine maker Rolls-Royce, two people familiar with the matter said.
The order includes 12 Airbus A330neo jets, for which Rolls-Royce (L:RR) is the sole engine supplier, and 13 A321XLR long-distance narrow-body jets. It was included in a new Airbus order tally but the name of the buyer was not immediately disclosed.
Airbus and GE both declined to comment.
If confirmed, the decision by the world's second largest aircraft leasing company to invest in the A330neo would be a key endorsement for the A330neo programme which has been clawing its way back from a period of weak sales and some cancellations.
GECAS has traditionally prioritised aircraft powered by engines made by its parent company General Electric. 
Decisions to invest in rival technology highlight competition to diversify portfolios in the leasing industry, even though GE is perceived as more closely aligned in the wide-body market with Airbus rival Boeing (N:BA).
The A330neo is a 250-300 seat upgrade of Airbus's most-sold wide-body aircraft, the A330, which is offered alongside the slightly larger Airbus A350 family. Both aircraft are exclusively powered by engines from Rolls-Royce.
In 2015, GECAS invested in the first A350 by buying the aircraft immediately after its delivery to Qatar Airways and then renting it back to the airline in a sale-and-leaseback deal.
But it remains rare for the GE subsidiary to buy Rolls-Royce-powered aircraft directly from the manufacturer.
Rolls and GE compete fiercely for engine sales and the A330neo airplane has in turn faced intense competition from the newer Boeing 787, which offers both GE and Rolls-Royce engines.
GECAS is widely seen as a candidate for potential sale as GE overhauls its balance sheet through disposals. It has said it aims to invest in aircraft to keep down the average age of its portfolio to 5.5 years from 6.8 years by 2024.
In a statement with its monthly order update on Thursday, Airbus said an ""unidentified customer ordered 13 A321XLRs in a transaction that also included 12 A330-900 highly efficient wide-bodies"".
It is common for aircraft deals to be posted on an anonymous basis before the buyer goes public, often using the publicity surrounding air shows.

Planemakers are gearing up for the Dubai Airshow from Nov. 17 which could feature confirmation of demand from leasing companies including GECAS, industry sources said.

161,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2019 03:16AM ET</span>","With discounts galore and Taylor Swift, Alibaba eyes another record Singles' Day","By Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI (Reuters) -  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA) will kick off its annual 24-hour shopping extravaganza on Monday with deals and deep discounts galore, and a performance by American popstar Taylor Swift to top it all, as it pushes to rake in another record Singles' Day sales.
This year's Nov. 11 bash comes as the $486 billion Chinese retail juggernaut navigates through a major turning point, the resignation in September of its flamboyant co-founder Jack Ma as chairman, and looks to raise up to $15 billion via a share sale in Hong Kong as early as this month.
Akin to Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the United States, Singles' Day, a shopping fest originally promoted by Alibaba Chairman and CEO Daniel Zhang in 2009, has since grown rapidly to become the world's biggest online sales event.
Alibaba saw sales worth $30 billion on its platforms on Singles' Day last year, dwarfing $7.9 billion U.S. online sales for Cyber Monday. Yet, the 27% sales growth was the lowest in the event's 10-year history, spurring a search for fresh ideas. 
""This year will be the 11th 11.11 festival, with more than 200,000 brands participating, one million new products on offer and over 500 million users are expected to participate – about 100 million more than last year,"" Alibaba said in a statement. 
Taylor Swift, whose latest album ""Lover"" has broken records in China, will headline this year's opening gala alongside local celebrities like Jackson Yee. Swift also performed at Prime Day concert for rival Amazon.com (O:AMZN) earlier this year.
Alibaba's Singles' Day celebrations have featured U.S. singer Mariah Carey and musician Pharrell Williams (NYSE:WMB) in the past.
Livestreamers are also set to play a prominent role in product promotions this year, as Alibaba increasingly turns to online video influencers to increase engagement on its app.
It has partnered with Kuaishou and Douyin, two popular Chinese video apps, to help it broadcast product promotions, and in the run-up to the show even roped in U.S. celebrity entrepreneur Kim Kardashian, who launched a Tmall stream to promote her KKW line of beauty products.
For a graphic on Alibaba's Singles' Day, see https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/SINGLES-DAY-ALIBABA/0H001BHN331S/eikon.png
INTENSE COMPETITION
Its heavy marketing campaign underscores intensifying competition with smaller rivals such as  Pinduoduo  (N:PDD) which have outsmarted Alibaba in second- and third-tier cities with deep discounts and group-buying deals.
Alibaba has been trying to expand its customer base beyond its core first- and second-tier city shoppers to less developed areas to combat slowing retail sales growth, describing it as a key strategy for the firm this year. 
Pinduoduo will be also holding its own ""Singles' Day"" events on the same day. 
The e-commerce upstart has signaled its intentions to break Alibaba and rival JD.com's (O:JD) stronghold on wealthy Chinese shoppers, saying that half of the app's users now hail from first- and second-tier cities.
Alibaba also faces challenges of a regulatory crackdown and a slowing economy, hurt by U.S.-China trade tensions. 

Ahead of the Nov. 11 event, China warned Alibaba and JD.com (O:JD) to stop practices that could be deemed as monopolistic, state media reported earlier this month.

162,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2019 02:55AM ET</span>",China reshapes global meat markets as swine fever rages,"By Nigel Hunt
LONDON/BEIJING (Reuters) - China is scouring the world for meat to replace the millions of pigs killed by African swine fever (ASF), boosting prices, business and profits for European and South American meatpackers as it re-shapes global markets for pork, beef and chicken.
The European Union, the world's second largest pork producer after China, has ramped up sales to the Asian giant although it can only fill part of the shortfall caused by ASF. Argentina and Brazil have approved new export plants to meet demand and are selling beef and chickens, as well as pork, to fill the gap. U.S. producers, however, have been hampered due to tariffs imposed by Beijing.
Other Asian countries are also ready to step up imports as they, too, deal with outbreaks of ASF. Vietnam, the Philippines, North and South Korea, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia are all struggling to contain outbreaks of the disease, which is deadly to pigs although not harmful to humans.
""It is very good news for those involved in processing and have licenses for exports to China,"" said Justin Sherrard, global strategist, animal protein at Rabobank.
Major EU pork processors include Danish Crown, Tonnies Group and Vion Food Group although the market is fragmented with many small- and medium-size players.
Shortages in the world's top pork consumer have been exacerbated by the upcoming Lunar New Year celebrations in late January, when pork, and pork dumplings in particular, play a central role in the food on offer.
One of the biggest European players Danish Crown said there had been a very clear jump in demand from China in the run-up to the Lunar New Year and it was bullish on the outlook for 2020.
China's state-owned agriculture conglomerate COFCO said this week it had agreed to buy $100 million of pork from Danish Crown in 2020 to help ease the domestic shortage.
NEW PLANTS APPROVED IN SOUTH AMERICA
Rabobank estimates that China's hog herd, the world's largest, fell by half in the first eight months of 2019 and will likely shrink by 55 percent by the end of the year.
Many more meat plants in Argentina and Brazil have recently been approved to export to China including beef and chicken as well as pork.
Nicholas Lafontaine, a cattle rancher from the town of Azul, 300 kilometers (186 miles) southwest of Buenos Aires, said China had traditionally taken cheap cuts with premium steaks destined for the EU.
China is now taking the whole carcass, reducing the amount of meat sold on the local market for Argentina peso, a currency which has lost around a third of its value this year.
As processing margins have improved, plants have reopened.
""The other benefit that comes from growing Chinese demand is the reopening of beef plants, he said, adding that when a factory opens its doors it is thinking about China.
Neighboring Brazil has also benefited. 
According to Brazilian meat trade groups, in one go Beijing authorized Brazil to more than double the number of beef plants with permits to sell directly to mainland China -- to 33.
Brazil exported 1.64 million tonnes of beef in 2018 with China buying 19.3% of the volume, trailing only Hong Kong. The South American country's exports have been forecast to rise to 1.8 million tonnes this year.
""China is the market paying the highest premiums for Brazilian meatpackers,"" Luciano Pascon, chief executive of privately-owned meatpacker Frigol, told Reuters in an interview.
TRADE WAR HITS U.S. PRODUCERS
Hefty tariffs on American pork imposed by China as part of the ongoing trade conflict are likely to mean that the U.S. industry will benefit less than its rivals.
U.S.-based meat packers such as Smithfield Foods have, however, been able to secure some direct sales.  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) expects to benefit from African swine fever by increasing sales to China or other countries as the outbreak redirects global meat trading.
Tyson Foods share price has risen about 50 percent so far this year.
Trent Thiele, a farmer who raises about 60,000 hogs a year in Elma, Iowa, said, however, the trade war is hurting American hog producers. Thiele said he would prefer selling U.S. pork to Chinese buyers than picking up residual business elsewhere in the world because China is a main buyer of products such as pigs' feet and organ meat that other countries have little appetite for. ""A lot of our other competitor countries are obtaining the market share that naturally would have been ours if we didn't have the retaliatory tariffs,"" said Thiele, president of the Iowa Pork Producers Association.
ASTRONOMICAL
Imported pork ribs currently cost around 40,000 yuan ($5,680) per tonne, compared with 17,600 yuan in spring 2019, traders said, while prices for other cuts such as pig front leg and rib meat have roughly doubled in that period.
""Right now, prices are astronomical, and the risk is very high,"" said a Beijing-based beef importer, who was struggling to gauge the right volumes to meet demand and avoid being left with expensive stock at the end of the holiday period.
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's Meat Price Index is up 12.5% so far this year and is at the highest level since January 2015.
The pork component has risen by more than 20%. 
Graphic: Global meat prices climb sharply, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/GLOBAL-MEAT-ASF/0H001QXH499F/eikon.png
The high global pork prices are even sparking interest in pig farming in predominately Muslim Kazahkstan.
""Not a week goes by without someone visiting us who wants to get into pig farming,"" said Maksut Baktibayev, chairman of Kazakhstan's Meat Union, an industry lobby group.

IAG said available seat kilometers, a measure of passenger carrying capacity, was estimated to grow 3.4% a year between 2020 and 2022, compared to a previous forecast of 6% growth a year for the 2019-2023 period.
The airline group, which also owns Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, lowered its forecast for growth in earnings per share (EPS) to 10%+ a year from a previous forecast of 12%+ a year, due to the lower planned capacity growth.
Chief Executive Willie Walsh said last week that he expected global macroeconomic softness to continue in 2020. The company has also taken a hit from industrial action at British Airways, which has knocked its outlook for profits this year.
IAG said that the forecasts for capacity growth numbers were not adjusted for the impact of the pilot strikes. After 48 hours of action in September, no further industrial action is currently scheduled although the dispute over pay remains unresolved.
Walsh and other members of IAG's management will update investors on its strategy plans at a capital markets day later on Friday.
The strategic update comes after IAG said on Monday it would buy Spain's Air Europa to boost its presence on routes to Latin America and the Caribbean.
IAG said it expected the deal, which will be funded through external debt, to close in the second half of next year and for it to add to its earnings in the first full year after the closure.

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Trade wars and softer growth are unlikely to dissuade global investors from diving into the world's second-largest economy as they seek better returns, participants in the Reuters Global Investment Outlook 2020 Summit said this week.
Although economic growth in China has slowed to its weakest pace in nearly 30 years, and recent bond market ructions have pointed to uncertainty over the outlook for policy easing, the country still promises opportunity in a world of negative interest rates.
""China is one of the few places investors can generate decent returns,"" said Richard Pan, the head of international business at China Asset Management Co (ChinaAMC).
Richard Bernstein, chief executive of Richard Bernstein Advisors LLC and a former Merrill Lynch & Co chief investment strategist, agreed, noting that China's slowdown is belied by ""accelerating leading indicators.""
""Because of what's happening in trade, the Chinese government has injected massive amounts of monetary and fiscal stimulus into the economy. To say it's not going to work is amazingly bearish,"" he said.
""We are very overweight Chinese equities,"" he added. ""Chinese equities are about 3% of the global benchmark, and we're at about 12%.""
Global index provider MSCI said on Thursday that mainland Chinese stocks, or A shares, would rise to a weight of 4.1% in the MSCI Emerging Market Index, up from 2.55% currently.
Mark Konyn, chief investment officer at AIA, said he didn't expect Chinese equities to match this year's gains in 2020, but ""it will be a reasonable year.""
The blue-chip CSI300 index (CSI300) has gained around 31% in 2019, making it the world's best-performing major index.
Konyn said that he expects that the trade war between Beijing and Washington, which began early last year, will have little long-term effect on China's commitment to opening its markets to more foreign investment.
""If you take a step back and say 'has the commitment to financial liberalization been impacted by the trade dispute?', I think the conclusion is 'no, that commitment is still very much in place,'"" he said.
King Au, president of Hong Kong-listed asset manager  Value Partners  Group Ltd (HK:0806), said his firm is expecting a sustained rally in Chinese stocks in 2020, calling the country's equities ""under-owned (and) under-researched.""
""For institutional investors, especially those long-term sophisticated investors, they definitely realize that they need to increase their China exposure from 'nice to have' to 'have to have,'"" Au said.
Au said that structural reforms and liquidity are driving momentum in China's equity market. Although he sees opportunities across A-shares, Au highlighted technology, healthcare, education and shares benefiting from consumption upgrades.
ChinaAMC's Pan also sees opportunities for investment in the high-end consumer market despite negative external factors. ""We don't see any material impact on Chinese consumption power from the trade war,"" he said.
Technology investment pioneer Glenn Hutchins, who co-founded private equity firm Silver Lake Partners in 1999 and now works through North Island, a family office, said he is betting on high growth outside the United States in 2020, especially in emerging technology companies in China.
Silver Lake invested in  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) in 2011, and Hutchins said he is still an investor.
""There's a huge growing market and a big addressable market by technology companies (in China),"" he said.
But Hutchins says that although Chinese Internet stocks are ""cheap,"" he does not invest in them. And ChinaAMC's Pan said that Chinese technology stocks remain vulnerable to U.S. sanctions.
Retail investors in China burned by previous market crashes and looking to move money out of stagnant real estate and low-yielding wealth-management products are increasingly turning to passive instruments, said David Xu, head of indexing and quantitative investment at Hua An Fund Management Co.
Xu, who says China's index-tracking mutual funds have the potential to jump tenfold in the next decade, said a rise in passive investing has driven a boom in ETFs as asset managers rush to launch new funds."

International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:ICAG), the parent of British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus, said it’s cutting its medium-term target for earnings per share growth to at least 10% from at least 12% previously.
That reflects a reduced forecast for capacity growth: the group now sees available seat-kilometers rising only 3.4% a year through 2023 from a previous estimate of 6%.
It’s also changing the way it reports capital expenditure, stripping out any proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. As such, the new, ‘gross’ annual capex requirement is seen at an average of 4.7 billion euros ($5.2 billion), whereas the old ‘net’ capex spend had been estimated at 2.6 billion euros.
The estimate for levered free cash flow remained the same at 2.1 billion euros a year, while leverage is still to be contained at or below 1.8 times EBITDA.

IAG's passenger traffic growth slowed in October to 3.4%

Pharma group AstraZeneca (LON:AZN) reported successful Phase III trials for its roxadustat drug, used to treat anemia in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease.
It said it expects to make a regulatory submission for the drug to be approved in the U.S. by year-end.

Games Workshop (LON:GAW) said that trading through the start of November had continued well, and that it expects sales for the six months through Dec. 1 to be over 140 million pounds, while profit before tax will be more than 55 million.
It cited a significant increase in royalty income, driven by the timing of guarantee income on signing new licences.
Annuities specialist Phoenix Group (LON:PHNX) said Chief Executive Clive Bannister is to retire on March 10, 2020. He’ll be succeeded by Andy Briggs, who is joining on Jan. 1.
Briggs was formerly CEO of Friends Life, Managing Director of Scottish Widows, CEO of the retirement income division at   Prudential   (LON:PRU) and chairman of the Association of British Insurers.

  Royal Mail   (LON:RMG) said it's seeking an injunction to stop a planned strike by the Communication Workers Union, alleging orchestrated breaches of the law on postal ballots. 
The company said it believes senior CWU officials, have been sabotaging the ballot to secure approval for strike action. 
Lloyds (LON:LLOY) insurer Beazley (LON:BEZG) raised its combined ratio forecast for the year on Friday and set aside $80 million to cover claims, from hurricane Dorian and two typhoons. 
Beazley said it expects its full-year combined ratio to be between 100% and 102%, indicating that it expects a slight loss. 
At the same time, it said its gross premiums rose 12% in the first nine months of the year, while its investment return year-to-date was 5.3%, thanks to a strong performance by global bonds.

Six companies began trading Friday with mixed results as investor demand shows cooling signs after a frenzied October.
Shanghai Kindly Medical Instruments Co., which sells devices such as catheters, raised $106 million in the most popular sale among the six initial public offerings: Individual investors placed orders for 268 times the shares initially available to them and the stock on Friday jumped as much as 44% from its offer price. Oncology drugmaker TOT Biopharm International Co. was the second-biggest deal -- $75 million -- with its retail book covered by 13 times. However it is the worst performer of the lot, down 6.7% from its offer price.
Here’s the full list of Friday’s debutantes:
The Hong Kong stock market has been one of Asia’s hottest in recent weeks, defying months of increasingly violent anti-government protests that have pulled the economy into recession. But moms and pops are betting less money on new shares this month. The six newly listed companies pulled off an average retail subscription ratio of 56 times, down from 139 times for October listings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Wild rallies have dwindled as companies vie to sell new shares. The three November debutantes before Friday brought an average first-day gain of 7%, compared with an 18% rally for October listings, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Friday’s cohort was up by an average 13.2%, although half of them have dropped below their IPO prices.
Singaporean company Beng Soon Machinery Holdings Ltd. had the wildest swing, rising by 36% before falling again to trade 1% below its offer price.
Hong Kong IPOs have raised $21 billion since January, down 36% from the same period last year. A possible share sale by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. may add about $10 billion to the tally.

The broker estimates a total of 2.52% of all founders’ shares are pledged as collateral, accounting for about 1.24% of the S&P BSE 500 Index’s total market capitalization.
Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd and Yes Bank Ltd were among companies whose founders made the biggest increases in share pledges, said analysts led by Sanjeev Prasad.
Last year’s shock default at shadow lender IL&FS group has reverberated across the Indian economy. The ongoing credit crisis has choked economic growth to its slowest pace in six years, while company defaults on bonds are at a record.
Founders with repayment obligations are pledging more because “lenders have held back from giving loans due to the ongoing credit crisis and slowing growth,” said Deven Choksey, managing director of Mumbai-based wealth manager and brokerage K.R. Choksey Shares and Securities Pvt.
A request by India’s market regulator in August for additional disclosure on pledged stock may also have contributed to an increase in reporting. Last month, the regulator and the nation’s stock exchanges decided to levy a minimum margin of 35% on stocks with high founder pledge ratios, among other criteria. The number of these so-called encumbered shares may rise further by year-end, Choksey said.
The S&P BSE Sensex Index closed at another new high Thursday, and volatility remains around 15% after spiking over 25% earlier this year. Still, the threat that stocks may be sold to cover a personal or corporate debt can shake investor confidence.
“Volatility can increase in stocks, especially those with high debt, as bringing additional capital into businesses is not easy anymore,” Choksey said."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Trial production has started at Volkswagen AG's (VW) (DE:VOWG_p) and SAIC Motor Corp Ltd's (SS:600104) $2.5 billion electric vehicle (EV) factory in Shanghai, VW's chief executive said on Friday, the latest development in the race to sell EVs in China.
""The move goes in line with Volkswagen's (electric) e-mobility initiative,"" Herbert Diess told reporters during a tour of the factory.
The announcement comes two weeks after U.S. EV maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) also said it had started trial production at its factory in China, where it aims to produce 500,000 cars a year when construction is completed.
Established automakers and startups alike are aggressively targeting China, the world's largest new energy vehicle (NEV) market, where NEV sales jumped 61.7% to 1.3 million vehicles in 2018.
Volkswagen is trying to leapfrog peers by readying two Chinese EV factories by next year, Reuters reported last month.
Volkswagen's ID series EVs will be the first to roll off the Shanghai production line, the German automaker said in a statement. The plant will also produce other models such as from VW's premium  Audi AG  (DE:NSUG) brand, the joint-venture partners said.

Diess also said Volkswagen plans to make 22 million electric vehicles by 2028, half of them in China. In July, Diess said that by 2035, half of Volkswagen's annual sales in China will be NEVs.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Fidelity International sees further gains in Japanese stocks next year and has started to invest in some value shares selectively, such as some automakers, the asset manager's Tokyo-based investment chief Takashi Maruyama told Reuters.
There some early signs of bottoming out in the manufacturing sector's corporate earnings although he is a little wary about further upside in some chip-related shares, Maruyama, head of equities at Fidelity International (FIL) Japan, said late on Thursday at a Reuters Global Investment Outlook 2020 Summit.
He said many manufacturers had cut their full-year profit forecasts, but year-on-year falls in profits are slowing and leading investors to think the worst period could be behind them.
""Over the past weeks, we have noticed some early signs that suggest corporate earnings won't get any worse, initially in semiconductor-related companies, then electronic parts makers and most recently, in factory automation-related firms.""
Maruyama cited Misumi Group (T:9962), one of the fund manager's top picks for years, as an example. The Japanese factory automation equipment maker slashed its profit estimates for the business year to March.
But Misumi stocks jumped nearly 10% in less than two weeks since the earnings announcement, because investors have focused on the fact that year-on-year decline in earnings stopped worsening in October-March.
Some shares, notably semiconductor-related firms, have already rallied substantially to such an extent, however, that Fidelity could rotate out of those expensive shares, Maruyama added, although he did not name the companies he recently sold and may reduce.
The big question for 2020, Maruyama added, is whether the global economic recovery will become strong enough to prompt investors to snatch up value shares - namely financials and car makers - which have long been shunned by many investors. Value stocks are those that trade relatively cheaply versus their fundamentals.
""We have already started buying some of the value stocks selectively. No financial names yet but some auto stocks,"" the head of Japanese equities unveiled, adding that buying into value companies remains a divisive subject in his investment team.
""In order to get a sustained rally in long-lagging financial stocks, fiscal stimulus will be needed in addition to some stability in global growth, with the 10-year Treasury note yield moving back above 2%.""
The U.S. 10-year yield had hovered below the 2% mark since early August and stood at 1.8% (US10YT=RR) in late Asian trade on Thursday.
Fidelity International has become overweight on Japanese stocks this month on an anticipated pick-up in corporate earnings and relatively inexpensive valuations compared with international peers.
Maruyama expects the benchmark Nikkei's (N225) core range for 2020 to be 21,500 to 24,500 and the index could rise as high as 25,000. The Nikkei closed at 23,330, its highest in 13 months, on Thursday.
""When the Nikkei nears 25,000, we will take it as an opportunity to take profits. We don't expect the market will rise continuously.""
Maruyama manages the asset manager's 1.56 trillion yen ($14.3 billion) Japan equity portfolios as of end-September.

The discovery could make it more likely the FAA will require airline operators to inspect 737 NGs with fewer than 22,600 cycles, which had not been mandated previously. Each cycle typically represents one flight, with a takeoff and a landing.
The cracks are on what is known as the ""pickle fork,"" a part that attaches the plane's fuselage, or body, to the wing structure.
An FAA spokesman said the agency had asked operators to report any cracks so it could assess whether it needed to change its inspection orders.
The Lion Air jets with cracks had fewer than 22,000 cycles and are now grounded for repairs, a spokesman for the airline said.
Lion Air performed the checks even though they were not yet required to ""ensure security and safety of the flights,"" he said.
One of the airline's newer 737 MAX jets last year crashed shortly after takeoff from Jakarta, killing all 189 people on board and leading to heightened scrutiny on the carrier's maintenance operations by Indonesia's safety regulator.
Indonesia's Director General of Civil Aviation Polana Pramesti said on Friday there were no plans for the country's aviation regulator to expand the inspections beyond the FAA directive. 
The FAA requires immediate checks of aircraft with more than 33,000 cycles and inspections within the next 1,000 cycles for those with more than 22,600 cycles.
Boeing did not respond to an immediate request for comment. The manufacturer last week said that just over 1,000 planes globally had met the threshold for inspections to date, and of those fewer than 5% had issues.
Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), Brazil's Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (SA:GOLL4), Australia's Qantas Airways and  Korean Air Lines Co  Ltd (KS:003490) are among the airlines that have grounded planes after discovering cracks.

Sino-U.S. trade news were in focus again after China said that both sides have agreed to cancel some existing tariffs on each others’ goods.
 
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component both gained 0.4% by 10:39 PM ET (02:39 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 0.4%.
 
Gao Feng, a spokesperson for China’s Commerce Ministry, said at a weekly briefing in Chinese that the U.S. and China have “agreed to remove the additional duties imposed on each other’s products in different phases after they make progress in reaching a deal.”
 
“Both sides should simultaneously undo existing additional tariffs in the same proportion to reach phase one deal, and that is an important condition for signing a preliminary agreement,” he said, adding that the two sides are still negotiating on how much of the tariffs should be removed.
 
White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham echoed with Gao’s comments and said that the Trump administration is “very optimistic” the two sides “will reach a deal soon.”
 
Meanwhile, China’s exports and imports were better than expected in October, data showed on Friday in morning.
 
In dollar terms, exports fell 0.9% during the month from a year earlier, less than the expected 3.9%. Imports were down 6.4%, also less than the forecast of 8.9%.
 
Trade balance came in at $42.81 billion.
 
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was near flat. Index heavyweight Softbank Group Corp. (T:9984) rebounded 3.5% after plunging yesterday amid weak quarterly earnings report.
 
South Korea’s KOSPI traded 0.2% lower.
Down under, Australia’s ASX slipped 0.1%.

174,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 10:36PM ET</span>","With trade war as a backdrop, U.S. companies walk a line at China expo","By John Ruwitch and Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - At trade shows in the United States, California-based Champion Power Equipment displays the faces of the tough-looking sportsmen that it sponsors against the backdrop of an American flag.
At an import expo in China this week, the images of a pro bass fisherman, lumberjack, bull rider and NASCAR and off-road drivers were there - but the flag was not.
""Even though we're proud to showcase we're a U.S. company, there are some things we've just tried to ... tame it down a little bit,"" said Greg Pauken, director of product development at the maker of portable generators and other motorised tools. ""Why create any more conflict than you need to?""
U.S. companies are walking a tightrope at the Nov. 5-10 China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai, with the fate of a preliminary deal between China and the United States to defuse the trade war still up in the air.
Strong backing from Chinese leader Xi Jinping has imbued CIIE with political symbolism unmatched by any other trade show in China.
The U.S. government has made a point of skipping it in the two years it has existed. Several other countries have sent leaders or senior officials, and many are hosting lavish pavilions promoting their nation's wares.
Nevertheless, more American companies have showed up this year - nearly 200 - than in CIIE's inaugural year, propelled by enthusiasm about China's vast market. In some cases, companies also want to support an event that the Chinese government considers highly significant.
Concern was not far from the surface about prospects for business if the trade war drags on and the world's no. 2 economy continues slipping.
U.S. companies are not yet being stigmatised, according to Stephen Lien, president of the Aerospace Asia Pacific Division at Honeywell International Inc (N:HON), but such a thing was ""certainly possible.""
""We get Chinese customers walking in and talking to us all day long,"" he said. ""They're not going to Philips just because we're an American company and Philips is a European company. There continues to be a lot of interest.""
Nearby, Twiggy Zhao, a representative at the WD-40 Co (O:WDFC) booth, said the California-based maker of lubricants was eager to gain traction in the China market but remained ""a little bit worried"" about trade war fallout.
""We quite want to separate politics and business. I mean, our product is very helpful and useful, so we want people to focus on products,"" she said.
On top of trade uncertainty is the perception that political risks have risen, as highlighted by the troubles the National Basketball Association has faced since the Houston Rockets' general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong's protests last month.
For Impossible Foods, the developer of plant-based meat substitutes, the risks are outweighed by the prospect of tapping into a huge country reliant on a environment-straining livestock industry.
Founder and chief executive Pat Brown was taking advice on how to walk the line from his brother, a diplomat in China.
""We don't intend to impose our own ideology on China or anything like that, but we are not going to be shy about talking about our values,"" he said.
""We're not here to tell China how to run its business,"" he added. ""We're here to help solve a huge global problem and help China solve its own food security and reduce its environmental impact. We're completely focused on that.""
Li Fang, president and general manager of Corning Inc's (N:GLW) greater China operations, said his company's success here had been aided by government support. Li said attending CIIE for the first time this year was, in part, a gesture of support for China.
The New York-based company has invested more than $7 billion in China - more than half of it since 2015 - and is doing ""extremely well,"" despite risks, Li said. The impact of the trade war has been ""minimal"" and Corning plans to continue to invest.
""We still hope the two countries can solve the issue as soon as possible,"" Li added."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Democratic U.S. lawmakers said on Thursday the Federal Aviation Administration overruled agency technical specialists on two Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co safety issues involving the 737 MAX and the 787 Dreamliner jets that they said could be ""potentially catastrophic.""
The issues involve the 737 MAX rudder cable and lightning protection for fuel tanks on the 787 Dreamliner.
Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Representative Rick Larsen, who chairs the aviation subcommittee, said in a letter to FAA Administrator Steve Dickson that FAA management ultimately overruled the technical specialists after Boeing objected.
That action raises ""questions about how the agency weighs the validity of safety issues raised by its own experts compared to objections raised by the aircraft manufacturers the FAA is supposed to oversee,"" the lawmakers said in the letter.
The lawmakers, who have been probing two deadly 737 MAX crashes, demanded a list of detailed answers from the FAA by Nov. 21.
Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe said the manufacturer is aware of both issues and ""confident that each was properly considered and addressed by Boeing, thoroughly reviewed with and approved by the FAA, and handled in full compliance with the processes governing review and disposition of such issues."" 
An FAA spokesman said the agency would respond directly to the lawmakers.
The letter said the committee had information and documents ""suggesting Boeing implemented a design change on its 787 Dreamliner lightning protection features to which multiple FAA specialists ultimately objected.""
The letter also raised concerns that Boeing ""reportedly produced approximately 40 airplanes prior to the FAA's approval of the design change. If accurate, that is an astonishing fact that suggests either willful neglect of the federal aviation regulatory structure or an oversight system in need of desperate repair.""
The FAA safety office rejected Boeing's lighting protection change in February but was overruled in March by FAA management, the lawmakers said.
The other issue involves the adequacy of rudder cable protection on the Boeing 737 MAX ""from an uncontained engine failure and the possibility of severance of the cable and a potentially catastrophic loss of control,"" the letter said, citing a 2014 memo from an FAA manager that suggested Boeing had not incorporated adequate protection following a deadly 1989 United Airlines engine failure accident in Iowa.
The letter said Boeing objected to making design changes to the 737 MAX rudder cable arguing they ""would be impractical and noting the company's concern about the potential impact on 'resources and program schedules.'""
The letter comes as many in Congress want to reform the longstanding practice of designating new airplane certification tasks to the manufacturer.

An October report by aviation regulators said the FAA had 45 people in an office overseeing 1,500 Boeing’s Organization Designation Authority employees and faulted the FAA's oversight, saying it did not have enough staffing and found “signs of undue pressure” on Boeing employees performing tasks for the FAA.

176,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 10:23PM ET</span>",U.S. Justice Department issues subpoenas to automakers in California emissions probe,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has issued civil subpoenas to four major automakers, demanding that they disclose details on a deal struck with California in July to follow strict vehicle emissions standards, a source briefed on the matter said on Thursday.
The Justice Department is carrying out an antitrust investigation into the voluntary agreement. It comes against a growing number of fights between the Republican White House and California on a number of fronts, including numerous environmental issues.
The Trump administration in September issued a determination that California cannot set its own vehicle emission standards and zero-emission vehicle mandates and is investigating if the companies engaged in anti-competitive conduct in striking the deal.
The Justice Department has issued civil investigative demands to Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Honda Motor Co, BMW AG, and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), the source said. The Wall Street Journal reported the subpoenas earlier.
The subpoenas ask for details of how the agreements were reached and if the automakers engaged in improper conduct, the person said.
The Justice Department declined to comment. The department has previously said that in August it sent the four automakers letters, without giving details.
A BMW spokesman confirmed on Thursday it had received a subpoena.
Ford and Volkswagen declined to comment, while Honda said it ""will continue to work cooperatively with the Department of Justice with regard to the emissions framework reached between the State of California and various automotive manufacturers.""
The subpoenas follow separate Justice Department meetings with the four automakers in October.
In September, two Democratic lawmakers asked the White House to turn over documents that would show if President Donald Trump interfered or directed the antitrust probe, saying that it appeared to be ""another example of the administration's weaponization of the antitrust laws to target perceived political adversaries of the president.""
Makan Delrahim, who heads the antitrust division, said in September he was not conducting the investigation for ""political reasons.""
Last month, other major automakers - including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Toyota Motor Corp, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV - backed the Trump administration in its efforts to bar California from setting tailpipe emissions standards. 
Those automakers are backing Trump in two lawsuits brought by California and 22 other states and environmental groups, which seek to reverse the administration's determination that California cannot set its own vehicle emissions rules. Those rules are followed by more than a dozen U.S. states.
The automakers' decision to side with Trump brought thanks from the president and prompted a furious backlash from Democrats and environmentalists.
In August 2018, the administration proposed freezing fuel efficiency requirements at 2020 levels through 2026, which would result in an average fuel efficiency of 37 miles per gallon by 2026, compared with 46.7 mpg under the Obama era rules.
The Trump administration's final requirements are expected to modestly boost fuel efficiency versus the initial proposal, with several automakers anticipating annual increases of about 1.5%, but are much less stringent than the Obama rules.

177,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 10:06PM ET</span>",Year's most destructive California wildfire declared extinguished after two weeks,"By Steve Gorman
(Reuters) - California's biggest, most ruinous wildfire this year, a wind-driven blaze that scorched 120 square miles (310 square kilometers) of Sonoma County wine country and consumed scores of homes, was declared fully contained and extinguished on Thursday, two weeks after erupting.
The Kincade fire alone accounts for nearly a third of the 250,000-plus acres (101,000 hectares) laid to waste by blazes since January, many during a series of violent windstorms of historic proportion that swept California last month.
The tally of more than 400 structures damaged or destroyed in the Kincade fire also represents over half the property losses from all California wildfires this year, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.
Still, California's current fire season to date pales by comparison to an epic spate of conflagrations in 2017 and 2018 that ranks as the deadliest and most destructive in state history.
Nearly 150 lives were lost in wildfires during those two years, including 85 who perished in the Camp fire, which virtually incinerated the Northern California town of Paradise a year ago on Friday and stands as the state's most lethal blaze on record. Cal Fire lists just three wildfire fatalities so far this year.
Although weeks remain of a fire season that now effectively runs through December, the 2019 tally of a quarter-million acres burned falls far short of the 1.2 million acres and 1.6 million acres that went up in flames in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Thousands of homes were destroyed.
A number of factors have been cited for the reduced wildfire toll in 2019, including redoubled readiness and prevention efforts and favorable weather through the first half of the year.
""We had a great winter, in terms of rainfall, with a really good snow pack, and no winds to speak of for most of the year,"" Cal Fire spokesman Scott McLean said.
Those conditions gave way to the onset of heavy blasts of dry, gale-force winds blowing in from desert areas in October, the traditional peak of fire season.
When fires did ignite, many communities in harm's way likely benefited from having more ""defensible space"" thanks to greater emphasis on fuel-reduction projects aimed at removing excess vegetation that might otherwise burn.
Governor Gavin Newsom also allocated extra money to pre-stage firefighting strike teams and equipment in strategic spots, allowing local authorities to respond to fires more swiftly, McLean said.
The jury was still out on the success of another major change in preparedness - increased use of wide-scale, precautionary power shut-offs by utilities during high winds to reduce the risk of electric lines sparking fires.
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. made particular use of this strategy in October, cutting off electricity to millions of residents in a move the governor and state regulators criticized as badly managed.
PG&E has acknowledged that the Kincade fire erupted near the base of a damaged high-voltage transmission tower where one of its lines malfunctioned about the time the blaze started, though the fire's cause remains under investigation."

""We'll file our papers tomorrow,"" Sessions said in an interview on Fox News after announcing his candidacy in a statement on his website.
Trump forced out Sessions as head of the Justice Department last November after repeatedly criticizing his decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe.
""When I left President Trump’s cabinet, did I write a tell all book? No. Did I go on CNN and attack the President? No. Have I said a cross word about President Trump? No,"" Sessions said in his announcement statement.
Sessions, 72, enters a crowded field seeking the Republican nomination to face Democratic Senator Doug Jones in the November 2020 election in a Southern (NYSE:SO) state considered reliably Republican.
Sessions, who held the Senate seat from 1997 to 2017, was an early and loyal supporter of Trump. But after being publicly ridiculed by the president, Sessions was ousted on Nov. 7, 2018. He was replaced briefly by Matthew Whitaker until William Barr was confirmed to the job in February.
Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the federal investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election paved the way for the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Trump has denounced the Mueller probe as a ""witch hunt.""
Trump has called his selection of Sessions as attorney general ""the biggest mistake"" of his presidency.
“As everyone knows, President Trump and I have had our ups and downs. But here’s the important part: the President is doing great work for America,"" Sessions said in his campaign announcement.
Asked in the Fox News interview if he expected to get Trump's support, Sessions said: ""I hope so. I think he will respect my work."" 
Sessions said he had not yet had a chance to discuss his candidacy with the president.
Others seeking the Republican nomination include U.S. Representative Bradley Byrne, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville and former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore.
Jones defeated Moore in 2017, becoming the first Democrat to win election to the Senate from Alabama in 25 years.
Moore's Senate bid was derailed by allegations of decades-old sexual misconduct involving teenage girls.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) may cross-examine four antitrust investigators involved in a criminal cartel prosecution against them, an Australian court ruled on Friday, a win for the defence in a closely watched legal battle.
The two banks plus  JP Morgan Chase  & Co (N:JPM) worked on a A$3 billion ($2 billion) stock issue for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) (AX:ANZ) in 2015. Citi, Deutsche, ANZ and eight of their staff were charged last year with withholding crucial information from shareholders about the sale.
JP Morgan was granted immunity from prosecution when two of its former executives agreed to co-operate with regulators.
However, lawyers for the defence have said they want to question staff of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in court about how they obtained evidence from the JP Morgan representatives. The ACCC opposed their request.
On Friday, a local court magistrate ruled that the defendants' lawyers may cross-examine the ACCC staff on the subjects of how they obtained witness statements from the JP Morgan personnel and the staff's level of cooperation with corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.
""The defence does not have an unfettered right to cross-examine witnesses (but) I'm not persuaded that I can or should oppose,"" the magistrate, Jennifer Atkinson told the court in Sydney.
""There will be examination of the following witnesses,"" Atkinson said, before naming the four ACCC staff.
Spokespeople for the ACCC, Citi, Deutsche and JP Morgan declined to comment.
Prosecutors have accused the banks of forming a criminal cartel to restrict the supply of ANZ shares and maintain the price of ANZ shares after they were unable to sell them all to regular investors, court documents showed.
Four phone calls in August 2015, which prosecutors said involved bankers from all the companies, are at the heart of the case.
None of the accused companies or people have entered formal pleas and no trial date has been set, but all have said they would plead not guilty.
The case could have major implications for the underwriting business and lead to increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide.
State prosecutors had opposed allowing the ACCC officers to testify, saying it may violate legal privilege and inappropriately expose the regulator's private workings.
The next hearing is on Dec. 5."

If confirmed by the Senate, Brouillette will replace Rick Perry, who said last month he would step down by the end of the year. He is expected to keep advancing Trump's policy of maximizing oil, gas and coal output while slashing regulations on energy facilities.
""If confirmed, I will further Secretary Perry's legacy of promoting energy independence, innovation, and security for the American people,"" Brouillette said in a statement.
Brouillette, 57, has taken on increasing responsibilities at the Energy Department in recent months as Perry signaled he would resign. He went on international trips for the department and sat in for Perry during several cabinet meetings.
Brouillette was a vice president at Ford (N:F) from 2004 to 2006. After that, he headed public policy for the United Service Automobile Association (USAA), which offers insurance and financial services to veterans.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some Wall Street investors and Democratic donors sharply criticized progressive firebrand Elizabeth Warren's policies on issues from taxation to affordable healthcare because they are impractical.
Speaking at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook 2020 Summit, several investors said, however, they were not too worried by a potential Warren presidency because many of her plans would struggle to pass what is likely to be a divided Congress.
""Her policies scare the heck out of every wealthy guy I know,"" said Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, which invests in cryptocurrency and blockchain. But he added: ""They don't scare me as much because I don't think they're practical."" Novogratz has donated to Warren's rivals, including South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
While cool on the U.S. senator from Massachusetts specific policy proposals, several donors and investors credited her political savvy, financial knowledge, and agreed that policymakers needed to confront rising income inequality or face long-term adverse social and economic repercussions.
But many questioned whether Warren's proposals would successfully address these issues, saying they feared her plan to fund trillions of dollars in social projects through a range of taxes could have unintended adverse consequences, such as reducing economic growth or dampening the stock market.
""Senator Warren is saying things that are difficult to enact, and I don't know how you end up paying for them,"" said Marc Lasry, chairman at Avenue Capital Group, who has donated to several of Warren's opponents for the Democratic nomination.
Wall Street's antipathy for Warren will help more moderate and conservative alternatives, including former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is expected to file for the Alabama Democratic presidential primary to keep his options open for a possible presidential run, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
The Warren campaign did not respond to a request to comment.
Warren, who is seeking the Democratic nomination to face Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election, has long made it clear she has little regard for Wall Street and many wealthy investors have much to lose if she is successful. Buoyed by grassroots funding, she has been able to snub the corporate coffers that have backed many presidential campaigns and propose policies that would squeeze the wealthy.
She has outlined a new tax of at least 2% on households whose net worth tops $50 million as well as a charge of 0.1% to sell stocks or bonds. She also wants to break up big banks, big tech and increase regulation on private-equity companies.
The Democratic senator has also proposed spending $20.5 trillion on a Medicare for All healthcare plan and several trillion more to make public colleges free, cancel some student loan debt, combat climate change, build affordable housing and increase social security benefits for retirees and other groups.
Reuters/Ipsos polls of Democratic-leaning voters put Warren at about 11% nationally, more than double her share in April, though still behind former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders.
Several investors also questioned Warren's plan to push Americans to a government-run healthcare plan, instead of private health insurance. Glenn Hutchins, co-founder of private equity firm Silver Lake, argued instead for creating a government-run system that people could choose, or keep their private insurance.
The current chairman of investing company North Island and part-owner of the Boston Celtics basketball team has given largely to Democrats, including presidential contenders John Delaney, Kamala Harris and Steve Bullock, as well as former U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke, who recently dropped out of the race. He said his policy is to donate if asked and that, while he had contributed to Warren's Senate campaign, he did not expect to be solicited during her presidential run.
""It's a very good thing that they have a bunch of people out there making their case,"" he added.
Some investors and strategists, though, said they saw opportunities to profit from a massive government spending plan.
""Almost all federal spending - of any sort, on anything - tends to be stimulative,"" said Anne Mathias, a strategist at fund manager Vanguard. ""Whether you spend it on healthcare or you spend it on defense or you spend it on highways, the sheer act of borrowing money from the market and spending it can be stimulative to the economy."""
183,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 07:21PM ET</span>","Economically optimistic, BlackRock's Rieder takes on more risk","By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Ross Kerber
NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc's top bond investor has boosted risk exposure in recent weeks, on a view that the market is too bearish about chances of a U.S. recession, the Federal Reserve's ability to support the economy and the resiliency of the U.S. consumer.
Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for global fixed income, said he is optimistic about the state of the U.S. economy with consumers in “tremendous shape” based on factors such as their income, household net worth and their savings rate.
As a result, ""We have definitely gotten longer risk in the last 3-4 weeks,"" Rieder said at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook 2020 Summit in New York on Thursday.
""I think people have all gotten into cash and have all beared-up about the world coming to an end,"" he said.
Recession fears were compounded by anxiety about Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren rising in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination, Rieder added.
Warren has emerged as a front-runner along with former Vice President Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic nomination to face Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election.
Some investors fret about Warren's plans to hike taxes on Wall Street, and regulate financial services more aggressively.
U.S. stock markets sold off hard starting mid-September amid concerns about trade, politics and concerning U.S. manufacturing data. The market has recovered since and the benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX) has since hit record highs.
The U.S. economy’s big services sector can continue to grow without sparking inflationary pressure for finite resources in the way that manufacturing industries traditionally could not, Rieder said.
""The consumer and services can keep the economy in good shape,"" Rieder said.
As BlackRock's (N:BLK) top bond investment officer Rieder oversees $2.3 trillion, about a third of the New York's firm's total assets under management.
Betting against a near-term recession or further cuts in interest rates, Rieder is selling credit and buying agency mortgage-backed securities.
One way the firm has taken advantage of the market's heightened worries about the economic outlook is by writing covered calls - selling options against stock holdings.
""We have some names that have done pretty well in some of our funds. We have been selling a decent amount of calls,"" he said.
Sellers of call options take on the obligation sell shares at a fixed price in the future. It is a neutral to moderately bullish strategy that seeks to harvest income from heightened volatility levels.
Even though volatility selling has proven a crowded trade, reducing its attractiveness at the index level, the trade still had juice when implemented at the level of individual stock, he said. He declined to name particular companies in which BlackRock sold options.
Rieder also said Fed officials have done a good job matching rate cuts to economic conditions, and said he hopes – and expects – the U.S. central bank will pause from further adjustments while waiting to see if inflation starts to hit 2% or perhaps higher.
""I think they should stop now. I don’t think they should cut rates anymore from here. They should stop and get out of the way,"" he said.
Rieder also said the Fed’s operations to boost liquidity by purchasing about $60 billion per month in short-term Treasuries plays an under-appreciated role in keeping the economy humming.
""You create a dynamic that’s much more important to the global economy and emerging markets than interest rates are, by a lot.""
September's sharp squeeze in money markets spurred the Fed into providing billions of dollars in daily cash injections and has reassured Rieder the U.S. central bank is back in the business of providing sorely needed liquidity, he said.             "
184,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 06:51PM ET</span>","BlackRock's Rieder selling U.S. credit, buying mortgages","By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Betting against a near-term recession or further cuts in interest rates, BlackRock's chief investment officer for global fixed income Rick Rieder is selling U.S. corporate debt and buying agency mortgage-backed securities.
Rieder, whose business represents $2.3 trillion of the $7 trillion BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has under management, said at the Reuters Investment Outlook 2020 Summit that he believed the Federal Reserve had stopped its rate-cutting cycle for now. While the manufacturing sector has been hit by the ongoing trade war with China, its contribution to U.S. gross domestic product has fallen dramatically in recent years.
He was the third speaker at the November 2019 Reuters Summit to cite the opportunities available in the mortgage market. Dan Ivascyn, chief investment officer at PIMCO, said that mortgage-backed securities were creating today's best investment opportunities.
As the Fed cut interest rates three times this year, the interest rate on U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgages has fallen by more than a full percentage point. That has driven a wave of refinancing that helped cheapen mortgage bonds guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie.
Andrew Hsu, portfolio manager at DoubleLine Capital, cited the opportunity in agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). But Hsu was interested in CMBS in particular, because he believed that commercial borrowers were less likely to refinance their mortgages in a low-rate environment.
Rieder, however, believes pre-payment speeds will remain moderate. ""We've seen these interest-rate levels and we think you're not going to see a pre-payment acceleration."" What's more, he said he expects interest-rate volatility to remain low, which would benefit the mortgage market.
Rieder also cited the growing demand from banks for mortgage-backed products, like JPMorgan (N:JPM) which reported significant growth in its securities business in the third quarter. Global banks earned $1 billion from trading agency MBS in the first half of 2019, a fivefold increase on last year for what industry sources say is the fastest growing revenue source in investment banking.
Finally, Rieder said that spreads in investment-grade credit were no longer interesting, and liquidity in the market was thinner than that in the mortgage market. ""In a world of uncertainty, I'd rather take more liquidity and a bigger buyer base."""

(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) popular theme parks and a remake of ""The Lion King"" pushed earnings past Wall Street targets on Thursday, and the company spent less than it had projected on its big plunge into streaming entertainment.
Shares of Disney rose more than 5% to $140.77 in after-hours trading.
Disney is trying to transition from a cable TV leader to a powerhouse in the crowded streaming video market dominated by Netflix Inc (O:NFLX). The family-friendly digital entertainment service, Disney+, is set to debut on Tuesday. 
Excluding certain items, Disney earned $1.07 per share for the quarter that ended in September, above average analyst estimates of 95 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Disney+ will initially stream in the United States, Canada and the Netherlands. On Nov. 19, it will debut in Australia and New Zealand, followed by several countries in western Europe on March 31, Chief Executive Bob Iger said.
""We're making a huge statement about the future of media and entertainment and our continued ability to thrive in this new era,"" Iger told analysts on a conference call. 
The Disney+ app will be accessible via a wide range of smart TVs, mobile phones and streaming devices, including Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Fire TV devices and  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) and  LG Electronics Inc  (KS:066570) products, Iger said.
The company is spending heavily to compete for digital viewers. 
Disney's direct-to-consumer and international unit, which also includes ESPN+ and Hulu, reported an operating loss of $740 million from July through September, up from $340 million the previous year, but less than the $900 million that Disney had forecast. 
Seeking a broad audience of all ages, Disney+ will offer a deep library of TV shows and movies from Disney, Pixar Animation, Marvel Studios, the ""Star Wars"" franchise and the National Geographic Channel, plus original programming such as a new ""High School Musical"" series and a remake of ""Lady and the Tramp."" It will cost $7 per month, less than the $13 for Netflix's most popular plan.
Edgier adult programming will go to Hulu, including shows from FX Networks starting in March, Iger said. FX on Hulu will feature every season of more than 40 FX original series spanning the past 17 years, such as ""Fargo"" and ""American Horror Story.""
Disney faces several competitors including a just-launched service from Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and offerings from AT&T Inc's (N:T) WarnerMedia and Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) next year. 
Distribution agreements with Apple, Samsung and others ""show they understand this is an ecosystem, and even with all their market power, they can't go it alone,"" said Forrester analyst Jim Nail.
For the just-ended quarter, the theme parks and consumer products unit reported a 17% rise in operating income to $1.4 billion, driven by sales of ""Frozen"" and ""Toy Story"" merchandise and higher guest spending at Disneyland in California.
The movie studio benefited from remakes of ""The Lion King"" and ""Aladdin"" plus Pixar sequel ""Toy Story 4."" Profit at the division jumped 79% to nearly $1.1 billion. 
The company's media networks division posted a 3% decrease in operating income to $1.8 billion, Disney said. Sports network ESPN experienced higher programming, production and marketing costs and now has 3.5 million subscribers. 

Overall revenue rose 34% to $19.10 billion, edging past analysts' average estimate of $19.05 billion.

186,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 06:02PM ET</span>",Attack on Canadian mining firm in Burkina Faso threatens gold’s final frontier,"By David Lewis, Helen Reid and Zandi Shabalala
NAIROBI/JOHANNESBURG/LONDON (Reuters) - As jihadists wreaked ever more havoc in the last two years, mining firms in Burkina Faso rolled out extra security measures, from barracks for government troops protecting them to safe rooms for workers behind barbed wire and mounds. 
Expatriates generally fly in and out, while local staff still drive but in guarded convoys.
That has added millions of dollars to security costs for foreign companies, mainly from Canada and Australia, operating in the West African nation where industrial miners are forecast to produce 60 tonnes of gold this year. 
Yet this week's attack on a convoy ferrying hundreds of local employees and contractors from a mine owned by Canada’s Semafo (TO:SMF) has exposed just how vulnerable firms still are. 
At least 37 civilians died, with another 60 injured and dozens more feared missing.
Abandoned buses and pickups lay riddled with bullets. Bloodied bodies were slumped in the vehicles and on a red dirt road. Military reinforcements arrived but only after the lead escort vehicle was blown up, officials said.
""This is the deadliest incident targeting the mining industry, or any private businesses, in the Sahel since the 2013 In Amenas hostage crisis,"" said Vincent Rouget, an analyst at Control Risks Group, referring to an attack on a gas plant in the Algerian desert that killed dozens of foreign hostages.
There has been no claim for Wednesday's ambush, but the modus operandi – a bomb attack on military escorts followed by gunmen unleashing bullets – suggested the involvement of Islamist groups. They have been pushing south from strongholds in northern Mali to carry out attacks across much of Burkina Faso and parts of western Niger.
Over 1,000 people have been killed in Burkina Faso since 2016 and nearly 500,000 more have fled their homes, mainly this year. In this time, there have been dozens of attacks on industrial and small-scale mining operations.
It is an acute dilemma for miners.
The region is seen as the gold industry's final frontier, with large untapped reserves. Lured by relatively low-cost mining, firms have invested billions over the last decade - but expansion by al Qaeda and Islamic State-linked militants could force them to rethink.
WORTH THE RISK?
""Because of the escalating security situation in Burkina, there are companies looking at decreasing their exposure to the country or leaving,"" said Bill Witham, the head of AAMEG, a body representing Australian resource companies in Africa.
""But the miners still see West Africa as a whole as quite a good investment.""
Semafo's Toronto-listed shares dropped 10 percent after the attack. And major mines just over the borders in northern Ghana and Ivory Coast are now within striking distance of Islamist strongholds, experts warn.
Last year, AQIM, the main al Qaeda affiliate in West Africa, told followers Western companies, especially from France, were ""legitimate targets"".
Semafo, whose staff, contractors or escorts have been attacked three time in the last 18 months, declined to comment further, saying only that it had beefed up security since those episodes. 
Eight other companies contacted by Reuters around the Sahel would not give details of their extra security costs.
West Africa has long been considered a risky prospect where political instability, volatile tax regimes and tricky relations with small-scale miners weigh heavily on boardrooms.
Yet government incentives and the potential to produce gold relatively cheaply led to over $7 billion invested in mining projects in the region between 2004 and 2018, according to a tally by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), a market intelligence company. 
This peaked at $1.2 billion in 2012 alone, when gold prices were at an all-time high.
That year, al Qaeda-linked groups took over northern Mali but gold operations were unscathed as most mines are in the south, hundreds of kilometers away from militant strongholds.
Since then, France has deployed over 4,000 troops to the region, there is a 16,000-strong United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali, and West African leaders have launched regional security initiatives. However, local armies are losing ground.
Since 2017, researchers documented at least 28 violent incidents at mines or involving mining workers in Burkina Faso, 17 of them this year, according to a Reuters analysis of data compiled by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. 
At least 12 of those events this year, which include attacks on workers, abductions and the use of improvised explosive devices, were linked to jihadists. Prior to Wednesday, at least 54 people had been killed in mining-related violence this year, five times as many as all of 2018.
""BRACING FOR AN ATTACK""
This has forced the industry to accept that the threat has spread well beyond Niger’s northern deserts, where the likes of Frances's Areva have uranium mining operations and expatriates have been kidnapped, said Rouget.
In October 2018, France scrambled two jets to strike militants attacking a gold mine in northern Burkina Faso.
Earlier this year, Burkina Faso's government asked mining firms to help fund a rapid reaction unit with helicopters to respond to incidents like Wednesday's, but the initiative did not materialize, according to two people involved in meetings.
One company security official said his firm spent millions of dollars on armored vehicles, bullet-proof walls and safety rooms. ""We are bracing for an In Amenas-style attack,"" he said.
However, some analysts believe mines still have sufficient defenses.
""The only thing that would shift the perception among gold miners that exposure to this insecurity is a risk worth taking is a direct attack on a mine site – an unlikely prospect,"" said Eric Humphery-Smith at risk consultancy Verisk (NASDAQ:VRSK) Maplecroft.
The top investor in Semafo said risk and gold mining went hand-in-hand, and extra security costs would not be a game-changer.
""Obviously it will add maybe a few dollars to the cost of producing an ounce of gold, but it is not going to change the overall economics,"" said Joe Foster, gold fund portfolio manager at VanEck Investment Management, which has a 10.1% stake in Semafo.
One immediate impact could be restrictions on how far afield firms are prepared to send geologists.
In May, Oumarou Idani, Burkina Faso’s minister of mines, identified exploration companies as high risk. ""They work over large areas, sometimes 250 square kilometers ... it is difficult to have a secure way of working over that size of area."" 
Months earlier, Kirk Woodman, a Canadian geologist with 20 years' experience in the region, was kidnapped and found dead.
That was a ""a big wakeup call"", a former senior mining executive who is now an investor told Reuters.
""Miners are going to risk exploring further afield a lot less now,"" he said, asking not to be named. ""This will affect how many new gold deposits are found.""

Thomas Feddo, who oversees the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which vets foreign investment for national security concerns, said enforcement would be a priority for the agency. He noted, however, that he recognizes the need for clarity on how it will work. 
""I suspect that somewhere in the future, sooner rather than later, we will promulgate enforcement guidelines that will give greater clarity to the business community about how we will exercise our enforcement authorities,"" Feddo said at an event in Washington.
CFIUS has flexed its muscle in recent months to block and regulate Chinese investment in the United States after Congress passed the so-called FIRRMA law last year. 
That legislation gave CFIUS more authority to oversee foreign investment in a bid to crimp access to sensitive technology by foreign adversaries that could be used to harm U.S. national security or eliminate a U.S. competitive advantage.
Before the legislation was passed, CFIUS already had authority to levy fines on companies. But the law also gave the agency the authority to impose financial penalties on firms that fail to comply with new mandatory filing requirements. 
""We have a substantial degree of latitude and a big stick in terms of the size of the civil monetary penalty that we can impose for a violation,"" Feddo said. 
Still, he said the goal of any penalty would be deterrence, and to ensure companies comply with the agreements they ink with CFIUS to assuage regulators' concerns and sign off on deals.
The agency has so far been cautious about applying fines. It issued its first one acknowledged publicly last year, for $1 million, to an undisclosed company for violating a mitigation agreement. Such agreements are signed to assuage regulators' concerns and permit a transaction to move forward. 
CFIUS has made waves with its reviews, especially of completed transactions. Reuters reported last month that it has launched a national security review of TikTok owner Beijing ByteDance Technology Co's $1 billion acquisition of U.S. social media app Musical.ly two years ago.

The acquisition that the two companies plan to announce Thursday ends an era that began when GM opened the complex in 1966. The factory’s fate was largely sealed when the United Auto Workers union was unable to convince GM to keep it in the fold as part of a new labor contact ratified late last month.
Terms of the deal aren’t being disclosed. Workhorse Group Inc., which is affiliated with Lordstown Motors but doesn’t share any ownership, climbed as much as 12% to $2.75 in New York trading.
The plant has been a political football since GM announced a year ago that it wouldn’t allocate future product to Lordstown. The decision was an immediate liability for U.S. President Donald Trump, who a year earlier went so far as to discourage rally-goers from selling their homes because of all the jobs he would bring back to the area. Democrats seized on the development as a symbol of unfulfilled promises made to voters in a key battleground state.
Trump was so eager to endorse GM’s discussions to sell the Lordstown plant that he preempted the announcement of the talks in May by the largest U.S. automaker and Workhorse. But both companies are on shaky financial footing, with Workhorse totaling just $6,000 of revenue during its latest quarter.
With the plant acquisition out of the way, Steve Burns, who used to lead Workhorse and is now chief executive officer of Lordstown Motors, is turning his attention to phase two: seeking cash to convert the Lordstown plant from making gasoline-burning Chevrolet Cruze sedans to plug-in pickups.
“We are going to be fundraising for a while,” Burns said in a phone interview. “We have to stand up an auto company.”
Debut Model
Lordstown Motors is calling its debut model Endurance and targeting fleet buyers who make up a big chunk of the truck market.
Workhorse Group is meanwhile among the bidders for a lucrative contract to make plug-in mail trucks for the U.S. Postal Service. The two companies share intellectual property related to electric-drive systems, Burns said.
If Workhorse wins the postal contract, the Lordstown plant could eventually build those vehicles, but it isn’t guaranteed, he said. Lordstown Motors does have an agreement to transfer 6,000 existing pre-orders for Workhorse’s electric truck prototype called the W-15 to Lordstown Motors for production.
If he raises the cash to get Endurance into production, Burns said he would work with the UAW and look to hire staff who didn’t accept the automaker’s offer to transfer to one of its other facilities. He wants experienced vehicle assemblers to build the trucks.
Four Motors
Burns said the Endurance will be built with four motors -- one for each wheel -- to deliver all-wheel drive. It will have fewer moving parts than existing pickups, which could translate to lower repair costs for fleet operators. It also will have outlets that enable owners to run power tools off the battery.
Lordstown Motors has the money to buy the plant and work on the vehicle, but Burns will need more to continue development, conduct crash and safety testing, get the truck approved for sale and retool the factory.
The UAW opposed the Lordstown plant sale because of the risk involved. In addition to being wary of tying its fortunes to a cash-strapped startup, future demand for electric vehicles is uncertain. Several electric-vehicle upstarts have failed, including Fisker Automotive Inc., which was acquired by a Chinese auto-parts conglomerate after bankruptcy. Even Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. struggles to make consistent profit.
Burns said he’s hired a team of veterans from GM, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. and Fisker’s successor company, Karma Automotive LLC. His chief production officer, Rick Schmidt, was a manufacturing director at Tesla for 3 1/2 years.
“We’ve got a solid team and I’m confident in our fundraising efforts,” he said.

192,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 05:35PM ET</span>",High-Frequency Trading Firm Pays $64.7 Million in Record Spoofing Penalty,"(Bloomberg) -- Tower Research Capital agreed to pay $67.4 million to settle allegations that three former traders at the firm engaged in spoofing, the largest penalty ever for such conduct, according to statements from the Justice Department and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
The ex-traders on thousands of occasions placed orders to buy or sell futures contracts -- including E-Mini S&P 500, E-Mini NASDAQ 100 and E-Mini Dow -- with the intent to cancel those orders before they were executed, the agencies said Thursday. The conduct lasted from at least March 2012 through December 2013. The New York-based firm entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department.
“Tower is deeply disappointed by the conduct of the three former employees named in this case, each of whom left the firm nearly six years ago,” company spokesman Rich Myers said in an emailed statement. “Since this matter came to light, Tower has cooperated with the government’s investigation and substantially improved its compliance and control functions.”
The former traders are Kamaldeep Gandhi, 37, and Krishna Mohan, 34, both of New York, and Bruce Mao, 40, a Chinese citizen, according to the Justice Department’s statement. Gandhi and Mohan both pleaded guilty to commodities fraud and spoofing in November 2018, according to the Thursday statement, which didn’t have details on Mao’s legal status. Gandhi and Mohan are scheduled to be sentenced next year.
‘Bogus Orders’
“Traders at Tower Research Capital LLC fraudulently placed thousands of bogus orders they never intended to execute—to deceive other market participants and move the market for their own benefit,” Brian Benczkowski, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s criminal division, said in the statement.
In settling the CFTC case, Tower didn’t admit or deny the agency’s allegations.
The U.S. has been cracking down on spoofing, a tactic in which traders place orders without intending to execute them to try to move prices in their favor. Spoofing can be done manually by traders or through computer algorithms. It involves flooding the market with orders that are later canceled when prices move in the direction the spoofer wants. While there’s nothing wrong with canceling orders, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act made it illegal to place orders with no intention of executing them.
Tower is one of Wall Street’s oldest high-frequency trading firms, which use computers to buy and sell securities at speeds faster than the blink of an eye. It was founded more than two decades ago by Chairman Mark Gorton, a former  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG proprietary trader. Gorton, 53, stepped down as chief executive officer in August.
Tower has seen its market share shrink, with firms such as Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial Inc. investing lots of money in technology and gobbling up huge chunks of equity trading, Larry Tabb, founder of research firm Tabb Group, said in August.

“The U.S. economy has experienced more than $500 billion in direct losses over the last five years due to climate and weather-related events,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Executive Vice President Kevin Stiroh told a risk forum on Thursday at the bank.
Disasters from devastating wildfires in California to storms pounding Eastern Seaboard cities have pushed climate change higher on the U.S. agenda, even as President Donald Trump formally begins withdrawing the country from the Paris climate accord.
The New York Fed took care to spell out that it was not turning into a climate activist.
“Supervisors should take a risk management perspective, not a social engineering one. It is beyond our mandate to advocate or provide incentives for a particular transition path,” Stiroh said, noting that the threat could be boiled down into two types of risk:
Physical risk, arising from potential for losses as climate-related changes disrupt business operations, destroy capital and interrupt economic activity.Transition risk, with the potential for losses resulting from a shift toward a lower-carbon economy as policy, consumer sentiment and technological innovations impact the value of certain assets and liabilities.“Supervisors should focus on the risks that emerge along the path decided by the public at large and their elected governments,” he said.
Stiroh’s prepared remarks did not venture into a discussion on central banks pointing their asset purchase programs toward green bonds, as has been suggested, with new European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde hinting she might be open to the idea once she had more information."

While Delhi chokes, politicians squabble in an annual phenomenon that lasts for an intense few weeks at the start of winter, then dies down as pollution levels fall. What they haven’t done is come together to find sustainable solutions to one of the world’s worst air pollution problems that by the World Bank’s calculations costs the country as much as 8.5% of its GDP, or around $221 billion each year.
Home to seven of the 10 most polluted cities in the world, India’s deadly haze was responsible for one of every eight deaths in 2017, while the life of a child born today is likely to be 2.5 years shorter because of air pollution. Delhi, with its unlikely combination of sweeping green boulevards and sprawling, unchecked urban growth, has become the symbol of the country’s struggle to contain this toxic cloud.
Describing the city as “gas chamber,” Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said crop burning in the states of Punjab and Haryana was a key source of pollution, and called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene. The federal environment minister Prakash Javadekar blamed Kejriwal’s administration for not taking serious measures, while his colleague, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, suggested in a tweet eating carrots could help beat pollution-related harm.
So far Modi has not issued a statement on the crisis, which prompted the declaration of a public health emergency and the closure of schools for several days. Calls to the prime minister’s office went unanswered.
“One key reason for the air pollution governance falling short is the absence of commitment and initiative by the political executive,” said Santosh Harish, environment researcher at the New Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research, adding most policy measures had been taken at the behest of judiciary. “They are negligent in taking on issues of air pollution as a sense of urgency.”
The country’s politicians should be on a war footing, Harish said, and address the lack of staff, equipment and enforcement power in pollution control boards, inefficiency in public transport systems and insufficient clean power generation.
Global Concerns
China -- which is also battling deadly air pollution -- reduced the annual average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) by a third between 2013 and 2017 in 74 cities, according to the State of Global Air 2019 study. India has long struggled to pull together a similarly coordinated national approach.
”China’s society had strongly expressed their needs for clean air and health when facing air pollution, thus the government took more emphasis on the issue,” said Ma Jun, founder and director of the Beijing-based Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs. There had not been a similar, significant public outcry in India, Ma said. “If there’s not enough consensus from the public, it’s hard for policy makers to be determined to tackle the issue.”
Air pollution drives up costs for companies, affecting both the bottom line and productivity, particularly when staff suffer respiratory diseases, said Hemant Shivakumar, a senior consultant at Control Risks. “In the absence of action by the government, this can become a long term risk and companies would want some kind of initiative to be taken.”
The South Asian nation’s toxic air is driven by a combination of factors, including vehicular emissions, factory emissions, road dust and construction activities. Crop burning contributed 44% to Delhi’s soaring PM 2.5 levels on Oct. 31, dropping to 2% by Nov. 7, according to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting.
Small scale farmers have been burning to prepare their land for planting for hundreds of years, said Helena Varkkey, an expert on air pollution and lecturer at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, noting baseline pollution in many Asian cities was also high, due to domestic, vehicular and industrial emissions. “If governments focus on these constant issues outside the major haze seasons, there could be a significant improvement on air quality as a whole,” Varkkey said.
‘Out of Hand’
India’s farmers, already struggling with depressed crop prices, are tired of shouldering responsibility for the crisis.“They blame farmers because farmers are the easiest people to beat,” said V.M. Singh, convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, a group representing around 250 farmer’s organizations. He urged governments to focus on programs to generate income from crop stubble, rather than expecting farmers to shoulder costs themselves.
“Either you take stubble away from farmers or you provide a cheap affordable technological solution to them,” said Sagnik Dey, associate professor of atmospheric sciences at Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi. “You can’t expect farmers to bear those high costs.”
Modi’s government has promoted solar power, improved emission standards and handed out millions of gas canisters to households to reduce cooking over open fires. In January it launched the National Clean Air Program. But the measures have yet to alleviate the impact of India’s rampant growth, from the dust left by thousands of new construction sites to exhaust from millions of cars.“The situation is getting out of hand,” said Dey. “The real frustration is that we know what to do but we are not able to implement it because of lack of coordination and limited resources.”"
195,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 05:34PM ET</span>",Corbyn’s U.K. Labour Party Is a Mess But Can Still Win Power,"(Bloomberg) -- They are divided, unpopular and have been accused by their own former colleagues of racism. But Jeremy Corbyn and his allies in the U.K.’s Labour Party could yet take power in next month’s general election.
After Prime Minister Boris Johnson had a terrible first day campaigning on Wednesday, it was Corbyn’s turn on Thursday.
As bad as Corbyn looks on paper, he has a potential path to power. The Conservatives have been in office so long that austerity-bitten voters want change. Opinion polls have misjudged the public mood before. Johnson is a gaffe-prone leader who is a divisive figure in the Brexit landscape.
With enough support in Labour heartlands in northern and central England, and with Johnson viewed increasingly with suspicion in Scotland, it could come down simply to voters disliking Corbyn less than they dislike Johnson.
Corbyn himself is a deeply divisive figure in his own political tribe. Just this week, his deputy quit and a former Labour member of Parliament publicly urged the country to vote Conservative. The Jewish Chronicle newspaper then ran a front page article describing Corbyn as an anti-Semite.
It was a grim narrative for a political opposition hoping to persuade the country to put it into power on Dec. 12. Labour could be doing so much better.
The Conservatives have been in office for nine years, and have been tearing themselves apart over Brexit for the past three. Johnson is now seeking to do something relatively rare for a government in British elections and increase the number of seats his ruling party has in parliament.
Polling Badly
Corbyn meanwhile has been calling for an election ever since the last one, in June 2017, put him within striking distance of replacing the Tories as the government. Yet with the campaign now under way, the opinion polls tell a very different story.
After rating close to the Conservatives for much of the last two years, Labour goes into the race behind. According to YouGov Plc, it hasn’t polled above 27% in six months. The Conservatives are on 36%.
Corbyn, in particular, polls badly. Just 23% of people say they have a positive view of him -- against 59% who say they have a negative view. More than half of people who voted Labour in the 2017 election think Corbyn should be replaced as leader.
It’s a view shared privately by many Labour MPs, including some inside his shadow cabinet team. Others, like Austin, have gone so far as to quit the party in protest at his leadership. “I regard myself as proper, decent, traditional Labour,” Austin told the BBC. “I just think Jeremy Corbyn’s not fit to run the country.” Saying people should vote for Johnson instead, he added: “I can’t believe it’s come to this.”
‘Racist Views’
For Austin, the final straw was the rise of anti-Semitism within Labour under Corbyn. Addressing the issue after a speech in Liverpool later, the party’s finance spokesman, John McDonnell acknowledged there had been a problem, and added that “one anti-Semite is too many,” but insisted the issue had been dealt with.
That’s not what the Jewish Chronicle thinks. Its front page accused Corbyn of “near total inaction” which it said had emboldened anti-Semites in the party. “How can the racist views of a party leader -- and the deep fear he inspires among an ethnic minority -- not be among the most fundamental of issues?” it asked.
Within Labour, Watson had been the figurehead of internal opposition to Corbyn, staying in place despite attempts to sideline or remove him. Though he said his decision was “personal, not political,” it was notable that his letter of resignation expressed no desire to see either a Labour government or Corbyn as prime minister.
Corbyn’s team is likely to be happy to see the back of Watson, but his departure raises the same question for Labour that Philip Hammond‘s did for the Conservatives earlier this week: What does it say about the party that lifelong members no longer see a future representing it in parliament?
Johnson’s Weakness
After decades in which Labour has aimed for the center ground of politics, talking about wealth creation as well as public spending, Corbyn has moved it firmly to the left. It’s not simply about taxation and spending. On foreign policy, Corbyn’s position is far outside the consensus of post-war British politics. He’s a critic of NATO, viewing it as a “danger to world peace.”
Yet none of this means Corbyn can’t become prime minister next month. The 2017 election saw him shrug off criticism of his views, and pick up votes where they mattered.
Johnson’s Brexit position has forced him into a strategy where he risks losing seats in pro-EU cities, the south of England, and Scotland. If he is to retain power and win a majority, Johnson must prevail in northern and central England -- but many of these are Labour strongholds that the Tories have never won.
When they tried this strategy in 2017, they came within a few thousand votes of losing power entirely. Lifelong Labour voters in these industrial districts may still balk at ditching their tribal allegiances in order to vote for the Tories, a party many have spent their lives hating.
Britain’s Election Gamble -- What You Need to Know: QuickTake
There’s another factor counting in Corbyn’s favor. If the Conservatives are the largest party after the election but fall short of an overall majority, they will probably find it difficult to form a coalition or even a looser alliance to prop up Johnson.
In another so-called hung parliament, Corbyn would have more potential allies among smaller parties. The Scottish National Party has said they would never work to keep Johnson in office but could help Corbyn in exchange for a referendum on independence for Scotland.
The smaller Liberal Democrats have ruled out supporting a Corbyn government, but party leader Jo Swinson might face the same choice as Austin: Corbyn or Johnson. And as an opponent of Brexit, she couldn’t back the Tory leader."

197,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 05:20PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top three things that could rock markets tomorrow. 
1. Consumer in Focus
The economic calendar winds down on the final trading day of the week with another update on the U.S. consumer from the University of Michigan.
The University of Michigan’s preliminary November consumer sentiment index, due at 10:00 am ET, is forecast to show a reading of 95.9, up slightly from the last month's reading of 95.5, while consumer expectations data will also be in focus.
With the holidays not far away, the U.S. consumer, the backbone of the economic growth this year, is set to come under increased scrutiny.
2. Oil Rig Count Rolls In
Traders will look to the latest rig count data due Friday for insight into whether U.S. producers continue to relentlessly pump out millions of barrels of oil.
Data last week showed the number of oil and gas rigs operating in the U.S. fell by 8 to 822. The count was also down nearly 23% from a year ago.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Fears that a slowing global economy, buffeted by trade tensions, would keep a lid on oil demand has been a big factor limiting upside in oil prices. 
But with the U.S. and China inching ever closer to a trade deal, those fears have receded slightly, helping crude prices find their footing.
3. Magna Earnings Puts Autos in Focus
  Magna International   (NYSE:MGA), suppier of mobility technology to the automative industry, reports earnings before the opening bell.
The auto supplier's earnings will also be closely parsed at a time when a slowing global economy has stifled demand for autos, keeping production in check, particularly in North America and Europe. 
During the company's post-second-quarter earnings call, Magna CFO Vince Galifi warned of further softening in North America and Europe, amid heightened macroeconomic uncertainty.
Magna is expected to report earnings of $1.34 a share on revenue $9.31 billion. Those results would be down from a year ago's earnings of $1.56 a share on revenue of $9.62 billion. 
The stock was up 0.23% on Thursday and hit a 52-week high of $57.09 during the session. The shares are up 24.6% in 2019, compared with 23% for the S&P 500 index."

Stroygazmontazh has also been under U.S. sanctions since 2014 because it was owned by Rotenberg, President Vladimir Putin's former judo sparring partner. Rotenberg was among the Russian officials and business executives blacklisted in the aftermath of Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014.
A spokeswoman for Rotenberg said he planned to use the funds made in the sale to invest in Russia. She did not disclose the terms of the deal, the reason for the sale, nor to whom it has been sold.
RBC business daily reported on Thursday that the firm had been sold to construction company Gazstroyprom for some 75 billion roubles ($1.18 billion). Russian gas giant Gazprom (MM:GAZP) owns a 49% stake in Gazstroyprom, according to the SPARK database which aggregates data from business registries.

Peck's departure comes as Gap prepares to spin off its Old Navy brand, a bright spot for the struggling retailer, into a publicly listed company. 
He has been with Gap for nearly 15 years and will depart after a brief transition, the company said.
Robert Fisher, the company's current non-executive board chairman, will serve as president and chief executive officer on an interim basis, effective immediately.
The apparel retailer, which estimated a 4% drop in third-quarter same-store sales, now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.75, down from its previous forecast of $2.05 to $2.15.

""This was a challenging quarter, as macro impacts and slower traffic further pressured results that have been hampered by product and operating challenges across key brands,"" Gap Chief Financial Officer Teri List-Stoll said.

200,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 04:55PM ET</span>",How the SEC is making life easier for corporate America,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Under the Trump administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken more than two dozen measures - including trimming rules - that make life easier for corporate America, according to a Reuters analysis of SEC announcements and interviews with more than a dozen lawyers, academics and advocacy groups.
Here are highlights of some of the changes that the SEC hopes will encourage more companies to go public.
CONFIDENTIAL IPOS
In July 2017, the SEC allowed companies of all sizes to confidentially file with the agency for initial public offerings. The move effectively extended a provision created by the 2012 Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS Act, that allowed companies of $1 billion in revenues or less to file in private.
The change allows firms more flexibility to work out kinks with the SEC before subjecting their finances to public scrutiny.
Several tech ""unicorns"" including Uber (N:UBER),  Lyft  (O:LYFT) and Slack Technologies (N:WORK) used the new provision before listing this year. Critics say confidential filings give investors less time to review key financial data before having to commit to purchasing shares.
WHISTLEBLOWER REWARDS
In June 2018, the agency proposed revamping a program that rewards corporate whistleblowers, whose original information leads to an enforcement penalty, up to 30% of the settlement.
The program, which was created by Congress in the wake of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, is widely regarded as a major success, leading the SEC to levy more than $1.4 billion in fines on malfeasant companies.
The SEC has proposed a discretionary cap of $30 million when it recovers over $100 million, and a discretionary floor of $2 million when it recovers a smaller amount, as well as other changes which may help to deter bogus or unhelpful tips that have stretched staff, say lawyers.
The proposal, which is still under discussion, has sparked outcry from whistleblower advocates, who say it would weaken protections for tipsters and discourage insiders from coming forward.
QUARTERLY REPORTING
Quarterly public reporting by listed companies has long been a controversial subject, with many corporate governance experts arguing it leads companies to be too short term in their outlook.
In December 2018, the SEC opened a public consultation on ways to ease the reporting burden, including by potentially moving to a semiannual cycle.
Some investors and analysts have said less frequent reporting could encourage companies to think more long-term, but others say quarterly reports provide critical information.
SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has thrown cold water on the notion that large companies would get out of quarterly reporting any time soon, but has said small company reporting merits studying. It is not clear if the SEC will proceed with a formal rule-change.
SARBANES-OXLEY ROLLBACK
In May 2019, the SEC proposed exempting public companies with less than $100 million in revenues from a requirement to get an external auditor to sign off on the adequacy of their internal financial reporting controls. The proposal would ease a rule introduced by the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom accounting scandals. The SEC said such an exemption should help reduce small companies' compliance costs.
But opponents of the proposal, including Rob Jackson, a Democratic SEC commissioner, and Harvard University academics, say it could lead to more corporate fraud. The SEC says there is no data to substantiate this claim and notes that companies overall will continue to be audited.
TESTING THE WATERS
In September, the agency finalized a new rule that allows all companies to privately sound out prospective institutional and certain accredited investors before filing for a stock exchange listing, expanding another provision of the 2012 JOBS Act.
The ""testing-the-waters"" rule, which previously applied only to smaller firms, helps companies gauge broader market interest before committing to time-consuming and expensive paperwork and SEC review.
But critics have said it gives large institutional fund houses, which get the opportunity to quiz the people running the startups, an edge over retail investors who don't get such access. They also say the rule does not impose a strict enough bar when determining if someone is an accredited investor.
DISCLOSURE MODERNIZATION
The SEC's disclosure regime has not been updated in three decades and most experts agree it is in need of a refresh. Clayton's SEC has taken several modernization measures, with a focus on reducing redundancy and making material disclosures more easily identifiable for investors.
Last year, for example, the SEC updated disclosure rules for hedging transactions and to ensure investors get a comprehensive picture of mining companies' assets. In August, the SEC proposed giving companies more flexibility in how they disclose general business development issues, litigation and risk factors.
It would also require firms to tell investors what material changes have been made to the demographics, stability and culture of their workforce.
Many industry participants, as well as Jackson and fellow Democratic commissioner Allison Lee, have supported some components of the modernization effort.
However, the SEC's decision in March to no longer require companies to seek its permission to redact confidential information from disclosures has sparked concerns that investors will miss key information. The SEC points out that staff will continue to scrutinize the redactions.
PROXY ADVISER CRACKDOWN
The SEC has launched a controversial campaign to rein in proxy advisers that make recommendations on how investors should vote in corporate elections. Lobbyists say these firms have accumulated too much power and often make damaging errors.
In August, the SEC implemented two pieces of guidance clarifying the obligations of proxy advisers and investors that rely upon them. The guidance lays out the considerations for investors when they retain a proxy adviser, including assessing the firm's conflicts of interests and potential mistakes in reports.
Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services Inc is suing the SEC over the guidance. The SEC this week proposed changes that would limit the ability of shareholders to submit proposals on items like executive compensation to company management."

But the rally was trimmed a bit after Reuters said internal disagreements in the Trump Administration were stalling a sign-off on the deal.
Still, the S&P 500, Dow Jones industrials, Dow Jones Transportation Average and the Nasdaq 100 indexes hit new intraday and closing highs. The Nasdaq Composite just missed a closing high but hit an intraday high. 
The Dow was up 0.66% and the S&P 500 up 0.27%. The Nasdaq added 0.28%, with the Nasdaq 100 up 0.29%. The Dow transports were up 0.56%.
 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), truck maker Paccar (NASDAQ:PCAR) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) hit all-time highs.
Among others hitting 52-week highs were Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM),   Citigroup   (NYSE:C), Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR), Ingersoll-Rand (NYSE:IR) and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU).
Two stocks that didn't join the party Thursday were video streaming company   Roku   (NASDAQ:ROKU) and online travel company   Expedia   (NASDAQ:EXPE), which both reported disappointing quarterly results after Wednesday's close.
After hours Thursday, entertainment giant Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) shares jumped nearly 4% as quarterly results from its theme parks and box-office hits helped the company's profit beat analyst estimates.
One indicator to watch: the major averages saw their relative strength indexes, a widely tracked technical indicator, briefly top 70 in the early afternoon before the market pullback. An RSI level above 70 can indicate the market is getting overbought.
The China-U.S. deal calls for China to buy more farm products and let financial services compete for business, Chinese officials said. At the same time, tariffs scheduled to be imposed in December would be cancelled and others phased out.
But Reuters said disagreements inside the White House about what to do about the tariffs may stall the deal.
The two sides have been expecting U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign an agreement some time in December.
The big demand for stocks, especially early in the day, sent interest rates higher. The 10-Year Treasury yield reached as high as 1.95%, its highest level since the end of July, before falling back to 1.919% toward the end of the day. The 10-year yield had fallen to as low as 1.429% in early September amid worries about the slowing global economy.
The prospects of a trade deal slammed gold and silver prices in New York and pushed up copper. Oil prices moved higher with West Texas Intermediate up 80 cents to $57.15 a barrel, and Brent crude, the global benchmark, up 55 cents to $62.29 a barrel.
 
Seven of the 11 S&P 500 sectors were higher on the day, led by energy, communications services, technology and financials. Utilities and real estate stocks, exposed to changing interest rates, were the weakest sectors. 
Fashion company Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL), broadcaster Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA), telecom company   CenturyLink   (NYSE:CTL) and military shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries (NYSE:HII) were among the top S&P 500 performers on Thursday.
 Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE), TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) and Hologic (NASDAQ:HOLX) were the S&P 500 laggards."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow and S&P 500 notched record closing highs on Thursday as the latest signs of progress in U.S.-China trade relations relieved investors, but a report raising fresh worries about the outlook for a deal limited the day's gains.
China said it had agreed with the United States to remove tariffs in phases, while state-owned Xinhua News Agency said Beijing was also considering removing restrictions on poultry imports.
But indexes pared gains in afternoon trading after a Reuters report, citing sources, said that the White House's plan to roll back China tariffs faces internal opposition and that no final decision has been made yet.
An interim U.S.-China trade deal is expected to include a U.S. pledge to scrap tariffs scheduled for Dec. 15.
""Any kind of uncertainty there, with the market at all-time highs, and it's easy for traders and institutions to press the sell button and take some money off the table,"" said Alan Lancz, president, Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc, an investment advisory firm, based in Toledo, Ohio.
The latest batch of earnings offered some upbeat news. 
The S&P 500 technology index (SPLRCT) ended up 0.7%, with shares of  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) up 6.3% after it forecast current-quarter profit above analysts' estimates.
Together with Qualcomm, other chipmakers, which have a sizeable exposure to China, also rose, propping the Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX) up 0.7%.

The day's gains resumed the recent record run for stocks, which have been bolstered, along with trade deal hopes, by some upbeat earnings.
""Corporate earnings, while down year over year, are better than many had expected, and that's a plus,"" said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist of Bruderman Asset Management in New York. 
Also on Thursday, Ralph Lauren Corp (N:RL) surged 14.7% after it topped second-quarter profit expectations, helped by a tighter control on expenses and strong demand for its Polo shirts and tweed jackets in China and Europe.
On the down side,  Expedia  Group Inc (O:EXPE) plunged 27.4% as the online travel booking company missed quarterly profit estimates.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.06-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.09-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 54 new 52-week highs and five new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 118 new highs and 85 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.92 billion shares, compared with the 6.83 billion-share average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Investing.com – Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) lowered its full-year earnings guidance after reporting mixed second-quarter results as earnings missed, but revenue topped estimates.
For 2020, the company lowered earnings to a range of $3.38 to $3.63 a share from $3.71 to $3.96 a share, previously. That was short of S&P Capital IQ consensus for earnings of $4.04. But bookings, a key measure to gauge the performance of video-game companies, was raised to a range of $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion from $2.60 billion to $2.70 billion. 

The firm reported earnings per share of $0.63 on revenue of $950.5 million. Analysts polled by Investing.com expected EPS of $1.69 on revenue of $921.77 million. That compared to EPS of $1.52 on revenue of $583.42 million in the same period a year earlier. The company had reported EPS of $0.27 on revenue of $422.24 million in the previous quarter.
Net bookings, the number of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically, grew 63% to $950.5 million, driven by games such as NBA 2K20 and NBA 2K19; Borderlands 3; Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V; Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online; Social Point’s mobile offerings; and WWE SuperCard and WWE 2K19. 
""The third quarter is off to a solid start with the launches of The Outer Worlds, Red Dead Redemption 2 for PC and WWE 2K20, and we will bolster our holiday line-up with offerings for Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Stadia and Sid Meier’s Civilization VI for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,"" the company said.

207,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 04:19PM ET</span>",GM sells shuttered Ohio plant to EV truck start-up,"By David Shepardson
(Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) confirmed on Thursday it has sold its shuttered Lordstown Assembly plant in Ohio to a start-up that has an ambitious plan to begin building electric pickup trucks by the end of 2020.
Lordstown Motors Corp, which is 10% owned by Workhorse Group Inc, has retained Ohio investment bank Brown Gibbons Lang & Co and is working to raise additional capital, Lordstown Chief Executive Steve Burns said in an interview. Workhorse shares closed up 27% on the news.
The fate of the northeastern Ohio plant has become a lighting rod in the 2020 presidential election after GM announced in November 2018 its planned closure, drawing condemnation from U.S. President Donald Trump and many U.S. lawmakers. The fate of the plant, which ended operations in March, remained uncertain until the Detroit automaker reached a new contract with the United Auto Workers union last month.
The company has been working on the engineering of the new truck called Endurance and hired Rich Schmidt, a former director of manufacturing at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, as chief production officer.
GM said Thursday it believes ""LMC’s plan to launch the Endurance electric pickup has the potential to create a significant number of jobs and help the Lordstown area grow into a manufacturing hub for electrification.""
GM is not investing in the venture. The purchase price was not disclosed, but sources said it was similar to EV start-up Rivian Automotive LLC's 2017 acquisition of a former Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Illinois, for $16 million. Burns said the company got a ""great deal"" after 10 months of talks with GM.
Burns, a former Workhorse CEO, said the company has been working on engineering the new truck for the last six months but acknowledged the timetable is ""aggressive."" However, he said the company has the advantage that the Ohio plant is ""fully intact, still warm.""
Burns hopes to have pre-production prototypes coming of the assembly line by April and start production by November 2020 with 400 hourly workers to start.
""When you live in a factory area and the factory closes, there is a lot of pain there,"" Burns said, saying it wants to build a company for the long term. ""This should be the electric epicenter of the Midwest if you do it right.""
Burns declined to say how much money the company has raised but said they have raised enough to hire the management team and engineers and acquire the factory. He said ""the serious"" effort to raise additional financing began on Thursday, and he is looking for new strategic investors.
The fate of the 6.2-million-square-foot Lordstown plant has been a major focus for Trump, who in June 2017 advised workers in nearby Youngstown, Ohio, that factory jobs were not leaving. “Don’t move, don’t sell your house,” he said.

GM last month said it plans an electric battery cell plant near the Lordstown complex that could eventually employ 1,000 people. Sources have said the battery plant would be a joint venture, where the workers are represented by the UAW and earn in the range of $15 to $17 an hour.

208,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 04:19PM ET</span>",Juul Labs to stop sales of mint-flavored nicotine pods in U.S,"By Chris Kirkham
(Reuters) - E-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc will immediately stop selling its mint-flavored nicotine cartridges in the United States, the company said on Thursday, after new signs that the mint variety is increasingly popular among teenagers.
Research released this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that mint was by far the most popular flavor among U.S. 10th and 12th grade Juul users, with more than 40% saying it was the most frequently used variety of nicotine pod.
One of the studies also showed Juul e-cigarettes were by far the most popular of any brand used by high school and middle school students, with nearly 60% of high schoolers and 54% of middle schoolers saying Juul was their usual brand.
Juul Chief Executive K.C. Crosthwaite called the results of those studies ""unacceptable"" in announcing the move.
""We must reset the vapor category in the U.S. and earn the trust of society by working cooperatively with regulators, Attorneys General, public health officials, and other stakeholders to combat underage use,"" said Crosthwaite, who took the helm in September after serving as a top executive at Marlboro maker  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc, which has a 35% stake in Juul.
Over the last year Juul has scaled back the number of flavors it offers to stave off mounting pressure from regulators over the surging popularity of its products with teenagers. 
The company said last year it would pull popular flavors such as mango, cucumber and fruit from retail store shelves in the United States, leaving only tobacco, mint and menthol flavors in traditional retail outlets but still selling others online.
Last month Juul announced it would also stop selling fruit- and dessert-flavored nicotine pods online in the United States.
The studies released this week suggest those efforts have not reduced Juul's popularity among teenagers.
The percentage of high schoolers using e-cigarettes increased to 27.5% this year, up from 20.8% last year. Moreover, data from one of the new studies suggest that mint and menthol flavors have taken the place of fruit- and candy-flavored nicotine liquids this year, after Juul restricted retail sales of flavors except mint, menthol and tobacco last fall.
Use of mint or menthol flavors increased among high school e-cigarette users between 2018 and 2019, growing from 38.1% to 57.3% this year, according to the analysis. Use of ""fruit"" or ""candy, dessert or other sweets,"" on the other hand, declined this year. 
Juul said on Thursday it will stop selling mint nicotine pods online in the United States immediately, and stop accepting new orders for mint cartridges from retailers. Juul still sells mint and other sweet flavors in international markets. 
The move comes as the Trump administration is considering a ban on all e-cigarette flavors except tobacco. President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced the plan in September and said a final decision would be made ""in the coming weeks."" 
No final decision has been announced. After that announcement, Juul CEO Kevin Burns stepped down and was replaced by Crosthwaite, who said the company would refrain from lobbying the administration on the proposed flavor ban.
Meredith Berkman, co-founder of Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes, said on Thursday that Juul's move was ""too little, too late,"" adding that she expects teenagers will simply flock to menthol-flavored e-cigarettes if mint is removed from sale. 

""If you really cared, you would include menthol,"" she said. ""That's where the kids will go. Everyone knows it.""

211,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 04:07PM ET</span>",Juncker says Trump won't impose tariffs on European cars: Sueddeutsche,"BERLIN/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker does not believe U.S. President Donald Trump will impose tariffs on imported European cars next week, he told Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
""Trump is going to make some criticism, but there won't be any auto tariffs,"" Juncker told the Sueddeutsche in pre-released extracts of an interview to run in its Friday edition. ""He won't do it. ... You are speaking to a fully informed man.""
The U.S. Commerce Department declined to comment.
Juncker's comments were the most definitive sign to date that Washington will hold off on imposing tariffs on imported vehicles that would have a huge ripple effect on European carmakers and many suppliers in the United States.
The United States must decide by Nov. 14 whether to impose threatened U.S. national security tariffs of as much as 25% on vehicles and parts under a law known as Section 232. The tariffs have already been delayed once by six months, and trade experts say that could happen again.
Matt Blunt, who heads a trade group representing General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (N:FCAU), said on Thursday the group remains ""opposed to the imposition of Section 232 tariffs on automobiles or parts. It would be harmful to the economy and the auto industry.""
The United States has already signed trade deals with Japan and South Korea that appeared likely to stave off auto tariffs, but its talks with the EU have been moving forward more slowly.
Trump last month said Washington continued to talk with the EU about trade, but aimed to avoid imposing broader tariffs for now.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also lauded increased investment by European carmakers in the United States. Those remarks have given EU diplomats hope for another reprieve.
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, a critic of the Trump administration's declaration of auto imports as a national security threat, told reporters on Wednesday that he expected the threatened car tariffs to be delayed again.
He said the administration had not responded to his request to see the full report on the issue. ""I think they're embarrassed to make public what the report actually says,"" he said.
One European diplomat said discussions were heading in the right direction, but cited concern that Trump could abruptly change his mind at the last minute.
Germany's BMW AG (DE:BMWG), the biggest U.S. automotive exporter by value for the past five years, last month said it had warned U.S. officials that intensifying a global trade war could threaten jobs at its plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, which exports about 70% of its production.
Both BMW and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) have invested to expand the production capacity of plants in the United States where they build mainly larger sports utility vehicles (SUVs) to keep up with rising demand and because it makes good economic sense.
Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) in January pledged to invest $800 million and add 1,000 jobs to build electric vehicles in Chattanooga, Tennessee."

213,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 03:14PM ET</span>","Fannie, Freddie government lifeline cut could cause economic pain: DoubleLine","By Megan Davies and Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration's aspiration to end government control of  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC) is unlikely to be realized anytime soon, and any weakening of the long-standing government backstop of the mortgage market could hurt housing and the wider economy, said a top investor.
While ending the support would benefit the government, there would be a chain reaction if the costs of mortgage lending were to increase, said Andrew Hsu, portfolio manager at DoubleLine Capital, the investment manager headed by Jeffrey Gundlach. That could, in particular, hit millennials, who are already struggling to buy homes as lending standards have increased since the financial crisis of 2008.
""Our base case expectation is that this process doesn't move forward anytime soon,"" said Hsu, who is co-portfolio manager of the DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund (O:DBLTX) and is a longtime investor in mortgage securities. ""It is a very complex process and there would be a lot of ramifications if this were to occur.""
Hsu, speaking at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook 2020 Summit in New York, said that such a move ""would be ultimately quite negative for the housing market and the broader economy in general.""
""Housing is one of the stars of our economy right now.""
The White House in September said it wants to take Fannie and Freddie out of government conservatorship. The U.S. government took direct control of the companies in the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis.
""Ending the conservatorship and essentially shifting some of these practices away into private markets potentially creates frictional costs, and these frictional costs will be passed on to the borrower,"" said Hsu.
Hsu said that transitioning from the GSEs into private markets will spur private lending in the mortgage space and would increase the size of the private non-agency mortgage market.
The DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund is DoubleLine Capital's largest fund with $56 billion in assets, invested in products such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) and asset-backed securities (ABS). DoubleLine Capital manages $147 billion in total assets.
In mortgage securities, Hsu said DoubleLine is actively involved in nonperforming and reperforming loans - meaning loans that were previously delinquent but have become current again. There are a finite number of these private-label loans, so volume is lower than agency-backed securities - high single digit to low double digit billions a year in issuance, said Hsu.
Hsu said that the credit risks posed by the current record-high levels of corporate debt have led them to reduce their position in CLOs. They have moved instead into agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) as well as asset-backed securities.
There are currently opportunities in CMBS as they are less susceptible to the risk that borrowers will refinance when interest rates fall. They are adding to their position in ABS ""because from a spread perspective we thought they were more attractive."""
214,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 03:13PM ET</span>",A 90-minute cut: shorter trading day comes with costs,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - A proposal to shorten trading hours on Europe's stock exchanges could help to boost liquidity and would have far-reaching benefits for the industry's hard-working traders.
But a proposed 90 minute reduction in the trading day could also drive some business away from Europe's main stock exchanges into so-called dark pools, trading venues which are less transparent and which regulators have been trying to curb.
Banks and fund managers on Thursday have proposed shortening the trading day in Europe to 7 hours from current 8-1/2 -- one of the longest in the world.
The  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE), which has said it will consider the proposals, has been operating its FTSE 100 index (FTSE) from 0800 London local time to 1630 for the last twenty years.
In 1999, the FTSE started trading one hour earlier to synchronise its trading hours with rest of Europe but Thursday's proposal recommends a reversal of that.
The new hours would mean a 30 minute reduction in an overlap with the United States' stock exchanges, which analysts and industry experts believe could be detrimental for the LSE, Europe's leading stock exchange as well as for its continental European rivals.
""London's great strength is overlapping both the Asian and U.S. trading hours,"" said Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James. ""I think the current set up is about right.""
But the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), a banking industry body, said the shorter hours would improve liquidity which has been hit by the growth of passive and index-tracking funds.
The popularity of passive investing is draining liquidity in Europe's $11.1 trillion equities markets as products like exchange-traded funds and hedge funds use end-of-day prices set during the exchanges' closing auctions for their daily pricing.
This means the final five minutes of trading has become the busiest time of day for stock market traders with a third of a day's average trade volume going through in the final hour.
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/4751/4713/closing%20auctions.png
""Shortening the hours would concentrate liquidity leading to more consistent trading costs and provide greater time for traders and the market to digest corporate announcements,"" AFME and the UK-based Investment Association said.
AFME's argument on liquidity is largely supported by the industry, but there are also concerns that shorter hours could drive more business into off-market venues known as dark pools.
This would hinder the European markets regulator's efforts to curb off-market trading, where trades do not contribute to price formation and there is less transparency. 
These off-market trading venues have become popular because they can allow large investors to avoid prices moving against them when they execute big stock trades.
""Shorter trading hours can drive trading liquidity to off market venues,"" Bilal Hafeez, CEO of MacroHive, a macro research and strategy firm based in Britain, said.
""With market making costs going down thanks to the rise of algorithmic trading and more market moving news such as trade and politics coming outside market hours, shorter trading hours is not ideal.""
In July, trading in such off-market venues accounted for 9.6% of all on-exchange activity, according to data compiled by capital markets advisory firm Tabb Group. This was its highest level since the European Union rules aimed at increasing transparency in financial markets came into effect in Jan. 2018.
Ben Springett, Head of European Electronic and Program Trading at Jefferies, said off-market venues could increase the competitive pressure by opening earlier and closing later than the main markets and that this would be counter-productive.
""The crucial aspect would be to retain relative harmony across the various European primary exchanges and alternative venues,"" Springett said. 
For hard-working equity sales traders the cuts would give them some breathing space to prepare for the early morning rush.
""We all get in earlier than the open. But to have an extra hour to prepare would mean a way less frenetic rush premarket to gather, digest and inform on the news and issues that really matter,"" said Mark Taylor, sales trader at Mirabaud, a broker.
The shorter hours could help boost diversity in the industry.
The Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates share trading in Britain, said last month the number of women in senior financial roles had flat-lined since 2005 despite the sector's ""rhetoric"" on diversity, with broking firms faring worst.
""I don't think anyone working in this industry could see this move (shorter trading hours) as negative because we all work extra-long hours,"" said a female sales trader at a European bank, who declined to be named. ""Our day is 11 hours long not eight as they say.""

215,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 03:08PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Freddie Mac hires McKinsey to review capital with government overhaul looming,"By Michelle Price and Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Housing finance giant Freddie Mac has hired management consultancy McKinsey & Company to advise on capital management, a spokesman said Thursday, as Freddie and its regulator start the long process of overhauling the firm and ultimately removing it from government control.
""After a competitive ... process, Freddie Mac retained McKinsey to conduct a gap assessment of our capital management capabilities and develop a roadmap to address any issues. This four-month engagement will begin in December,"" said a Freddie Mac spokesman in a statement to Reuters.
McKinsey did not respond to requests for comment.
Hiring McKinsey is the strongest signal yet that Freddie is beginning to draw-up a long-term roadmap to overhaul its operations and raise capital as a precursor to eventually freeing itself from government conservatorship.
Freddie and its fellow government-sponsored enterprise Fannie Mae were bailed out in 2008 during the subprime mortgage crisis. While the pair have not yet gotten approval to raise outside capital, they have been urged by their regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, to shore up their operations to ensure they can function as standalone companies.
The pair, which guarantee over half of the nation's mortgages, are expected to eventually hire advisers to help them try and raise billions of dollars to rebuild their reserves, said Mark Calabria, director of the FHFA. 
He also has emphasized that the two companies need billions of dollars in additional capital before they can safely be set loose, to ensure any downturn in the housing market does not lead to their failures.
Fannie Mae did not respond to a request for comment. 
The FHFA is seeking its own outside adviser to build a ""roadmap"" for recapitalizing the firms, and hopes to announce the pick by the end of November. Calabria has said he expects the FHFA to hire its adviser before Fannie and Freddie hire their own for any capital raise so as to avoid any conflicts of interest.
In addition, the FHFA is working on a rule establishing new capital standards for them. Calabria expects to announce in the coming weeks if the FHFA will need to re-propose that capital rule, which he has said must be finished before the companies can begin raising funds, potentially through public stock offerings.
The pair were only recently permitted to begin rebuilding their reserves, with the FHFA announcing in September they could retain up to $45 billion in earnings.

The Trump administration has vowed to end the long-standing government lifeline, with the Treasury Department offering in September a set of recommendations for returning the pair to their standing as private companies.

216,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 02:50PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Sears says it has secured a $250 million lifeline, will close 96 stores","By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sears told Reuters on Thursday it had won a $250 million lifeline from lenders that include billionaire owner Eddie Lampert, and will close additional stores, as mounting losses strain the beleaguered U.S. department store chain's finances.
The new loan, put together in recent weeks, increases by roughly $100 million the $150 million of financing that Sears raised several weeks ago, said people familiar with the transaction, who were not authorized to discuss publicly some aspects of the deal.
Lampert, through his hedge fund ESL Investments Inc, has contributed a significant portion to the new financing, the people added. 
The financing and additional store closures reflect the continued difficulties Lampert has had in his attempt to return Sears to its glory days, when it was among the largest retailers and owned the tallest building in the world. 
Lampert combined Sears and rival chain Kmart more than 15 years ago, heralding the formation of a retailer with $55 billion in annual sales, but the company lost money almost every year over the past decade in the face of competition from the likes of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). 
Starting in December, Sears will close 96 stores, leaving the retailer with 182 locations, the company said in a statement. That is down from 425 stores Lampert acquired when he rescued Sears from bankruptcy proceedings in a $5.2 billion deal earlier this year. 
Sears recently closed on a deal to buy affiliated company Sears Hometown and about 414 of its stores, which sell lawn furniture and appliances. Following the planned closures, the combined retailer will have roughly 600 locations. Sears also owns Kmart discount stores, 45 of which will shutter during the December closings, one of the people said.
Sears said its owners have been ""working hard to position... for success by focusing on our competitive strengths and pruning operations that have struggled due to increased competition and other factors.""
Lampert contributed less than half the total amount of the new Sears financing, the people said. Hedge-fund Cyrus Capital Partners LP is among the other lenders, Reuters has previously reported. 
Sears is in the midst of an attempted turnaround after filing for bankruptcy protection in October 2018 after losing billions of dollars. Lampert, formerly the company's chairman and CEO, has bankrolled the retailer for years to keep it going but so far failed to return it to profitability. 
In addition to fewer shoppers, Sears remains mired in litigation with its old bankruptcy estate over terms related to Lampert's earlier rescue.

Those challenges have drained the company's cash coffers, risking a potential violation of terms of its other bank debt, the people said. That left Sears faced with the choice of raising additional money or potentially closing even more stores, they said.

217,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 02:33PM ET</span>","Roku Is Not Broku Despite Slump, Wall Street Says","Investing.com –  Roku  hit a wave of selling Thursday. But the opportunity to bag shares of the streaming-device company at an even cheaper price has prompted some optimism on Wall Street. 
 Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) shares slumped more than 15% by 3:05 p.m. ET (20:05 GMT) but they remained above their session low of $116.26 following mixed third-quarter results. Guidance was trimmed, but losses were not as bad as feared.
Roku reported a loss of 22 cents a share on revenue of $260.9 million, compared with consensus estimates from Investing.com for a loss of 28 cents on revenue of $256.11 million. A year ago, the company lost 9 cents a share on revenue of $173.38 million.
The plunge in Roku shares, however, has led some on Wall Street to get even more bullish on the streaming-device company.
Among the highlight of bullish calls, Rosenblatt Securities, which recently raised its price target on Roku to $159 from $134, said shares look ""more compelling"" following the sell-off.
In the midst of the optimism, however, one Wall Street analyst is hardly surprised by the magnitude of selling, warning that Roku may struggle to deliver blowout material beats that many expect. 
Ahead of the earnings report, investor expectations were running high that the company would deliver an outsized beat and raise, but the mixed fourth-quarter guidance has dimmed optimism somewhat. Pivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak said in a note.
The company raised its full-year revenue guidance to $1.106 billion, up 49% from a year ago. But it trimmed its forecast for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to $30 million to $35 million from an earlier range of $30 million to $40 million. 
“We are not surprised by the ... decline indication in the stock in the after-market as an undeniably rich 12+X ’20 revenue multiple simply does not leave a lot of room for anything but material beats,” Wlodarczak said in his note.
Despite Thursday's pullback, Roku's shares are up more than 290% for the year."
218,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 02:16PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Trump administration moves closer to easing gun exports,"By Mike Stone and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has passed a key milestone in a long-delayed rule change that would make it easier to sell U.S. firearms outside the United States, including assault rifles and ammunition, people briefed on the matter told Reuters.
The proposed rule changes, which would move oversight of commercial firearm exports from the U.S. Department of State to the Department of Commerce, could be enacted as soon as the end of this year, the sources said late on Wednesday.
The move by President Donald Trump's administration may generate business for gun makers such as American Outdoor Brands (O:AOBC) and Sturm Ruger & Company (N:RGR) while increasing the sale of deadly weapons abroad. A relaxing of rules could increase foreign gun sales by as much as 20%, the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) has estimated. 
While the State Department is primarily concerned with international threats to stability and maintains tight restrictions on weapons deals, the Commerce Department typically focuses on making it easier for U.S. companies to sell products overseas.
Since taking office, Trump has been a far more outspoken booster of U.S. weapons sales abroad than his recent predecessors, acting almost as a salesman for the U.S. defense industry, analysts have said. Any move that would boost arms sales is also likely to earn enthusiastic support from the influential National Rifle Association as Trump's re-election campaign heats up.
Critics, including some lawmakers and arms control advocates, have expressed concern that any easing of export rules could make powerful weapons of the type often used in U.S. mass shootings more accessible to criminal gangs and militant groups that Trump has vowed to fight.
""This change will undermine congressional oversight, exacerbate the risk of international gun violence, human rights abuses, and armed conflict, and put U.S. servicemen and women at risk from U.S. weapons that have fallen into the wrong hands,"" Rachel Stohl, a managing director at the Washington think tank the Stimson Center, said in a statement.
A review of the rules by multiple U.S. agencies including the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security concluded this week, the people said. Government records show the final rule was formally transmitted to the White House Office of Management and Budget on Oct. 23. 
This week's close of the interagency comment period was a key milestone that enables the Trump administration to put lawmakers on notice of the intent to transfer formal oversight to the weapons sales from State to Commerce. Top officials at both departments still need to sign off on the issue before legislators can be notified. 
Reuters first reported on the Trump administration's interest in the oversight shift in 2017 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-weapons-exclusive/exclusive-trump-administration-prepares-to-ease-export-rules-for-u-s-guns-idUSKCN1BU2N8. The action is part of a broader Trump administration overhaul of weapons export policy https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-drones-exclusive/exclusive-game-of-drones-u-s-poised-to-boost-unmanned-aircraft-exports-idUSKBN1CG0F4.
The effort to streamline U.S. small arms export controls dates back to an Obama administration initiative begun in 2009 that was never translated into policy.
""The move would reduce the regulatory burden and make industry members more competitive in the global marketplace with out reducing oversight,"" said Lawrence Keane, head of government and public affairs for the NSSF trade group, adding ""there is more oversight at the Commerce Department.""
Representatives from the Commerce Department and budget office declined to comment.
BEAT THE CLOCK
""The Administration continues to work through the interagency process with the Departments of State, Commerce, Homeland Security, Justice, and other stakeholders to reexamine longstanding polices and regulations to ensure that U.S. industries have every advantage in the global marketplace,"" a State Department spokesman said. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed legislation that would prohibit the transfer of firearms export oversight to the Department of Commerce. But the bill containing the language, an annual defense policy bill called the National Defense Authorization (NDAA), has not passed the Senate and is not yet law.
If the Trump administration moves to notify legislators of the planned change in the coming weeks, it could be enacted before passage of the NDAA, one of the people said. 
The Senate's version of the NDAA does not contain the same language as the House bill. The measure is being discussed by legislative staffs, the person said.

Domestic gun sales have risen in the past three months, according to estimates released on Tuesday by research consultancy Small Arms Analytics & Forecasting. Sales are flat at 10.8 million units when compared to the same period a year earlier, SAAF said in the estimate.

219,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 02:03PM ET</span>",Re-sale market drives hype around H&M designer collaborations,"By Sonya Dowsett and Anna Ringstrom
MADRID/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - As fast-fashion giant H&M (ST:HMb) pushes more designer tie-ups, some consumers are eschewing the long lines outside stores to buy the looks in the fast-growing resale market.
H&M has released 15 designer and brand collaboration collections to date in 2019 compared to 11 in the whole of last year. 
The latest is its collection of looks crafted in collaboration with Italian designer Giambattista Valli. Most pieces were sold out on H&M websites across Europe hours after launch on Thursday, including a ruffled red tulle evening gown priced at $549 and worn by model Kendall Jenner in H&M's high-profile ad campaign. 
But another marker for products' desirability is the resale market online. H&M restricted the sale of the Giambattista Valli collection to one of each item to stop shoppers buying clothes to immediately resell. 
""We are fundamentally positive about a secondhand market,"" H&M Creative Designer Ann-Sofie Johansson, who works on designer alliances, told Reuters in an interview.
""It's just when someone makes a business out of it that we don't like it,"" she said, referring to the practice of buying at the retail price and then flipping to make a profit, rather than selling pre-worn items at a later date.
At online fashion marketplace Poshmark, items from H&M's Giambattista Valli micro collection, released earlier this year before Thursday's main launch, sell for around five times more than the eponymous designer label itself, Poshmark said.
A long pink silk dress from that collection sold for $475 in May, shortly after it went on sale in H&M stores at a retail price of $299, one Poshmark listing showed.
Meanwhile, a Giambattista Valli shift dress from the designer's own ready-to-wear line is listed for less than $200 on California-based resale marketplace Tradesy - considerably less than the retail price of the H&M collaboration pieces - said Randi Eichenbaum, vice president of Tradesy product management.
On average, pieces from H&M collaborations sell 22 percent faster than pieces from brands' main labels, said luxury resale platform The RealReal, although some alliances are more highly-sought-after than others. 
Resale prices for H&M collaborations often start at or above H&M's original retail price, according to Sasha Skoda, head of womenswear at The RealReal.
SECOND-HAND
Designer collaborations have become increasingly common since H&M's first tie-up 15 years ago – including Japanese clothing chain Uniqlo (T:9983) with JW Anderson, Britain's Topshop with model Kate Moss and even Swedish homewares store IKEA with U.S. fashion designer Virgil Abloh.
What is new is that the resale market has sky-rocketed. The second-hand market for apparel is expected to double in the next five years to $51 billion, according to data gathered for online thrift store thredUP.
While some retailers limit purchases in order to curtail reselling at a profit, resales are integral to how teens and twenty-somethings shop, especially for sneakers and streetwear.
""It's become part of the game,"" said Marc Beckman, chief executive officer of DMA United, an agency that has brokered designer collaborations ranging from Karl Lagerfeld for Puma (DE:PUMG) to Tucker for U.S. chain store  Target  (N:TGT).
Adidas (DE:ADSGN) Chief Executive Officer Kasper Rorsted mentioned on Wednesday the fact that its recently-launched Blackburn Spezial shoe had sold for 50,000 euros ($55,225) on the resale market.
In a Stockholm H&M store at a pre-launch event on Wednesday, 20-year-old hotel worker Amel Zamouri said she had been aware of Giambattista Valli for some time and was excited to buy his designs at an affordable price.

""I am hooked on two gowns - the red one I tried on and the white one that has some ruffles on the shoulders and chest,"" she said.

220,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 02:03PM ET</span>",Roku tumbles 11% as Wall St. gives thumbs down to latest report,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Roku  Inc's (O:ROKU) stock tumbled 11% on Thursday after the video streaming company gave a quarterly report that Wall Street deemed not good enough to justify its sky-high valuation.
A major winner in the consumer shift away from cable television in favor of Netflix (O:NFLX) and other over-the-top services, Roku's stock remains up over 300% this year, even after Thursday's retreat.
Shares of the San Jose, California company, which reported a wider loss for the September quarter, are valued at an elevated 11 times revenue expected over the next 12 months, compared to a multiple of about 5 for streaming heavyweight Netflix, according to Refinitiv. 
""We applaud management for driving substantial growth on a sound business model. However, we think shares are currently overvalued and expect volatility to persist,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter warned in a client note on Thursday, maintaining his neutral rating.
Roku reported a September-quarter net loss and revenue that were better than analysts on average expected, according to Refinitiv. It raised its revenue guidance while trimming its outlook for adjusted EBITDA.
Competition in the streaming market is increasing rapidly, with Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) and Apple (O:AAPL) launching new services in November. AT&T Inc's (N:T) HBO Max and a new offering from Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) are expected to enter the market next year.
Reflecting growing competition in hardware used to deliver streaming services, Roku's stock tumbled 28% over three days in September after Comcast said it would offer internet customers a streaming media set top box for free.
As the streaming video market has become more crowded, Roku has shifted its focus from device sales to advertising, which is now the company's fastest-growing revenue stream. 
At least two analysts increased their price targets for Roku following its report, while Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris cut his price target, maintaining his ""buy"" rating.

Thirteen analysts recommend buying Roku's stock, while four are neutral and two recommend selling, according to Refinitiv. The analysts' median price target is $150, which is 20% above Roku's current price of $125.

221,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 02:01PM ET</span>","UPS liable for shipping contraband cigarettes in New York, damages reduced: court","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court found  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) liable to New York state and New York City for shipping hundreds of thousands of cartons of untaxed cigarettes, but reduced its payout for damages and unpaid taxes to about $97.6 million from $247 million.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan agreed with a trial judge that UPS violated a federal anti-cigarette trafficking law and New York's public health law by shipping the contraband cigarettes, which often came from Indian reservations.
In a 115-page decision, Circuit Judge Gerard Lynch wrote that UPS also violated its October 2005 Assurance of Discontinuance with the state not to ship cigarettes to consumers and unlicensed dealers, and that shielding it from liability ""would thwart the AOD's purpose.""
But the court also said the trial judge imposed excessive civil penalties, and should not have halved what Atlanta-based UPS owed for unpaid state and local excise taxes.
Civil penalties were lowered to $78.8 million from $237.6 million, while the tax payout doubled to $18.8 million from $9.4 million. New York state would receive about $58.8 million overall, and New York City about $38.8 million.
The vote was 2-1. The dissenting judge, Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs, would have set aside more of the payout. New York state and New York City originally sought more than $872 million.
UPS said in a statement that it may appeal, but was pleased that the ""unwarranted damages"" award was reduced significantly.
James Johnson, New York City's corporation counsel, in a statement said the decision was a ""big win"" for New Yorkers, and ""sent a powerful message to companies: Do not illegally transport untaxed cigarettes; it will cost you.""
The office of New York Attorney General Letitia James did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
State and city officials had accused UPS of having since 2010 shipped more than 683,000 cartons of untaxed ""contraband"" cigarettes to unlicensed wholesalers, unlicensed retailers and residences, often from smoke shops on Indian reservations.
Both sides had appealed from parts of the May 2017 award by U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest, which followed a non-jury trial. Forrest is now in private practice.
In January, UPS rival FedEx Corp (N:FDX) agreed to pay $35.4 million to settle three lawsuits by New York state and New York City over the shipment of untaxed cigarettes.
The case is State of New York et al v United Parcel Service Inc, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 17-1993, 17-2107, 17-2111."

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian mid-sized lender  Banco Inter SA  (SA:BIDI4) on Thursday launched a smartphone app offering clients direct access to more than 60 stores selling products from appliances to sneakers to beauty products.
The launch marks Banco Inter's latest move beyond its existing free checking accounts to lure more clients and increase profitability by becoming a one-stop shop for everything.
Among its retail partners are Alibaba's (N:BABA) AliExpress, Lojas Americanas SA (SA:LAME4), Natura Cosmeticos SA (SA:NATU3),  Nike  Inc (N:NKE),  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) Brasil (SA:CRFB3) and HP Inc (N:HPQ).
Chief Executive Joao Vitor Menin said in an interview with Reuters that he expects the so-called super app to help the bank attract new clients, either at a faster pace or at a lower cost.
Menin said the bank could reach roughly 8 million clients by December 2020, more than double its current 3.3 million consumers.
The lender, in which SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) bought a 14.9% stake earlier this year, will share a portion of commissions from the third-party vendors on the app with its clients in the form of cash-back rebates. The commissions will also provide the bank a new revenue stream.
Some analysts still doubt whether such multi-function apps, widely used in China and elsewhere in Asia, will catch on in Latin America's largest economy.
""A bank's app is one that people use more recurrently,"" he said. ""So we believe clients will buy products and services through Inter's app. It will prove to be easier.""
Banco Inter posted on Wednesday a 38.1% drop in third-quarter net income from a year earlier, to 11.8 million reais, as expenses rose at a faster pace than revenues"
223,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 01:41PM ET</span>",T. Rowe Price's McPherson sees green light for value stocks,"By April Joyner and Ross Kerber
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Economic uncertainty has held back value stocks, but fund manager Heather McPherson of T. Rowe Price Group Inc (O:TROW) sees plenty of opportunity to scoop up undervalued shares, including in the financial and utilities sectors.
Among her picks are American International Group Inc (N:AIG),  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) and CenterPoint Energy Inc (N:CNP), she said on Thursday at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook 2020 Summit in New York.
Shares of AIG, along with other property and casualty insurance companies, are poised to rise as concerns related to climate change and litigation drive up pricing, McPherson said. She cited California wildfires and opioid lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies as among events boosting insurers' pricing power.
""We're seeing the best pricing that we've seen in 15 years,"" she said.
McPherson manages T. Rowe's $750 million U.S. Large Cap Value Equity Fund and helps run a $22 billion strategy with a similar mandate for institutional investors.
(For other news from the Reuters Global Investment Outlook 2020 Summit, click on https://www.reuters.com/summit/investment20)
At a time when net deposits in the mutual funds industry have shifted strongly to passive index products with low fees, McPherson takes a traditional approach, looking for undervalued companies.
Though some of her holdings have underperformed, she sees the tide turning as the industrial sector of the U.S. economy improves and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy remains accommodative.
""It feels a little bit different here,"" she said. ""In the mix of that, though, is a lot of regulatory and political uncertainty, which we're trying to use as an opportunity to buy good companies.""
For McPherson, one such bet is Wells Fargo, the top holding in her fund as of Sept. 30. She said the San Francisco-based bank is well-positioned to finally move beyond a sales practices scandal.
Shares of Wells Fargo were at $54.20 in afternoon trading on Thursday, below the $65 range they reached in early 2018 but above their close of $43.38 on Aug. 15, before Chief Executive Charlie Scharf took over.
The shares represent ""one of the best risk-rewards in this space. We think they are coming out of the penalty box,"" McPherson said.
Another position in McPherson’s fund is utility CenterPoint Energy Inc (N:CNP) of Houston. Its shares are lower than they were on Feb. 1 when it completed its merger with Indiana-based Vectren Corp.
The deal should help CenterPoint because it will increase the share of its operations focused on power generation, and reduce the impact of its stake in a pipeline company that has turned off investors, she said.
""We're trying to find these idiosyncratic ideas that look cheap,"" she said."

LONDON (Reuters) - British long-dated government bond yields rose to their highest in more than three months on Thursday as a global improvement in risk appetite and the prospect of big increases in public spending overshadowed a more dovish Bank of England.
Ten-year gilt yields (GB10YT=RR) peaked at 0.814%, up around 9 basis points on the day and the highest since July 16, and 20- and 30-year yields gained a similar amount (GB20YT=RR) (GB30YT=RR).
By contrast, two-year yields (GB2YT=RR) barely budged -- pinned down by an unexpected split vote at the Bank of England -- and the two-year/10-year yield curve rose to its steepest since July 15 at 24 basis points.
The steepening yield curve reflected countervailing forces at play for different maturities of gilts.
Markets received a shock earlier in the day when two BoE policymakers unexpectedly voted to cut rates, and the majority said a rate cut could become necessary if Brexit uncertainty and a global slowdown did not ease.
One measure of interest rate expectations now prices in a two thirds chance of a quarter-point BoE rate cut by the end of next year, compared with just over half on Wednesday, pushing down on two-year and five-year gilt yields, which are already well below the BoE's 0.75% Bank Rate.
But the broader tone in markets on Thursday was negative for fixed income assets, bolstered by increased optimism about a trade deal between the United States and China.
German 10-year Bunds , like their British counterparts, rose to their highest since mid-July.
And for longer-dated gilts, there was added upward pressure on yields from the second day of Britain's election campaign, in which both the Conservative Party and the Labour opposition promised big increases in spending if they win the Dec. 12 vote.
The fiscal news was ""arguably more significant"" for gilts than the BoE decision, Capital Economics analyst Oliver Allan wrote in a note to clients.
Labour's would-be finance minister, John McDonnell, promised an extra 150 billion pounds ($192 billion) of infrastructure spending during the next five years, on top of 250 billion pounds he has already promised for the coming decade.
McDonnell's Conservative counterpart, Sajid Javid, said he would spend an extra 100 billion pounds.
Both plans would require a significant increase in gilt issuance over the medium term, and could push up inflation or BoE rates if the spending hits the economy at a time when it is close to full capacity.
However, Capital said it expected the increase in British yields to be limited as any significant rise would attract foreign investors at a time when yields on much euro zone debt are below zero.
""Although UK yields are low historically, they are not particularly low relative to those elsewhere in the developed world,"" Allen said."

Investing.com – Throughout Netflix’s journey to streaming dominance, famed short-seller Citron has been quick to douse overzealous investor optimism. But in a surprising move, Citron ditched its short-seller mandate and joined the chorus of bulls, urging traders to go long Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).

Much of the optimism from the call on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has to do with the streaming giant's strong content slate and international growth, both of which could boosts shares back to $350, according to Citron. Netflix rose 1.7%. 

Citron sent a tweet, keeping its penchant to opt for dramatics when making a call on Netflix.

In January, when shares were trading above $300, the short seller said investors buying into the streaming company at that level were as “blind as Bird Box,"" referring to Netflix's original feature film ""Bird Box,"" released in December last year.

International business has grown in importance for the company as many believe it may be nearing peak U.S. subscriber growth.

In its second quarter, Netflix added 500,000 subscribers in the U.S. and 6.8 million international customers.

Netflix is also facing a ramp-up in competition, which will likely rein in some of its dominance.

Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) is by far the biggest threat, with the launch of its Disney+ streaming service next week.

The Disney+ threat will come under the spotlight later today, when Disney releases third-quarter results and will likely offer more commentary on its streaming platform.

Some have labeled Disney+, the Netflix killer, but many expect the latter will keep its position on the streaming throne.

But Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has a plan.
""We plan on taking spend up quite a bit,"" Hastings told attendees at the New York Times' DealBook conference Wednesday.

Hastings did concede, however, that consumers will spend dollars on rival streaming platforms, but ultimately most of their time would be spent on Netflix.

Netflix is up about 9% for the year so far and has an average price target of $364, according to consensus estimates from Investing.com. "

Samir Assaf, HSBC's global banking and markets division head, told senior bankers on a conference call on Tuesday of the issue, said the source, adding the weaknesses had been identified during routine regulatory work.
HSBC has been dogged by compliance problems, with the most high profile scandal involving helping Mexican drug cartels launder money, leading to a $1.9 billion U.S. settlement in 2012.
A Department of Justice deferred prosecution agreement ended five years later, after HSBC invested hundreds of millions of dollars in compliance measures.
The PRA compliance issue adds to HSBC interim chief executive Noel Quinn's workload as he begins a costly overhaul to address sluggish European and U.S. performances."

231,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 12:58PM ET</span>","T-Mobile in talks with Sprint on merger, does not rule out lower price","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - T-Mobile US (O:TMUS) Chief Executive John Legere on Thursday acknowledged talks are ongoing with Sprint Corp (N:S) to extend their merger agreement, but he declined to rule out requesting the $26 billion price be reduced.
The T-Mobile-Sprint deal, announced in spring 2018, has won regulatory approval from the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission but faces a lawsuit from more than a dozen state attorneys general seeking to stop the deal. The previous merger agreement expired last week.
""What I can say is yes we are having conversations as partners about whether and how long we move forward the date... and what if any items should be agreed between the parties in exchange for agreeing to extend those terms,"" Legere said during a webcast to discuss next generation 5G wireless and other issues.
""It's not a hostile conversation. It's an active one,"" he said, while giving no sense of when agreement might be reached.
""It’s sort of like going to month-to-month on your rent. There’s no more lease. You continue to move forward.""
Sprint said it was not backing away. ""We continue to be committed to completing the merger with T-Mobile,"" Sprint spokeswoman Lisa Belot said in an email. 
Legere said a new merger agreement's terms could entail ""'How do you handle things that have happened that need to possibly to be indemnified, how do you agree on future things that you will share in order to settle the deal, etc.' It’s a broad array of things.""
Legere said his company had made settlement offers to the state attorneys general, who argue that a merger of the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers would mean higher prices for some of the poorest consumers. Legere said he sent them a new letter on Thursday. 
""We’ve had very frank discussions,"" Legere said. ""We have made settlement proposals as ways to continue those conversations."" 
The reference to a possible lower price for Sprint is another piece of bad news for Softbank Group, which owns a big chunk of the U.S. wireless carrier. Softbank took a hit with WeWork, which abandoned a public offering, and on Wednesday it announced its first quarterly loss in 14 years. 
Legere was speaking at an event to announce initiatives that he said were dependent on the merger proceeding: giving first-responders free access to 5G wireless; a plan to help children without access to the internet do homework; and a $15 per month prepaid service with unlimited talk, text and 2GB of high-speed smartphone data..

He also said the company planned to launch 5G services on Dec. 6.

LISBON (Reuters) - Apple Pay has attracted regulatory scrutiny as a result of several expressions of concern about the U.S. tech giant's mobile payment service, Europe's antitrust chief said on Thursday.
Margrethe Vestager's comments come after an EU questionnaire, seen by Reuters late last month, showed EU regulators had asked online merchants whether they had been told to use Apple Pay instead of competing services.
""We've been asking quite a number of questions because we get many many concerns when it comes to Apple Pay for pure competition reasons,"" said EU Competition Commissioner Vestager, without specifying who had expressed concern.
""People see it becomes increasingly difficult to compete in the market for easy payments,"" she told a news briefing at the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon.
In an interview with Reuters last year, Vestager said she might investigate Apple Pay if there were formal complaints. At least one party has gone to the European Commission with its grievance, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Apple Pay, which was launched in 2014 and is available in more than 50 countries including over 20 EU member states, marks Apple's (O:AAPL) diversification from sales of devices like iPhones and iPads.
Apple has previously said its payment system offers the safest solution in the market, as shown by the thousands of banks using it, and that iPhones offer users a choice of payment options, including credit and debit cards and bank apps.
Vestager, who retains the competition portfolio in the new Commission due to start work on Dec. 1, has gained a reputation as a tough enforcer especially against tech companies, handing out hefty fines and ordering them to change their practices.

In the next Commission she will have an expanded mandate which could see her take a more proactive role, including introducing new legislation to govern the technology sector.

Daley, who was named vice chairman of public affairs, will report directly to Scharf and joins the fourth-largest U.S bank from Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), where Scharf was chief executive officer prior to his latest assignment. 
""I am delighted to welcome Bill to Wells Fargo,"" said Scharf in a statement on Thursday. ""I have known Bill and worked with him for many years and know we will benefit from his unique background.""
Daley, who left BNY Mellon days after Scharf's exit, had previously served at the White House twice - he was Secretary of Commerce during the Clinton administration and was handpicked by Barack Obama in 2011 to be his chief of staff. In 2000, Daley also served as chairman of Al Gore's presidential campaign. 
Daley's appointment at Wells Fargo marks the first significant top-level hire under Scharf, an early sign that the new CEO may bring in more of his long-time lieutenants to the scandal-plagued bank. 
Wells Fargo is operating under a regulatory microscope, as it tries to rebuild its reputation with customers, investors and politicians after employee whistle-blowers revealed in 2016 that the bank had opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts.

Daley has previously served on the board of  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and has also served as a director at Merck and Co (N:MRK). He is also a past president of SBC Communications (N:T).

238,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 11:11AM ET</span>",Five new life lessons from Charles Schwab,"(The writer is a Reuters contributor; the opinions expressed are his own.)
By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK(Reuters) - When  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) stares intently at his smartphone, you can be sure of one thing: He is checking the stock market.
The 82-year-old has been in a heated love affair with stocks and capitalism ever since starting his brokerage back in 1971.
Schwab sat down with Reuters to talk about his latest book, ""Invested,"" in which he talks about the bumpy, winding, unlikely path that landed him where he is today.
A few key lessons he learned along the way:
1. While you’re young, get out there and work every job you can.
You might be surprised to learn some of the wacky gigs from Schwab’s teenage years: Plucking duck feathers, raising hens, collecting Coke bottles from under grandstands, driving a tractor at a sugar beet farm, working as an oilfield roustabout. Those early moments taught him as much about human nature as anything else in his career.
“Dealing with people on that level, you get a real understanding of them,” he said. “When I was working on the beet farm alongside Hispanic agricultural workers, they may not have been able to speak any English, but they were real people with real families and real feelings. I’ve been lucky to have experiences like that, and I think all parents should get their teenagers out doing that kind of stuff.”
2. Take the risk – even if you are not totally ready.
When trading commissions were first deregulated decades ago, no one – including Schwab himself – truly knew how a low-cost brokerage strategy was going to play out. But he went for it, and his current $7.8 billion net worth (according to Forbes) indicates how well that bet paid off.
His motto: “85% ready is good enough,” he says. “If you’re 85% of the way there, then make the decision to go for it. Hesitation doesn’t do anybody any good.”
3. Turn your weakness into advantage.
Many might not know that Schwab is dyslexic, and still reads slowly today. Even at 82, you can tell that his childhood experience cut him to the quick. “Dyslexia wasn’t even defined when I was a kid,” he said. “You were either slow, or stupid. People said things like, ‘Why don’t you do better? Just work harder!’”
But a remarkable number of people with learning differences, such as Virgin Group’s Richard Branson and Apple’s Steve Jobs, turned into extraordinary business leaders – perhaps because of that ability to look at things differently, process events in new ways, and see things others don’t see.
4. Do the hard things.
Another of his lowest career moments: When the Schwab board let go former Chief Executive David Pottruck. Not only because it was a delicate situation with a longtime colleague, but because it meant Schwab himself had to reassume the title of CEO.
“That was a really down time,” he remembered. “It felt like a fire hose of water coming at my head, becoming a CEO again at sixtysomething.” But a public company’s primary responsibility is to its shareholders, and even though it wasn’t comfortable or easy, Schwab did what he felt had to be done.
5. Do not think in terms of family dynasties.
Schwab has five kids and 13 grandchildren, so you might think that he envisions an army of next-gen Schwabs taking over the company after he’s gone. Not so.
“They have to follow their passions, whatever that might be,” he said. ""If you want to be a teacher, be a teacher. There’s no need for them to work in finance. In fact only one of my children is in the business - my eldest daughter Carrie, who runs our foundation. She actually started for us as a file clerk.”
For whoever ends up running the show, he hopes that this new book can be a sort of GPS, steering them in the right direction. “I know full well that there is an end zone out there for me someplace,” he quipped. “I wrote this so that employees and customers would know where we came from, and understand the values we talk about. Maybe it could be a kind of Bible going forward – for the next chapter, after I’m gone.”"

BERLIN (Reuters) - Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) announced plans on Thursday for more cost cuts and delivered better-than-expected results, sending shares higher even as a cabin crew strike posed a further challenge to the German airline's efforts to revive profits.
Lufthansa has reacted to competition from Ryanair (I:RYA) and easyJet (L:EZJ) by cutting costs and announcing a turnaround plan in June for its own budget airline Eurowings, which it said on Thursday was paying off as third-quarter figures beat forecasts.
The next round of cuts will target its Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines and Lufthansa Cargo businesses, it said.
Its shares, which have fallen 16% in the last year, were up 6.6% at 1515 GMT, making them the biggest gainer on the German blue-chip index (GDAXI) and putting them on track for their best day in a year.
The results were the airline's most bullish for some time, Bernstein analysts said.
""Capacity growth is benign in its home markets through winter, cost savings are ramping up, and we are getting signs of capacity and capex relief in 2020,"" they said.
The upbeat results come after rivals Ryanair and British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) gave lukewarm outlooks as the industry struggles with overcapacity and fierce competition over ticket prices.
On Monday, Ryanair said it expects further delays to its Boeing (NYSE:BA) MAX 737 deliveries and last week IAG said strikes its pilots had hurt quarterly profits.
Industrial action could be a major headache for Germany's largest airline too.
Cabin crew launched a strike over pay and pensions that will result in the cancellation of 1,300 flights on Thursday and Friday and affect 180,000 passengers. Trade union UFO has called for the walkout on what amounts to one in five of the carrier's planned 6,000 flights.
One day of strike action would cost the company an estimated 10 million to 20 million euros, finance chief Ulrik Svensson said. Even rumors of a walkout would deter customers, he added.
COST CUTS
The airline said quarterly adjusted earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) fell 8% to 1.3 billion euros ($1.4 billion), ahead of average analyst forecasts for 1.2 billion euros, while revenues rose 2% to 10.2 billion euros, also ahead of consensus.
On Thursday, it said slower growth at its competitors was helping to counter pricing pressures in Europe.
Lufthansa said the Eurowings plan was showing first results and it should achieve a margin of 7% in the longer term.
Lufthansa said it would seek additional annual cost savings at Austrian Airlines of 90 million euros by the end of 2021 that would include staff cuts, closing decentralized bases to focus on its Vienna hub and standardizing its fleet.
Spohr said 700-800 jobs would be cut at the Austrian airline.
""In an increasingly challenging market environment, it is more vital than ever that we consistently take every action within our influence and further reduce our costs,"" Svensson said.
""We have resolved several further measures to improve the performance of our only modestly profitable and even loss-making companies,"" he said.
Lufthansa said it would make changes to the route network at Brussels Airlines, streamline its administration and standardize its fleet.
It will cut the size of the fleet at Lufthansa Cargo, withdrawing all 10 Boeing MD-11 freighters by the end of 2020, and adding two Boeing 777Fs to the seven it already uses."
241,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 10:38AM ET</span>","Stung by WeWork, SoftBank boss Son charts more cautious IPO course","By Sam Nussey and Rocky Swift
TOKYO (Reuters) - Fresh from the WeWork debacle, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son says he now aims to be more cautious about the timings of IPOs, a shift that could squeeze the Japanese company's funding and increase its reliance on its lower-growth telecom business.
Son said SoftBank Group's (T:9984) $100 billion Vision Fund would now look to see companies list when they were closer to achieving profitability. 
""I have started to think we should be more cautious on timings for IPOs of companies like WeWork, Uber and Slack,"" Son said late on Wednesday after admitting to poor judgment over WeWork. His company spent more than $10 billion to bail out the startup after an IPO (initial public offering) attempt flopped. 
However, the billionaire boss stressed that several companies from the fund's portfolio would go public in both 2020 and the year after. SoftBank is counting on new listings to raise cash for its recently announced second Vision Fund, to which it has committed to invest $38 billion.
The slower IPO approach is likely to increase SoftBank Group's reliance on its telecoms unit SoftBank Corp (T:9434), according to analysts. The business accounted for nearly a third of the conglomerate's operating income in the last financial year.
While the telecom firm's income has helped insulate the group from losses at the Vision Fund, the unit is the smallest of the three main wireless operators in Japan, a rapidly aging market with limited prospects for growth. 
So despite being a globe-spanning business with ties to Saudi Arabia, Silicon Valley and Wall Street, SoftBank's fortune rests to large degree on a Japanese base of 23 million mobile subscribers, plus retail investors who snap up its junk-rated bonds aimed at fans of its SoftBank Hawks baseball team.
Son's comments about office-sharing firm WeWork were remarkable admissions for an executive well known for his ebullience.
""My investment judgment was poor in many ways,"" the 62-year-old said after SoftBank Group plunged to its first quarterly loss in 14 years on Wednesday, adding he had turned a blind eye to problems with WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann.
UBER & SLACK
WeWork was not the first setback involving SoftBank investments and stock market debuts.
Shares in ride-hailing app Uber Technologies (N:UBER) have fallen by more than a third since its listing. Shares of Slack Technologies (N:WORK), which develops productivity software, have tumbled by almost half.
Dan Baker, a director of equity research at Morningstar, said there was a gap between what private markets were willing to pay for these businesses and what the public market would pay. 
""If they are to delay IPOs then the company will be relying on the dividends from SoftBank Corp,"" Baker said. 
SoftBank Corp has committed to paying out 85% of its profits as dividends. As such, the telecom company is closely watched by investors as an indicator of the health of its parent.
SoftBank Group is also cushioned by a 26% stake in China's  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA), worth about $120 billion, which could be sold off if it needs to raise cash in a hurry. 
SoftBank Group has 5.5 trillion yen ($51 billion) in outstanding bonds and another 4 trillion yen in bank loans, according to Refinitiv data. Its weighted average cost of debt is 3.7%, the seventh-highest among all companies on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average <.N255>. 
Moody's calculations show the conglomerate's interest coverage ratio is 1.3, meaning group income is enough to service its debt, with some left over.
RARE BRIGHT SPOT
The telecom unit was a rare bright spot in SoftBank's earnings this week, reporting a 9% increase in second-quarter operating profit. In that July-September period, it contributed 284 billion yen ($2.6 billion) in operating income to SoftBank Group.
The wider group itself posted an operating loss of 704 billion yen, with its Vision Fund losing 970 billion yen.
In the year to March 2019, the telecom unit contributed 725 billion yen in operating income, accounting for 30 percent of the group's operating income. Much of the rest of the operating income was from largely paper gains from the Vision Fund.
It was unclear precisely how SoftBank Group's listings timeline would now be governed, but Son stressed that portfolio companies would remain active in the IPO market.
""There are companies in our group that have started making money or are about to make money soon,"" he said. ""For those companies, they make decisions, and we will support them. That's the case. So next year and the year after that, several portfolio companies every year should go public. 
""That's the direction that we will keep."" 
Testuro Ii, president of Commons Asset Management, which does not hold SoftBank shares, sounded a note of caution.
""Including Uber and WeWork, there are now many unicorns which have done IPOs but are struggling to make profits and whose valuations are being questioned,"" he added.

""So it is hard to see rapid improvements in the Vision Fund.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global private equity group KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) is targeting a record $15 billion for a new Asia-focused buyout fund, three sources with knowledge of the plan told Reuters.
Buyout groups including Bain Capital, Blackstone (N:BX), Carlyle (O:CG), and KKR are increasingly focusing on Asian investments as lower valuations and corporate restructuring throw up new opportunities in key markets.
KKR's fundraising will start in the first quarter of 2020, with the aim of achieving first close, an important milestone indicating the fund has crossed a minimum threshold and can begin making investments, by June, the people said on Thursday.
A spokeswoman for KKR in Hong Kong declined to comment.
The fundraising target and timeline for KKR's planned Asia-focused fund, which will focus on consumer, technology, and manufacturing firms across major markets including Australia, China, Japan, and India, have not previously been reported. 
These are countries where it has done large deals in the last few years, including its acquisition of Campbell Soup's (N:CPB) Australian snacks unit for $2.2 billion in July and Japanese car parts maker and KKR-owned Calsonic Kansei's purchase of Fiat Chrysler's Magneti Marelli for $7.1 billion.
KKR has already received interest for its planned fund from prospective investors, known as limited partners (LPs), including those who invested in its previous Asia funds, two of the people said. 
The fund size and fundraising schedule have not yet formalized and the plan is subject to change, said the people, who did not want to be named as the details are not public yet.
REGIONAL RECORD
An Asian fund of the size KKR is targeting would be the biggest raised by the New York-based firm, whose previous record was $9.3 billion in 2017. It would also be the biggest U.S. dollar-denominated private equity capital raising in the region.
Hillhouse Capital, an investor in top Chinese technology firms including Tencent (HK:0700) and Baidu (O:BIDU), last year raised a record $10.6 billion Asian fund.
A total of 92 funds have raised a combined $42.3 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated Asia funds so far this year, compared to $50 billion raised in the whole of 2018, Preqin data shows.

KKR is also raising capital for investments elsewhere and on Tuesday said it had closed its latest buyout fund European Fund V, focused on transactions in core Western Europe markets, at 5.8 billion euros ($6.42 billion).

245,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 09:06AM ET</span>",Special Report: How plaintiff lawyers help corporate America keep its secrets,"By Jaimi Dowdell and Benjamin Lesser
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Paula Lawlor was sifting through piles of internal General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) documents in a hotel room outside of Los Angeles when she hit pay dirt: Company records showing that GM knew for years that stronger roofs on its vehicles could save lives.
The year was 2000, and the researcher was helping a lawyer prepare a case on behalf of a young man who had been paralyzed when the Chevrolet Blazer he was driving flipped. It was one of thousands of lawsuits GM and other automakers faced over the years that claimed that the roofs of their vehicles easily crumpled in rollovers, resulting in severe injury and death.
GM invariably denied the allegations, arguing that roof strength made little difference. Now, Lawlor had in hand evidence to the contrary. Among other documents were 1980s test results showing that people wearing seatbelts in vehicles with stronger roofs were likely to suffer less severe injuries in a rollover.
Such evidence helped persuade a jury to award the plaintiff $15.4 million. But something continued to trouble Lawlor. Only a small fraction of the evidence was aired publicly at trial. Worse, to her mind, was that while dozens of plaintiff lawyers suing GM over roof-crush deaths and injuries had seen much of the same evidence over the previous decade, most of it remained hidden under court-mandated secrecy the lawyers had accepted.
In those 10 years, more than 5,000 seatbelt-wearing passengers died in GM rollover accidents, many more were injured, and the company was still pumping out new vehicles with similar roofs.
As Lawlor saw it, the plaintiff lawyers should have raised alarms. “If you see something so egregious, don’t you think you have a responsibility to do something?” she said.
Lawlor did do something. She embarked on a years-long campaign in and out of the courts to expose the evidence about GM vehicles’ roof strength — a personal mission that culminated in 2016, when tougher federal standards for vehicle roofs took effect.
The secrecy that prompted her to action, however, has remained pervasive in U.S. courts. And as Reuters found, plaintiff lawyers in big product liability cases are often complicit in perpetuating it. Their willing participation in a process that hides critical information about potentially harmful and even deadly products prevents consumers from making informed choices and regulators from taking corrective action.
“Far too many plaintiff lawyers miss the big picture about the good that can be done” by pushing for more transparency in court, said Drew Ashby, a plaintiff lawyer with The Ashby Firm in Atlanta.
That clashes with the image plaintiff lawyers cultivate as champions of transparency, fighting to hold corporate America accountable for making and selling harmful products. As the then-president of the American Association for Justice, the plaintiff bar’s main lobbying group, said in 2014: “Whether it’s dangerous cribs, defective drugs or exploding tires, court secrecy endangers consumers and allows corporations to hide wrongdoing. Americans have a right to know about hazardous and defective products.”
COMPETING OBLIGATIONS
Dozens of plaintiff lawyers told Reuters they feel compelled to go along with entrenched court secrecy. The main reason, they said, is their duty to their clients, as spelled out in state bar association rules. Many plaintiffs have suffered catastrophic injuries and other hardships and literally can’t afford to wait for disputes over what can and can’t be made public as bills mount. Of course, such delays can also be costly to the lawyers, who get paid only when a case is settled or decided in their favor.
“You have to balance the need … for an attempt at prompt resolution for the people who are actually the victims of the defendants’ conduct, and the need for public disclosure,” said Ellen Relkin, a New York plaintiff lawyer who has litigated several high-profile product liability cases.
Plaintiff lawyers’ interests are thus aligned with those of judges who want to keep the wheels of justice moving and of defendants — usually big companies — that prefer to keep details of their inner workings hidden.
As Reuters reported in June, judges regularly allow information pertinent to public health and safety to be filed under seal, even though court documents are, by law, presumed to be public. In nearly all jurisdictions, judges are required to provide an on-the-record rationale for allowing litigants to file information under seal — to protect trade secrets, for example, or an individual’s medical records — but they rarely do that.
In its analysis, Reuters found that information pertinent to public health and safety was filed under seal in 55 of the 115 biggest product liability cases consolidated in federal courts over the past 20 years. These mega-cases, known as multidistrict litigation (MDL), involved products used by millions of consumers.
The secrecy exacts a heavy toll. In just a handful of cases Reuters analyzed, hundreds of thousands of people were killed or seriously injured by allegedly defective products – including cars, drugs and guns – after judges allowed litigants to file under seal evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to potential danger.
It’s a measure of their role in maintaining court secrecy that in nearly all of the 55 big cases, it was plaintiff lawyers who filed the information under seal. That’s because of the way secrecy is baked into the process early on.
During pretrial discovery, when the opposing sides request information from each other to prepare their cases, the defendant usually won't give plaintiffs any information until they agree to a protective order. In theory, these agreements are meant to keep under wraps potentially damaging proprietary or personal information. But in many cases, nearly everything ends up being stamped “confidential,"" and plaintiff lawyers often just agree to the secrecy without complaint.
Later, when plaintiff lawyers begin filing motions or presenting their cases in court, the standard for imposing secrecy moves higher. Material obtained through discovery that is later submitted as evidence becomes part of the court record; as a matter of law, litigants must provide a reason for submitting such evidence under seal, and the judge must approve.
In most of the big MDLs, however, plaintiff attorneys actually cited the defense’s earlier claims of confidentiality to justify filing evidence under seal. Since judges rarely ask for a more specific rationale for the secrecy, documents marked as confidential remain so.
That’s true when the parties settle, which is how most product liability cases end. It can also be true after a jury decides in favor of the plaintiff. Sometimes, plaintiff lawyers even agree to keep evidence confidential that has already been aired in open court in other cases.
Lawyers who do fight secrecy seldom succeed. They challenged defendants’ claims of confidentiality for material relating to public health and safety in 23 of the 55 big cases Reuters analyzed. Judges nearly always refused to unseal the evidence.
A FAILED CHALLENGE
In a GM roof-crush case in the 1990s, Donald Friedman, a former GM engineer, served as an expert witness, analyzing the company’s crash test data. That and most of the other evidence cited in court was marked confidential. After a jury awarded the plaintiff $8.8 million, Friedman determined that everyone should be able to see what he had seen.
Acting on Friedman’s request, Thadd Llaurado, a lawyer on the case, challenged the sealing of GM’s records. After nearly a year of briefs and hearings, the judge turned down Llaurado’s request to lift the protective order.
""GM has shown that the testing information is of value to GM's competitors,"" the judge said in his 1993 decision. Among the records the judge kept under seal were about 10 exhibits that had been cited openly in the trial.
GM declined to comment on past roof-crush litigation. It said that in general, confidentiality safeguards under the law “have not been an obstacle to continuous improvements in safety.”
Yet potentially harmful flaws in many products remain secret years after the first lawsuits are filed. Overly broad protective orders are a big part of the problem, legal experts and plaintiff lawyers said. In 45 of the 55 big MDLs Reuters analyzed, the protective order allowed most any document to be marked as confidential.
One solution is for plaintiff lawyers to push for protective orders that more narrowly define what can be kept confidential.
The strategy worked for Eric Holland. In July 2018, his legal team won a huge victory when a St. Louis jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $4.7 billion to 22 women who had alleged that their ovarian cancer was caused by Baby Powder and other J&J talc products tainted with carcinogenic asbestos. J&J has appealed the verdict.
Holland told Reuters that many of the documents he thought revealed the full story about talc and asbestos hadn’t come out in the trial and were still deemed confidential. He thought they should be made public. In a separate talc case, he negotiated a protective order with J&J that limited what the company could mark confidential to trade secrets, personal information and the like.
The more specific order made public internal J&J documents showing that the company knew its talc had sometimes tested positive for asbestos. Scientists used that information in a presentation to U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials earlier this year. The agency has since said it may consider new rules to improve talc safety.
J&J, in a statement to Reuters, noted that it has made thousands of documents available for use in the courts and on its website. The company also said it “has continued to work with plaintiffs' counsel to negotiate appropriate protective orders to protect documents that contain confidential information.”
For help drafting the narrower protective order, Holland turned to Public Justice, a nonprofit organization that intervenes in cases to get court records unsealed. The group has developed a model protective order that lays out narrow definitions of what can be marked confidential and makes clear that simply marking a document as confidential is not a sufficient reason to later file the information under seal during court proceedings.
As the first and sometimes only people to know that potentially life-saving documents are being sealed, plaintiff lawyers should be the “first line of defense” against harmful secrecy, said Jennifer Bennett, a lawyer with Public Justice.
MASTERING ROOF CRUSH
Court secrecy wasn't on Paula Lawlor's radar when she stumbled into a job as a researcher for Michael Piuze, a Los Angeles personal injury and product liability lawyer who has notched big court victories against cigarette maker Philip Morris (NYSE:PM). Lawlor had been helping him on several different cases when he asked her in 2000 to focus on roof crush.
Piuze’s client was Robbie Lambert, who in 1990 fell asleep at the wheel of his Chevrolet Blazer, which veered off the road and flipped. Lambert was wearing a seatbelt, but the SUV’s roof crumpled inward. The then 18-year-old Lambert, who had just been named to the training team for U.S. Olympic hockey, was left a quadriplegic.
Lambert’s was only the latest among hundreds of lawsuits alleging that roofs on some GM vehicles were too weak to prevent serious injuries and deaths in rollovers. By then, thousands of people had died or been seriously injured in GM rollovers, though it’s impossible to determine whether roof crush was responsible.
Lawlor, a then-47-year-old mother of seven with no college degree, set to work transforming herself into an expert on all things roof crush. She networked with lawyers across the country, some of them sending her documents they had obtained in discovery in their own lawsuits against GM. Her home became a library of binders. She pulled all-nighters poring over documents. She talked about little else with her family.
“Coming home and not thinking about work, that’s not for her,” said Jennifer Preston, Lawlor’s daughter.
As Lawlor pieced together the material, a damning picture emerged: In the 1970s, GM and other automakers persuaded the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to weaken its originally proposed roof-strength standards – after GM vehicles failed to meet those standards in crash tests – but by 1990, GM had conducted its own tests showing that stronger roofs were safer.
The more she read, the more she came to “really understanding how they totally misled everybody all of those years,” Lawlor said.
As the trial date approached, Piuze’s team set up a “war room” where they met to discuss strategy, prepare motions and review discovery material to be used as evidence. And thus Lawlor found herself in that hotel room outside of Los Angeles in 2000, going through piles of more GM documents.
After her work helped Piuze win the $15.4 million verdict against GM in 2001, Lawlor still felt she had to do something. “People were dying,” she said.
“Paula knew more about roof crush than most experts and almost all lawyers,” Piuze said. The two had discussed challenging the protective order in the Lambert case, but “I didn’t have time to get involved in the crusade. I had a lot of clients to satisfy,” Piuze said. Still, Lawlor “had my blessing” to bring the full story to light, he said.
In 2003, she got her chance when she began working on a case for Los Angeles lawyer Garo Mardirossian. In 1999, Bing Lin Duan suffered traumatic head injuries when the Chevy Aerostar van his family had rented for a vacation rolled four times on a road near California's Sequoia National Forest. The roof caved in by 10 inches. Duan persisted in a vegetative state for about two years before dying from his injuries at age 65.
When Lawlor came to the case, NHTSA was seeking public comments on a proposal to strengthen its vehicle roof strength standards. The agency, analyzing its own data, had found that rollovers were the most dangerous types of crashes from 1995 to 1999.
Lawlor approached Mardirossian about using the Duan case to challenge the secrecy shrouding the GM litigation. He agreed with her plan.
She knew what to request from GM during discovery. She also knew that some of that information had already been used as exhibits in other trials, which should make them public. This included detailed results of tests GM conducted in the 1980s on Chevrolet Malibu cars — film, data and analysis showing that roofs stronger than the NHTSA standard resulted in less severe injuries in rollovers.
In court, GM and other automakers cited summaries of the Malibu tests that GM engineers published in 1985 and 1990 to argue that roof strength doesn’t matter in rollovers. The automakers also used the partial summary results to convince NHTSA that roof standards on the books since 1971 were sufficient.
GM continued to mark all of it – the published summaries and the test details – confidential under protective orders issued in other cases across the country.
“We all knew in the industry” about the tests, Madirossian said. “We just couldn’t talk about it freely.” Under the protective orders, lawyers could discuss the discovery material only with expert witnesses and others involved in the litigation.
In a motion filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in 2004, Madirossian argued for sharing the information with safety advocates and NHTSA. “The documents are fifteen to forty years old and are of no commercial value. Finally, all of them are of such paramount importance to the health and safety of the public as to outweigh any interest GM might have in keeping them confidential,” the motion said.
Judge Mel Red Recana ruled in favor of Mardirossian’s motion. Mardirossian estimates that the months-long effort to challenge the confidentiality cost about $100,000 in staff time. As the jury entered its second week of deliberation, the two sides settled. Terms weren’t disclosed.
Recana declined to comment.
The judge’s ruling freed Lawlor. With copies of GM’s records, she left Los Angeles in 2004 and, with her two youngest children, moved to be near the beach in San Diego to focus on her mission. On one of her frequent seaside walks, it hit her: Take the fight to Washington, D.C.
Money was tight, and she worried about how to pay for her efforts. Then, in 2006, her back was injured in a minor traffic accident, resulting in a legal settlement that paid her $70,000. “When I got the money, I was sure it was meant for me to do something big,” Lawlor said.
DELIVERED BY HAND
She flew to the capital to deliver more than 1,000 pages of GM’s records in person to a NHTSA clerk. In 2007 she gathered engineers, politicians, academics, victims, safety advocates and more for a meeting about roof crush in Washington. She launched a public information campaign that included strategically placed billboards.
In 2007, she co-wrote “Deadly by Design,” a self-published study on how automakers fended off stronger roof-strength standards. She sent it to NHTSA and lawmakers, and it was later quoted in a hearing before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.
She also volunteered with the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based consumer safety group, putting together reports detailing the history of the roof-crush controversy. The center was joined by Public Citizen and other advocacy groups in pushing NHTSA to upgrade roof-strength standards.
In 2009, NHTSA published a new minimum standard mandating that the roofs of all passenger vehicles be able to withstand three times their empty weight in tests, doubling the earlier requirement. The agency also changed testing procedures to more closely resemble real-world crashes.
At the time, the agency said the upgraded standard would prevent 135 deaths and more than 1,000 injuries a year. In 2010, the agency published a study that “confirms a relationship between greater roof strength and fewer injuries.”
In a statement to Reuters, NHTSA did not address Lawlor’s efforts or the importance of the documents she shared with the agency. “Safety-related information developed or discovered in private litigation is an important resource for NHTSA,"" the regulator said.
After the 2009 rule change, Lawlor took some time off and traveled to France, where she had a religious epiphany. These days, she leads pilgrimages to a holy site in southern France.
Starting in September 2016 — 16 years after Lawlor first came across the documents that launched her campaign — every passenger vehicle sold in the United States was required to adhere to the new roof-strength standard."

A spokesman from PIF declined to comment.
Kalanick, who was ousted in 2017 from the U.S. ride-hailing leader he co-founded after a series of scandals, is betting on so-called dark kitchens becoming a backbone for the rapidly expanding food-delivery market.
The idea is to let eateries add new business without needing to lease a traditional restaurant space.

Only slightly more than 10% of the 2,504 companies from a variety of sectors assessed the Swiss National Bank’s policy benchmark of -0.75% as positive, the bank said on Thursday. Even among exporters skeptics outnumbered proponents.
“One has to weigh the costs of the policy against the benefits,” UBS Switzerland Chief Economist Daniel Kalt said.
The SNB is one of several central banks to have cut interest rates below zero in an bid to stimulate the economy. Criticism of its policy, in force for the past four years to stem appreciation pressure on the franc, has been mounting of late. The Swiss Bankers Association last month called for negative rates to be scrapped because they were no longer fulfilling their purpose.
SNB President Thomas Jordan told newspaper NZZ am Sonntag in an interview that the franc is still highly valued, although not as strong as in the past, and that sub-zero rates are a key part of the strategy to prevent an appreciation.
Once the prospects for the Swiss economy improve, Kalt said it might be “worth a try to venture an exit” from negative rates even if the European Central Bank hasn’t yet raised borrowing costs."
250,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 07:19AM ET</span>","Facing shorter holiday season, U.S. retailers rev up faster delivery, early deals","By Aishwarya Venugopal and Nandita Bose
(Reuters) - U.S. retailers are rushing in with faster-than-ever delivery deals and earlier Christmas promotions in hopes of easing the impact of this year's shorter holiday selling season, a period that can be make-or-break for retailers.
Thanksgiving, the traditional kick-off of the U.S. holiday shopping period, falls on Nov. 28 this year, a week later than last year's Nov. 22, leaving retailers with six fewer days to drive sales between Thanksgiving and Christmas day. 
The last shortened shopping season was in 2013 - a year when retail chains and delivery companies scrambled to get packages to shoppers in time for Christmas. 
Retailers' urgency to avoid a repeat of 2013 is on full display as is the rush to compete with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which began rolling out free one-day shipping on over 10 million products in June.
The holiday season spanning November and December can account for as much as 40 percent of annual sales. 
""It's a very compressed holiday season...every day counts,""  Target  (NYSE:TGT) Corp's chief executive, Brian Cornell, said in October. 
For the first time, Target is offering its ""Drive Up"" service, which lets shoppers order on the Target app and have their items brought to their car, in all 50 states. The company said most orders will be ready within an hour and brought out in less than two minutes upon arrival. 
That will be in addition to free shipping with no minimum purchase, order pickup on online purchases and same-day delivery services. 
Similarly, Best Buy has promised free next-day delivery on thousands of items. And Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc is, for the first time, offering free next-day delivery on orders over $35 without a membership fee. 
""A shorter holiday season puts more importance on each shopping day,"" said Steve Sadove, senior adviser for Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and a former CEO and chairman of department store operator Saks Inc. Sadove said the sales outlook for the season remains positive despite the fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
Mastercard, which measures consumer spending across all payment types including cash and checks, expects U.S. retail sales, excluding automobiles, to grow 3.1% from a year ago between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24. 
The holiday deals deluge, which traditionally has started on the day after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday, has been starting earlier and earlier in November each year. This year such promotions began in mid-October due to the shorter season. For example, Walmart began offering holiday deals on Oct. 25.
Steep discounts on merchandise, typically visible just ahead of or immediately after Thanksgiving, are being offered by many companies. Online home retailer Wayfair is offering up to 70 percent off on top-selling items. Others like Amazon, Target and Kohls have already begun offering Black Friday deals. 
""Retailers will need to plant a sense of urgency early-on, then reinforce it after Thanksgiving, when the rubber meets the road,"" said Carol Spieckerman, president at consultancy Spieckerman Retail. 
To be sure, the deals and shipping offers do not necessarily mean shoppers will buy more, retail consultants said. The tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on Chinese imports, which have raised prices of many items, are weighing on sentiment, they said. 
Seventy-nine percent of Americans are worried that tariffs will make their holiday shopping more expensive, according to the National Retail Federation, a leading industry trade body. 
The tariffs on Chinese-made clothes, shoes and some electronics went into effect on Sept. 1. Another round of 15% U.S. tariffs, on consumer goods, is expected on Dec. 15.

A senior official of the Trump administration said on Wednesday that a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign a long-awaited interim trade deal could be delayed until December.

253,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 07:02AM ET</span>",Ford may consider making branded pickups in China if cities open more,"By Yilei Sun and Norihiko Shirouzu
SHANGHAI (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) will consider building Ford-branded pickup trucks in China if restrictions on driving pickups in cities are relaxed and it could also roll out customized models at that time, a senior company official said.
Ford was among foreign automakers exhibiting their wares this week at the China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai, a fair aimed at showcasing the country's free trade credentials.
Many of the vehicles that Ford, General Motors (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) put on show were pickup trucks, a segment of the Chinese market that has remained relatively resilient even as the overall industry braces for a second year of dipping sales.
Demand for pickups - both from traditional farm and construction-related customers as well as newer interest from general car buyers - has increased and last year China became the world's second-biggest pickup truck market.
But many big Chinese cities restrict pickups from entering their centers, an obstacle for sales growth. But some urban areas have relaxed the rules in recent years, boosting pickup sales. 
""If more areas relax restrictions on pickup trucks, we will plan to locally manufacture Ford-branded pickup trucks in China to meet the demands of Chinese consumers with considerations of the market situation,"" Joseph Liu, Ford's China vice president for product innovation, told Reuters on Wednesday.
The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker does not build Ford-branded pickup trucks in China, but its local partner, JMC (SZ:000550), in which Ford has a 32% stake, manufactures Yuhu series pickups with Ford technology.
Liu did not provide details about manufacturing plans or model specifications but said made-in-China Ford pickup trucks would be different from existing imported models, if and when Ford went ahead with the plans.
For instance, China-made pickup trucks would be of sizes that are suitable for China's roads and are less likely to have capacity for towing trailers as current policies limit that.
Other automakers at CIIE told Reuters this week they were there to test the waters. GM and FCA also displayed their new pickup models such as the Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra Denali, and Jeep Gladiator.
FCA representatives said the company planned to launch the Gladiator in China but was still working on adjusting the model to meet regulatory requirements on things like emissions.

A spokeswoman for GM said the company wanted to showcase American-style pickup trucks in Shanghai to get public opinion. She said, however, that GM had no plan to launch these models in China now.

255,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 06:35AM ET</span>",Uber faces costly choices after expert finds it uses Waymo self-driving tech,"By Paresh Dave
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber (N:UBER) said it ""will likely"" have to strike a licensing deal with Waymo or opt for costly changes to its autonomous driving software, after an expert found the ride-hailing giant still used technology from the Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) unit.
While it was unclear by when the company needed to decide on its next move in the blockbuster trade secrets dispute, Uber, in a quarterly securities filing on Tuesday, said that a detour in its software development ""could limit or delay our production of autonomous vehicle technologies.""
Uber has been racing to catch up to Waymo in the development of software and hardware to install in cars and trucks to allow for driverless taxi and delivery services. 
The expert review of Uber's software was part of a legal settlement reached in February 2018 that brought to an abrupt halt a federal jury trial over whether the company unfairly benefited from confidential ideas allegedly secured by making former Waymo engineers key members of its self-driving car team.
Waymo began as a project within sister company Google a decade ago, while Uber launched its effort four years ago. 
Uber declined to give details beyond its filing.
Waymo told Reuters in a statement that the independent software expert's findings ""further confirm Waymo's allegations that Uber misappropriated our software intellectual property. We will continue to take the necessary steps to ensure our confidential information is not being used by Uber."" 
Last year, Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi had expressed confidence that the company had not used Waymo's proprietary information in its hardware or software. 
But by this April, weeks ahead of its initial public offering, Uber disclosed that the expert software reviewer's interim findings were mixed and could be costly. 
Waymo had alleged in court filings in 2017 that Uber was ""misappropriating two, highly valuable Waymo trade secrets related to planner software,"" which processes data from sensors on the vehicle and controls its movement. 
Uber shares have tumbled about 40% since their market debut in May amid big quarterly losses as it spends heavily on marketing.
Its self-driving venture has also faced other challenges.
The United States National Transportation Safety Board in a recent report there were software flaws in an Uber self-driving test vehicle that struck and killed an Arizona woman in the middle of a road last year. 
Still, the Uber unit drew a $1 billion investment in April from SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and automotive company Denso Corp (T:6902).
Last year's settlement also gave Waymo a 0.34% stake in Uber, worth about $245 million based on Uber's $72 billion valuation at the time. 
It is unclear if Waymo still holds those shares. 

Waymo this year began a limited robo-taxi service in Arizona.

""We are interested to look at a restructured new Alitalia, if it makes sense to us and our shareholders, our staff and our customers due to the importance of the Italian market.""
On Wednesday, Alitalia's administrators said they had no preferred option between Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and Lufthansa, the two groups talking with rail operator Ferrovie dello Stato about a rescue for the Italian carrier.
Ferrovie, which is leading a state-orchestrated effort to rescue Alitalia, will have to choose between the two foreign carriers in the next weeks as the financial performance of Alitalia was deteriorating, the administrators said.
Delta and Lufthansa belong to rival respective airline alliances and are both interested in the lucrative Italian market, one of the world's top tourism destinations which is seeing good growth in foreign visitors.
Lufthansa wrote to Ferrovie recently offering a commercial partnership with Alitalia and saying it could take a stake in the carrier under certain conditions to be agreed with other partners.
Last week, sources close to the matter said Lufthansa is ready to invest up to 200 million euros ($221.72 million) in Alitalia, while Delta has said it is prepared to put 100 million euros in the Italian airline."

Lufthansa on Wednesday announced it expected to cancel a total of 1,300 connections on Thursday and Friday, with 180,000 passengers affected. That amounts to about one in five of Lufthansa's planned 6,000 flights over the two-day period.
The departure table on Frankfurt airport's website showed scores of canceled flights to European destinations and on transatlantic routes.
A Lufthansa spokesman confirmed about 400 flights would be canceled in Frankfurt alone on Thursday, with an additional 250 in Munich and some more at smaller airports, bringing the total number to 700 on Thursday.
""It's quiet in the terminals,"" a spokeswoman for Frankfurt airport said, adding that many passengers had rebooked onto different flights and not shown up at the airport.
Flight attendants' union UFO has left open the possibility of continuing the strikes beyond Friday, potentially escalating the dispute.
The airline and the union have been at odds for months over the union's legal status. Lufthansa says the union leadership team that took office earlier this year was not elected in a way that met legal requirements -- a stance that UFO contests.
Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr on Thursday announced new talks with unions including UFO.
Lufthansa, which faces tough competition from Ryanair and easyJet (LON:EZJ), on Thursday also announced plans to cut costs at its Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines and Lufthansa Cargo units to revive profits.

259,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 05:14AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Aston Martin's Cliff-Edge Ride Set to Continue,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- James Bond’s carmaker of choice won itself some valuable breathing space Thursday with a set of quarterly results that – (cue: dramatic music) – showed things aren’t getting any worse.
True, demand for   Aston Martin   Lagonda's (LON:AML) bread-and-butter DB Vantage (prices for which start at a mere $150,000) has weakened, but the figures suggest that dealers have now at least started working off excess inventory accumulated earlier in the year.
They’re still not ordering as many new ones as hoped – core wholesale sales were down 16% on the year – but retail demand has held up, with a 13% increase and an encouraging increase in market share. After a loss in the first half, the company turned an operating profit of 10.5 million pounds in the third quarter.
But the key message from Thursday’s earnings is arguably the reassurance that the do-or-die bet on the new DBX crossover SUV – built from scratch at a brand new plant in Wales with an overwhelmingly new workforce – is still on track.
The company said it expects the official launch of the DBX to take place in Beijing in two weeks’ time.
“The first production trial build has been completed, and St Athan commissioned, with start of production due in Q2 2020 as planned,” the company said in its trading update. “We are delighted with the early reception the car has received from customers and initial orders are being placed at the confidential events.”
The shares rose 8% in response at opening, but promptly fell back as the market remembered that AML will have to shift more DBXs than seems likely if it’s going to whittle down what looks like an unsustainable debt burden. They're still down over 75% from the IPO price last year.
The company had to pay 12.5% to issue $150 million in senior secured debt two months ago, the equivalent of placing itself in the hands of the neighbourhood loan sharks. The interest on that and other borrowings will more than eat up such meagre operating profits as AML is currently generating.
The company faces a debt cliff in 2022, with 900 million pounds in credit set to mature. It desperately needs the uncertainty generated by Brexit (Aston’s sales are still very U.K.- and Europe-heavy) and the U.S.-China trade war to dissipate as fast as possible so that it can refinance at more favorable rates before it gets too close to that cliff edge. In that regard, this morning’s news from China claiming a mutual agreement to roll back tariffs will help AML more than most. 
However, until the DBX starts generating serious cash, the hair-raising thrills’n’spills of Aston Martin will be shared by drivers and shareholders alike."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) plans a $1.8 billion share buyback, Japan's biggest automaker said on Thursday, after beating quarterly forecasts on higher global vehicle sales and an improved performance in North America.
Operating profit rose 14% to 662.3 billion yen ($6.1 billion) for the three months to September 30 as Toyota enjoyed its strongest second quarter since 2015.
The profit beat an average forecast of 592.3 billion yen, based on estimates from nine analysts, Refinitiv data showed.
It sold 2.75 million vehicles globally, up from 2.18 million a year earlier. 
Sales in North America, Toyota's biggest market, rose 5.6%, while sales in Asia climbed 3.4%. 
Operating profit in North America, which has been a sore spot for Toyota over the past two years, more than doubled helped by less discounting.
""New models of the RAV4 and the Corolla, as well as last year's Camry, have been well received in North America, so we've been able to lower incentives,"" Operating Officer Kenta Kon told reporters at a briefing. 
For an interactive chart on Toyota's operating profit and vehicle sales, click on https://tmsnrt.rs/312ftUg
Toyota said it would buy back up to $1.8 billion worth of its common stock, or 34 million shares, by end-March.
It maintained its forecast for operating profit in the year to March to fall 2.7%, after three years of gains, as it expects a strengthening yen to weigh.
It lowered its forecast for annual global car sales by 2.7% to 10.7 million units, weighed by weakening demand in India, Indonesia and Thailand. Still, it expects record sales topping last year's 10.6 million.
'EVERY LAST DROP'
Toyota's projected profit slip is subdued versus smaller rivals including Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) Subaru Corp (T:7270) and Mazda Motors Corp (T:7261), which have slashed their full-year outlooks by up to 67% this month amid weaker demand for their cars.
Many of them acknowledge they are struggling to contain costs amid the need to invest heavily to develop self-driving cars and electric vehicles.
Toyota also said higher R&D investments and rising labor costs had made cost-cutting a challenge, but it managed an additional 45 billion yen in cost savings during the quarter.
Executive Vice President Mitsuru Kawai told reporters that the company was looking at every possible way to cut production costs and improve efficiency at its factories, including scraping out ""every last drop"" of vehicle body paint from the can before opening a new one.

""(Each drop of paint) on its own would represent only a fraction of a yen in savings, but if we add up these efforts we can build a savings effect,"" he said.

Members of the executive and supervisory boards have Doll in their sights, the sources told Reuters, saying he did not inform the government and the supervisory board about problems in the planned sale of international unit Arriva.
A spokeswoman for Deutsche Bahn declined to comment.
Doll was called in on Wednesday by Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer, who the sources said had not shown any backing for Doll. Doll himself considers the accusations unfounded and does not want to go voluntarily.
Seen as a reformer at the company, Doll still has some supporters on the supervisory board, including among trade union representatives, the sources said. His opponents are Ronald Pofalla, infrastructure head, and Richard Lutz, railways head.
Deutsche Bahn said in September that it expects a 50 billion euro ($55.4 billion) climate change package agreed by the German government to generate the railway company’s biggest growth spurt in its 180-year history.
However, the highly indebted firm and chief executive Lutz have been under fire over delays and for having insufficient capacity, with Scheuer setting Lutz an ultimatum of Nov. 14 to present ideas for improvements in rail and freight.
The supervisory board meeting on Thursday was due to appoint Sigrid Nikutta, the head of the Berlin public transportation company, to the executive board to reorganize the ailing freight transport subsidiary DB Cargo, currently managed by Doll.
However, that appointment could also be at risk because of the power struggle around Doll."

Shares of  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) hit their highest in more than a year after the German industrial company beat fourth-quarter profit expectations, while Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) jumped 6.5% on plans to cut costs at some of its units to revive profit.
The German airline's shares boosted the wider travel and leisure index (SXTP) by 1.4%, making it one of the top gainers among the major European sub-sectors.

""There are still hurdles to be (crossed) but it is positive that not only U.S. officials are optimistic but Chinese negotiators are sending positive signals as well.""
China and the United States have both agreed to cancel in phases the tariffs imposed during their prolonged trade war, the Chinese commerce ministry said.
The news sparked a broad-based rally in Europe on Thursday, with trade-sensitive Frankfurt shares (GDAXI) rising 0.7% to their highest level since February 2018.
It also helped investors shrug off another weak data point from Germany showing industrial output fell more than expected in September.
All eyes will now be on a Bank of England meeting later in the day, where the central bank is expected to hold interest rates steady ahead of a snap election in the UK on Dec. 12 to decide the fate of Brexit.
The FTSE midcap index (FTMC) and Irish stocks (ISEQ) gained 0.76% and 1.22%, respectively.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.4%. It is now 2% away from its record high, last hit in April 2015.
Among the top gainers across European sub-sectors were automakers (SXAP) and miners (SXPP), while defensive plays such as telecoms (SXKP) and utilities (SX6P) fell, suggesting higher risk appetite.

Deutsche Lufthansa AG (DE:LHAG) said an improved performance at its no-frills Eurowings arm helped stem profit declines as a two-day strike underscores the challenge facing the airline in cutting costs.
Third-quarter earnings fell 8% to 1.3 billion euros ($1.44 billion) as a slide in fares outstripped savings, according to a statement Thursday. The figure was ahead of analyst estimates and the revival at Eurowings suggests the group may be getting to grips with competition from specialist discount carriers.
Lufthansa said it expects capacity to shrink 1% on short-haul routes in its home markets this winter, comments that Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said may point to a better operating environment over the next six months. A glut of seats in the past few years has pushed down fares and undermined margins at European carriers despite efforts to boost efficiency.
The cabin-crew strike highlights the challenge facing Lufthansa as it seeks to secure deeper cost costs. The walkout, which began at midnight, has led to the cancellation of 1,300 flights and Germany’s UFO union has said it will escalate the action unless the company agrees to fresh talks on pay. Lufthansa declined to comment on the likely cost.
Shares of Europe’s biggest airline gained 3.4% to 16.70 euros as of 9:10 a.m. in Frankfurt. The stock has declined 14% this year, following a 36% slide in 2018.
Chief Executive Officer Carsten Spohr said the performance of Eurowings, which turned profitable after posting losses in the previous three quarters, indicates “turnaround measures are showing first results.” The unit has reduced winter capacity this winter, helping to buoy yields despite the fare war.
The Lufthansa statement made no reference to a possible investment in Alitalia SpA as part of a rescue of the bankrupt Italian carrier, though Spohr is tipped by analysts to tackle the subject on a call with investors later."

270,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 01:36AM ET</span>",China's tobacco monopoly means big risks for e-cigarette startups,"By Josh Horwitz
(Reuters) - In a glass-walled laboratory, chemists puff on vaping devices as they test liquid nicotine flavors. Nearby, staffers with cartons of instant noodles on their desks tap away at laptops, messaging suppliers and customers.
Here at the Shenzhen offices of e-cigarette start-up RELX Technology, workers scramble to keep pace with the rush of firms vying for sales in the world’s biggest tobacco market. Their potential-customer base starts with 300 million Chinese smokers of traditional cigarettes – about nine times the number in the United States. Founded by former employees of Didi Chuxing, China’s answer to Uber (NYSE:UBER), RELX aims to become China’s answer to Juul Labs Inc, the San Francisco startup that captured a huge share of the U.S. vaping market with a sleek and addictive e-cigarette.
RELX makes an almost identical product: a stick-shaped device that burns high-nicotine liquids packaged in plug-in “pods.” But it won’t have to compete with the U.S. e-cigarette giant. Juul has yet to crack China’s market even as it aggressively expands elsewhere in Asia and faces a regulatory crisis in the United States https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/juul-ecigarette over a surge in youth vaping. Juul’s delayed entry into China – potentially its most lucrative market – underscores the complexity and risk of operating here.
E-cigarette sales have grown slowly in China compared to other industrialized nations. Its market is about one-ninth the size of the United States, according to market research firm Euromonitor. One main reason: China Tobacco, which is both the government-owned cigarette company and the national tobacco regulator. The state monopoly has not clearly signaled how it will regulate e-cigarettes – or whether it will sell them. If it does, it has the power to regulate its competitors out of the business.
One investor in a Chinese e-cigarette startup likened the combined regulatory and competitive threat to “a knife on the neck.”
China Tobacco did not respond to written questions from Reuters.
The cigarette giant’s power stems in part from its contribution to the national purse - accounting for 5.45% of China’s tax revenue in 2018. That amounts to 10.8 trillion yuan ($1.5 trillion), according to calculations by Professor Rose Zheng of the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.
Still, China Tobacco sells cigarettes for a fraction of what they cost in most nations – as little as 3 yuan per pack, or less than half a U.S. dollar. RELX sells a device and one pod for between 299 yuan to 399 yuan.
Foreign firms, particularly U.S. firms, face the additional obstacles of the U.S.-China trade war, cultural challenges in marketing and distributing, and competition from a host of new Chinese e-cigarette startups including RELX, which was valued at $2.4 billion based on recent investments.
In September, Juul briefly started selling devices on two popular online commerce sites, Tmall and JD.com Inc. But the products were pulled from the websites days later for unknown reasons.
Juul, Tmall parent company  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd, and JD.com declined to comment on the Juul product removals or China’s regulatory environment. China Tobacco issued a notice Nov. 1 urging e-commerce platforms and e-cigarette companies to shut online stores offering vaping products, a move aimed at stopping youth sales.
Juul declined to comment on its China strategy.
RELX CEO Kate Wang said she’s “not worried” about the government’s impact on the sector. The products will continue to remain available, she said, “as long as there’s proof that this is a good solution for smokers.”
FRONTIER MARKET
Many e-cigarette startups still see boundless opportunity in China. Nearly half of Chinese men smoke cigarettes, according to the World Health Organization. Chinese factories make 95% of the world’s e-cigarettes, according to Electronic Cigarette Industry Committee, a Chinese trade association. But almost all of that production is exported.
Juul’s explosive U.S. growth only recently convinced Chinese e-cigarette firms of the viability of small, high-nicotine vaping devices in China. They had focused on larger, box-shaped devices that spew vast clouds of vapor and spawned a subculture in the Chinese hip-hop community. The box vapes were less effective in delivering nicotine but offered better profit margins, said Michael Gao, founder of Chinese e-cigarette company Moti.
“The old box-style models, you could sell for $100,” compared to about $30 for a Juul-like device, Gao said. “So everyone had doubts about the pod model.”
Juul’s success quelled those doubts. Dozens of Chinese startups released pod-style vapes starting in 2018. Many had roots in China’s technology industry. Shenzhen-based Laan, for instance, was founded by former employees at WeChat, the messaging app owned by Tencent. YOOZ, based in Beijing, was launched by Cai Yuedong, an online media entrepreneur.
Samuel Liu, who launched the Evove brand of e-cigarettes, envisions a mass market. “It’s a legal drug; it’s a fast-moving consumer good; and it’s an electronic product,” he said. “Electronic cigarettes will be the second item you carry in your pocket, after your phone.”
And yet Liu and others acknowledge the risk posed by China Tobacco.
“When VC’s come to me, I always tell them they shouldn’t get too excited,” he said. “You don’t know when the government will come in and just claim this market for itself.”
Some VCs are embracing the risk. In April, RELX closed on $75 million in venture capital funding from high-profile investors including Sequoia China and Yuri Milner.
In addition to e-commerce sites, RELX sells its products through bars, cafes and smartphone repair shops, and says it has more than 900 branded storefronts as franchise partners. The company also plans to soon open flagship stores in Southeast Asia and London.
The company’s most popular flavors are mung bean, a common ingredient in Chinese desserts, and laobinggun, a type of popsicle popular in the nineties in China.
“We search for flavors that are pretty familiar to people over 30, things that are old-fashioned and inspire emotion,” says Wang.
MONOPOLY CONTROL, MIXED SIGNALS
China Tobacco dominates the nation’s tobacco supply from manufacturing to retailing. The same entity controls regulation under a different name – the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration.
The administration has at times worked against efforts to limit smoking. In Hangzhou, for example, the local government in 2018 attempted to ban indoor public smoking. The movement lost momentum after the tobacco administration pushed for lighter measures including more designated smoking areas, which it said allowed for “civilized smoking” in a statement to Reuters at the time.
In May 2017, the regulator claimed jurisdiction over heat-not-burn smoking devices - an alternative type of e-cigarette that creates a vapor from raw tobacco leaves. The decision effectively barred Phillip Morris International Inc from Chinese sales of its IQOS device, a heat-not-burn e-cigarette popular in Japan. China Tobacco subsidiaries have since begun testing their own heat-not-burn devices and selling them in limited quantities.
Phillip Morris said in a statement it had no current plans to sell IQOS in China but did not comment on the nation’s regulation of the heat-not-burn sector.
The government has sent conflicting messages on whether it intends to regulate e-cigarettes that vaporize liquid nicotine blends - or sell them itself.
In March, state broadcaster CCTV aired a segment highlighting the potential health risks from inhaling nicotine and other chemicals in e-cigarette liquids. The spot was part of a program - broadcast annually on China’s national “Consumer Day” - that targets industries the government alleges have wronged the public.
Industry players say they struggled to interpret the government’s message in the segment. They hoped it signaled that the tobacco monopoly would continue allowing e-cigarette sales but start regulating their quality and safety. They had the same hopes in May, when a government regulator submitted draft regulations for exported Chinese e-cigarettes to the World Trade Organization.
Many industry observers, however, continue to believe China Tobacco will eventually enter the e-cigarette market itself.
State-owned enterprises such as China Tobacco are “bloated and slow to take action,” said Maggie Chen of ESun, a Shenzhen-based consulting firm that helps companies comply with import and export regulations. “But they are definitely paying attention to this sector.”"
271,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 12:53AM ET</span>","Global Economy in Better Place After Fed Cuts, Trade Progress, Ex-RBI Governor Says","(Bloomberg) -- Hopes of a trade deal between the U.S. and China and a series of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve are making the world a much better place in the short term, former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said.
“The Fed has been very sensitive to a lot of concerns about growth,” Rajan said in an interview to Bloomberg TV’s Haslinda Amin in Singapore. “It has done a series of insurance cuts. That seems to have reassured markets even while they were waiting to see some resolution to the trade imbroglio.”
The Fed last month cut interest rates for a third time this year, citing a combination of trade-policy uncertainty, slowing global growth and below-target inflation. The U.S. and China have been trying to negotiate a limited trade deal, but it may not be clinched until December over indecision on where to sign the deal.
Rajan said there’s some progress on the trade deal, but it will not be a permanent solution and won’t be something that many people want to see.
In some sense “we are in a much better place” than where we were toward the end of last year, said Rajan.
Here are some more points from the interview:
On Europe, Rajan said the European Central Bank has very little room to ease policy further, and it is now for the politicians to revive growth and create more jobsBoosting government spending to support growth comes with its own risks given high debt in some countries, Rajan saidOn Brexit, he said that an unprepared exit by the U.K. from the European Union will not be goodOn speculation that he is a potential successor to Mark Carney as the head of the Bank of England, Rajan said that it was a very difficult job, and central banking jobs were becoming increasingly political. He said the BOE job requires a candidate who understands the domestic political situation(Updates with more details from third paragraph.)"

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares napped near multi-month peaks on Thursday while bonds eked out a bounce as reports of delays in sealing a preliminary Sino-U.S. trade deal left investors frustrated at the lack of concrete progress.
In early European trades, the pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures were up slightly while those for German DAX were flat. London's FTSE futures rose 0.2%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped a slight 0.2%, just off a six-month high hit earlier in the week.
Japan's Nikkei dithered either side of flat in very quiet trade, having touched a 13-month top on Wednesday. South Korean stocks eased 0.15% after hitting their highest since May, while Shanghai blue chips lost 0.08%.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 eased 0.1%.
Reuters reported on Wednesday a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign an interim trade deal could be delayed until December as discussions continue over terms and venue.
Among various suggestions was to sign a deal after a scheduled NATO meeting in early December.
""One could take the view that by not committing to meet the original deadline it gives more time for a somewhat more comprehensive agreement to be thrashed out,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank.
""But markets have understandably jumped the other way, exhibiting a slight loss of confidence that anything more substantial than an agreement not to further lift tariffs, in return for some increase in US agricultural purchases, can be agreed by way of an initial deal.""
Wall Street was underwhelmed by the news and the Dow ended Wednesday all but flat, while the S&P 500 gained 0.07% and the Nasdaq dropped 0.29%.
HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) rose over 6% after Reuters reported U.S. printer maker Xerox (NYSE:XRX) Holdings Corp has made a roughly $33 billion cash-and-stock offer for the computer group.
The pause in the risk rally helped bonds recoup a little of their recent losses. Yields on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell back to 1.81% from a two-month top of 1.87%.
That in turn restrained the dollar, which eased to 108.74 yen from a weekly high of 109.24. The dollar was steady on a basket of currencies at 97.965.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Foreign holdings of Chinese stocks rose to a record high by the end of the third quarter, despite the ups and downs in a protracted trade dispute with the United States, as Beijing further opens its financial markets to help fund businesses.
By end-Sept, Chinese equities held by foreigners were at a record of 1.77 trillion yuan ($253.14 billion) after having risen for four straight months, up nearly 40% in a year, the latest data from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) shows.
China is stepping up opening of its heavily policed, giant capital markets, having recently scrapped investment quotas under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) scheme.
Cross-border yuan usage jumped 20% in Jan-Sept on capital market opening, with about 6 trillion yuan of cross-border yuan payment for securities investment, according to a central bank official.

The data also showed investors had been net buyers of A-shares through the Stock Connect linking Hong Kong and the mainland for the past five months through October, purchasing a net 158.2 billion yuan worth of A-shares.
The Stock Connect is a scheme to allow foreign investors convenient access to the A-share market.
Robust foreign inflows into the stock market of the world's second largest economy come as major international index providers, including MSCI, FTSE Russell and S&P, have begun or are stepping up inclusion of China A-shares and bonds on global indexes.

The heaviest foreign flows were into the consumer sector, as foreign investors hoped for China's policy stimulus to bolster an economy hurting in a nearly two-year long trade war with the United States.
Beijing has rolled out a raft of measures to boost domestic consumption, which accounts for over 60% of its economy, to help shore up faltering demand.
The consumer sector remained the most preferred by the northbound flows via the Stock Connect, with food and beverage, home appliances and healthcare stocks making up 40% of those foreign investors' A-share holdings by market value, analysts at Essence Securities said in a report.

275,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 12:26AM ET</span>",China's index funds could grow ten-fold in a decade: Hua An,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's index-tracking mutual funds have the potential to jump 10-fold to 6 trillion yuan ($857.29 billion) in assets over the next decade as investors are more likely to place money with them than rival stock-pickers who struggle to beat the market, veteran portfolio manager David Xu said.
Xu, the head of indexing and quantitative investment at Hua An Fund Management Co., said that growth in passive funds was being driven by the participation of more mature investors, as well as a rotation of Chinese money out of the stagnant real estate market and lower-yielding wealth management products (WMPs).
""Efficiency of China's market is rapidly rising,"" Xu, who manages over $5 billion worth of investment in several index funds, said in an interview as part of the Reuters 2020 Investment Outlook Summit.
He estimates that only two to three out of 10 active fund managers in China have beaten the benchmark CSI300 Total Return Index , and the odds will shrink further as the market become more efficient.
Once viewed by some investors as a casino, China's stock market is witnessing increasing participation by foreign and domestic institutional investors, whose intensive drilling into companies' fundamentals makes it harder for stock-picking fund managers to identify opportunities that others may have missed.
Burned by the 2015/16 market crash, retail investors are shunning individual stocks, and switching to index-trackers.
""They're avoiding the risks of individual stocks, instead turning to index investment,"" said Xu, whose ChiNext 50 ETF has seen a 27-fold surge in assets since end-2017 to about 6 billion yuan. Xu also manages Hua An's flagship SSE180 ETF (SS:510180) and Asia's biggest gold ETF (SS:518880).
Equity exchange-traded funds (ETFs) - the dominant form of index funds in China - have nearly tripled since the start of 2017, exceeding 500 billion yuan ($71.44 billion), according to fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors. That contrasts with a 7% contraction in active equity and balanced funds during the period.
Although index funds in China have seen their share of the country's mutual fund industry rise to 11.7% from less than 9% two years ago, the growth potential remains huge. In the United States, index funds have grabbed half of the fund market.
Fearful of missing out an expected boom, Chinese asset managers are rushing to launch new ETFs. Global players including Vanguard and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) are also eyeing this segment of the China market.
Xu said that fiercer competition will inevitably lead to price wars, and innovations.
Having already launched ETFs tracking German and Japanese indexes to faciliate offshore investment, Hua An plans to launch an ETF that invests in the French market, Xu said.
""China is accelerating its opening-up. That creates new growth opportunities for ETFs."""

WASHINGTON/PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. and European regulators have asked  Boeing Co  (N:BA) to revise documentation on its proposed 737 MAX software fix, the planemaker confirmed Wednesday, further complicating its efforts to return the jet to service by year-end.
The world's largest planemaker had submitted documentation in a key part of an approval process, already delayed by months, for a 737 MAX software upgrade in the wake of two crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed 346 people.
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) officials flagged a number of issues over the weekend at an Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL) facility in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, during a documentation audit of how the new software was developed, sources told Reuters.
Boeing and regulators will return to Iowa at a yet-to-be-determined date to complete the audit, the officials said.
""We think there is still some work to be done,"" EASA Executive Director Patrick Ky told Reuters on Monday. 
Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe said Wednesday the company ""provided technical documentation to the regulators as part of the software validation process. The documentation was complete, and it was provided in a format consistent with past submissions. Regulators have requested that the information be conveyed in a different form, and the documentation is being revised accordingly.""
One person briefed on the matter characterized the issue differently and said Boeing's paperwork had gaps, was substandard and meant regulators could not complete the audit, a crucial step before the plane can be certified to return to service.
The person said it could take ""weeks"" to satisfy regulators in a worst-case scenario, though Boeing believes it can address the omissions in a matter of days.
The extent of the delays caused by the documentation requirements was not immediately clear. There was no indication of any need to revise the software package based on the audit, sources said.
Boeing is ramping up the number of people assigned to address the software documentation officials, a source said. Boeing shares closed down about 1%.
Boeing chief financial officer Gregory Smith said at an industry conference on Wednesday that the company's job is ""make sure we get everything done right on time, answer every question, every document that's needed, every form of software enhancement that's required anytime.""
The FAA declined to comment on the audit but said it was ""following a thorough process, not a prescribed timeline, for returning the Boeing 737 Max to passenger service.""
In September, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said the agency had told Boeing ""it's really better to be very methodical and very detailed rather than try to rush a partially completed product and then say, ‘We’ll get back to you with the rest of it.’""
Dickson said the FAA will need 30 days from the time of the as-yet unscheduled certification test flight before it can unground the plane.
A third person, familiar with FAA documentation audits but who did not participate in the 737 MAX review over the weekend, said such audits frequently uncover inconsistencies or omissions in documentation but rarely lead to changes to the underlying software or system.
Boeing's fastest-selling jetliner has been grounded worldwide since March, cutting off a key source of cash for Boeing while forcing airlines to cancel thousands of flights. Many carriers have taken the MAX off schedules into 2020. 
 American Airlines Group  (O:AAL) Chief Executive Doug Parker told a conference on Wednesday that American's plan to put some of its 737 MAX jets back in the air in mid-January https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-airplane/american-airlines-cancels-737-max-flights-until-jan-16-idUSKBN1WO1FX would require FAA approval in ""the earlier part of December.""
Boeing has repeatedly delayed its timeline for returning the plane to flight by the end of 2019, as regulators have scrutinized proposed fixes.

Documentation requirements are central to certification for increasingly complex aircraft software, and can become a source of delays. In 2008, EASA nearly derailed Europe's Airbus A400M https://www.reuters.com/article/us-air-a400m-idUSTRE6570NK20100608 military transporter over software documentation following a failed audit.

(Reuters) - Short-term home rental company Airbnb Inc said on Wednesday it will introduce new safety measures in response to a fatal Halloween shooting in California last week, including a 24/7 hot line and review of ""high risk reservations.""
Speaking at a conference, Airbnb co-founder and Chief Executive Brian Chesky said the company would make a ""significant investment"" in the new measures and that it would not have an impact on plans to go public next year.
""We are making the most significant change to our platform to increase the amount of trust in our platform,"" Chesky said at The New York Times DealBook Conference.
San Francisco-based Airbnb has already banned ""party houses"" after the shooting incident last week, where five people were killed at a large Halloween gathering inside a rental home.
Airbnb will now expand manual screening of high-risk reservations from Dec. 15 to identify suspicious reservations and start a verification process for all the listings on its platforms, the company said.
It will also set up a hot line for neighbors of Airbnb properties with concerns, and offer a ""guest guarantee"" whereby customers can unhappy with a listing can rebook at another property or get a full refund.
Chesky said Airbnb was profitable in 2017 and 2018, and that the company has more money in its coffers than the $3.2 billion that it had raised through fundraising.
Airbnb is leaning toward going public through a direct listing, rather than an initial public offering, Reuters has reported.
In an IPO, shares are sold by a company to raise money. In a direct listing, however, no new shares are sold, rather existing investors are given the opportunity to sell shares.
Asked about how Airbnb was approaching going public through an IPO or a direct listing, Chesky said, ""I certainly don't have any news to make except to say that we also don't need to raise new money."""
281,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 08:47PM ET</span>",Alphabet expects to complete probe of sexual misconduct claims by next month,"By Paresh Dave
(Reuters) - The board of Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) expects to complete by next month an investigation into the company's handling of sexual harassment and other misconduct complaints against current and former executives, according to a filing in state court last month.
Alphabet's board formed a special litigation committee last spring after several shareholder groups filed lawsuits alleging that company directors breached their fiduciary duties by covering up sexual misconduct claims against two former top executives over the past five years.
Four of the lawsuits were joined together in June in Santa Clara County Superior Court in California, and Alphabet was expected to respond to the allegations by Nov. 8.
But Alphabet and the plaintiffs said in a joint court filing on Oct. 18 that because the internal investigation was expected to end by early December, they agreed to move the company's response deadline to Dec. 13 so that it would have the findings from the investigation in hand. 
The board committee is working with law firm Cravath Swaine & Moore, the filing said. 
CNBC first reported the investigation on Wednesday, citing unspecified materials that showed an independent subcommittee of the board had retained an unnamed law firm to assist with the investigation.
Alphabet said in a statement to Reuters that its investigation had already been noted in the court filings. 
""In early 2019, Alphabet's board of directors formed a special litigation committee to consider claims made by shareholders in various lawsuits relating to past workplace conduct,"" the company said.
The company declined to elaborate, and spokespeople for Cravath did not immediately respond to requests to comment. 
It is unclear whether Cravath or the special litigation committee have interviewed any alleged victims, witnesses or accused executives, some of whom are no longer at Alphabet. 
The investigation includes reviewing the behavior of Alphabet's chief legal officer, David Drummond, who has been accused of having relationships with employees, CNBC said. 
Drummond told news website BuzzFeed in August that he made some mistakes with one relationship he had with a colleague, but said that he had not started any other relationships with a co-worker.
The shareholders suing Alphabet directors and executives include individuals and various labor unions and pension funds, among which is the New York City Employees Retirement System. They have called for Alphabet to enact governance and oversight to stop future workplace conduct issues. They also call for Alphabet directors to pay damages to Alphabet for allegedly breaching their fiduciary duties and engaging in corporate waste.
The allegations stem primarily from large severance payments made to Andy Rubin, who led Google's Android mobile operating division until 2014, and Amit Singhal, head of Google's search unit until 2016. Company investigations into both men had found accusations of sexual harassment against them to be credible, according to the lawsuits.

Rubin and Singhal have disputed the allegations.

(Reuters) - Purdue Pharma LP and the company's Sackler family owners will be shielded until April 8, 2020, from sprawling opioid litigation to give the maker of OxyContin time to try to reach a legal settlement the company says is worth $10 billion.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain said on Wednesday he would approve an order extending a stay on more than 2,600 lawsuits that accuse Purdue and the Sacklers of fueling a crisis that contributed to 400,000 U.S. deaths between 1999 and 2017.
Drain, whose court is in White Plains, New York, ordered a brief stay of the litigation in October.
While the litigation is on hold, Purdue and the Sacklers committed to share information with the states, municipalities, Native American tribes, hospitals, individuals and others who have sued.
Purdue filed for bankruptcy in September to try to corral the parties to one court and build support for its proposed settlement, which will now be evaluated through the discovery process with the company and the Sacklers.
The bulk of the parties that have sued Purdue support the settlement, and the main opposition comes from about two dozen state attorneys general.
At Wednesday's hearing, a lawyer for the official creditors committee said the billionaire Sackler family was being slow to respond to demands for financial records.
Drain warned that the family runs the risk of being exposed to litigation when his order expires if they do not cooperate.
""This is not a free pass,"" he said.
Under the proposed deal, control of Purdue will be transferred to the parties suing it. The Sackler family will contribute at least $3 billion to the deal, and in return will be released from further lawsuits, the deal says.
The company has also committed to appointing an independent monitor during ongoing negotiations to ensure it ceased practices that allegedly contributed to the addiction crisis, such as promoting its drugs and rewarding sales teams.
In addition to Purdue, several manufacturers, distributors and pharmacy chains have been sued by the same groups over the opioid crisis. 

In October, distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC),  Cardinal Health  Inc (N:CAH) and McKesson Corp (N:MCK), drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Inc (TA:TEVA) (N:TEVA), and Johnson & Johnson (J:JNJ) proposed settling the litigation against them for $48 billion.

284,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 07:47PM ET</span>",Acting UAW head to examine 'every inch' of union in scandal's wake,"By Nick Carey and Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - The acting head of the United Auto Workers (UAW) said on Wednesday that he will examine every department of the union in response to a spreading federal corruption probe that has damaged the union's standing during contract talks with Detroit's automakers.
""We're going to be looking at every inch of this union to make sure we embrace tight controls,"" Rory Gamble told Reuters in an interview shortly after federal prosecutors issued new charges against a former top UAW official. ""We need to make sure we have standards that stop this thing from happening again.""
Gamble said that on Thursday he would propose a series of ""very strict rules"" to the UAW's board for managing members' dues and enable staff to report wrongdoing.
""We need to get away from that wall of silence that seems to have surrounded some of this stuff,"" Gamble said.
A UAW vice president, Gamble stepped into his role at the weekend to replace UAW president Gary Jones, who took a paid leave of absence after being linked to the ongoing corruption probe.
Earlier Wednesday former UAW vice president Joseph Ashton, also a former General Motors Co (N:GM) board member, was charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud.
Ten people have been charged in the investigation so far.
The FBI has been investigating alleged illegal payoffs to UAW officials by  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) NV (MI:FCHA). 
The widening probe raises questions about whether the U.S. government might seek to supervise the UAW as it did the Teamsters in the wake of financial corruption at that union. 
Gamble said he has been briefed by the union's legal team on that possibility. 
""We're going to work very hard to show we can apply self-governance here and protect and maintain our union,"" he said. ""I have no problem doing that.""
In 1988, the U.S. Justice Department sued to force out senior leaders at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union and appoint a trustee because of the union's connection to organized crime. 
The government oversaw the union from March 1989 until 2015, when it agreed to a five-year transition period that will end in February 2020.
Last week UAW leaders recommended approval of a tentative four-year labor agreement with  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), sending the deal to the automaker's 52,000 UAW members for a vote. The union previously ratified a similar deal with GM and will now negotiate with FCA.
Gamble said the union was committed to getting a good deal for its members. 

""If you look at the GM strike, that was done under a cloud of suspicion for some of our leaders,"" he said. ""But our members came together with one focus in mind and that was getting a good, fair agreement to protect their families.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks and fund managers want the European stock trading day shortened by 90 minutes in a radical move they say would improve market efficiency and staff wellbeing - but exchanges are split.
The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), a banking industry body, and UK-based Investment Association (IA), which represents asset managers, said Europe had some of the longest trading hours in the world at 8-1/2 hours.
This compares with 6-1/2 hours on Wall Street and 6 hours in Asia, the two industry bodies said in a joint statement on Thursday.
AFME and IA, whose members including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Barclays  (LON:BARC), BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) account for the bulk of share trading, said they were talking with major European exchanges to explore cutting the trading day by 90 minutes.
The opening bell would be rung at 0900 GMT, an hour later than at present, with the close 30 minutes earlier at 1600 GMT.
The first hour of trading currently attracts light volumes, making it more costly to trade, with over a third of trading in the final hour.
""Shortening the hours would concentrate liquidity leading to more consistent trading costs and provide greater time for traders and the market to digest corporate announcements,"" AFME and IA said.
Long hours affect the mental health and wellbeing of traders and are a key obstacle to recruiting more diverse staff, in particular for those with family or caring commitments, they added.
The Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates share trading, said last month the number of women in senior financial roles had flat-lined since 2005 despite the sector's ""rhetoric"" on diversity, with brokers the worst.
The London Stock Exchange said it strongly supported improving diversity and workplace culture, and intended to consider the request in a formal consultation with members and users.
FIT FOR PURPOSE
Share trading in Europe already faces fragmentation due to Britain's departure from the European Union, and differences in trading hours could accentuate any divide.
Rainer Riess, director general of the Federation of European Securities Exchanges, said Europe's current trading hours were ""fit for purpose"" and should not be revisited.
""A reduction of trading hours in Europe would give an advantage to other jurisdictions in similar or equivalent time zones to expand their trading hours,"" Riess said.
Existing hours reflect investor needs, allow European markets to interact with the United States and Asia, Riess said.
Cboe, Europe's biggest cross-border exchange, said it would likely make the most sense to shorten sessions at the beginning of the day given they do not overlap with the U.S. market.
Aquis Exchange said that while it welcomed steps to improve markets, cutting trading hours was not the most effective way of boosting diversity or the number of women."

(Reuters) - Middle Eastern fund Investcorp is joining forces with Chinese partners to spend up to $500 million buying food brands and manufacturing sites in Asia, aiming to tap into China's emerging middle classes and their growing taste for foreign foods.
In a deal announced on Thursday, Investcorp has teamed up with state-owned China Resources and Fung Investments, backed by Hong Kong family Victor and William Fung, to launch what the company says will be Asia's only private equity fund dedicated to investing in food.
Investcorp has $28.2 billion worth of assets under management, including Britain’s Tyrells crisps and Australia’s Yarra Valley snackfoods in its portfolio, and has identified China as an emerging market for Western-style foods.
Soy sauce produced in Japan is also likely to be a target for the partnership to buy and export to China.
Investcorp co-chief executive Hazem Ben-Gacem played down China’s slowing economic growth which, at 6% in the third quarter of 2019, was the weakest for 27-1/2 years.
""We are investing in a defensive sector that will continue its momentum regardless of the macroeconomic trends. People might spend less on luxury brands or travel, but not on food consumption in a downturn,"" Ben-Gacem told Reuters.
The transaction was finalised in Hong Kong late Wednesday, with the three parties signing an initial funding agreement of $300 million.
The partnership expects its first deal to be closed within the next four months and aims to have 12 investments made over the five year life of the fund.
Equity investments are expected to be between $40 and $70 million each into businesses with enterprise values (equity plus debt) of up to $100 million.

The mooted layoffs at the Ilva steelworks in Taranto came just two days after ArcelorMittal announced that it planned to pull out of a year-old deal to buy the Italian company. 
ArcelorMittal blamed its decision at time on the government's failure to renew a legal shield it had previously provided which gave the firm immunity from prosecution while it cleaned up the heavily polluting plant.
Conte met ArcelorMittal managers earlier in the day and said it was clear the legal shield had nothing to do with the threat to quit Italy. The real problem was that the firm had not hit its production targets, he told reporters.
""The legal shield is not the issue. The company believes that the current production level of 4 million tonnes a year does not cover its investments and cannot justify current job numbers,"" Conte said.
There was no immediate comment from ArcelorMittal.
ArcelorMittal took control of Ilva in November 2018 and has some 10,700 employees in Italy, including 8,200 in Taranto -- the largest such steel plant in Europe.
Conte said it had aimed to produce 6 million tonnes of steel a year in Taranto. He added that ArcelorMittal could not turn around one year into its contract and announce that its plan was no longer viable. 
The prime minister said he had given ArcelorMittal two days to rethink its position, but acknowledged that he had received no commitment from the company to review its stance.
""It is premature to say how this will end. The layoff plan they have presented is clearly unacceptable. Any layoff plan is unacceptable,"" Conte said, adding: ""This first meeting does not give us much hope.""

292,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 06:32PM ET</span>","Qualcomm's licensing forecast, helped by Apple deal, drives share gains","By Stephen Nellis and Munsif Vengattil
(Reuters) -  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) on Wednesday forecast current-quarter profit above Wall Street expectations, as its all-important licensing segment benefits from a deal with Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and the annual holiday-quarter boost it brings.
Qualcomm, the world's biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, derives most of its profits from a business segment that invents technologies and licenses them. The company forecast between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in revenue for that segment for its fiscal first quarter, above analyst expectations of $1.23 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The licensing business drove the adjusted profit forecast with a midpoint of 85 cents per share, also above analyst expectations of 83 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data. The return of Apple sales also provides Qualcomm a seasonal boost in its fiscal first quarter that ends in December, when Apple traditionally sells its biggest number of devices and therefore pays the most royalties. 
On the chip side, Qualcomm's chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, told Reuters in an interview that the company has won deals to supply 230 device designs with 5G chips, up from 150 a quarter ago.
""We're continuing to see strength in the licensing business, particularly after we've added in the deal we signed this year with Apple, and we're on the front end of the 5G transition, which will impact our product business,"" Mollenkopf said. ""We're closer to that and we're really seeing the signs that we should be confident."" 
The news sent shares up nearly 5.1% to $89.00 in after-hours trading.
The company has resolved license disputes with major customers such as  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) and Apple.
It helps that most of Qualcomm's customers are actually paying,"" Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said.
But Qaulcomm remains in a license dispute with Huawei. ""Although negotiations continue, we have not reached a final agreement with Huawei,"" Qualcomm said on Wednesday.
Qualcomm said it expects between 1.75 billion and 1.85 billion smart devices with modem chips, including 175 million to 225 million 5G handsets, to be sold in 2020. Because Qualcomm collects license fees on devices that use cellular connections to wireless data networks, a greater number of devices sold often results in higher revenue and profits.
The results come a week after Apple calmed Wall Street nerves with improved sales in China, the world's largest smartphone market, and follow strong earnings from chipmaker  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) last month. 
Qualcomm said that for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 29, revenue in its licensing segment was $1.16 billion, beating estimates of $1.10 billion, according to data from FactSet.
Excluding items, the company earned 78 cents per share, topping analysts' average estimate of 71 cents.

Revenue in the fourth-quarter fell about 17% to $4.81 billion, but beat analysts' estimates of $4.70 billion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell joined a bipartisan group of senators on Wednesday in introducing a bill to secure the pensions for nearly 90,000 retired coal miners as a recent wave of coal company bankruptcies threatens the solvency of the federal pension fund.
The Bipartisan American Miners Act, co-sponsored by McConnell, of Kentucky, and West Virginia Senators Joe Manchin, a Democrat, and Shelly Moore Capito, a Republican, would transfer funds from the federal abandoned mine lands program to avert insolvency of the United Mineworkers of America pension plan.
Kentucky and West Virginia are among the biggest U.S. coal-producing states.
A bankruptcy filing last week by one of the largest coal mining companies, Murray Energy, was expected to hasten the insolvency of the pension fund - estimated to occur by 2022. Eight other coal companies have filed for bankruptcy over the last two years as natural gas has taken over as the primary fuel for U.S. power plants.
""The startling number of orphaned miners in the drastically underfunded pension plan presents an urgent crisis for entire communities of miners, retirees, and their families,"" McConnell said in a statement.
If passed, the bill would secure the pensions of around 92,000 retired and working coal miners and ensure health care for 12,000 retirees.
UMWA, the miners' union, which has been pushing for Congress to pass legislation to save the pensions for years, said the new bill was a breakthrough.
""With this one bill, the United States Senate has taken a giant, bipartisan step forward in keeping America’s promise to our coal miners and their families,"" said UMWA President Cecil Roberts.
The bill does not address the future of the federal program to ensure medical coverage for miners suffering black lung disease, which UMWA has been urging lawmakers to address https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-coal-blacklung/u-s-coal-miners-discouraged-by-black-lung-meeting-with-mcconnell-idUSKCN1UI18G.
Manchin had included a measure to restore a higher coal excise tax to boost the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund in an earlier version of a pension bill, but said Wednesday he would introduce a separate bill to tackle that issue. For now, he said the Senate has a path forward to address the looming crisis facing the pension fund.
""This is not a solution that can be held off any longer and we must act now,"" he said.
A spokeswoman for McConnell did not comment on the timing of moving the bill through the Senate."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will offer farmers hurt by drought up to A$1 billion ($688.10 million) in cheap loans and grants, Prime Minister Scott Morrison is expected to announce on Thursday, as the government seeks to curb rising discontent from rural voters.
Farmers across Australia's east coast have been battling drought conditions for more than three years, wilting agricultural production and leaving some towns on the brink of running out of drinking water supplies.
With growing anger amongst the conservative government's traditional voter base, Morrison will pledge new financial aid, including temporary interest free loans, designed to allow farmers to stave-off bankruptcy.
""We have been back on the ground listening to farmers and their communities, and this package is a direct response to their feedback,"" Morrison will say, according to prepared remarks seen by Reuters.
""This is money in the pockets of our farmers to help keep their stock fed and watered, their staff and farm hands paid and their crops irrigated.""
Any small business deemed to be dependant on agriculture will be eligible for a concessional loans of up to A$500,000, payable over 10 years.
To ease the financial burden, the government said there will be no interest payable over the first two years of the loan, while businesses will then pay only interest on the loan between years three to five. Principal and interest payments will then be due from year six.
The financial aid package is being announced just weeks before the grain harvest, which typically begins in December.
Australia is among the world's top 10 exporters of the grain, the largest part of the country's agricultural sector that typically contributes about 2% to GDP.
But with almost no rain in recent months across New South Wales and Queensland, farmers do not expect to harvest any meaningful supplies, curtailing rural exports.
INTL FCStone on Wednesday said its poll of an unspecified number of clients pegged Australian wheat production at 15.54 million tonnes, 19.1% lower than Australia's official estimate of 19.2 million tonnes.
With lower production, Australia - typically one of the world's largest exporters - is also likely to lose greater market share in lucrative markets such as Indonesia and South Korea at a time of falling prices."

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Uber (N:UBER) said on Wednesday that it will allow passengers and drivers to record audio of their trips in Brazil and Mexico using a new feature in the app, as the ride-hailing company copes with recurring safety concerns during its trips. 
Uber has come under significant scrutiny over passenger safety in markets such as the United States and India but it has acknowledged particular problems in Latin America, where passengers and drivers have been robbed and assaulted and some even murdered.
Uber said the audio recording feature will debut in Latin America's two biggest markets but that it may eventually be rolled out elsewhere in the region and possibly beyond. 
While the company has not shared numbers, it has said in financial statements since its IPO that there are ""numerous and increasing reports"" of passengers or drivers in Latin America being ""victimized by violent crime, such as armed robbery, violent assault, and rape, while taking or providing a trip on our platform.""
By way of heading off privacy concern issues, Uber said that the recordings will be encrypted and will not be played back in the app. Instead, they can be sent to the company so that an employee can review they if someone alleges misconduct or crime during the ride. 
Uber will also share the recordings with law enforcement upon request. 
The recordings function only begins if either driver or passenger goes on the app and starts it. 
Uber did not provide a timeline for the release of the function, but said it would launch soon in both Brazil and Mexico, testing it in a handful of cities at first. 

""What we know is that as the economic issues in Latin America gets worse, the tendency is for crime to also get worse,"" said Claudia Woods, who leads Uber in Brazil, in an interview.

The deal benefited from aggressive bidding by investment banks and yield-hungry investors, according to Daniel Berger, senior market strategist at Municipal Market Data (MMD).
The spread for Illinois bonds due in 10 years over MMD's benchmark triple-A yield scale fell 11 basis points to 150 basis points.
""The penalty eased, but it's still a big penalty,"" Berger said, noting that Illinois spreads remain the widest among the states.
Illinois also has the lowest credit ratings compared to other states due to its $133.5 billion unfunded pension liability and chronic structural budget deficit.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) won $450 million of the bonds in competitive bidding, while  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital won the remaining $300 million.
""We were pleased to have entered the market near historic low interest rates and with solid investor demand, and the results reflect a low all-in interest cost that benefits Illinois taxpayers."" said Paul Chatalas, Illinois' capital markets director, in a statement.
Proceeds are earmarked in part for a six-year, $45 billion Rebuild Illinois infrastructure program passed earlier this year by the legislature, which also approved new funding from higher fees and taxes and a gambling expansion that includes additional casinos and sports betting.
The bond sale is Illinois' first since a constitutional challenge to some of its outstanding GO bonds was filed in a state court in July. The case is on appeal after it was dismissed in August.
Last month, the governor's budget office released a five-year forecast that showed the state's general fund deficit reaching $3.2 billion by fiscal 2025 along with an unpaid bill backlog that balloons to $19.2 billion. The forecast pointed to the state's ""unsustainable"" tax structure as a culprit. Governor J.B. Pritzker hopes voters will make a major change to the structure next year by adopting a constitutional amendment for graduated income tax rates."

Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) reports fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell Thursday.
Ahead of earnings, expectations are high that the company's hefty investments in streaming services Hulu, ESPN+ and Disney+ will likely keep profit in check.
The ramp-up in content spend comes as Disney seeks to boost its direct-to-consumer business, with the launch of its streaming service Disney+ set for Nov. 12.
The company has forecast losses in its direct-to-consumer business to rise to $900 million in the fiscal fourth quarter.
The performance of its studio-entertainment business, meanwhile, will also draw attention after it generated less revenue than expected in the third quarter despite massive success at the box office of its Marvel, Star Wars and namesake franchises.
Disney is expected to report earnings of 95 cents a share on revenue of $19.29 billion, according to estimates compiled by Investing.com. In the year-ago quarter, Disney earned $1.48 a share on revenue of $14.3 billion. 
Disney was off slightly on Wednesday but is up 19.7% this year.
  Take-Two Interactive   Software (NASDAQ:TTWO), meanwhile, will also report earnings after the market close.
The video game publisher is expected to report earnings of $1.69 a share on revenue of $921.77 million, with the bottom line likely driven by sales of its Borderland 3 game, which launched on Sept. 13. 
In the year-ago quarter, the company earned $1.52 a share on $583.4 million.
Borderlands 3 sold-in over five million units in its first five days, making it the fastest-selling title for both the series and the 2K Games publishing label.
The company highlighted ""incredibly strong"" PC sales of the game through the Epic Games Store as a key driver of performance.
Beyond earnings, guidance on net bookings, a measure commonly used by video-game companies, will also come into focus.
Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) shares were off 0.5% on Wednesday but are up 13.3% on the year.
2. Jobless Claims, Fed Speakers in Spotlight
The U.S. economic calendar is somewhat light for Thursday, with jobless claims and a handful of Fed speakers due.
At 8:30 AM ET, the Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended Nov. 2.
Economists forecast that initial jobless claims fell to 215,000 from 218,000 previously.
On the monetary policy front, speeches from Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan at 11:05 AM ET (16:05 GMT) and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic at 12:10 PM ET (17:10 GMT) will also be watched for further insight into the Federal Reserve's thinking.
Fed chairman Jerome Powell last week hinted that rates would remain low for as long as the outlook on economy stays the same and inflation continues to undershoot the central bank's 2% target.
On Wednesday, Chicago Fed president Charles Evans also raised expectations that the Fed is ready to stand pat on rates, saying that the fed funds rates is close to neutral – one that neither stimulates nor stifles economic growth.
3. Sterling on Watch as Bank of England Rate Decision Due
The Bank of England will deliver its interest rate decision at 7AM ET (12PM GMT), with many expecting the United Kingdom's central bank to keep rates steady amid Brexit and political uncertainty.
The Bank of England is expected to leave its benchmark  base rate at 0.75%. The rate has been at that level since August 2018.
The focus then, will shift to the central bank's growth and inflation forecasts, both of which are at risk of getting trimmed, potentially strengthening the case for a rate cut next year. 
Traders will also keep an eye on BoE governor Mark Carney' s press conference for further clues on monetary policy.
With a no-deal scenario averted, for the moment at least, the pound has been one of the outperforming currencies in recent months, but further upside is limited. 
""We don't expect any further significant unwinding in sterling's Brexit discount as all options remain open with regard to how Brexit is resolved -- ranging from no deal to Brexit cancelled, depending on the results of the December-12 general election and any referendum after the election,"" Action Economics said."

The initial public offering will be priced at between 16.50 euros and 19.90 euros per share, valuing the company between 3.15 and 3.8 billion euros, or slightly above expectations.
The state, which owns 72% of FDJ, will retain a 20% stake, allowing it to weigh on governance and strategic choices, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in an interview with newspaper Le Parisien before the prospectus was released. 
At the estimated sale price, the 52% stake would generate proceeds of 1.23 billion to 1.73 billion euros for the French state. The final pricing will be determined on Nov. 21, Le Maire said.
It would be the country's biggest IPO since that of French glass bottle maker  Verallia  (PA:VRLA), which went public in October at a market valuation of 3.2 billion euros, with gross proceeds of 888 million euros.
The privatisation of companies such as airports group (PA:ADP) and FDJ is integral to President Emmanuel Macron's plans to raise funds for innovation projects and boost the overall economy.
Le Maire said the subscription period will run from Nov. 7-19 for retail investors, with incentives such as a 2% discount on each share in exchange for a commitment to keep them for at least 18 months.

301,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 05:01PM ET</span>","Fearing Another Repo Spike, Janus Build Up Its Cash Pile","(Bloomberg) -- Janus Henderson Group Plc is bracing for a repeat of September’s repo-market turmoil to play out in the final weeks of 2019.
Nick Maroutsos, the firm’s global bonds co-head, expects that repo rates will “spike” as typical year-end funding strains emerge. The Fed has been injecting liquidity since Sept. 17 to calm money markets. But Maroutsos warned that may not be sufficient as banks pare back lending heading into the turn of the year as they shore up balance sheets to meet regulatory requirements.
For Maroutsos, the best way to prepare for the anticipated strains is by building up cash. The firm’s $1 billion Janus Short Duration Income exchange-traded fund, which trades under the ticker VNLA, typically keeps up to 5% of its holdings in cash, he said. He’s looking to increase that pile and then deploy it as banks step back.
“The way to take advantage of this is you have to be cash-rich,” Maroutsos said. “Dollars will be in high demand, so managers that have large amounts of dollars will be able to benefit probably.”
In September, the overnight repo rate spiked to four times usual levels at the time as cash reserves fell out of alignment with the volume of securities on dealer balance sheets. The episode prompted the Fed to step into the market with overnight and term repurchase agreement operations and to begin buying $60 billion of Treasury bills per month.
The turbulence presented an opportunity for some fund managers. Janus’s approach was to enter into short-dated dollar-yen forward contracts, which allowed it to effectively lend out greenbacks in exchange for yen cash.
It’s unclear what opportunities will arise this time around, Maroutsos said -- but he wants to be prepared. In 2018, repo spiked at year-end, with overnight rates soaring above 6%.
“There’s a number of ways to do it, the problem is we don’t know what that’s going to be right now,” Maroutsos said. “We’re waiting, we’re keeping an eye on it, and will be likely putting money to work here in the near-term.”
Papering Over
He’s not alone in warning of year-end turbulence.  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) strategists wrote last week that the Fed will need an “all in approach” to contain repo rates during the final weeks of 2019. The analysts also wrote that “sensible revisions” to capital requirements are needed, though impractical before year-end.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said last month that post-crisis regulations prevented his bank from deploying cash into the repo market during the September upheaval. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he was open to loosening those liquidity rules.
While that would help free up banks’ reserves, it’s unlikely to happen “overnight,” according to Maroutsos. The Fed could also address the problem through a permanent effort toward balance-sheet expansion, potentially in the form of a repo facility, a tool that would allow eligible banks to convert Treasuries into reserves on demand at an administered rate.
Either way, for him the Fed’s actions haven’t been enough to fix the deep-seated issues in the repo market.
“They’re kind of papering over the problem,” Maroutsos said. “They’re providing liquidity, which is helpful, but it doesn’t address the real issue at hand.”"

Consumer spending continues to drive the U.S. economy, even amid hints of inconsistency in the broader economy, according to the chief executive officer of online personal loan company LendingClub Corp.
“While the consumer remains strong, there’s volatility and a bit of anxiety,” CEO Scott Sanborn said in a phone interview after the company posted earnings. Consumers haven’t yet felt the impact of trade tensions, he added, but they may if higher tariffs start to bite.
Big bank results last month showed vigorous consumer spending, with CEOs including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase’s Jamie Dimon calling the consumer “healthy” and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). getting an upgrade on consumer strength. Analysts called credit cards a “bright spot” in earnings. That contrasted with slower commercial lending, as per  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP). earnings and a recent Federal Reserve loan officer survey.
LendingClub shares on Wednesday soared as much as 16%, the most intraday since May 8, after the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter results. Analysts highlighted progress on trimming expenses as employees move to Utah from San Francisco.
Sanborn said he’s “thrilled” with LendingClub’s move to Utah. He noted that the company’s post-move real estate costs have fallen 50% and salary expenses have dropped 25%.
LendingClub’s fastest-growing segment is now super-prime lending to the highest credit-quality borrowers, Sanborn said. Meanwhile, loans with “mature vintages” continue to see solid performance. The company’s number one “use case” continues to be customers swapping expensive credit card debt for cheaper personal loans, he said, adding that the spread between personal loans and credit cards is at a high.
LendingClub is forging ahead with efforts to secure a bank charter, though “the timelines are tough to call,” he said. The company is already highly engaged with regulators and would like the “clarity” of having a primary charter.
“We have all the procedures,” including costs, of a bank charter, Sanborn said. But LendingClub isn’t “getting the benefits.”"
303,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 04:59PM ET</span>",Smartphone Rebound Sparks Signs of Life in Asia’s Tech Cycle,"(Bloomberg) -- A technology slump that has dogged Asia’s manufacturing economies is showing signs of bottoming.
That’s potentially good news for a region where exports of electronics goods on average account for around 30% of shipments, according to an estimate by ING Bank.
Asia is the world’s dominant producer of semiconductors, optical lenses, memory chips and display screens that are used in every day goods like smartphones and cameras.
A big fall off in tech sales has hurt economic growth and forced central banks and governments to respond by lowering interest rates and rolling out fiscal support.
Now, better demand for smartphones -- global sales rose on a quarterly basis only for the first time in two years during the third quarter -- is signaling a nascent recovery.
Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co., the world’s biggest handset maker, said its smartphones enjoyed solid demand in the third quarter. The company also saw its mobile-display orders rise as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). launched its latest iPhone.
Apple projected fiscal first-quarter revenue that beat analysts’ estimates while Sony Corp (T:6758). signaled buoyant demand for the image sensors used in smartphone cameras.
“Smartphones are leading the tech industry to recovery,” said Neil Mawston, executive director at the London-based Strategy Analytics.
South Korea, the bellwether for global trade and home to some of the world’s biggest semiconductor, smartphone and display makers, is where the nascent recovery will be tested.
Samsung, which also dominates memory chips, said the inventory of dynamic random access memory -- or DRAM, its biggest cash cow -- would probably “normalize” in the first half of 2020 and prices for NAND rebound by the end of this year.
That outlook came as data showed chip inventories in South Korea fell the most in more than two years on a monthly basis in September. On a yearly basis, the inventory still went up, but the pace of rise slowed for two months in a row, the first back-to-back deceleration since last year.
“The bottom line is how quickly these chip inventories are cleared out,” said Mun Byung-ki, a researcher at the Korea International Trade Association in Seoul. “Demand for server DRAM has to come back even though there’s a clear recovery in NAND.”
Semiconductor prices are expected to bottom in the first quarter of next year,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Bank economist Angela Hsieh wrote in a Nov. 1 report.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). economists Marie Kim and Jeeho Yoon also said in a Nov. 1 report that they were “cautiously monitoring to see a turn-around of the semiconductor cycle, and expect Korea’s semiconductor exports to turn positive in the second quarter next year.”
The game changer for tech exporters over coming years is the expected roll out of 5G, or fifth-generation mobile networks, that promise wireless transfers of data dozens times faster than conventional devices.
South Korea and the U.S. earlier this year rolled out commercial 5G networks, and China is trying to catch up by offering discounts to smartphone users that migrate to the nation’s own infrastructure.
Yet that roll out is sputtering due to heightened technology tensions between the U.S. and China.
“Upside prospects for this sector remain very limited unless 5G becomes more of a reality,” ING economists led by Rob Carnell wrote in a recent note. “And that is where the trade war is important, because while this still rages, 5G remains a distant prospect.”
Displays are another sector that serves as a barometer of tech demand. While liquid crystal displays -- a flat-panel technology widely popular for low prices -- continue to suffer in sales, organic light-emitting diodes have been gaining ground as the go-to screens for high-end devices such as the iPhone and LG OLED televisions.
Data from South Korea’s international trade association shows the nation’s OLED cycle has bottomed out, as revenue returns to levels seen last year.
“With an inventory glut having been worked off, there are tentative signs that Asia’s electronics export cycle is bottoming out,” according to Vincent Tsui, an analyst at Gavekal."
304,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 04:54PM ET</span>",Stocks - Trade Uncertainty Takes the Fizz out of Rally,"Investing.com – Many investors want or expect stocks to move higher, but a little buyer reluctance took over the stock market on Wednesday.
The caution was caused in large part by news reports that the signing of a U.S.-China trade deal may be delayed until December, assuming a site for the signing can be chosen and the last details negotiated.
The S&P 500 finished up 2 points, and traded within a range of about 12.5 points. The Dow Jones industrials were basically flat at 27,492.56, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.3% 8,410.63.
The number of stocks hitting 52-week highs fell to 117 on Wednesday from 285 on Tuesday.
The wrinkle in the trade deal was born out of Chile's decision to cancel the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. It was to be held this month in Santiago, with President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign the trade deal at that time.
But local protests about economic conditions turned nasty, forcing the Trump Administration and Xi's government to work on finding a new site, possibly in Sweden or Switzerland.
 
The final details of what is expected to be the first of several agreements are still being negotiated. A key detail for China is for the U.S. to scrap tariffs, due in December, on $156 billion in goods including cell phones, laptop computers and toys. It also wants relief on tariffs imposed in September on goods including machinery, semiconductors and furniture.
So, the market stalled. The S&P 500 had risen 6.34% between Oct. 8 and its closing high of 3,078 on Monday, a fairly rapid rise, especially considering the index is up 22.7% on the year. Clearly, some traders saw the trade news and decided to wait.
What little excitement came on a Wall Street Journal report that Xerox (NYSE:XRX) might try to take over computer-maker HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), better known as simply Hewlett-Packard. HP was up 6.4%. Xerox rose 3.6%, both among the 10 biggest S&P 590 gainers on the day. 
While 20 Dow stocks were higher, Boeing (NYSE:BA) was off 1.1%, and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) dropped 2.8% as excitement faded that the pharmacy giant might try to go private. One reason is that Stephen Schwarzman, CEO of Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group called the idea ""a stretch."" Blackstone has been involved in many of the largest buyouts. 
The declines for Boeing and Walgreens subtracted more than 39 points from the Dow on a day when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was up 0.04% and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) slipped 0.28%. 
Health, real estate, consumer staples and financial stocks were the market leaders. Energy shares were lower as oil prices fell in response to the trade-deal news.
Interest rates also moved lower with the United States 10-Year Treasury yield down to 1.821% from Tuesday's 1.865%. Gold was up $9.40 to $1,493.10 in New York as some investors looked for safe havens.
Cosmetic company Coty (NYSE:COTY), health company DaVita HealthCare Partners (NYSE:DVA), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) were the S&P 500 leaders.
Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG), packaging company   Sealed Air   (NYSE:SEE), drugmaker Perrigo (NYSE:PRGO) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) were the S&P 500 laggards.

The streaming-device company downgraded its full-year adjusted earnings (EBITDA) outlook to a range of $30 million to $35 million from a previous range of $30 million to $40 million. The downgraded guidance was blamed on continued investment in the business as well as an approximately $5m headwind related to dataxu operations and dataxu-acquisition-related expenses.

313,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 03:32PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S.-China trade deal signing could be delayed to December; London a possible venue - source,"By David Brunnstrom and Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign a long-awaited interim trade deal could be delayed until December as discussions continue over terms and venue, a senior official of the Trump administration told Reuters on Wednesday.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was still possible the ""phase one"" agreement aimed at ending a damaging trade war would not be reached, but a deal was more likely than not.
Dozens of venues have been suggested for the meeting, which had originally been scheduled to take place on the sidelines of a now-canceled mid-November summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Chile, the official said.
One possible location is London, where the two leaders could meet after a NATO summit that Trump is due to attend from Dec. 3-4, the official said. ""It's under consideration but nothing decided,"" the official said.
Other sites are possible in Europe and Asia, but the former is more likely, with Sweden and Switzerland among the possibilities. Iowa, which Trump has suggested, appeared to have been ruled out, the official said.
China's latest push for more tariff rollbacks would be discussed, but was not expected to derail progress toward an interim deal. 
The official said China was believed to see a quick deal as its best chance for favorable terms, given pressure Trump is facing from a congressional impeachment inquiry as he seeks re-election in 2020.
U.S. Treasury prices gained on Wednesday on word that the talks could be delayed, while some investors also repositioned after a three-day sell-off. The dollar slid and the three-day global stock market rally paused as U.S. productivity data disappointed and investors turned a bit cautious about U.S.-China trade talks.
""Negotiations are continuing and progress is being made on the text of the phase one agreement,"" White House spokesman Judd Deere said. ""We will let you know when we have an announcement on a signing location.”
China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
An interim U.S.-China deal is widely expected to include a U.S. pledge to scrap tariffs scheduled for Dec. 15 on about $156 billion worth of Chinese imports, including cell phones, laptop computers and toys. 
People familiar with the negotiations said on Monday that China has been pushing Trump to remove more tariffs imposed in September as part of the first phase of the deal. A U.S. official said the fate of the Dec. 15 tariffs is being considered as part of negotiations.
A source briefed on the talks told Reuters on Tuesday that Chinese negotiators want Washington to drop 15% tariffs on about $125 billion worth of Chinese goods that went into effect on Sept. 1. They are also seeking relief from earlier 25% tariffs on about $250 billion of imports from machinery and semiconductors to furniture.
A person familiar with China's negotiating position said it is continuing to press Washington to ""remove all tariffs as soon as possible.""
Since Trump took office in 2017, his administration has been pressing China to curb massive subsidies to state-owned firms and end the forced transfer of American technology to Chinese firms as a price of doing business in China.
Analysts say the phase one deal will fail to adequately address these issues, focusing largely on Chinese purchases of U.S. farm goods and intellectual property protections related to copyright and trademark issues. It will not address industrial subsidies at all.
Venues that have been talked about for the Trump-Xi meeting have ranged from Alaska to Greece.
One Chinese official said Beijing was floating the possibility of a meeting in Greece, where Xi is due to arrive this Sunday, after which he will head to Brazil for a summit of major emerging market countries which starts on Nov. 13.

Multiple U.S. sources have said a signing in Greece was unlikely.

314,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 03:31PM ET</span>","Blackstone CEO is optimistic U.S., China will agree trade deal","By Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman said on Wednesday he was optimistic that the United States and China would resolve their 16-month-long trade war, helping to ease tensions between two of the world's biggest economies.
""It looks like things have lined up to go forward and I think there's good faith at this point to start things,"" Schwarzman said in an interview at a Reuters Newsmaker event in New York.
American and Chinese officials have been racing to finalize a ""phase one"" interim trade agreement before new U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, including electronics, toys, and laptops, take effect from Dec. 15.
That agreement is expected to be concluded later this month and signed by U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, resulting a truce in the trade war.
""If agreement number one is done, which I would expect would happen, then it will lead to the second agreement, which will have more things in it, so I think there's reason for optimism in terms of what's going on,"" Schwarzman said.
U.S. economic growth has slowed this year, reaching 1.9% in the third quarter, according to the Commerce Department, due to a decline in business investment triggered by trade tensions.
This slowdown has heightened concerns of an impending economic recession amid other warning indicators, including the inversion of the U.S. yield curve during the summer. An inverted yield curve has preceded every U.S. recession since 1955.
But Schwarzman said he does not expect a recession to happen anytime soon since personal consumption, which accounts for 70% of the economy, remains strong.
""The consumers are doing quite well and it's the first time in many years that in part of our economic scale people are out-earning inflation,"" Schwarzman said.
""When that happens, people spend money. I expect there to be a continued wage pressure because we're starting to run out of workers and this will continue as a sort of economic cycle for a while.""
Schwarzman has had close links with China dating back more than a decade, when the country's sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corporation, paid $3 billion for up to 12.5% of New York-based Blackstone. CIC has since sold down that stake.
Blackstone has become one of the biggest U.S. investors in China's property sector. Schwarzman is also the founder of the Schwarzman Scholars, a one-year international scholarship program based in Tsinghua University in Beijing."

316,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 02:38PM ET</span>",Flood of trades sends Uber to record low as insiders allowed to sell,"By Noel Randewich and Supantha Mukherjee
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc's (N:UBER) stock dropped 3% to a record low in its busiest trading session since the ride-hailing company's Wall Street debut as employees and early investors on Wednesday became free to sell their shares.
Over 110 million shares, worth around $3 billion, had been traded at mid-day, second only to the 186 million shares exchanged in Uber's first session on the stock market on May 10.
The majority of Uber's 1.7 billion outstanding shares were restricted from trading until Wednesday, a so-called lockup period intended to avoid an avalanche of sales for the newly public company that could have undermined the stock price.
The end of Uber's lockup comes at a time of growing reluctance on Wall Street to make risky bets on a host of money-losing heavyweight startups that held highly promoted public listings this year. 
With Wednesday's loss, Uber has fallen more than 40% since its IPO as the company, which lost $1.2 billion in the September-quarter, struggles to win investor confidence. 
In its IPO filing, Uber had said about 76% of its shares held by insiders, venture capitalists and other investors faced lockup.
Uber's stock has tumbled 14% since Monday, when the San Francisco company reported an increased quarterly loss as it outspent rivals on discounts to lure customers and invested heavily in loss-making new business ventures.
""Some of the sell-off over the last few days has been attributed to the fear of additional liquidity coming into the market as a result of the lockup expiration today, and people were trying to get ahead of that,"" said Matt Novak, managing partner at All Blue Capital, an Uber investor. 
Early investors and employees may be reluctant to sell their shares since the stock has fallen so far.
BEATING
SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), which has invested billions in Uber to become its largest investor, in 2017 bought preferred stock at $48.77 per share and common shares at $32.97 apiece from existing shareholders, including co-founder Travis Kalanick. Uber's common stock last traded at $27.
The Japanese firm, which took a beating on its investment in office-sharing startup WeWork, earlier on Wednesday reported its first quarterly loss in 14 years, hurt by an $8.9 billion hit at its giant Vision Fund.
Uber also counts Benchmark Capital, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Alphabet (O:GOOGL) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) among its top investors. 
In September, WeWork scuttled its much-anticipated market debut due to skepticism about its business model, corporate governance and burgeoning losses. That development led to increased reluctance among many investors to own money-losing companies trading at high multiples.
Unprofitable U.S. companies holding IPOs this year have had a median stock return of 0%, compared to a median increase of 3% for profitable companies that held IPOs, according to a Reuters analysis. The S&P 500 is up 22% in 2019 after closing at a record high on Monday.
Longbow Asset Management in recent days has started to buy shares of Uber, its smaller rival  Lyft  (O:LYFT), social media website Pinterest (N:PINS) and online pet store Chewy (N:CHWY), said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive of the investment advisory firm in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Lyft has fallen 41% from its March IPO and Pinterest is down 44% from its August high following its April listing. Chewy surged 70% in three sessions after its debut, but since then has steadily declined and now remains up just 6% from its IPO price. 

""I wasn't interested in a lot of these companies at their IPO prices, but now that they're down 30 or 40 percent, they're interesting to me,"" Dollarhide said. ""I'm in the business of buying when things look bleak.""

317,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 02:22PM ET</span>",Tiffany asks LVMH to raise its $14.5 billion offer: sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Tiffany & Co (N:TIF) has asked Bulgari owner LVMH (PA:LVMH) to raise its $14.5 billion acquisition offer, arguing that it significantly undervalues the U.S. jewelry chain, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
Tiffany's board decided that LVMH's $120-per-share, all-cash bid was too low to become the basis for negotiations, the sources said. Tiffany informed LVMH it could open its books and provide confidential due diligence if the French luxury group sweetens its offer, the sources added.
LVMH remains engaged and is considering a new offer, according to the sources. The exact numbers being discussed could not be learned. Sources have previously said Tiffany's board saw a price level of $140 per share, which its shares reached last year, as key to reaching a deal.
The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Tiffany and LVMH did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Jewelry was one of the strongest performing areas of the luxury industry in 2018, according to consultancy Bain & Co, which forecast that comparable sales in the $20 billion global market were set to grow 7% this year.
Tiffany, founded in New York in 1837 and featured in the 1961 movie ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" starring Audrey Hepburn, had struggled with falling annual sales and profit since 2015, before a revenue turnaround in 2017.
Under Chief Executive Alessandro Bogliolo, former head of fashion firm Diesel and a Bulgari alumnus, Tiffany has been building up its e-commerce business, and is trying to court younger shoppers with more affordable pendants and earrings and new designs.
However, LVMH believes Tiffany needs to spend more on reinventing and marketing its brands, and that it can achieve this only as a division of LVMH, according to the sources.
LVMH's 2011 purchase of Bulgari boosted its smallest and newest business division, jewelry and watches, which also includes Hublot and Tag Heuer watches. Nonetheless, that business accounted for 9% of revenue and 7% of LVMH earnings in 2018, about only a fifth the size of its core fashion and handbag business, home to brands like Christian Dior, Givenchy and Louis Vuitton.
Acquiring Tiffany would increase LVMH's exposure to the bridal and diamond category, as well as to U.S. luxury shoppers. Should there be a deal, LVMH plans to keep the Bulgari and Tiffany's brands separate, according to one of the sources.

UniCredit has been a long-time shareholder in the venerable merchant bank, which for most of Italy's post-war history was at the centre of a web of cross-shareholdings allowing it to call the shots at Italy Inc.
Though Mediobanca has in recent years exited many of its investments in other companies, it remains the biggest shareholder in Europe's third-largest insurer Generali (MI:GASI).
Credito Italiano, the bank that UniCredit grew out of, was among the founders of Mediobanca in 1946.
UniCredit, which was Mediobanca's largest shareholder prior to the sale, is selling the stake at an average price of 10.53 euros per share, according to one of the bookrunners for the sale, for an overall value of around 780 million euros ($863.4 million).
Mediobanca shares have risen 46% since the start of the year, compared with a 21% rise in the Italian banking index (FTIT8300).
The stake sale is the latest in a string of disposals and other measures to reduce UniCredit's exposure to Italy by Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier. The Frenchman, who is aiming to bolster the bank's balance sheet, will present UniCredit's third-quarter results on Thursday.
The sale comes as Mediobanca's strategy of diversifying away from investment banking and into consumer credit and wealth management has faced attack from billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio, who unexpectedly bought a 7.5% stake between September and October.
UniCredit's exit leaves Del Vecchio, founder of the Luxottica eyewear group, as Mediobanca's top shareholder and there has been recurring speculation in local media that he plans to increase his holding.
However, UniCredit said in its statement it had requested the placement be made to a diversified pool of investors, indicating it was not selling the stake to Del Vecchio.
A source close to the matter said that with UniCredit's exit Del Vecchio may have lost a potential ally in its fight to promote change at Mediobanca.
BofA Securities (N:BA),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and UniCredit Corporate & Investment Banking are acting as joint bookrunners of the placement."
319,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 02:16PM ET</span>",Chile copper mine output largely unaffected by protests despite some attacks,"By Fabian Cambero and Anthony Esposito
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's copper mines have mostly maintained production and kept operations running normally in the face of weeks of unrest in the country, industry insiders told Reuters, though scattered incidents have hit some operations and uncertainty lingers.
The Chile protests show little sign of letting up despite measures taken by President Sebastian Pinera. While most mines are in remote areas, managers and analysts worried that continued unrest could hurt operations that make Chile the world's top copper producer, responsible for around 28% of global production.
""If the crisis worsens, and major political demands are made again, major unions get involved, general strikes are organized ... no doubt there will be vulnerabilities to the services that mining firms require,"" said Juan Carlos Guajardo, head of the consultancy Plusmining.
""We are calm now, but we don't know if it will last,"" said the head of a major private mining company.
Some major miners have suffered direct attacks on parts of their facilities. Vandals lit on fire a water pump station at mining firm  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) Plc's flagship Pelambres copper mine, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The company said in a statement that ""ancillary infrastructure outside Los Pelambres perimiter"" was damaged.
Copper prices rose on Tuesday after Antofagasta doubled its forecast production cut from Chile to about 10,000 tonnes this year due to the protests.
Still, that was a tiny percentage of the company's total production of 725,300 tonnes of copper in 2018. Antofagasta's other Chilean mines are now operating normally, it said Monday.
Other miners have had problems with port facilities, public transportation and supply chains and brief walk outs at some operations. To skirt road blockages, some mines use small planes to fly in personnel and some supplies.
The mayhem in capital city Santiago hindered transportation to and from Anglo American's Los Bronces mine, on the outskirts of the city. The firm said it put in place ""a contingency plan"" to minimize an impact on operations.
At the start of the protests unidentified individuals also set fire to the entrance of Anglo American's Chagres smelter and burned two company buses, the firm said.
Lumina Copper's Caserones mine, controlled in a partnership of JX Holding and Mitsui Mining said that due to the ongoing protests its operations are now using ""minimal personnel.""    
Mining unions and port workers have threatened to go on strike in solidarity with the larger social movements, but have so far remained on the job.
Last week, BHP said its Escondida copper mine, the world's largest, was operating at a ""reduced rate"" after union workers walked off the job for part of the day in solidarity with the anti-government protest movement.
By the next day Escondida was operating normally."

322,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 01:04PM ET</span>","StockBeat: Sonos Soars, Analyst Says It Hits All the Apple Notes","Investing.com – Sonos surged on Wednesday as one Wall Street analyst said the audio company could be next on the shopping list for big tech firms, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) touted as a potential suitor.
With its push into connected home efforts, which needs improvement, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would ""materially"" benefit from making a play for Sonos, said D.A. Davidson analyst Thomas Forte. Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) rose 5%.
The spotlight on smaller hardware makers rose to the fore less than a week ago, when Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) bought wearables company Fitbit in a $2.1 billion deal. Apple was also rumored to be circling but was not prepared to cut as big a check as Google did for the wearables company.
Sonos, however, hits all the right notes for Apple to take notice, boasting many similarities such as high product quality and design acumen. Sonos can also charge a premium given its superior brand status, according to Forte.
""Just as Fitbit fills a void for Google when it comes to healthcare-related data, acquiring Sonos could materially advance Apple's connected home efforts (an area we believe it needs improvement and where its own product, the HomePod, was a disappointment),"" he added.
But there could be one hitch to a potential Apple-Sonos deal – regulation.
The regulatory powers have grown wary of big tech's growing influence and may not be eager to rubber-stamp a deal, Forte suggested.
Sonos is up 45% for the year so far."

324,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 12:36PM ET</span>",Amazon's rising air shipments fly in the face of climate plan,"By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) Chief Executive Jeff Bezos has plans to slash greenhouse gas emissions from the online retailer's delivery operations. 
Yet the company's use of airplanes - the most climate-damaging mode of transportation - is on the rise, according to data provided to Reuters.
Amazon Air's U.S. volume has risen steadily since its 2016 launch, according to an analysis of Department of Transportation data by Cargo Facts Consulting https://www.cargofactsconsulting.com, a Luxembourg-based advisory firm with a global staff and more than four decades of history. 
It crunched data from Air Transport Services Group Inc (O:ATSG) and  Atlas Air Worldwide  Holdings (O:AAWW). Both supply planes and pilots for Amazon Air. 
In July, Amazon Air flew 136 million lbs of goods in the United States, according to the data. That was up 29% from the year earlier and just 9 million lbs short of December 2018, when the peak holiday shipping season was in full swing. 
For a graphic on fast delivery fuels more Amazon Air flights, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/AMAZON-AIRPLANES/0H001QXH999X/eikon.png
Bezos has said Amazon will cut its use of airplanes as it builds more local warehouses and fills them with goods that it can deliver to customer doorsteps in one day, or even one hour.
But for the time being, Amazon's air shipments are climbing as it speeds up deliveries to lure customers and pressure rivals like Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT). 
In April, Amazon started offering no-minimum purchase, one-day free shipping to members of its Prime subscription service.
In the latest quarter, it saw delivery costs soar, and warned the holiday quarter would see costs for one-day shipping alone spike to $1.5 billion.    
The Seattle e-retailer, which sends 10 billion packages a year, declined to say what percentage of its shipments travel by plane or give specific examples of how the latest drive to shave time off its standard two-day shipping affected air transport. 
Last month, Amazon said its CO2 emissions in 2018 were 44.4 million metric tons and set a goal to be net carbon neutral by 2040. 
""We expect the percent of total shipments to customers utilizing air transportation to reduce from year to year as we significantly increase one and same day shipments,"" Amazon spokesman Sam Kennedy said, when asked about Cargo Facts' data.
DELIVERY WARS
A standard package flown on a plane in the United States creates an estimated 6-10 times more CO2 emissions than one traveling by truck, said Jacques Leonardi, a senior research fellow in freight, logistics and sustainable distribution at the University of Westminster in London.
Amazon Air leases 47 planes and is expected have 50 by the end of the year. It operates roughly 110 daily flights in the United States and around 20 per day in Europe, according to Cargo Facts. 
In June, shortly after FedEx Corp (N:FDX) said its planes would stop shuttling packages for the online retailer, Amazon Air announced plans to have 70 planes on lease by 2021.
But Amazon says it is getting closer to customers with an expanding network of well-stocked warehouses. Those local fulfillment centers underpin the company's one-day and same-day delivery services. 
In a news release issued Monday, Amazon said those options were ""better for the planet"" because there aren't many miles in the trip to customer doorsteps.
Because those time windows are so tight, ""you are eliminating the possibility of air transportation,"" Amazon's Bezos said in September. ""Even though it's counterintuitive, the fact of the matter is that shorter delivery times end up being less carbon-intensive than longer delivery times."" 
Products from most of Amazon's 158 U.S. distribution centers can be shipped to 65% of the population in one day, said Marc Wulfraat, president of supply chain consultancy MWPVL International. 
Items like footwear, jewelry, auto parts and niche electronics come from 23 distribution centers that span the country - and will likely need to be moved by air for next-day delivery, Wulfraat said. 
Amazon also depends on  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) for air shipments. The Atlanta-based delivery company has seen a bump in that business since Amazon began expanding free one-day delivery this spring, UPS executives and analysts said. 
Domestic next day air volume at UPS surged more than 30% in the second quarter and was up nearly 24% in the third quarter - fueled by faster e-commerce shipping speeds and rival FedEx's breakup with Amazon this summer. 
""It's not all from FedEx,"" said Satish Jindel, the founder of logistics advisory firm ShipMatrix, noting that express and deferred air services revenue at UPS surged $852 million in the second and third quarters. 

Amazon's business was worth about $900 million to FedEx prior to their split, Jindel said. Express, which includes air shipments, accounted for roughly $540 million of that, he said.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Coca-Cola (N:KO) is committed to collecting and recycling plastic bottles rather than switching to aluminum cans as the world's largest soft drinks maker seeks to reduce its carbon footprint, its chief executive officer told Reuters.
Along with multinational rivals including PepsiCo (O:PEP) and Nestle (S:NESN), Coca-Cola has started offering recyclable aluminum cans as well as plastic bottles for some water brands as the industry reacts to public outrage over the world's oceans being polluted with plastic waste.
But Coca-Cola's launch of a range of cans for sparkling water in the United States is not part of a broader shift, said CEO James Quincey during an interview in Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos.
""We are not trying to engineer a strategic shift from plastic to aluminum,"" said Quincey, adding that the firm was ""focused on collecting"" and has a collection rate of about 59%.
Quincey said import tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum that U.S. President Donald Trump set in 2018 to preserve national security would also not alter its plan.
""It's not so big that it's going to make us change our strategy,"" said Quincey on the impact of the tariffs.
""Given the relative weight of aluminum in our total business, it hasn't caused a big change in strategy - just a cost increase that fed through to the consumers,"" he said.
Last year Coca-Cola pledged to collect and recycle a bottle or can for every one it sells globally by 2030.
The company adopts different methods around the world to collect bottles. In some countries it uses a deposit return scheme that enables consumers to return bottles in exchange for incentives - such as cash, vouchers or a points-scheme. It also works with private firms that employ collection agents to retrieve used bottles.
""A recycled PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottle has a much lower carbon footprint than an aluminum can or a returned glass bottle,"" said Quincey.
He said collecting and reusing bottles was a ""better long term answer"" than switching to cans.

Last month environmental group Greenpeace said Coca-Cola was the world's biggest producer of plastic waste for the second year in a row.
Working with the Break Free From Plastic movement, it said 11,732 branded Coca-Cola plastics were recorded in 37 countries - more than the next three top global polluters combined.
But Coke's CEO said this was just a reflection of the drinks company being the ""biggest brand"".
Coca-Cola beat Wall Street estimates with quarterly revenue of $9.51 billion last month, prompting the company to give an upbeat forecast for 2019."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. investors last week pulled $4.1 billion from mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that hold domestic stocks, extending a pullback from the U.S. equities market that has now lasted for five of the last six weeks, according to data released Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute.
The withdrawals came during a week in which the Federal Reserve continued its pace of equity-friendly interest rate cuts, helping propel the benchmark S&P 500 to record highs. Yet concerns over the trade war between the United States and China and the possibility of a recession over the next 12 months have weighed on investor sentiment, pushing investors into the perceived safety of bonds.
For the year to date, investors have pulled nearly $118.5 billion from U.S. stock funds. Over the same time, bond funds have brought in nearly $366.1 billion in new assets despite yields that are historically low. The $11.3 billion investors deposited into the category last week continued a winning streak for bond funds that began in early August.
World stock funds, meanwhile experienced approximately $2.7 billion in outflows, the largest weekly drop since late August. For the year to date, investors have pulled nearly $46 billion from the category."
330,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 12:02PM ET</span>","Former UAW official, GM board member charged in UAW investigation","By David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Former United Auto Workers vice president Joseph Ashton was charged on Wednesday with conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud, the latest person named in a wide-ranging corruption probe into the union.
Ashton, a former General Motors Co (N:GM) board member, conspired with other union officials to receive ""hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes and kickbacks,"" charging documents alleged in U.S. District Court in Detroit. 
The U.S. Attorney's Office said it expected to seek the forfeiture of approximately $250,000 from Ashton, who left the GM board in December 2017 amid the federal investigation.
GM said in a statement it was ""deeply disturbed by Joe Ashton’s alleged criminal conduct. GM was not aware of this illegal activity until it was recently revealed by the government’s investigation.""
Ashton's lawyer did not immediately comment.
Federal prosecutors said Ashton and other UAW officials steered an inflated $4 million contract to a vendor to provide 58,000 watches to UAW members. The watches were never distributed and remain in storage in Detroit.
On Sunday, UAW President Gary Jones, who has been linked https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-corruption-labor/federal-corruption-probe-hits-home-for-uaw-boss-contract-talks-under-storm-cloud-idUSKCN1VI229 to the corruption probe by U.S. federal officials, took a paid leave of absence. 
Acting UAW President Rory Gamble said the allegations ""are completely inexcusable and violate UAW’s long-standing standards of conduct ... The UAW remains focused on negotiating and finalizing strong contracts for our members, especially during this round of auto negotiations.""
The FBI has been conducting a wide-ranging investigation into illegal payoffs to UAW officials by  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA). The union had hoped the 2018 election of former regional director Jones as president would put the federal probe behind it. 
The probe also expanded to look at the conduct of UAW officials, like Ashton, tied with managing the union's relationship with GM.
To date, 10 people have pleaded guilty in connection with the criminal investigation into illegal payoffs. Last month, Jeffery Pietrzyk, a former high-level official in the UAW’s GM Department, pleaded guilty to conspiring with other UAW officials to engage in honest services fraud by taking over $123,000 in bribes and kickbacks from UAW vendors and contractors.
The widening probe raises questions about whether the U.S. government might seek to take over the UAW. 

In 1988, the U.S. Justice Department sued to force out senior leaders at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union and appoint a trustee because of the union's connection to organized crime. The government oversaw the union from March 1989 until 2015, when it agreed to a five-year transition period that will end in February 2020.

331,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 12:01PM ET</span>",Second U.S. law firm plots rival London forex class action,"By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - U.S law firm Hausfeld plans to battle Scott & Scott for a high-profile London class action against major banks over alleged foreign exchange (forex) rigging, a London court heard on Wednesday.
Hausfeld, which co-led a similar U.S. case against 15 banks with compatriot Scott & Scott and helped secure $2.3 billion in settlements for American claimants, has written to defendant banks to say it plans to file its own, so-called collective proceedings order (CPO) by the end of November, the court heard.
JPMorgan (N:JPM),  Citigroup  (N:C),  Barclays  (L:BARC), UBS (S:UBSG) and RBS (L:RBS) already face a potentially vast class action since being fined more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) by the European Commission in May over cartels dubbed ""Essex Express"" and ""Three Way Banana Split"".
That lawsuit -- led by Michael O'Higgins, the former chairman of British watchdog The Pensions Regulator and funded by litigation finance group Therium -- was filed by Scott & Scott in July.
""There is, waiting in the wings, an additional CPO application in what U.S. lawyers call a 'carriage dispute' regarding who acts as a representative for the class,"" judge Marcus Smith told the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT).
""It's quite clear, if you have two opt-out CPO applications in relation to the same subject matter, only one can prevail.""
Citigroup, JPMorgan and UBS declined to comment. RBS and Barclays were not immediately available to comment.
The Hausfeld letter was referred to at the first court hearing in the O'Higgins case against the five banks over allegations that forex cartels caused harm to pension funds, asset managers, hedge funds and companies.
A spokeswoman for Hausfeld confirmed the firm was considering filing a class action ""relating to unlawful manipulation of the foreign exchange spot market between 2007 to 2013"". She was unable to comment further. 
Some of the world's biggest investment banks have paid more than a combined $11 billion in fines to settle U.S. and European regulatory allegations that traders rigged foreign exchange markets.
Foreign exchange is the crown jewel of London's financial sector. With about 43% percent of the $6.6 trillion-per-day forex market traded here, lawyers have jostled for position since the Consumer Rights Act introduced the first ""opt-out"" class actions for breaches of UK or EU competition law in 2015.
In such cases, UK-based members of a defined group will automatically be bound into legal action unless they opt out, while overseas-based claimants actively have to sign up.
If the O'Higgins case passes preliminary challenges, the tribunal plans to decide on the class action application in early 2021. 

""We are encouraged that the judge has set out a timetable to move things along,"" O'Higgins said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said on Wednesday he would forgo ""tens of millions of dollars"" in compensation after asking the company's board of directors to waive his bonuses on Saturday.
Chairman Dave Calhoun said on Tuesday Muilenburg had asked not to receive any bonuses for 2019 or equity grants and not to receive any new equity grants until the 737 MAX airplane had returned to full service, which might not happen until early 2021. Muilenburg also said he planned to make significant donations to a fund to help the families of 346 people killed in two fatal 737 MAX crashes. 
""It's not about my money,"" Muilenburg said at The New York Times DealBook Conference. 
Muilenburg received $23.4 million in total compensation for 2018 and came under criticism from lawmakers for not immediately taking a cut in his compensation following the Lion Air crash in October 2018. 
He said he was forgoing the bonuses to ""send a message of responsibility.""
A Boeing spokesman said on Wednesday Muilenburg ""has committed to donating the entire value of any previous equity grants that vest in 2020.""
Calhoun gave Muilenburg a strong vote of confidence on Tuesday, saying the board believed Muilenburg ""has done everything right.""
Muilenburg said he would like to still be Boeing's CEO in three years. 
""As long the board allows me to serve in this role, I am going to serve in it,"" he said. 
Muilenburg also said the company would support reforms of a long-standing practice of the Federal Aviation Administration, of delegating certification tasks for new airplanes to Boeing and other manufacturers. Several reports faulted this delegation process in the 737 MAX review.
In the case of the 737 MAX, 40% of the certification tasks for the jet were delegated to Boeing.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank (T:9984) plunged to its first quarterly loss in 14 years on Wednesday, dragged down by an $8.9 billion hit at its giant Vision Fund, as CEO Masayoshi Son admitted poor investment judgment and turning a blind eye to problems at startup WeWork.
The scale of the loss shows the risks in Son's strategy of splashing out big on cash-burning startups. It has also cast a pall on his efforts to raise a second massive fund.
WeWork's spectacular flame-out this year has sparked questions about Son's judgment in backing unconventional tech founders such as WeWork's Adam Neumann. SoftBank was forced last month to spend more than $10 billion to bail out the office-sharing startup after its IPO attempt flopped.
""My investment judgment was poor in many ways and I am reflecting deeply on that,"" Son, 62, told a news conference following the results. It was a remarkable admission for an executive well known for his ebullience.
He said he had turned a blind eye to problems with Neumann in areas such as corporate governance. Nevertheless, Son was defiant that WeWork was still a solid business, saying there would be a ""hockey stick"" recovery in its profits eventually.
SoftBank Group Corp said its $100 billion Vision Fund contributed an operating loss of 970 billion yen ($8.9 billion) during the July-September quarter, and an unrealized loss of 537.9 billion yen for the six months of the year as the value of its tech bets such as WeWork and Uber Technologies (N:UBER) tumbled.
Overall, the group posted an operating loss of 704 billion yen ($6.5 billion) in the July-September quarter compared to a 706 billion yen profit in the same period a year earlier and a 48 billion yen loss forecast by analysts, according to Refinitiv.
SoftBank said the combined loss on its directly held shares in WeWork and WeWork shares held by the Vision Fund amounted to $8.2 billion.
DEBT FOCUS
The results are likely to put a renewed focus on SoftBank's considerable debt pile. It has more than $51 billion in outstanding bonds, and another $36 billion in bank loans. Its weighted average cost of debt is 3.7%, the seventh-highest among all companies on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average, according to Refinitiv data. Both Moody's and S&P rate its debt as junk.
The Saudi Arabia-backed Vision Fund, which is run by ex-Deutsche Bank banker Rajeev Misra, had invested $70.7 billion in 88 companies at the end of September. Those investments are now worth $77.6 billion excluding exits, it said.
With increased market scrutiny over the path to profitability for many of its bets on unproven startups, Son was also more cautious about the timings of IPOs - an essential step to unlock capital to keep its investment juggernaut growing.
Son said he expected the second Vision Fund to go ahead as scheduled, and at a similar size to the first fund, but he declined to provide an update on negotiations with investors.
The value of most of the fund's listed investments, including Uber, Slack Technologies (N:WORK) and  Guardant Health  (O:GH) fell over the quarter. 
At Uber, that slide has continued as losses mount and a post-IPO share lock-up ends, with its shares hitting new lows this week. 
SoftBank's investing activities are propped up by other pillars of Son's empire including domestic telecoms operator SoftBank Corp (T:9434), which on Tuesday reported a 9% rise in second-quarter operating profit, beating estimates, buoyed by its cash-cow mobile business. [L3N27L1Q2]

SoftBank did not release a forecast for the current business year, saying there were too many uncertain factors.

ROME (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal (AS:MT) said this week it was withdrawing from a deal to buy Italy's struggling steel firm Ilva after the government scrapped previous guarantees of legal immunity during an environmental clean-up at its plant.
The decision puts at risk thousands of jobs in Italy's underdeveloped south, threatens supply for Europe's second-largest steel consumer, and has led to ructions within the ruling coalition.
Here is an explanation of what has gone wrong and why the issue is so important for Italy.
WHAT IS ILVA?
Ilva was founded in 1905. Its biggest plant, and the largest in Europe, took root in the southern city of Taranto in the 1960s. At its peak, the site produced more than 10 million tonnes of steel a year, but following scandals over its appalling environmental record it was placed under state-supervised administration in 2015.
After months of negotiations, steel giant ArcelorMittal (AM) took control of Ilva in 2018. The firm currently has some 10,700 employees, with 8,200 in Taranto and most of the others in two finishing facilities in northern Italy.
Under the deal, AM agreed to pay 1.8 billion euros ($2 billion) for Ilva. It also pledged to spend 1.2 billion euros between 2018-23 on an environmental clean up and 1.3 billion to boost production at Taranto to 8 million tonnes per year from 6 million.
WHAT HAS GONE WRONG?
AM's main complaint is that the government has removed a pre-existing legal shield that granted it immunity from prosecution over environmental risks while it carried out the clean-up at Taranto.
The shield was introduced in 2015 when the state took charge and gave legal immunity to the then managers as well as to any future buyers while they implemented ""the best preventative rules on environmental matters."" 
Locals afflicted by pollution said this left them without legal redress and was therefore unlawful. A local judge backed their complaint and the ruling 5-Star Movement, which had promised to shutter Ilva before entering government in 2018, introduced a clause in a decree in June to remove the safeguard.
ArcelorMittal said if the decree was approved, it would pull out of the purchase and initially the government promised to backtrack. But, under pressure from 5-Star lawmakers, the promise failed to materialize and the shield expired on Nov. 3.
WHY DO THEY WANT A LEGAL SHIELD?
Experts say environmental norms were ignored at the site for decades, leaving Taranto exposed to highly toxic pollutants. One report drawn up by a group of medical experts found that between 2005 and 2012, more than 3,000 deaths were directly linked to exposure to pollutants. Locals say there have been hundreds more deaths since then. ArcelorMittal says it cannot run the risk of law suits tied to the pollution before it has had a chance to clear up the mess and make the site safe.
ARE THERE ANY OTHER PROBLEMS?
According to ArcelorMittal, yes. It says an order from a magistrate in July to idle one of three operational furnaces at Taranto following a fatal accident there in 2015 meant it could no longer implement its industrial plan. A court order in September annulled the July demand and gave AM 90 days to make the furnace comply with safety regulations. AM has said it needs more time to complete the desired overhaul.
DOES THE GOVERNMENT ACKNOWLEDGE AM'S COMPLAINTS?
No. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte says immunity was not part of the purchase accord so cannot be used as a reason to rescind the deal. 5-Star says AM is seeking an excuse to flee Italy at a time of weakness in global steel markets. Ilva made an EBITDA loss of some $350 million in the first half of 2019.
AM has cut its output in Europe blaming weak demand and high imports. Critics say it would therefore be in the company's interests if Taranto was shuttered. AM denies this, saying it aimed to make Taranto the lowest cost site in Europe. 
WHAT HAPPENS NOW?
If AM does pull out, the case will end in court. In the meantime, the government would have to take the site back and presumably seek a new buyer or nationalize it. The coalition would also face a huge political backlash."

(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and  Raymond James Financial Inc  (N:RJF) will pay roughly $12 million in restitution to customers who incurred excessive fees on investments meant to help their children afford college, a U.S. regulator said on Wednesday.
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said Bank of America's Merrill Lynch unit will pay at least $4 million and two Raymond James units will pay $8.03 million, after failing to ensure that financial advisers properly took fees into account when recommending investments in so-called 529 savings plans.
Such plans are tax-advantaged municipal securities designed to encourage saving for education, and sponsored by U.S. states, state agencies and educational institutions.
FINRA said the supervisory failures caused Merrill and Raymond James customers, especially those with young children many years away from college, to incur higher fees than they should have.
According to the regulator, many customers who invested in Class C shares, which carry no upfront sales charges but higher annual fees, would have been better off investing in Class A shares that carry upfront sales charges but lower annual fees.
The failures allegedly occurred from 2011 and 2015 at Merrill, and from January 2008 to March 2017 at Raymond James.

None of the units admitted or denied wrongdoing, and FINRA said they received credit for ""extraordinary cooperation"" with the regulator.

339,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 10:17AM ET</span>",Ride-hailing market revs up in Egypt,"By Yousef Saba
CAIRO (Reuters) - Competition in Egypt's ride-hailing and tech-enabled transport market is heating up as rivals from global giant Uber (N:UBER) to smaller local firms vie for a slice of the Middle East's largest market.
Operators say there is a lot more room for growth. Egypt's population will soon be swelling to 100 million. Taxis, minibuses, tuk-tuks and motorbikes shuttle passengers and deliveries through crowded, chaotic streets.
The biggest players are Careem and Uber, which had its IPO in May and posted a wider third-quarter loss on Monday as it tries to outspend competitors. The firms still operate separately despite their merger in March.
Industry experts expect more mergers as start-ups try to gain market share for bus or motorbike services.
Egypt is among Uber's top 10 markets globally, and is seen as a regional tech hub - start-ups such as digital payments firm Fawry (CA:FWRY) have set up shop in a tech park outside Cairo.
Uber has 90,000 active drivers in Egypt, operates in about half of Egypt's 27 governorates, and is looking to expand next year to the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh and southern Egypt, its Egypt General Manager, Ahmad Hammouda, told Reuters.
Both Uber and Careem introduced bus services late last year after the founding of local start-up Swvl, which runs buses along fixed routes via an app. Swvl has already expanded into Kenya and Pakistan.
FAST FOOD
Besides buses and passenger vehicles, Uber and Careem motorbikes also compete with Egyptian start-up Halan, which launched in November 2017 and operates in more than 20 Egyptian cities as well as Sudan's capital, Khartoum.
Tech-enabled food delivery is also expanding rapidly, where Uber Eats competes with Halan, local start-up Elmenus, Spanish start-up Glovo and Otlob. Germany's Delivery Hero bought Otlob in 2017 and has a stake in Glovo.
Halan uses motorbikes to deliver food, tuk-tuks for passenger transport and cargo tricycles for goods. It has partnerships with fast food chains including McDonald's, KFC and Pizza Hut in Egypt and is now targeting smaller restaurants.
It has around 10,000 active drivers, CEO Mounir Nakhla told Reuters.
Launched in June 2011 as a catalogue of menus from restaurants, Elmenus began delivering food via its platform late last year and is due to start using its own delivery vehicles this month, its founder, Amir Allam, told Reuters.
Glovo plans to invest 5 million euros ($5.54 million) in the country, where it says smartphone use is growing rapidly but just one quarter of deliveries are ordered online.
""There will come a time when somebody, or a couple of players, will dominate,"" said Elmenus' Allam. ""But this is still a long way to go because the market is growing massively.""
SIZE MATTERS
Maged Dessouky, a transport expert at the University of Southern (NYSE:SO) California, said it was hard to predict who would prevail. 
""Size matters, but size isn't everything,"" he said. ""Of course, when we get to autonomous vehicles, it's going to be very interesting. That's going to change the equation completely.""
Despite the optimism around the sector, there are uncertainties. In September, Egypt's parliament passed a law governing ride-hailing apps that will require them to keep data for six months and share it with the government when asked.
Earlier this year, Uber riders and drivers in Egypt faced technical difficulties with the Uber app, which two security sources said was linked to data-sharing disputes with the authorities.
The Egyptian Competition Authority (ECA) is examining Uber's acquisition of Careem and new entrants are still appearing. 
Earlier this year, billboards sprang up across Cairo advertising ride-hailing firm Dubci, prompting speculation that Egypt's powerful military, which has been expanding its business activities, was behind it.
The billboards have mostly disappeared, and news about Dubci has been scarce since the military denied ownership in July. Reuters could not reach the company.

Chinese state-owned entities are in talks about investing a combined $5 billion to $10 billion in Aramco’s initial public offering, as Saudi Arabia seeks commitments from friendly governments to shore up the record share sale, people with knowledge of the matter said.
The Beijing-based Silk Road Fund is among parties that have been in discussions to buy stock in the offering, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Some other Chinese funds or state-owned enterprises may also join, the people said.
President Xi Jinping has been seeking to increase China’s political clout and revive ancient trading routes under his “One Belt, One Road” initiative. An investment in Aramco would cement ties with Saudi Arabia as well as provide China a way to profit from rising oil prices.
State-owned oil producer Sinopec Group and sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp. have also held talks in recent months about investing in the Aramco IPO, the people said. Commitments haven’t been finalized, and the lineup of investors and the amounts each firm puts in will ultimately depend on the Chinese government, the people said.
The Silk Road Fund was set up in 2014 with $40 billion of initial capital. It was later supplemented with another 100 billion yuan ($14 billion) of funds, according to its website.
Large commitments from China would help Aramco make the share sale a success after Western money managers pushed back earlier on the company’s valuation. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman has long insisted the state oil company is worth $2 trillion, although he’s prepared to scale back his expectations to between $1.6 trillion and $1.8 trillion, Bloomberg News has reported.
Aramco declined to comment. Representatives for the Silk Road Fund and CIC, as well as Sinopec Group and its main listed unit, didn’t reply to requests for comment.

U.S. government debt due in a decade or more has returned more than 15% this year through Nov. 5, on track for its biggest annual gain since 2014, according to a Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) index. But the performance has started to fizzle, with the measure extending declines to a third straight month as 10- and 30-year yields touch the highest since September. And investors will be keenly focused on the longer end of the curve this week, with the U.S. Treasury preparing to sell 10-year debt on Wednesday and 30-year bonds the day after.
The recent sell-off in longer maturities may simply be the result of investors trying to lock in returns as 2019 draws to a close, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management. Duration -- the longer it is, the bigger the gains when yields fall -- has been the biggest contributor to fixed-income returns “bar none,” said portfolio manager Jim Caron.
“If duration giveth, duration taketh away,” Caron said. “If rates go back up, you’re going to find that people will be very quick to try and preserve those gains.”
Rates on 30-year Treasuries climbed as high as 2.35% Tuesday, up from a record low of 1.9% touched in August as angst over the global ripple effects of trade friction spread and inflation expectations tumbled. They were at 2.32% in early U.S. trading Wednesday.
Benchmark 10-year yields, which touched a high of 1.87% on Tuesday, are around 1.84%, up from a three-year low of 1.43% set in early September. Ten-year yields are still down more than 80 basis points in 2019, compared with a drop of close to 70 basis points for the long bond.
Bonds around the globe have mirrored the recent move in Treasuries, with yields on 10-year German bunds rising 43 basis points from a September low. A similar Australian benchmark has also climbed more than 40 basis points from its August trough.
Caron says the U.S. economic outlook argues for the 10-year yield to be closer to 2%, a level last seen in August. He’s been reducing duration in his portfolios since early October.
Surprisingly strong U.S. services data released Tuesday and optimism that the Trump administration may remove tariffs on Chinese goods prompted traders to dial back Federal Reserve rate-cut expectations. Market-based measures of inflation expectations are on the rise again, and the yield curve is steepening.
Auction Pressure
The back-up in longer-dated yields comes as the U.S. prepares to auction a combined $46 billion of 10- and 30-year bonds Wednesday and Thursday.
The supply of Treasuries should widen the gap between 5- and 30-year yields, according to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. rates strategist Jay Barry. He estimates that from current levels around 67 basis points, the curve is roughly 15 basis points too flat.
“It’s natural that as the Street and investors make room for the longer-duration supply that comes in the middle of the month, the curve steepens in anticipation,” Barry said.
A similar trend has also been seen in Japan. Yields on 10-year Japanese sovereign bonds climbed to the highest in more than five months on Wednesday after weaker-than-expected demand at a 2.1 trillion yen ($19 billion) auction.
“Higher yields could become a trend if the U.S.-China trade talks continue to progress,” said Tadashi Matsukawa, head of fixed-income investment at PineBridge Investments Japan Co.
In U.S. credit meanwhile, investment-grade bond deals non-financial issuershave also been targeting longer maturities. The average for new deals in the market Tuesday was about 26 years, up from 15 years on Monday, and about 13 years for this year so far.Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) placed a bigger than expected $600 million in 40-year bonds tight to its existing curve.
Double Down
Not everyone is convinced higher yields are in the offing. For one thing, a trade accord between the U.S. and China is hardly a done deal.
TD Securities strategists recommend “doubling down” on long 10-year Treasury positions, targeting a drop in yields to 1.6%.
“Global growth and trade uncertainty remain headwinds” despite recent positive headlines, analysts Priya Misra and Gennadiy Goldberg wrote in a Tuesday note. “Foreign inflows this year have been the highest since 2012, and low global rates suggests these flows are unlikely to abate.”
Brown Advisory’s Thomas Graff sees long bonds losing regardless of whether the economic outlook brightens or worsens from here. On the one hand, it’s unlikely that inflation expectations will surge and buoy longer yields. But at the same time, the 30-year probably won’t rally as much as shorter maturities should the Fed be forced to cut rates meaningfully in the months ahead.
For that reason, he’s underweight the longest parts of the curve.
“If you have a lot in the 30-year, I feel like you’re vulnerable on both ends,” said Graff, head of fixed-income at the $6.2 billion asset manager.

347,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 08:24AM ET</span>",JPMorgan Has a Plan to Help Amazon and Airbnb Look More Like Banks,"(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has long feared that technology giants will act more and more like banks. The firm’s surprising solution: help them do it.
The bank has spent the last year developing an e-wallet tailored for companies such as Airbnb, LYFT Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) that it says could help online marketplaces and companies in the gig economy defend against getting cut out of the businesses they helped create. In the process, they’ll look a little more like banks.
The JPMorgan product would give tech companies the ability to provide millions of customers virtual bank accounts and to offer perks such as car loans or discounts on home rentals to those who keep money stashed there. The more customers use their virtual accounts to pay for services, the less the companies would have to spend on payment-processing fees to third parties such as JPMorgan.
“A company’s biggest fear is that once they establish a commerce-type relationship, they can’t maintain the end-user, and they leave the ecosystem because they now have a direct relationship with the seller,” Matt Loos, a managing director in the JPMorgan’s global payment strategy and product group, said in an interview. The goal is to create incentives for customers to stay, he said.
It sounds counterintuitive to help tech companies wade deeper into financial services. The catch is the companies can only use the offering if they let JPMorgan handle all payment processing and cash movement for them. It’s all part of a move to bolster a fast-growing wholesale payments business that on its own contributed 10% of JPMorgan’s $109 billion in revenue last year, and which moves $6 trillion of cash every day for corporations around the world.
Killing the Middleman
The largest players in the gig economy and the biggest global banks are grappling with the same existential threat known in industry jargon as disintermediation -- being pushed out of transactions entirely. For cautionary tales, they could look to the travel agencies and bookstores that their own technology has helped consumers sidestep.
In payments alone, banks over the next five years risk losing 15% of their revenue -- around $280 billion -- due to escalating competition from non-banks such as Adyen and massive tech companies from PayPal to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), according to a September report from Accenture (NYSE:ACN).
The nightmare for the U.S. financial industry is that a technology company replicates the success of Alipay and WeChat in China, where money flows through digital systems without the need for banks at all.
“There’s no doubt in my mind that e-commerce platforms are thinking about how to do what you would call traditional retail banking or insurance products more than they did in the past,” Takis Georgakopoulos, who runs wholesale payments for New York-based JPMorgan, said in an interview.
For JPMorgan, the path to survival involves ceding some control in order to build a moat around its global payments offering, a business that McKinsey & Co. has called “the beachhead” of the entire banking relationship.
“The same way a company like Amazon wants to keep everything under their control, we want to keep as much money movement as possible under our control for each individual client,” Georgakopoulos said.
Pay In, Pay Out
Many U.S. companies feast on fees from accepting and processing payments, but JPMorgan is the only U.S. bank that has businesses that do both. Its merchant-services operation collects a fee on so-called “pay in” -- when a customer pays for a good on the platform -- while its treasury service unit generates revenue handling the “pay out” to the supplier or seller on the other side.
JPMorgan said it’s targeting the 10 biggest e-commerce and gig economy companies, a group that includes Amazon, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc., Airbnb and EBay Inc., among others.
“We’re talking to all of them,” Georgakopoulos said. “We want the whole industry to use it.”
JPMorgan says its e-wallets use virtual account technology that can simplify an e-commerce company’s refund process, expedite payouts to sellers and boost loyalty. The ideal candidate would have international customers requiring complex cross-border transactions that would benefit from JPMorgan’s technology.
The goal is to wrest payments business from traditional bank competitors such as  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and from non-banks that offer similar e-wallet capabilities.
One potential obstacle: Some tech companies have found ways of accomplishing the same thing without relying on JPMorgan.
Uber last week said it’s working with Green Dot Corp. to roll out e-wallets that let drivers and riders track earnings, manage and move their money, and “discover new Uber financial products” as part of an effort to keep riders loyal and build out its financial-services offering. And last year, PayPal bought Hyperwallet, a payout provider, in a bid to boost its ability to handle cross-border payments for e-commerce platforms and marketplaces.
JPMorgan says it plans to offer its e-wallet and payments services at a discount to what it costs to work with multiple providers.
“You stop paying all of the transaction costs for people bringing money in or out, you increase engagement and generally speaking it’s kind of nirvana for the e-commerce guys,” Georgakopoulos said.
The bank plans to go live with the technology with at least one client before the end of the year, he said."

Advertisements to drum up interest among Saudis in the sale of their oil giant, Aramco, appear on a few billboards, bank machines and online, though even in the urban sprawl near the company’s Dhahran headquarters you had to look for them. There were a couple on the highway from the city of Al Khobar to Dammam and at an ATM in the vast Al Rashid shopping mall.
The sale kicked off on Sunday at a news conference broadcast live from Aramco, and many Saudis have said they’ve been saving up to buy into the industry that has fed their economy for decades and underpins Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s transformation of the kingdom.  
The ads focus on the company’s journey to the stock exchange with images of engineers in hard hats depicting industry and growth. The slogan is “Saudi Aramco: Coming Soon to Tadawul.”
There’s a lot riding on this sale. Aramco and the banks managing the IPO are coordinating the campaign and the aim is for it to snowball in the coming days and weeks. It will be on the radio, main television channels and in newspapers.  
The Alyaum newspaper based in the oil-rich Eastern Province carried a banner at the start of its local news section, while the Asharq Al-Awsat daily had a full page including a tagline saying the IPO reflects “the belief of the kingdom’s leadership in the importance of Saudi Aramco.”

The announcement follows a green light for the strike from a German court that earlier on Wednesday rejected a temporary injunction.
Germany's biggest airline had filed a motion with the court to prevent the strike after trade union UFO had called for a walkout at Lufthansa's German operations on Thursday and Friday.
As part of a dispute over pay and pensions, UFO has fought with the airline in court for months over the union's legal status.

The court said that its decision could still be legally challenged.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stock markets steadied after a three-day rally on Wednesday as traders continued to watch incoming economic data and awaited new developments from U.S.-China trade talks.
MSCI's All Country World Index (MIWD00000PUS) was flat on the day, after rallying 1.3% since Friday.
World stock markets have rallied on a scaling-back of recession bets amid rising optimism about a U.S.-China trade deal this month and as global business surveys indicate tariff-hit manufacturing sentiment has troughed.
France's benchmark 10-year bond yield turned positive on Wednesday for the first time since July, in a further sign that entrenched pessimism in world bond markets is abating. 
Investors said stock markets were consolidating gains made over the last three sessions as focus shifted to lingering concerns over the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks.
Traders and investors hope a preliminary Sino-U.S. trade pact will roll back at least some of the punitive tariffs that Washington and Beijing have imposed on each other's goods, but it is still uncertain when or where U.S. President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign the agreement. 
Some suggested markets had already discounted a lot of good news.
""Optimism about a trade deal between the U.S. and China has given a lift to global equities,"" wrote Simona Gambrani at Capital Economics in a note to clients.
""But with a lot of good news already discounted and global economic growth likely to remain sluggish, we suspect that any further upside for stock prices will be limited.""
European stocks edged higher, boosted by gains in financial stocks as investors assessed a mixed bag of earnings reports. The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was higher by 0.1%. Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) index was flat, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) and France's CAC 40 (FCHI) were up 0.2% and 0.3% each.
Incoming economic data continued to show signs of improvement.
German industrial orders rose more than expected in September, offering some hope for manufacturers in Europe's biggest economy as they head into the fourth quarter after a tough spell. 
Euro zone business activity expanded slightly faster than expected last month but remained close to stagnation, according to a survey whose forward-looking indicators suggest what little growth there is could dissipate.

351,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Boeing to invest $1 billion in global safety drive: sources,"By Eric M. Johnson and Tim Hepher
SEATTLE/HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is planning an initial investment of around $1 billion into industry-wide pilot development as part of a long-term initiative to reduce risks like those faced by the crew in two 737 MAX crashes, people familiar with the matter said. 
The embattled planemaker is trying to rebuild trust and cooperation with airlines, passengers and regulators around the world after the 737 MAX was grounded in March, following crashes in which a total of 346 people died.
Details of the company's ""Global Aviation Safety"" initiative remain under wraps due to delays in returning the 737 MAX to service, as attention focuses on changes to cockpit software that investigators say played a major part in the two crashes.
Boeing will launch the pilot development project after regulators approve changes to 737 MAX software and training and the plane resumes flights, one of the people familiar with the matter said. The company currently expects that to happen in the United States by year-end.
The plane is likely to return to service in Europe during the first quarter of 2020, the head of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said earlier this week.
The pilot project spending budget, people familiar with it said, will be in addition to the more than $8 billion in costs from compensation to airlines for delayed aircraft deliveries and lower production tied to the 737 MAX grounding.
The training initiative is still being developed and will be rolled out over years, one of the people said. While costs are expected to rise over time, the effort may overlap with future aircraft programs.
""It will involve significant funds to raise standards around the world and requires Boeing putting its own money in,"" said another person familiar with the project.
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg was accused by U.S. lawmakers in back-to-back hearings last week of placing profits over those safety standards, a charge Boeing denies.
Muilenburg said Boeing would help ""build a talent pipeline"" of pilots and invest heavily in the pilot-machine interface or fight deck for the next generation, but gave few details.
A Boeing spokesman declined additional comment.
Part of Boeing's investments will include improving aviation infrastructure, such as air traffic and flight simulation systems, a third person with knowledge of the plans said.
It is also considering whether to develop new training materials or methods for various career stages, and fund training centers or recruitment efforts, the people said.
Boeing could also create a data-sharing network on aircraft design with global regulators, one of the people said, in a bid to improve outside knowledge of its aircraft technology and operations.
The head of the EASA told Reuters in a recent interview that it would demand more data when deciding whether to certify future jets.
PILOT SHORTFALL
Outlines of the new investment were drawn up in the wake of the crashes as Boeing executives acknowledged that stall-prevention software known as MCAS confused the pilots due to an overwhelming workload, the people said. 
Investigations have raised questions over whether that was in part due to faulty assumptions about the hazards involved, leading to a design that placed unrealistic demands on pilots. 
Investigators and global regulators have also pinpointed concerns about certification and training. 
Boeing says it followed industry practice on reaction times.
Experts say that Boeing, as the largest planemaker in the world, and its regulator, U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, have played a key role in shaping global standards around aircraft design and operations. 
Even before the crashes, the aircraft industry was bracing for a staffing shortfall of 1.5 million aircraft technicians and pilots over the next 20 years.
Both Boeing and Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) have already launched beginner training programs to help ease the shortages.
The crashes have also sped up a rethink of safety needs in emerging markets, where demand for new jets is driving a huge share of Boeing's business. But airlines face gaps in regulation and infrastructure. 
Safety experts have voiced concerns that the sheer growth of aviation has lowered the bar for the skills required to enter training, adding pressure for cockpit and training improvements.

""There is a large generation of pilots that will be needed over the next 20 years and we need to be thinking about designing our airplanes for that next generation,"" Muilenburg said at the hearing last week.

(T:7211) slashed its annual profit and sales outlook, becoming the latest Japanese automaker hit by sputtering global demand and a stronger yen.
Operating profit for the fiscal year through March 2020 will be 30 billion yen ($275 million) instead of 90 billion yen, the company said in a statement Wednesday, citing decreases in wholesale volumes and the impact of currency swings that erode income brought home. The revenue outlook for the period was cut 5% to 2.45 trillion yen.
The gloomy outlook underscores the challenges facing other Japanese carmakers, including Toyota Motor Corp., which reports results Thursday, as well as Nissan Motor Co., Mitsubishi’s partner in a three-way global automaking alliance with  Renault  SA (PA:RENA). The yen has strengthened 1.7% against the dollar since the start of April, and has been a key factor behind reduced outlooks by Japanese manufacturers this year.
Sales volumes fell in North America, Australia and Indonesia, while Thailand, Vietnam and Japan saw increases, Mitsubishi Motors said. The negative impact of lower volumes, foreign exchange and spending on research and development will continue to weigh on results, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Tatsuo Yoshida.
Although Mitsubishi Motors has remained mostly in the shadows amid turmoil at Nissan following the arrest of former alliance Chairman Carlos Ghosn, the company has been working to cut costs and expenses and introduced new models in its Asian growth markets, such as the Pajero Sport in Thailand.
Some jobs will be cut, although the company hasn’t decided on any numbers, Chief Executive Officer Takao Kato said at a news conference in Tokyo.
“Since the latter part of 2018, we have been shifting our focus from expansion toward profitability,” Kato said. “As a result, we have been able to remove 20 billion in costs, but the downturn in global demand and headwinds from currency swings is more than we expected.”
First-half operating profit fell 82% to 10.2 billion yen, while sales declined 3.5% to 1.13 trillion yen. Mitsubishi Motors shares rose 1.5% before the results, leaving them down 12% this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States' top market cop is slowly taking the shackles off corporations.
Since becoming head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2017, Jay Clayton has presided over more than two dozen measures which make life easier for America Inc, according to a Reuters analysis of SEC announcements and interviews with more than a dozen lawyers, academics and advocacy groups.
The changes -- 17 implemented so far with a further nine proposed -- are part of a broader push to help reverse a 20-year decline in U.S. public company listings by modernizing disclosures and cutting regulatory costs for firms. 
But a majority of them will weaken investor safeguards or diminish their rights, according to lawyers, consumer and investor groups and SEC sources.
""Under Clayton's leadership, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been quietly chipping away at an array of rules, many quite technical in nature,"" said Anna Pinedo, a partner at law firm Mayer Brown.
""Although individually these haven't gotten much attention, in aggregate the SEC's rulemaking agenda under Clayton adds up to positive changes for public companies.""
Clayton declined to be interviewed for this story but his spokeswoman said protecting the interests of Main Street investors was a top priority.
“The initiatives advanced under his leadership maintain or enhance investor protections, including by ensuring today’s investors receive the material information necessary to make investment decisions,” Natalie Strom said in a statement. 
Appointed by President Donald Trump with a mandate to entice more companies to go public, Clayton pledged to boost jobs and pension pots by making it more attractive for small companies to sell shares on stock exchanges while also protecting mom-and-pop investors.
Corporations led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the country's biggest business group, have said red tape is partly to blame for a 50% decline in the number of listed companies over the past two decades.
""Clayton recognizes that the decline of public companies is a threat to the long-term competitiveness of the American economy,"" said Tom Quaadman, executive vice president of the Chamber's Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness.
""Clayton has taken a holistic step-by-step approach to reverse this situation.”
But trimming companies' disclosure requirements, for example by giving them more leeway over how and what they divulge in regulatory filings, and more freedom to make redactions, mean investors will get less information, say critics.
It is still too early to see the full effects of most of the changes but corporate governance experts worry that they swing the balance in favor of companies and make public markets more treacherous for both institutional and retail investors.
""The deregulatory agenda now advancing at the SEC is too often driven by lobbyist intuition rather than hard facts about the markets we oversee,"" Robert Jackson, one of five SEC commissioners, told Reuters. He has opposed several of the measures. 
One of Clayton's most contentious proposals would relax a requirement, created by Congress in 2002 following the Enron accounting scandal, for companies with less than $100 million in revenues to get their internal financial reporting controls signed-off by an independent auditor. 
Another controversial proposal to cap financial rewards for whistleblowers could reduce the incentive for company insiders to come forward with evidence of wrongdoing. After fierce attacks by corporate governance advocates, that proposal may be softened as Clayton tries to get it across the line in coming months.
This week, he proposed changes that would limit the ability of shareholders to submit proposals on items like executive compensation to company management. 
To be sure, Clayton has toughened market oversight in some areas. Some of the measures aimed at simplifying financial disclosures make it easier for investors to identify material information and give them more information on certain topics, such as how company employees deal in their stock. 
Cryptocurrency offerings have slumped after Clayton said they should be regulated like stock offerings, and he passed a package of measures this year requiring stockbrokers to disclose potential conflicts of interest, and the commissions they earn, when giving financial advice.
The broker rules, however, were heavily criticized by advocates for mom-and-pop investors who said they still left investors exposed to conflicted advice. 
REAL COSTS FOR REAL PEOPLE
Going public is expensive. Investment bankers, lawyers and auditors collectively charge millions of dollars to prepare companies for their stock market debut and it can cost millions more to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements.
But there are other reasons why companies are staying private, denying ordinary investors the sort of investment opportunities they traditionally rely on to fund their retirement. 
For one, deregulation in the private market since 1996 has made it easier for firms to raise money from private investors, cutting most Americans out of the equation. Record low interest rates in recent years have spurred those wealthy individuals and institutions to put more cash into start-up investments.
Over the past five years, there has been at least $150 billion raised in private equity and debt placements, compared to $90 billion over the previous period, according to data from Dealogic. The overall figure is likely to be far larger as data on such private deals is not comprehensive.
And while the total number of public companies is lower than 20 years ago, the total value of public companies has doubled, partly due to mergers and acquisitions.
The IPO market has improved this year. As of the end of October, there had been 37 small-cap company listings, each raising between $300 million and $1 billion, on track to beat last year's 39 listings and in line with 2017. 
Bankers said this was largely due to a buoyant stock market, boosted by record low interest rates, rather than any regulatory changes introduced by the SEC. 
“Although these new tools have been put in place and positively received, the continued strength of the broader market has been the primary factor driving IPO volumes,"" said Jim Cooney, head of equity capital markets for the Americas at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
A former Wall Street deals lawyer who has represented a roster of big banks and hedge funds, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Clayton initially disappointed Republicans and corporate lobbyists who had hoped he would hand them quick big wins.
Instead, Clayton focused on building consensus with the four other commissioners who decide on rule-making and enforcement actions at the SEC. Two of the five current commissioners were picked by the Democratic party. The rest, including Clayton, are Republican appointees.
Over the past year, though, Clayton has proved more willing to push through changes despite dissent from the Democratic commissioners, most notably Jackson, who has voted against several measures since joining in January 2018.
Jackson, an academic who has studied the reliability of corporate disclosures, said reducing the frequency and substance of information companies had to publish, ""comes with real costs for real people"".

Allison Lee, the other Democrat commissioner, declined to comment. Republican commissioners Hester Peirce and Elad Roisman, did not respond to requests for comment.

357,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 06:21AM ET</span>",South Africa's Ramaphosa gets $13.5 billion of investment pledges at summit,"By Mfuneko Toyana
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African President Cyril Ramaphosa secured about 200 billion rand ($13.5 billion) of investment pledges, mainly from domestic companies, on Wednesday as part of his drive to boost flagging economic growth.
Ramaphosa announced the investments during his opening speech at a forum aimed at drawing sorely-needed direct investment into the economy.
""The new investments over five years are with the view of addressing low economic growth and reducing unemployment,"" Ramaphosa said. ""It is pleasing to see that investors still consider South Africa as a country that has much to offer.""
At last year's forum, Ramaphosa had set a goal of attracting $100 billion of new investments over a five-year period and he quickly secured more than half that amount in pledges.
But many of those promises are yet to translate into projects that could make a meaningful indent in the country's 29% unemployment rate or lift the growth rate above last year's level of 0.8%.
The scale of the challenge Ramaphosa faces was underlined by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni's bleak medium-term budget speech last week, which slashed this year's growth forecast to 0.5% and showed government debt would shoot up to more than 70% of gross domestic product by 2023.
Moody's placed South Africa's last investment-grade credit rating on a ""negative outlook"" after Mboweni's updated budget projections, giving the country up to 18 months when it could be downgraded.
A downgrade could trigger billions of dollars of outflows from South African government debt.
Despite a modest pickup in foreign direct investment last year, investment by local firms has remained weak during Ramaphosa's presidency as cash-rich companies continue to send money offshore.
Domestic firms like telecoms firm MTN (J:MTNJ) and paper company Sappi (J:SAPJ) made some of the largest pledges at Wednesday's conference, with other large investments promised by state freight company Transnet and the state airports management company.
MTN pledged to invest 50 billion rand over the next five years and Sappi pledged 14 billion rand over several years.
The new pledges would be a ""shot in the arm"" to the local economy, Ramaphosa said.
Ramaphosa has promised reforms from the energy to telecoms sectors, but progress has been slow due to opposition from labor unions and parts of his ruling African National Congress party.
His investment conference last year secured nearly 300 billion rand of investment pledges from firms like miner  Anglo American  (L:AAL). During that conference, countries including China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates made a further $35 billion in pledges.
Ramaphosa said on Wednesday that a new chief executive and revamped board of directors at struggling state power firm Eskom would be announced ""in the next few days"" and promised that his government would continue to improve the ease of doing business."
358,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 06:11AM ET</span>",Huawei founder says not yet talking directly with U.S. firms to license 5G,"By Brenda Goh
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd is not yet directly engaged with any U.S. company over the firm's proposal to ease concerns about the security of its platform by licensing its 5G network technology, its founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei said on Wednesday.
A Huawei executive told Reuters in October that the company was in early stage talks with some U.S. telecoms companies about licensing its technology but warned that conversations were at an early stage and would likely take a long time to conclude.
The idea of a one-off fee in exchange for access to Huawei's 5G patents, licenses, code and know-how was first floated by Ren in interviews with the New York Times and the Economist in September. But it was not clear whether there was any interest from U.S. companies.
""There are currently no U.S. companies talking to us directly, because middlemen who have come to talk do not necessarily represent the big U.S. companies, as this is a big and difficult introduction,"" Ren said in a conversation broadcast by the company.
""It is only when someone is willing to come and discuss this issue with us will we find an investment bank to help us find an intermediary to discuss the deal, contract and cooperation, but not yet,"" he said.
The U.S. government, fearing Huawei's equipment could be used by China for spying, placed the world's largest telecoms equipment provider on a blacklist banning it from buying American-made parts and has led a campaign to convince allies to bar it from their 5G networks. It has also brought criminal charges against the company, alleging bank fraud, violations of U.S. sanctions against Iran, and theft of trade secrets, all of which Huawei denies.
Ren said on Wednesday that the company was coping well with the U.S. blacklisting and Huawei was continuing to innovate without U.S. support, even though he hoped the ban would not be a long-term issue.
He said that the company expects to sell 240-250 million smartphones this year.
Huawei said last month that it had sold more than 200 million phones in the year to Oct. 23, hitting that milestone more than two months earlier than it did in 2018."

Investing.com -- Europe’s bank stocks advanced more or less in unison on Tuesday after Germany’s finance minister floated new proposals to break the deadlock on a common deposit insurance scheme for the euro zone, one of the region’s biggest institutional weaknesses.
By 5:10 AM ET (1010 GMT),   Societe Generale   (PA:SOGN),   BNP Paribas   (PA:BNPP), Unicredit (MI:CRDI), ING,   Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) were all up between 4% and 1%, albeit helped in part by some strong earnings and a better-than-expected uptick in German factory orders. The Stoxx 600 consolidated recent gains, retracing 0.2%, while the German DAX was down 0.1% and the U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.2%.
However, those tempted to jump on the bandwagon shouldn’t get carried away. There have been plenty of false dawns on deposit insurance before, and Scholz attached familiar conditions to his proposals, as Katharine Utermohl, chief economist with insurance giant Allianz (DE:ALVG), pointed out.
Writing in the Financial Times, Olaf Scholz said “we understand that compromises are necessary to complete banking union” and proposed a common reinsurance scheme to backstop the various national schemes.
Scholz claimed this would “significantly enhance the resilience of national deposit insurance.”
The proposals are important because the euro zone’s lack of a common deposit insurance scheme has tied the fate of banks to the ability of their national governments to bail them out. That’s contributed to big valuation discounts for banks in countries which have higher debt burdens, such as Italy, Portugal and Greece.
Germany has been the biggest obstacle to a European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), fearing that its savers could be plundered to bail out collapsed banks in southern Europe. Despite a big reduction in bad loans in the Italian, Greek and Spanish banking system in recent years, the euro zone’s biggest and financially strongest economy has refused to accept a potentially vast liability.
But his suggestions were quick to attract familiar criticisms. The FT quoted Helmut Schleweis, head of the hugely influential German savings bank association, as rejecting the proposals, saying it’s “not the right moment to communitize deposit insurance schemes.”
As far as German banks have been concerned, it hasn't actually been “the right moment” for the last eight years, and it's hard to see when the ""right moment"" might ever come.
Tellingly, in tying his proposals to an unspecified additional reduction in non-performing loans, Scholz again evaded the question of how much risk reduction would be enough to satisfy Berlin and its banks. Scholz also repeated an oft-stated German demand to introduce risk-weights for sovereign bonds, something that has always been unpalatable to all of the euro zone members with lower sovereign credit ratings than Germany.
To underline the point, ECB banking supervisory head Andrea Enria gave a speech Tuesday about completing banking union which made no mention of sovereign risk weights, and a lot of space to the need for a proper EDIS, now. An agreement still seems years off.
That’s not to say there’s no reason for bank stocks to be up today. SocGen’s results, which included an impressive 48 basis points of capital generation, removing most lingering doubts about a capital increase, were rightly rewarded with a 4.2% bounce in a stock that had fallen 20% in the 12 months prior to this morning. Moreover, its ability to keep loan loss provisions down emboldened hopes that a trade truce between China and the U.S. will come soon enough to spare Europe a wave of manufacturing bankruptcies. 
So while the tentative signs of a bottoming out of the euro zone economy (and thus ECB interest rates) justify something of a rerating in bombed-out bank stocks, anyone tempted to trade just on the prospect of a European deposit insurance scheme should still probably go and lie down in a darkened room until the feeling goes away."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BMW's (DE:BMWG) new chief executive delivered a 33% third-quarter operating profit rise as stronger sports utility vehicle sales and the absence of the one-off factors which depressed earnings a year earlier lifted its earnings.
Oliver Zipse, who became CEO in August, said the German sportscar manufacturer is on track to meet full-year targets, unlike rivals such as Ford which have been forced to lower their profit forecasts due to slower sales in China.
""We are well on our way to achieving our targets for the year as a whole,"" Zipse said on Wednesday.
Sales of BMW's passenger cars rose 3.6% in the quarter including a 5.8% rise in China sales in September, thanks to a newly launched X3 sports utility vehicle, even as overall car sales in China fell for the past 15 months in a row.
The Munich-based company said its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) rose to 2.29 billion euros ($2.54 billion), up from 1.72 billion euros in the year-earlier quarter and ahead of the 2.16 billion euros forecast in a Refinitiv poll.
The operating margin at its automotive division rose to 6.6% from 4.4% in the year-earlier period, when new emissions rules led to heavy stockpiling and discounting by competitors and hit BMW's profit margin on luxury cars.
""A decent set of third-quarter numbers with revenues 4% ahead of consensus driven by better mix and solid pricing,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Dorothee Cresswell said in a note.
BMW said in March it expects a significant fall in group pretax profit, a slight increase in vehicle deliveries, and an EBIT margin of between 4.5% and 6.5% in the automotive division, an outlook it reiterated on Wednesday.
It sees demand for electrified vehicles, which includes hybrid engines, doubling by 2021, and sales of electrified cars growing by 30% annually between 2021 and 2025.
Carmakers are having to make huge investments into cleaner and self-driving technologies just as demand in China, their biggest market, is falling and a trade war between Washington and Beijing is curbing global economic growth.
The Bavarian carmaker faces higher manufacturing costs as it prepares factories to build hybrid and electric cars, forcing cost cuts elsewhere, with the aim of achieving more than 12 billion euros in efficiency gains by the end of 2022.
BMW said it will cut development times of vehicles by a third and the number of drivetrains by 50% from 2021 onwards."

The company said the reliability of the 23 trains in operation had increased by a factor of seven in recent weeks and ride comfort had substantially improved thanks to new software.
Bombardier said last week it was on track to complete a handful of large rail contracts, including the Swiss order, that have weighed on margins as it restructures.
Bombardier and SBB had said in May they were making progress in resolving technical problems with the trains, with Bombardier's chief executive telling analysts last week that the Swiss railways had 23 in service.
""Bombardier has now delivered a total of 25 of the FV-Dosto trains, which is in line with the defined delivery schedule. By summer 2021, the entire fleet of (62) trains will have been delivered,"" the company said in a statement on Wednesday.
SBB awarded Bombardier the 1.9 billion Swiss franc ($1.91 billion), 59-train contract in 2010, but the first deliveries were made only in 2018. Amid problems, Bombardier agreed to add three more trains free of charge as compensation.
The Swiss contract for the trains calls for undisclosed penalty payments in the event of delays, but the SBB has not given any details so far."

(Reuters) - European shares took a breather on Wednesday after closing at a four-year peak in the previous session, as a mixed bag of earnings reports and weak services sector data from the euro zone weighed on sentiment.
 Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) shares rose 4.6% to a six-month high after the bank said it had set aside three-quarters of the cash needed to deliver a planned dividend payout this year.
The update helped power a 1% rise in bank stocks (SX7P), the most among the major European sub-sectors. The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) struggled for direction after rising about 0.1% in early trading.
European shares have logged strong gains this week on growing optimism over a trade truce between the United States and China.
Fresh data on Wednesday showed Germany's services sector barely grew in October, while euro zone business activity expanded slightly faster than expected last month, but remained close to stagnation.
""There is a little bit of a holding pattern after the optimism we saw on the trade front and the effect is just slowly wearing off,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group.
""There is also a nagging sense that maybe this market has moved too fast too quickly so we could just move lower on some short-term weakness.""
The European retail sector (SXRP) gained 0.3% after better-than-expected earnings from Britain's Marks and Spencer (L:MKS) and Dutch supermarket operator Ahold Delhaize (AS:AD).
Swiss chocolate maker Barry Callebaut (S:BARN) fell 4% after reporting a slowdown in its most recent quarter, while Italy's postal service provider Poste Italiane (MI:PST) dropped 1.2% due to a lackluster performance of its mail and parcel business in the third quarter.

364,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 04:43AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank Sees Interest Rates as Biggest Challenge in Europe,"(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s finance industry has seen its global sway erode dramatically and the main weapon being used to boost the continent’s economies is making things worse, a top Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) executive warned Wednesday.
The region’s banks and insurers “have lost dramatic amounts of ground,” with only one still ranking in the top 20 globally by market value, compared with six before the financial crisis, Deutsche Bank AG President Karl von Rohr said Wednesday at Bloomberg LP’s Future of Finance conference in Frankfurt. While challenges abound -- from an erratic trade war to Brexit to unrest in Hong Kong and Chile -- they pale in comparison with the headwinds for banks from low and negative rates, he said.
“The biggest challenge facing the European financial industry is the persistent and structurally low interest rate environment,” von Rohr said in prepared remarks. “Negative interest rates are a burden on the financial system as they turn long-standing certainties upside down.”
The comments add to a growing chorus of critics warning of the implications from years of low and -- in the case of Europe -- negative rates. David Solomon, the chief executive officer of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., said Tuesday that history is unlikely to look back favorably at the “experiment of negative rates,” which in his view was holding back the region. Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing has warned they will “ruin the financial system” in the long run.
The European Central Bank has imposed negative interest rates on deposits for more than five years, pushing the rate even further down in September. That has complicated Sewing’s plan to refocus the lender on its roots catering to European corporations. The bank had to soften a revenue goal just two months after announcing it as a reversal in expectations for interest rates weighs on income from lending.
Deutsche Bank Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke said last week the bank is now intensifying efforts to pass on the negative interest rates to clients to offset the headwinds. About a fifth of the deposits in the lender’s retail and wealth management division could potentially be targeted and he wouldn’t mind if deposits “walk out the door,” von Moltke said on a call with analysts.
Von Rohr said Deutsche Bank won’t pass the cost of negative rates on to average retail clients, but the questions was “relevant” for large corporate clients and the very wealthy.
Compared with the U.S., where banks receive interest on deposits from the Fed, the disadvantage from negative rates costs European lenders almost 40 billion euros ($44 billion) a year, he said. Tiering -- a system by which the ECB exempts some deposits from negative rates -- was providing only “a tiny bit of relief.”
To help fix those problems, von Rohr said European lawmakers need to tackle long-standing structural issues, such as the lack of a unified market for capital and for financial services -- a political project known as banking union -- which makes consolidation across national borders difficult and leaves them at a disadvantage to Wall Street.
Negotiations at the EU level about the banking union are currently at an impasse, not least because Germany has been resisting plans to create a common deposit insurance for the entire bloc. The country’s Finance Minister Olaf Scholz on Wednesday sought to break the deadlock in discussions over European banking integration by signaling the country may drop its opposition to a key part of the plan."

  Societe Generale   SA (PA:SOGN) boosted a key measure of financial strength for a second straight quarter and shrank the trading division faster than planned as Chief Executive Officer Frederic Oudea restructures the investment bank.
The French lender said the CET1 ratio -- a closely-watched metric of its ability to absorb losses -- gained almost 50 basis points to 12.5% after the sale of businesses. The lender also met early its goal of cutting 8 billion euros ($8.9 billion) of risk-weighted assets from its markets business as the bank pivots to focus on areas of strength.
The capital strength in the thid quarter helped counter a 20% decline in the business of buying and selling equities and net income and revenue that missed analyst estimates. The bank blamed “adverse market conditions in August” and waning client demand for structured products for the decline in equities. The shares rose as much as 4.9%.
The longest-serving CEO of a top European bank is undertaking the bank’s biggest restructuring in years, cutting 1,600 jobs, slashing costs and paring risk after giving up his main mid-term targets for growth and profitability. The French lender exceeded its capital requirement by the narrowest margin of the eurozone’s top 10 listed banks last year, prompting analysts to question whether the lender would need to tap markets.
In equities, “our franchise is more geared, more driven by structured products,” where demand was low in the quarter due to global uncertainties such as trade disputes and Brexit, Deputy Chief Executive Officer Severin Cabannes said in a Bloomberg Television interview, adding adding that on a nine-month basis, the equities franchise remained solid.
The bank “had a significant improvement in terms of capital position,” he said, which is “our current financial priority.”
SocGen traded 4.4% higher at 28.15 euros as of 10:05 a.m.
The bank also took a charge of 113 million euros ($125 million) to close some businesses in the Balkans, helping push third-quarter net income down 35% from a year earlier.
The bank still plans to take market share in investment and structured products, financing solutions, and advisory on “smart flow” activities.
Fixed Income
Revenue from fixed income did better than equities, rising 1% versus the same quarter a year earlier. SocGen cited “strong client activity in financing and rates and credit.”
SocGen achieved its 2020 target for its common equity tier one ratio of 12% ahead of time last quarter. The bank had been working with McKinsey & Co. to find ways to bolster its CET1 ratio, a person familiar with the matter said in May.
Oudea is seeking to preserve the bank’s traditional leadership in businesses such as equity derivatives while strengthening capital and exiting or refocusing fixed-income activities. Still, the stock has trailed larger rival  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA, which also outperformed SocGen in fixed income and equities in the most recent quarter.
Some analysts have said that ongoing turnover at the trading unit might dent revenue, and that the changes come with high risks. In February, SocGen replaced the markets unit’s head, and the head of the fixed-income business is also leaving.

The performance in fixed-income trading trailed the gain of about 10% reported by the large Wall Street peers and a 35% surge at BNP. Among European investment banks, the results were uneven, with  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc posting a 19% gain, while  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) saw a 21% slump in revenue from that business.
SocGen has been scrambling to reduce or exit some trading activities to shore up capital. At the same time, its expanding in some emerging markets and is considering a fully-owned brokerage in China, joining a rush by the world’s biggest banks as the country speeds up the liberalization of ownership restrictions in the financial sector."

Over the past 30 days, analysts have lowered earnings outlook for Asia's large and mid-cap firms' by 0.1% due to slowing economic growth in the region, the data showed.
However, the cut was much lower than the 2.7% downgrade in the previous two months.
India, Japan and Australia led the downgrades in the region over the past month, according to the data.
""Declining commodity prices and weak consumer sentiment point to earnings revision weakness in Australia,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in a report this month, adding that its Asia-ex-Japan economic sentiment index has fallen further, which may indicate lack of confidence in the economy.
On the other hand, analysts upgraded their earnings outlook for Chinese and Taiwanese firms by an average of 1.4% and 1.3% respectively, the data showed.
Taiwan's economy grew at its fastest pace in more than a year in the third quarter, as a rebound in demand for tech products for the year-end peak season boosted manufacturers and ""offset"" the impact of trade disputes.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) plans to double the number of repair and maintenance shops, add about 100 charging stations and revamp showrooms in China as the electric vehicle maker gears up to open its Shanghai plant.
The moves mark a departure from the approach chief executive Elon Musk announced in March, when he said the company would shut many of its retail stores worldwide to cut costs.
Tesla had already treated China, the world's biggest electric vehicle market, differently than elsewhere. The company and Musk openly disdain marketing, but in China Tesla has offered racing events and showroom parties.
""Building cars from the Shanghai factory is just the first step,"" Tesla vice president Tao Lin said at an industry conference last month in Beijing. ""Next we must deliver cars very well to our customers and provide very good after-sales service.
Tesla plans to turn some of its showrooms in China into one-stop shops called ""Tesla Centers"" that also serve as delivery sites and offer maintenance support, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, said the rollout would start in Shanghai and Guangzhou.
In coming months, the company also plans to double its service centers to 63 from 29 and boost fast charging stations by 39% to 362, according to Tesla planning documents seen by Reuters.
""Expanding the service network is very important to boost customer confidence,"" Tesla China general manager Wang Hao told Reuters, adding the firm would build more charging stations in China next year at a ""faster pace.""
""There is growing sales potential from more inland cities, and a need to prepare for growing repair and maintenance demands to avoid complaints,"" one of the sources said.
Tesla, most of whose service centers are in China's coastal regions and big provincial capitals, will open new ones in the northwestern city of Urumqi, southwestern city of Kunming and ""Ice City"" Harbin in the north, the documents showed.
The sources cautioned that plans might change depending on the circumstances.
Tesla's corporate headquarters in the United States did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Its efforts to boost its physical presence in China comes as the carmaker has started trial production at the $2 billion Shanghai plant, its first overseas factory, ahead of mass production by the end of December.
Tesla has said it should be able to build 3,000 Model 3 sedans a week in its initial phases. That is nearly four times the number of imported Model 3 vehicles sold in China per month this year, according to figures from research firm LMC Automotive.
RISING COST BURDEN
The expansion plan is likely to increase financial strain on Tesla, which has been burning cash because of heavy losses and capital expenditure.
Tesla has had negative free cash flow every quarter but five over the past decade, but positive free cash flow of $371 million in the three months that ended in September, thanks to record deliveries and reduced costs.
It was not immediately clear how much Tesla would need to spend to expand its sales and after-sales network in China.
Tesla operates about 48 showrooms in mainland China. In contrast, BMW (DE:BMWG), Daimler's (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes Benz, and Audi (DE:NSUG), which will have electric sport-utility vehicle models in China by the end of this year, all have more than 500 sales outlets there.
Although Tesla might not need to have as many showrooms as its rivals, it should have more than it currently does, experts said.
""Chinese consumers are willing to examine cars in a physical store, so car manufacturers need to have a certain store network in various places,"" said Cui Dongshu, secretary general of China Passenger Car Association.
Maintaining growth momentum in China has become even more crucial to Tesla, as its U.S. revenue tumbled 39% in the third quarter, its first decline in more than two years. By contrast, sales in China rose 64% to $669 million.
Tesla is also expanding its sales and delivery workforce in China: It has held several hiring events in Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen for sales and delivery staff in recent months, according to recruitment advertisements posted on social media.
At a Tesla service center in Beijing, customers said more maintenance and charging facilities would encourage them to drive farther.
""It is definitely good thing. If it is convenient enough, I will drive my car to more cities,"" said Niu Siliang, a 60-year-old retired man who owns a Model X SUV."

Malaysia had temporarily surrendered Ng for 10 months to the United States, where he has been charged for conspiring to launder money and bribe government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi through bond offerings that  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) had handled.
Ng has pleaded not guilty to the charges in Malaysia and the United States.
Malaysia had requested that a trial start in April, as the 10-month period of U.S. custody agreed to by the countries would lapse in March, Deputy Public Prosecutor Zaki Asyraf Zubir told Reuters.
""Prosecution requested for the trial in April,"" Zaki said in a text message.
Prosecutors have said that Goldman Sachs generated about $600 million in fees for its work with 1MDB, which included three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013 that raised $6.5 billion.
Ng, along with Tim Leissner, a former partner at Goldman Sachs in Asia, received large bonuses in connection with that revenue.
Malaysia has said it was seeking up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman over its dealings with 1MDB, set up in 2009 by the then prime minister, Najib Razak.
Najib, who lost a general election last year, faces 42 criminal charges related to losses at 1MDB and other state entities. He has pleaded not guilty.
Goldman said last month it was in discussions with authorities on the possibility of a resolution of investigations relating to 1MDB.
Malaysia rejected an offer from Goldman of less than $2 billion in compensation over the scandal, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told the Financial Times last week."

Housebuilder   Redrow   (LON:RDW) said business in the first half of its fiscal 2020 year was held back by planning delays and its own cautious approach to buying land in what it called an “unceasing period of economic and political uncertainty.”
Net reservations were up 2% on the year in the six months through September, while average selling prices were 389,000 pounds, up 1,000 pounds ($129,000) from a year earlier. On the bright side, it said its order book had risen 8% to a record high of 1.3 billion pounds.
Redrow said the further period of uncertainty caused by the recent Brexit extension and the general election to come in December meant that its business would be more heavily skewed than usual to the second half. 

The bleeding continues at   Marks & Spencer Group   (LON:MKS). Like-for-like Clothing and home sales fell 5.7% in its fiscal second quarter, worse than the 5.2% drop three months earlier.
Like-for-like food sales picked up, growing 1.5% after a 0.8% increase in the first quarter, in what CEO Steve Rowe called the “first fruits” of its partnership with Ocado (LON:OCDO). As a result, overall LFL sales in the U.K. fell 1.3%, slightly less than the 1.7% drop through June.
Group operating profit fell 15% in the first half, while adjusted earnings per share fell 24.5% to 7.1 pence.
M&S still said it expects a recent change in management to improve the performance of its home and clothing division, and said full-year sales will fall only 2% instead of the 3% previously estimated. It kept its guidance for food sales unchanged. It also cut its guidance for capital expenditure by 50 million pounds to a range of 300-350 million.

Cybersecurity firm Sophos (LON:SOPH) said billings grew 8% in the six months through September, with an 11% rise in currency-adjusted subscription revenue offsetting a 5% drop in hardware sales. The group renewal rate rose to 121% from 118% a year earlier.

Defense technology group  Ultra Electronics  (LON:ULE) said it had had “good order book development” since its half-year results, adding that trading remains in line with expectations.
“Our major markets are growing and our strong technology base is positioning us well on existing and potential future programs,” the company said in a brief update.
Ultra will hold an investor day on Jan. 23.

The company, which has agreed to be bought by private equity group Thoma Bravo, said it swung to a pretax loss of $1.5 million due to exceptional legal and restructuring costs and a one-off gain in the previous year’s accounts.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Global investors will embrace China's vibrant capital markets even more closely, shrugging off threats of a U.S.-China decoupling in the wake of their trade war, veteran Chinese fund manager Richard Pan said.
Foreign ownership in China stocks, also called A-shares, will exceed 10% in a decade, up sharply from 2.7% now, the head of international business at China Asset Management Co (ChinaAMC) predicted.
Despite a slowdown in economic growth, ""China is one of the few places investors can generate decent returns,"" said Pan, who manages $5 billion worth of investments in China for global sovereign wealth funds, central banks and pension funds.
In an interview as part of the Reuters 2020 Investment Outlook Summit, the former portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management brushed aside concerns that the Sino-U.S. trade frictions would morph into a broader financial war.
Those fears were triggered by reports that Washington was discussing possible restrictions on capital flows into China, with a focus on investments made by U.S. government pension funds. Last month, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio said he plans to introduce legislation to block a federal pension fund from investing in Chinese stocks.
Pan said his team visited some big U.S. pension companies last month, and ""they told us that's the last thing they worry about,"" as Washington cannot dictate how state governments and private pensions make investment decisions.
An avid supporter of globalization, Pan said China's financial opening and economic restructuring - accelerated by the trade war - will only benefit foreign investors.
""This market is liquid, deep, and big. Global investors can park a significant amount of money into major Chinese companies.""
China is stepping up opening of its giant capital markets, having recently scrapped investment quotas under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) scheme.
Pan, also head of QFII investment at ChinaAMC, one of China's biggest mutual fund houses, declined to disclose details of his global mandates. But a domestic mutual fund he manages, using the same investment methodology, shed some light on his stock-picking strategies.
His China AMC QianLong Selected Equity Fund has achieved a return of roughly 47% this year, far outperforming China's blue-chip index CSI300 (CSI300), which is up about 33%.
The fund's portfolio is highly concentrated in consumer players such as liquor brands Kweichow  Moutai  (SS:600519) and Wuliangye (SZ:000858), as well as high-end equipment makers such as Sanyi Heavy Equipment (SS:600031).
As the world's No.1 market for Mercedes-Benz and LVMH, and the No. 2 market for Apple (O:AAPL) and Starbucks (O:SBUX), China's fast-growing high-end consumer market will also nurture great local brands, offering tremendous investment opportunities, Pan said.
In the luxury segment, ""we don't see any material impact on Chinese consumption power from the trade war.""
China's technology innovation is likely to foster the next  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) or Tencent among Chinese companies, but Pan said he would avoid tech stocks highly vulnerable to U.S. sanctions.
""A full-blown trade war is not our base case scenario. But U.S.-China conflicts in areas such as technology may last for a long time, due to power rivalry."""

375,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 11:18PM ET</span>",Huawei Forecasts Robust Smartphone Growth Despite Trump Ban,"(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. expects smartphone shipments to grow 20% next year even if it’s blocked from the latest Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) software, suggesting the Trump administration efforts to contain the company’s rise may not be working.
The world’s largest smartphone maker after Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. can rely on its massive home market and in-house software to keep the division humming, said Will Zhang, president of corporate strategy. Sourcing the hardware for smartphone manufacturing wasn’t a problem because of the availability of global supply, he told Bloomberg News.
Huawei is approaching a critical juncture in its fight for survival, six months after Washington barred it from buying key U.S. components and software without special licenses. Those include Google’s Android operating system, semiconductor design tools from Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) Inc. and Cadence Design (NASDAQ:CDNS) Systems Inc. and radio frequency chips made by Qorvo and Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS). That threatens to dent Huawei’s smartphone business, which ships more than twice as many devices as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., while impeding its ability to make fifth-generation networking gear.
“There are many ways for our U.S. partners to find global solutions, rather than ship from a single U.S.-based source,” Zhang said at Huawei’s Shenzhen headquarters.
China’s largest technology corporation is a central facet of sensitive negotiations intended to defuse trade tensions with the U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has expressed optimism that the U.S. would strike a “Phase One” trade deal with China this month, adding that licenses would come “very shortly” for American companies to sell components to Huawei. Till then, the U.S. blacklist is exacting an uncertain toll on the Chinese networking giant.

Zhang said in the past Huawei set one target for smartphone shipments, but now because of increased uncertainty in the market it developed three different goals that include best and worst case scenarios. Under a moderate scenario, smartphone shipments could rise around 20% next year, he said. “Even for the pessimistic one, we see small growth,” said Zhang. The best case projection is for 40% growth.
Huawei, which gets roughly half of its revenue from its smartphone division, has so far managed to sustain an enviable pace of growth despite its precarious situation. It gained market share against Apple and Samsung in the third quarter by expanding smartphone shipments 29%. In its home market shipments jumped 66% in the third quarter but only rose about 18% sequentially abroad, according to Canalys. Huawei posted a 24% surge in revenue in the first nine months of 2019, boosted by a 26% jump in smartphone shipments to 185 million units.

Billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei once predicted the Trump administration’s move could knock $30 billion off his company’s revenue. That amount was later trimmed to $10 billion. Zhang revised down the total impact amount again on Tuesday. “Now I think it’s less than $10 billion,” he said. A significant part of that comes from Huawei’s server business, which he said had been expected to generate revenue of $8 billion this year. “But that will be cut in half,” he said, because Huawei was having difficulty making servers that employed the dominant x86 architecture used by U.S. giants  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc. “Although servers are not our core product, every project involves one,” Zhang said.
He also said 20% to 40% of Huawei’s products were affected by the ban. “Some impact was small, so we could easily find a solution within half a year or three months. But for servers, it impacted our business, our revenue and our strategy for the future as well.”
Longer term, the company is exploring ways to get around a Google blockade. Huawei introduced its Mate 30 series in September, the first marquee phone that runs an open-source version of Android and lacks Google-licensed apps from Gmail to YouTube and Google Play Store.
Huawei is also developing its own operating system, HarmonyOS, which is designed primarily for Internet of Things devices but can also power smartphones. In September, the company offered $1.5 billion to lure global developers to create software for its own ecosystem.

Chevron, which leads the consortium developing one of the Central Asian nation's biggest oilfields, said last week that cost overruns would balloon project expenses by 25% to $45.2 billion..
""Generally, we told them that in our opinion the sum is too high,"" Bozumbayev told reporters when asked about Tengiz costs.
He said Chevron and ExxonMobil have sent experts to Kazakhstan to review the project and it was too early to talk about the final figures.

Russia's LUKOIL (MM:LKOH) and Kazakh state energy firm KazMunayGaz  are also partners in the Tengiz joint venture.

377,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 10:33PM ET</span>","Virgin Australia to trim domestic capacity, axe a Hong Kong route","By Jamie Freed
SYDNEY (Reuters) -  Virgin Australia  Holdings Ltd (AX:VAH) said on Wednesday it plans to cut domestic capacity by at least 2% and remove five aircraft from its fleet as it grapples with stagnant demand.
It will also axe its Melbourne-Hong Kong route, which Virgin said had underperformed amid widespread pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and the carrier will fly from Brisbane to Tokyo's Haneda Airport instead.
The reduction in domestic capacity, which will take place before end-June and comes on the heels of restructuring moves unveiled this year, is aimed at lifting airfares as domestic revenue and demand have flatlined, Chief Executive Paul Scurrah said.
""We are seeing a flat market compared to a very robust first half last year,"" he told media by phone after his company's annual meeting in Brisbane. ""We are seeing the same things our competitor is seeing.""
Bigger rival Qantas Airways (AX:QAN) last month reported revenue per available seat kilometer in its domestic business, had fallen nearly 1% in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Virgin does not provide quarterly revenue updates.
Virgin said in August it would cut 750 jobs, merge business divisions and conduct a sweeping review of its operations after swinging to an annual underlying loss due to soft market conditions and higher fuel costs.
Scurrah said on Wednesday the airline was working to get the balance right between Virgin Australia and its budget brand, Tigerair Australia, so that the pair were no longer operating on the same routes at the same time.
Virgin will remove two Airbus (PA:AIR) A320s from the Tigerair fleet and three Fokker 100s from its business serving regional Australia, he said. It had a fleet of 133 aircraft as of end-June.
In September, Virgin agreed to buy back the 35% of its frequent flyer business that it did not already own from private-equity group Affinity Equity Partners for A$700 million ($482 million).
Scurrah said the frequent flyer deal would yield A$20 million of cost savings, which would help pay the interest on new borrowings taken out to fund the purchase.
Qantas said last month it would increase domestic capacity to maintain market share against Virgin, pointing to forward scheduling data that showed Virgin planned to raise capacity by 2% in the second half ending June 30, 2020.
A Qantas spokesman said on Wednesday his airline always monitored demand and capacity settings and would make changes as appropriate.

“New tariffs treat is not a bargaining chip,” he added.
 
“The U.S.-China trade deal, I think, is really off to a reasonable start.

The California Department of Insurance said on Tuesday it won a court order appointing it conservator of California Insurance Co, a subsidiary of Applied Underwriters Inc.
Berkshire sold its 81% stake in Applied last month to a group that included Applied co-founder Steve Menzies and private equity firm Quadrant Management in a $920 million transaction.
Applied, a specialist in workers’ compensation insurance, completed the transaction after merging California Insurance with an insurer in New Mexico and getting approval for the merger in that state.
Applied has said it sought approval in New Mexico because California took too long to approve the transaction, according to published reports.
However, California said its approval was still required.
Applied did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It told The Wall Street Journal it was considering its options.
The conservatorship was approved by a California state judge in San Mateo County on Monday.
It forbids California Insurance from canceling existing policies, and requires written state approval for the issuance of new policies.
Applied has previously faced state regulatory concerns regarding some workers' compensation policies, and in 2017 settled with California over alleged “bait and switch” marketing tactics.
The insurance department said on Tuesday it acted ""in response to the company's willful violation of state law and established pattern of continually flouting California's regulatory processes.""
California Insurance has $185 million of written premiums in the state, the department said.
Applied was founded in 1994, and moved to Omaha, Nebraska in 1999. Berkshire, which is based in Omaha, acquired its stake in Applied in 2006."

The announcement follows the discovery that five South Korean companies had colluded in delivering oil to U.S. military bases. 
The Procurement Collusion Strike Force will be made up of the department's Antitrust Division, 13 U.S. attorneys' offices, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the offices of inspectors general from the Defense Department, Justice Department, General Services Administration and U.S. Postal Service.
Its creation is a follow-up to the Justice Department's announcement last year that it would be more aggressive in pressing antitrust charges against companies that rig bids for government contracts. [nL2N1XQ1FZ]
The strike force will use data - such as selective bidding that suggests companies are splitting a market - to seek out and prosecute government contractors who collude, according to the department.
About 40% of U.S. government discretionary spending, or about $550 billion in 2018, is disbursed via contracts for goods and services, according to the watchdog Government Accountability Office.
Executives of companies caught bid-rigging can face prison time and the companies can face fines that are triple the gains made in the price fixing.
""The investigation and prosecution of individuals and organizations that cheat, collude and seek to undermine the integrity of government procurement are priorities for this administration,"" said Makan Delrahim, head of the Antitrust Division. ""The PCSF (strike force) will train and educate procurement officials nationwide to recognize and report suspicious conduct.""
In the most recent salient case https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-southkorea-fuel-exclusive/exclusive-three-more-south-korean-firms-rigged-u-s-military-bids-idUSKCN1NQ2C5 of procurement collusion, in November 2018, South Korean companies SK Energy Co Ltd [SKENGG.UL]; GS Caltex Corp, 50% owned by  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX); and Hanjin Transportation Co Ltd agreed to 
plead guilty to criminal charges and pay $236 million for their role in a conspiracy to fix the price of fuel sold to U.S. military bases in South Korea. [nL2N1XX00F]
Two other companies - South Korean oil suppliers S-Oil Corp and Hyundai Oilbank Co [INPTVH.UL] - made a similar settlement early this year. [nL1N2171IG]
The GSA's Office of Inspector General and Justice Department also indicted people for rigging bids for GSA contracts. 
The Justice Department official said that more than one-third of the division's open grand jury investigations related to public procurement, or otherwise involve a government victim.

The department will also reach out to government contracting experts to teach them how to identify instances of collusion and also to government contractors to ensure they know the law.

The Beijing-based lender is selling up to 5.95 billion A shares at 5.5 yuan a share, the filings with the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges said.
The deal, pending the go-ahead from regulators, would be the largest IPO in China since 2015, Dealogic data showed.
The deal also marks the sixth H-share and A-share dual listing of China's leading state-owned lenders, under a year-long push to globalize large mainland lenders.
Set up in 2007, PSBC built its business on a massive client base in China's rural areas thanks to its parent state-owned China Post Group Corp, which operates postal services.
By end-June, PSBC had a total 39,700 branches, 48% of which are located in rural counties and villages. It had some 9.17 trillion yuan savings on book by the end of September, accounting for 96% of the bank's total liabilities.
PSBC's bad loan ratio was 0.83% by the end of the third quarter, far below the industry-wide level of 1.81%, as the lender didn't start its corporate lending business until 2009.

The fund would look to invest in Chinese firms, with companies in a life-sciences park it helped open in the eastern city of Wuxi last year to be among its first beneficiaries, the British drugmaker's chief executive officer, Pascal Soriot, told Reuters.
AstraZeneca was a minority partner in the fund and would mainly play an advisory role in selecting investments and supporting the firms, he said. The companies did not disclose financial details of the deal.
""It's a substantial investment on our side, but also our financial partners,"" Soriot said of the agreement, to be signed with the Chinese investment bank CICC on the sidelines of the China International Import Expo on Wednesday.
""We can help choose some of those investments but we can also help along the way the startup companies, develop products and find their way around the world"" he said, describing it as AstraZeneca's largest-scale healthcare industrial fund.
The company also planned to expand an existing research and development center in Shanghai from 450 employees to 1,000, and establish a new artificial intelligence innovation center in the city.
Western drugmakers have profited from partnerships in China, where AstraZeneca's sales have doubled since 2012, as well as a softening in the regulatory environment for pharmaceutical firms.
But the government has also been trying to slash drug prices, changing the playing field as many firms had relied in the past on selling older drugs at premium prices. In September, China also expanded a pilot bulk-buying program to the entire country in an attempt to negotiate lower prices from drug manufacturers.
Soirot said these were both factors in AstraZeneca's decision to make those investments in China, as the price pressures were encouraging companies to create new drugs that the government was approving and reimbursing at a faster pace.
AstraZeneca, he said, wanted to start making drugs it could export globally from China. Areas of opportunity included oncology and respiratory diseases.
""Historically, until today, our Chinese team has been developing global products for the Chinese market. We want now the Chinese team to take the global leadership on some projects,"" he said."

Shares of parent IAC/InterActiveCorp (O:IAC) also down about 11% after the bell. 
Match has been facing increasing competition from a host of rivals including Bumble and Facebook Inc's (O:FB) dating platform that recently launched in the U.S. in September.
Bumble also stepped up by launching its app in India late last year, a market with a huge potential for dating-related services.
Tinder — which has made ""swipe left"" and ""swipe right"" a point of pop culture conversations - added 437,000 average subscribers in the quarter, down from an addition of 503,000 in the previous quarter. The addition brought Tinder subscribers up to 5.7 million in the third quarter.
To fend off competition, Match has boosted its marketing spend on its money-spinner Tinder in emerging markets, including India and Latin America, as well on its other dating services, PlentyOfFish and Hinge.
Match's total operating expenses rose about 20% to $364.9 million in the quarter.
The owner of OkCupid and PlentyOfFish expects current-quarter total revenue between $545 million and $555 million, below analysts' estimate of $559.3 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The forecast overshadowed a better-than-expected quarterly revenue and a 19% growth in average subscribers that rose to 9.6 million from a year ago, including a rise of about 29% subscribers in its international markets. 
Last month, parent IAC said it intends to spin off its ownership stake in Match Group resulting in the full separation of the two companies.
Match on Tuesday said it expects spin-off related expense to be about $10 million in fiscal 2020.
The revenue forecast comes at a time when Match is in the middle of a U.S. Federal Trade Commission complaint related to the company's certain marketing-related claims.
Total revenue rose 22% to $541.5 million in the third quarter, edging past analysts' estimates of about $540.6 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 

The company's net earnings attributable to Match Group shareholders rose to $151.5 million, or 51 cents per share, for the three months ended Sept. 30, from $130.2 million, or 44 cents per share, a year earlier.

The newspaper said eight Australian regulators had agreed to use their formal powers to press Facebook on its plans to launch the so-called ""stablecoin"" digital currency following an unsatisfactory meeting with the company in October.
A stablecoin is a digital currency tied to a ""stable"" asset or basket of assets that can range from real currencies to commodities. Libra would be pegged to bank deposits and government securities across several currencies such as the dollar and euro.
Australian and international regulators have expressed concern the new currency could disrupt the financial system, harm users of Facebook apps and aid money laundering.
In an email to other regulators cited by the newspaper, Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) deputy commissioner Elizabeth Hampton said: ""If we don't get answers to these questions from the U.S.-based team we will then need to consider whether formal powers are exercised where available.""
The OAIC is the national regulator for privacy and freedom of information.
A specialist committee looking at emerging threats for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission warned commissioners in July that ""all regulated entities"" as well as consumers and investors could be affected if Libra could not be effectively supervised, the newspaper said.
""The proposed Libra ecosystem also poses many risks and threats, including the proliferation of scams based on Libra via mobile apps,"" the ASIC committee said, according to heavily redacted documents obtained by the newspaper.
""We also expect that we may identify more risks and threats once we have more information,"" it said.
The newspaper said Facebook Australia declined to answer a list of detailed questions about its meetings with Australian regulators.
""As a member of the Libra assocaition, we will continue to be a part of dialogue to ensure that this global financial infrastructure is governed in a way that is reflective of the people it serves,"" a Facebook spokesman told the newspaper.

Global securities watchdog IOSCO said on Monday existing securities rules on disclosures, registration and reporting could apply to ""stablecoin"" digital currency initiatives such as Libra to help realise its benefits."
385,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 05:45PM ET</span>",Robert Kaplan Says Steeper Yield Curve a Sign Fed Rates Now Appropriate,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan is taking comfort from the recent steepening in the yield curve and sees it as a sign that the U.S. central bank now has policy in the right place.
“I feel better with a more normally shaped yield curve,” Kaplan told Bloomberg News on Tuesday after speaking at an event in Dallas. Kaplan had voiced concern in the past that having the Fed’s benchmark policy rate above the entire Treasury yield curve was a warning that it had set rates too high.
“So now that we’ve got a 10-year in the 180s and a 2-year in the 160s -- much more in line with the fed funds rate -- I think it again reinforces to me that we’ve probably got an appropriate setting of the Fed funds rate now,” he said.
The 10-year note, currently yielding 1.86%, has widened its spread above the two-year note to around 23 basis points compared to around 10 basis points earlier this month. An inverted yield curve, when short-term yields are above longer-term ones, has historically been an early warning of recessions in the U.S."

Pompeo Shows Discomfort With Giuliani Role (4:20 p.m.)
Secretary of State Michael Pompeo indicated discomfort with Rudy Giuliani’s involvement in U.S. policy toward Ukraine but realized there was little he could do about it, according to transcripts of witness testimony to the House impeachment inquiry released on Tuesday.
One witness, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, said Pompeo “rolled his eyes and said, ‘Yes, it’s something we have to deal with,’” when discussing Giuliani’s role. The other witness, former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker, testified that Pompeo told him he was glad Volker was trying to correct the “damaging or negative image” Giuliani was giving Trump regarding Ukraine.
Both witnesses described a secretary of state who realized there was little he could do to dissuade Trump from listening to Giuliani, though neither said he had first-hand knowledge of Pompeo ever confronting Trump directly. “My speculation is yes, that they hit a brick wall when it came to getting rid of Mr. Giuliani,” Sondland said.
The testimony offers the first detailed description of Pompeo’s impatience with Giuliani. Pompeo has so far refused to offer a public opinion on the former New York mayor’s role, evading questions in numerous television and radio interviews or saying private citizens are often enlisted to help carry out foreign policy.
FBI Head Says He Hasn’t Talked With Giuliani (4:10 p.m.)
FBI Director Christopher Wray told senators on Tuesday he hasn’t had any communication with Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and declined to say whether Giuliani has made formal representations to his investigators on any matters.
Wray also said neither Trump nor anyone at the White House has asked him to open investigations into any particular individuals.
“I think there should be no opening of an investigation based on anything other than the facts and the law,” Wray told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. “My loyalty is to the Constitution and to the people of this country.”
Wray was responding to questions from Senator Kamala Harris, a Democratic presidential candidate.
Wray also said the FBI wants to know about any efforts by individuals or foreign governments to interfere in U.S. elections. -- Chris Strohm
Grisham Says Testimony Backs Trump’s Claims (3:36 p.m.)
White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham repeated her assertion that Trump had done nothing wrong and said the testimony from Sondland and Volker shows “there is even less evidence for this illegitimate impeachment sham than previously thought.”
She cited testimony from Sondland saying he didn’t know why aid to Ukraine was suspended. And she said Volker’s testimony confirms there wasn’t a quid pro quo because the Ukrainians didn’t know funds were suspended at the time.
“No amount of salacious media-biased headlines, which are clearly designed to influence the narrative, change the fact that the president has done nothing wrong,” Grisham said in a statement. -- Jordan Fabian
McConnell Predicts Trump Acquittal by Senate (3:07 p.m.)
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Trump would be acquitted if he faced a Senate impeachment trial now about allegations he pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son.
“I’m pretty sure how it’s likely to end,” McConnell told reporters after a closed-door meeting with all Senate Republicans. “If it were today, I don’t think there’s any question it would not lead to a removal.”
McConnell said he can’t predict how long a trial might take, but said Democrats may have an incentive not to let it last through the party’s presidential primaries scheduled for early next year. Six Senate Democrats are seeking the nomination.
“How long does a presidential candidate want to be here on the floor of the Senate instead of in Iowa and New Hampshire?” McConnell said.
He also said it’s clear that the Democratic-led House will impeach the president, adding that Democrats are “hell-bent to do this.” -- Laura Litvan
Volker Cites Trump Complaint About Ukraine (2:32 p.m.)
Volker, who was Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, told House impeachment investigators that when he advised the president to meet with Ukraine’s new leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump complained that the Ukrainians “tried to take me down.”
The remark appears to be a reference to an unsubstantiated belief among some Trump allies that Ukraine attempted to interfere in the 2016 election on behalf of Trump’s opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Trump referred to the theory in a July 25 phone call with Zelenskiy. After Zelenskiy asked about purchasing additional U.S. anti-tank missiles to combat Russian-backed separatists, Trump responded by saying: “I would like you do us a favor though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,” according to a White House memorandum documenting the call.
Trump then mentioned elements of the theory, including a U.S. cybersecurity firm called CrowdStrike and a Democratic National Committee server that some Trump allies believe was hacked or even physically stolen by Ukrainians. “The server, they say Ukraine has it,” Trump told Zelenskiy.
Zelenskiy responded by telling Trump that “we are ready to open a new page on cooperation in relations” with the U.S., but the Ukrainian leader had no idea what Trump was talking about, according to people familiar with his reaction to the call. -- Steven T. Dennis
Sondland Revises Testimony on Aid Suspension (2:19 p.m.)
Sondland filed a supplemental statement on Monday revising his original testimony, saying that “by the beginning of September 2019, and in the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I presumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement” by Ukraine.
In Sondland’s initial testimony, he said he didn’t recall when he became aware that the corruption that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani was pushing to investigate was actually related to Joe Biden and his son.
Sondland said he reviewed the testimony of two other U.S. officials -- William Taylor and Timothy Morrison -- and their opening statements “refreshed my recollection about certain conversations in early September 2019.” Sondland said he did recall a Sept. 1 conversation in which Ukraine’s president asked Vice President Mike Pence about the U.S. aid for Ukraine that was being withheld.
The statement also said that Sondland now recalls a conversation in which he told Ukrainian official Andriy Yermak that a “resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.” -- Steven T. Dennis
Volker Defends Biden’s Ukraine Policy (1:53 p.m.)
Volker warned Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani that allegations raised by former Ukraine prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko were not credible, and he defended Joe Biden’s push to have Ukraine fire him when Biden served as vice president.
“He was executing U.S. policy at the time and what was widely understood internationally to be the right policy,” Volker told the committees.
He said that when Trump officials recommended to the president on May 23 that he schedule an Oval Office meeting with Ukraine’s new president, Trump said Ukrainians “tried to take me down” and said they should talk to Giuliani.
Volker testified that he was never told why Trump withheld security aid from Ukraine, saying it struck him as “unusual” because the Pentagon, the State Department and the National Security Council all thought the aid was “really important.”
Volker said he first learned of the aid freeze on July 18, a week before Trump’s call with Ukraine’s president -- and he assumed the aid would eventually be released given the support for it inside the administration. -- Billy House and Steven T. Dennis
Sondland Cites Conditions for Trump Meeting (1:45 p.m.)
Sondland testified that a promise by Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden’s son and the 2016 election was a condition that “would have to be complied with” for the country’s leaders to get a meeting with Trump.
“That was my understanding,” Sondland said in excerpts of his interview transcript released by House Democrats on Tuesday.
Sondland says the requests for the Ukrainian government, led by Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, were initially just related to corruption, but “kept getting more insidious” as time went on. He said he wasn’t aware of the connection between the Bidens and the Ukrainian gas company Burisma until later, at least after July.
Sondland said Secretary of State Michael Pompeo described Giuliani’s involvement in foreign affairs as “something we have to deal with.”
“People usually smiled when they heard Rudy’s name because he was always swirling around somewhere,” Sondland said.
Sondland, Volker Interview Excerpts Released (1:32 p.m.)
House committees leading the inquiry released excerpts from Sondland and Volker’s testimony. The excerpts for Sondland can be found here. The excerpts for Volker can be found here.
Sondland and Volker had pivotal roles in the Trump administration’s interactions with Ukraine that are at the heart of the impeachment probe. They and Energy Secretary Rick Perry were the “three amigos” deputized by the White House to help Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani lead back-channel administration overtures to Ukraine.
The releases are part of House Democrats’ effort to open the impeachment process ahead of public hearings expected later this month. Republicans have criticized the private depositions that were attended by members of both parties who sit on the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees. -- Billy House
Mulvaney Asked to Appear for Questioning (12:39 p.m.)
Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney was asked to appear for questioning this Friday by the three House committees leading the inquiry.
The committee leaders said in a statement that their probe shows he may have been “directly involved” in an effort led by Trump, his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others to “withhold a coveted White House meeting and nearly $400 million in security assistance in order to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to pursue investigations that would benefit President Trump’s personal political interests, and jeopardized our national security in attempting to do so.”
The committee leaders cited Mulvaney’s Oct. 17 press conference in which he acknowledged a political motivation for withholding aid to Ukraine, rather than the national interests of the U.S.
The invitation to appear follows an Oct. 4 subpoena for White House documents. The White House didn’t respond to the demand. -- Billy House
White House Aide Doesn’t Appear for Hearing (9:34 a.m.)
Griffith has not arrived for his closed-door testimony and is not expected to, according to an official familiar with the actions of the three House committees leading the inquiry.

388,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 05:44PM ET</span>",Singapore Central Bank Weighs New Financing Perks in Green Push,"(Bloomberg) -- Follow Bloomberg on LINE messenger for all the business news and analysis you need.
Singapore may expand green financing incentives for financial services companies to boost their resilience against the economic impact of climate change.
That’s according to Monetary Authority of Singapore Managing Director, Ravi Menon, who says the central bank sees opportunity to expand its sustainable grant program beyond bonds. Financial institutions need to prepare for potential changes in asset values and policy caused by climate change, and be able to seize new business opportunities, he said.
Other areas that can be promoted include green funds, loans, insurance and risk-transfer solutions, according to Menon.
“The economy of the future has to be greener, which means the financial sector has to be greener than before and be in a position to support that kind of activity,” Menon said in an interview in Singapore. “If you look at the full range of financial services then the challenge is to ask ourselves: have we applied our minds to make each of these services and offerings conducive to creating a more green economy that has lower carbon footprint?”
Southeast Asian nations are some of the most vulnerable to climate change and are estimated to need $200 billion in green investments each year to 2030. Singapore issuers have so far sold about S$6 billion ($4.4 billion) worth of green bonds, a small portion of Singapore’s S$96 billion corporate bond market, MAS data showed.
The MAS rolled out its green bond grant program three years ago to help companies fund up to S$100,000 in expenses related to obtaining a review for green bond sales. Borrowers must sell bonds that are at a minimum S$200 million in size, or have a bond program of that amount with an initial issuance of at least S$20 million.
The central bank expanded this in February to include securities that target social works and sustainability.
“For the last two to three years, we’ve had the green bond scheme which we’ve expanded considerably, and we are now thinking about this in other areas of finance,” Menon said.
Sustainability Disclosures
An important step in developing the local green finance industry is to tackle company disclosure on sustainability issues, according to Menon. While publicly listed companies are given guidelines on sustainability reporting, “the quality of the disclosure quite frankly varies widely,” he said.
Local financial services players, including the nation’s biggest banks, appear to be taking heed to the growing interest in green finance. Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. wants to build a sustainable finance portfolio of S$10 billion by 2022, while United Overseas Bank said it would halt funding for new coal-fired power plants. Southeast Asia’s biggest lender, DBS Bank Ltd., has been extending sustainability-linked loans to borrowers such as CapitaLand.
“If climate change is indeed the existential challenge facing mankind, the strategies that we embark on mitigating and managing that process will have huge impact on economies,” Menon said. “I think greening the financial system will be as important as the technological transformation of the financial sector.”"

The Nasdaq Composite was up only slightly, with chip and networking stocks providing the fuel. But that, too, was a new closing high -- but barely a closing high.
The Nasdaq 100 index, dominated by big technology stocks, fell back a half point after hitting closing highs on Friday and Monday.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which hit a new intraday high, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) closed down very slightly, their losses costing the index a whopping two points in total. The index was down a half point.
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN), up 6.9%, and Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) were the index leaders.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) was up 2%, adding 48 points to the blue-chip index, because, in a CNBC interview, its new board chairman David Calhoun voiced confidence for CEO Dennis Muilenburg's performance in the 737 Max crisis, although the CEO will give up his 2019 bonus.
As cynical as it sounds, the stock is still up 11% on the year, a signal that many investors are willing to stick with Boeing and expected the aerospace giant to come out of the crisis caused when two 737 Max jets fell out of the sky in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Calhoun acknowledged engineering problems with the plane and said the company will be compensating customers forced to ground their 737 Max planes.
Walgreens jumped on a Reuters report it may be looking at going private in what might be one of the biggest leveraged buyouts ever. The gain was good for 11 points for the Dow, which ended the day up 30.5 points.
If a deal can be done, it would take a lesser-performer out of the Dow. The shares are off about 7% on the year, when the index itself is up 17.8%. (The big downside to a buyout would be how many people would lose jobs in cost cutting.) 
 
Transportation stocks had a strong day, reflecting hopes that a trade deal between the United States and China will boost shipping and air travel.
The Dow Jones Transportation Average hit a new intraday high of 11,161.32. The average ended up 0.6% but fell short of a new closing high. Nonetheless, the average moved up on big gains for logistics giant Expeditors International of Washington (NASDAQ:EXPD) and strength in airline stocks. JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) hit a 52-week high.
A rising transportation average is an important coincident index. If the economy is growing, consumers are buying stuff. If they're buying more stuff, someone needs to ship it. Trucks are a key transportation mode, and PACCAR (NASDAQ:PCAR), the big maker of trucks, hit a new all-time high.
The index is up 20.5% for the year and 13.5% since slumping in May.
The gains for the transports were strong enough to overcome weakness from rising oil prices and higher interest rates as well. The 10-Year Treasury yield rose to 1.855% from Monday's 1.788%.
Supermarket giant Kroger (NYSE:KR), International Flavors & Fragrances (NYSE:IFF), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) and Under Armour Inc C (NYSE:UA) were among the top S&P 500 performers. 
Pharmaceutical company Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL), medical-equipment maker Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX), oil company Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and animal medicine company IDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ:IDXX) were among the weakest S&P 500 performers. "

392,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 04:28PM ET</span>","Bankrupt Puerto Rico eyes new debt policy, will pay holiday bonus","SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico would place restrictions on its future debt sales under proposed legislation that won praise on Tuesday from the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth's federally created financial oversight board.
Puerto Rico's bankruptcy takes up the bulk of the island's $120 billion of debt and pension obligations and analysts have raised questions about the island's future market access due to the board's attempt to void some outstanding bonds.
Under legislation backed by Governor Wanda Vazquez Garced, the Puerto Rico Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority would be charged with developing a policy for the government and its public corporations that sets a limit on tax-backed debt.
The agency would also have to approve any debt issuance, which would be limited to maturities of no more than 30 years with proceeds allocated for only capital improvements. Principal payments would be required to begin within two years of issuance.
Debt refinancings would have to produce debt service savings without extending maturity dates beyond those on existing bonds. Exceptions would be made for bond refundings to address natural disasters or emergencies.
""Upon the possibility and need that the government returns to capital markets and in accordance with our public policy, this law establishes uniform and responsible processes for any future debt issuance,"" the governor said in a statement.
The board said it welcomed a policy to prevent a repetition of ""irresponsible fiscal management and debt issuances"" that led to the island's financial crisis and subsequent 2017 bankruptcy filing.
The bill now heads to the legislature, where support for the measure was unclear.
Concerns have been raised about Puerto Rico's future ability to access the U.S. municipal market without paying a bruising penalty given the board's contention that more than $6 billion of general obligation bonds sold in 2012 and 2014 should be invalidated because they breached a debt limit in the island's constitution.
Meanwhile, the governor and the board announced on Tuesday that public sector workers will receive about $60 million in Christmas bonuses this year.
In July, the board said its $20.2 billion, fiscal 2020 budget for Puerto Rico's central government would prohibit officials from moving money around to pay for things not in the board's fiscal plan like the bonus, which has been the subject of past spending disputes.
On Tuesday, the board said that the bonus is ""part of the routine compensation package provided to public employees,"" and that it worked with the governor to identify funding to pay for it.

393,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 04:28PM ET</span>",S&P 500 retreats slightly after recent record,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The benchmark S&P 500 edged lower on Tuesday, as investors paused in the wake of a rally buoyed by hopes of a trade deal between the United States and China that sent the three main U.S. stock indexes to record highs in the previous session.
While there was growing optimism over a deal, investors have also shown caution, pushing up value stocks over growth names over the past few sessions. The Russell 1000 value (RLV) index has climbed nearly 2% over the past three sessions compared to a gain of 0.8% for the Russell 1000 growth (RLG) index. 
Keeping some tentativeness intact, China is pushing President Donald Trump to remove more tariffs as part of the ""phase one"" deal, which may be signed this month, according to latest reports.
""The market is at an all time high, people are getting a little skittish about the deal,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.
""Definitely a move to value, but it is more of a move to financials because rates are moving higher and a move to energy because the commodity is moving higher and those are two sectors that have gotten absolutely mauled by the market, the valuations are cheap there.""
Financials (SPSY), a big weight for value stocks, rose 0.42% as benchmark U.S. Treasury yields hit a six-week high and energy (SPNY), gained 0.45% as oil climbed more than 1% as the best performing S&P sectors. The rate-sensitive real estate sector <.SPLRCR> dropped 1.76%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 30.52 points, or 0.11%, to 27,492.63, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 3.65 points, or 0.12%, to 3,074.62 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 1.48 points, or 0.02%, to 8,434.68.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed at record highs for a second session on Monday, while the Dow hit a record high for the first time since July.
Apart from hopes of a resolution to the trade war, stocks have received a boost from a largely better-than-expected third-quarter earnings season, the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut and upbeat economic data.
Data on Tuesday showed the reading on the ISM services index improved to 54.7 in October from 52.6 in September, above expectations of 53.4, according to economists polled by Reuters, easing concerns that a slowdown in the manufacturing sector was spreading to other parts of the economy.
Over three quarters of S&P 500 companies that have reported results so far have beaten profit expectations, Refinitiv data showed. Earnings for the quarter are now expected to dip 0.8%, an improvement from the 2.2% decline expected on Oct. 1. 
A 2.05% rise in Boeing Co's (N:BA) shares provided the biggest boost to the blue-chip Dow Jones index after Chairman Dave Calhoun said the company's board believed CEO Dennis Muilenburg ""has done everything right"" following two fatal crashes of its 737 MAX jet.
Helping the Nasdaq advance was Adobe Inc (O:ADBE), which gained 4.25% as the Photoshop software maker raised its fourth-quarter digital media annualized recurring revenue target and gave a strong forecast for fiscal 2020. 
 Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) fell 9.85% as the ride-hailing service posted a bigger third-quarter loss from a year earlier.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.13-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.10-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 58 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 148 new highs and 40 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.89 billion shares, compared to the 6.61 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

394,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 04:18PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Walgreens has explored taking drug store chain private - sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Mike Spector
(Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA) has been exploring whether to go private following private equity interest in the U.S drug store chain, which has a market value of more than $55 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
In recent months, Walgreens has held preliminary discussions with some of the world's largest private equity firms about putting together what would be the biggest ever leveraged buyout, the sources said. 
Walgreens has tasked investment bank  Evercore Partners Inc  (N:EVR) with exploring whether a transaction can be put together, the sources said, cautioning that a deal is far from certain.
Many private equity firms have pushed back on the idea, concerned about Walgreens' business prospects and the challenges of financing the deal, the sources added. 
A leveraged buyout of Walgreens would likely require participation of several private equity firms, each writing large checks, at a time when many of them have lost their appetite for teaming together on so-called club deals. Many of those takeovers were completed during a boom preceding the 2008 financial crisis and subsequently struggled or collapsed. 
Walgreens Chief Executive Stefano Pessina, who is the company's largest shareholder with a 16% stake, could roll his equity into the deal to help finance the transaction, one of the sources said.
Walgreens has also contemplated divesting some of its assets, such as its 27% stake in drug wholesaler AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC), to provide more funding, one of the sources added.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Walgreens and Evercore declined to comment.
Walgreens shares rose 8% to $64.12 in New York after Reuters was first to report the news on Tuesday. It later gave back some of those gains and was up about 3%. The stock had lost 28% of its value in the last 12 months, compared to a 13% rise in the S&P 500 Index (INX). 
Walgreens' deliberations over going private reflect the challenges its business faces.
Last week, it warned it did not expect its adjusted earnings to grow in fiscal 2020 because of the low reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, especially generics, and competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). 
The Deerfield, Illinois-based company, which operates Walgreens and Duane Reade pharmacies in the United States and Boots in Britain, has been closing stores and launching cross-selling partnerships with companies such as grocer  Kroger Co  (N:KR) and weight loss clinic operator Jenny Craig, as it seeks to cut costs and boost its growth prospects. 
Some analysts said that going private could allow Walgreens to avoid the prying eyes of Wall Street, and invest in its business and offerings without having to worry about quarterly earnings. But many questioned whether such a large leveraged buyout was possible.
""Given poor industry fundamentals, seemingly never-ending margin pressures faced in the healthcare supply chain, and, let's face it, ongoing uncertainty about unpredictable items such as opioids exposure, we would struggle to see a monster premium beyond this current run-up (in the stock),"" Baird analyst Eric Coldwell wrote in a note.
DEALMAKING
Walgreens' approach toward alliances and joint ventures stands in stark contrast to the strategy of rival CVS health Corp (N:CVS), which acquired U.S. health insurer  Aetna Inc  (NYSE:AET) for $70 billion last year. CVS shares have performed better than Walgreens in the last 12 months, down about 7%. 
In 2017, Walgreens dropped a $17.2 billion deal to buy smaller peer  Rite Aid Corp  (N:RAD) after failing to win U.S. antitrust approval. Instead, it agreed to acquire 1,932 Rite Aid stores, about 42% of its total. The retail footprint proved too big for Walgreens, which has been gradually closing some locations.
Last year, Walgreens explored other deals, including buying out the rest of AmerisourceBergen and buying a stake in U.S. health insurer  Humana Inc  (N:HUM), as well as selling a stake to it. It did not pursue those transactions, although it has been expanding its partnership with Humana by providing primary care services and support for seniors inside Walgreens stores. 
Pessina, 78, would not be the first company boss to be involved in talks to take his firm private. Dell Technologies Inc (N:DELL) CEO Michael Dell, for example, took the computer maker private in 2013 in a $24.9 billion deal backed by private equity firm Silver Lake. After a string of acquisitions, Dell returned to the stock market as a public company last year and now has a market value of $39 billion.
But Dell owned about three-quarters of his company at the time of the leveraged buyout, making its funding easier. 

Last year, former  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) executive chairman Paul Jacobs briefly explored a long-shot bid to take the U.S. semiconductor company, which has a market capitalization of $103 billion, private.

395,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 04:14PM ET</span>","WeWork still on life support, rivals say it must cut costs fast","By Carrie Monahan and Sheila Dang
NEW YORK (Reuters) - SoftBank may be rescuing WeWork with a $9.5 billion cash injection but most rivals say they believe the office space sharing company is still in critical condition.
They say for Manhattan-based WeWork to survive it will need to slash costs and balance sheet risk, and it will need to do that fast without scaring off customers. 
In interviews, six rivals were mostly more sober than gleeful about WeWork's fall to earth, which has seen estimates of its valuation drop from $47 billion or more in August to as little as $5.9 billion based on terms of the SoftBank lifeline. Hedge fund investor Bill Ackman warned last week it may be worth nothing.
The company was forced to abandon its plan for an initial public offering as investors questioned big losses, whether its business model was sustainable, and the way it was run by its cofounder Adam Neumann, who subsequently quit as chief executive. 
Through its rescue, Japanese technology investment company SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) is seeking to protect its previous investment of about $10 billion in WeWork, though many investors and analysts question whether it will ever be able to recoup that. Its stake will rise to 80 percent from 30 percent.
Rivals suggest many ways for WeWork to reduce losses, all painful. 
They include closing or selling operations in some secondary or poorly performing places, as well as getting out of activities such as construction that are not essential to its main business. The competitors say WeWork should also stop discounting, mothball some of the floors of newly leased real estate, and seek new ways to partner with landlords and investors.
Big job cuts are a given.
But it is a long road to profitability. 
""When I try to do the math with divestitures of non-core (businesses) and layoffs, those things alone are not buying them enough runway,"" said Joshua White, managing director of MakeOffices, which has 16 office sharing sites across three U.S. cities.
He said WeWork has to ""switch from growth at all costs to profit at all costs,"" but the long-term leases it has signed are a barrier. Getting out of those could mean large penalty payments.
""WeWork is in a very challenging situation,"" said Charles Robinson, senior vice-president for U.S. operations at Servcorp, an Australia-based company with more than 160 sites across the globe. ""They're going to have to look at ways of getting some of those liabilities off their balance sheet without destroying their reputation.""
He added: ""Best-case scenario – if they do fix it, the company will be valued at $4 billion.""
BLEEDING CASH
The company has added 114 new sites in the past four months, according to its website, and is planning on opening another 208 in the next few months, bringing its total to 850. 
It already had $18 billion of long-term lease obligations at the end of June.
In response to questions from Reuters, a WeWork spokesperson said: ""Our industry-leading core business continues to perform well, and our new executive leadership is focused on growing our global workspace platform while accelerating our path to profitability.""
WeWork's new Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure told employees late last month after the SoftBank rescue announcement that there was ""zero risk of the company going bankrupt."" He said WeWork would get back to basics, make profitability a priority, and review its markets to see if they made sense.
He said there would be an unspecified number of layoffs. In recent weeks, sources close to the company have talked about as many as 4,000 job cuts out of more than 12,500 employees it had at the end of June. 
That will put WeWork in the extraordinary position of firing employees at a time when it is opening many new offices.
WeWork has been bleeding cash at a fast rate. 
Sources familiar with the situation said it was set to run out of cash in November if it had not had the Softbank injection. It had $2.47 billion of cash on its books on June 30. 
The cash burn rate may also be increasing in the short term. While a $185 million ""consulting"" fee being made to Neumann is being separately funded by SoftBank, WeWork will have to fund severance costs for those being laid off, and pay any additional advisers hired for the SoftBank deal.
It means that the $5 billion of debt and $1.5 billion of equity SoftBank is providing will also be quickly eaten through unless it slashes costs and boosts revenue. The other $3 billion from SoftBank was used to acquire shares from Neumann and other shareholders.
WeWork declined to comment on its cash burn rate.
It is also unclear if weeks of negative publicity has hurt revenue, whether in deterring new customers or unsettling existing tenants. 
Longer term, WeWork could try to move to more of a franchising model, reducing the leasing liability problem, some rivals say, though potential returns are much lower. Another less risky model would be to focus more on management partnerships with landlords and manage space for a fee.
Such transformations would be difficult. ""I think they're a long way's off earning the trust of landlords to become a licensee,"" said John Arenas, CEO Of Serendipity Labs, which has coworking sites in 37 places in the United States.
Another big change suggested is that WeWork stop offering incentives to customers. That prospect does excite some rivals. ""We're jumping out of our seats right now,"" said Jamie Hodari, the CEO of Industrious, with sites in 33 American markets.
(This version corrects paragraph 22 to make it clear that SoftBank is separately funding fee to Neumann)

397,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 04:00PM ET</span>",Wall Street increasingly weighs risk from climate change,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the wake of two years of devastating wildfires in California, Wall Street is incorporating a new risk metric when evaluating companies: climate resiliency. 
Investors, analysts, research firms and companies are putting more emphasis on how climate issues ranging from rising sea levels to record heatwaves will affect profits and revenues in the United States and what companies are doing to address those risks. 
Companies located in areas such as California, Florida and Louisiana that put them at a higher risk of being affected by more severe weather patterns are increasingly being asked how they will protect their businesses from climate change. 
Overall, more than 70 firms have discussed the potential impact of climate change on their business on their quarterly results calls since the start of the year, more than double that of last year or any other year since 2014, according to a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data. 
As a result, fund managers, who typically do not incorporate environmental attributes in their analysis of a company, are taking a closer look at whether the physical locations of their property and equipment will put them at a higher risk of being impacted by climate change. 
""Without expecting a company to significantly change its strategy, we are increasingly having conversations with management teams to ask them about their plans for climate resilience,"" said Arthur Hurley, senior portfolio manager on the Columbia Real Estate Fund. 
So-called ESG funds, which focus on a company's environmental, social, and governance attributes, have been at the forefront of focusing on the physical risks of climate change. 
But now fund managers like Hurley are finding that companies in their portfolio like  Equity Lifestyle Properties Inc  (N:ELS), are revealing to analysts on their earnings call that they are evaluating the potential for rising water levels when it purchases new marinas. Shares of the company are up 43% for the year to date. 
Hurley said he is actively going into companies, like Equity Lifestyle and Boston Properties Inc (N:BXP), that are preemptively addressing potential climate impacts, whether by focusing more on the elevation of potential developments or incorporating construction design elements like putting critical equipment above floor grade. 
Fund managers say that the bankruptcy of San Francisco-based power company Pacific Gas & Electric Co (A:PCG_pa) (N:PCG) in January prompted them to put more emphasis on climate risks. 
Wildfires that broke out Oct. 23 could undermine California's largest utility's $14 billion plan to finance its turnaround after filing in January for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection anticipating its liabilities from massive wildfires in 2017 and 2018 blamed on its equipment could top $30 billion.
ONCE AN UNCONTEMPLATED RISK
At the same time, there have been 10 weather and climate disaster events that have caused more than $1 billion in damages since the start of the year, already nearly double the average of 6.3 events for each full-year between 1980 and 2018, according to National Centers for Environmental Information. 
Insurance claims for what were once considered secondary perils - such as wildfires and hail - have accounted for $13 billion out of $15 billion in natural disaster claims through August, according to Swiss Re. 
The increase in wildfires has prompted underwriters, such as  Hiscox  Ltd (L:HSX) to incorporate new risks models and stop insuring some clients in high-risk areas such as California. 
Overall, 10% of insurers refused to renew policies in wildfire-prone areas in California in 2018, according to the California Department of Insurance. 
Research firms including S&P Global's Trucost division are rolling out more climate risk analytics that are meant to help investors assess the specific climate risks that each company faces. 
The firm is publishing a report in the next few weeks that will focus on companies that face the highest physical risks of climate change, a spokeswoman said.
In March, Silicon Valley start-up Jupiter Inc announced that it had completed a $23 million Series B funding round to expand its analytics services that can provide investors and companies with detailed short and long-term weather patterns for specific locations. 
""This is something that's not going away soon,"" said Gregory Peters, managing director, multi-sector and strategy head at PGIM Fixed Income. 
As a result, he has trimmed his positions in some California utilities, while analysts on his real estate team are increasingly focusing on climate risk. 
""That risk attached to the utilities is kind of a new thing that we didn't necessarily contemplate a couple of years ago.""

398,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 03:18PM ET</span>",U.S. SEC proposes rules that could limit shareholder voices,"By Katanga Johnson and Jessica DiNapoli
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wall Street's top regulator on Tuesday proposed a pair of long-awaited rules that would set new limits on shareholders’ ability to call for corporate changes on thorny issues like climate change disclosures and executive compensation.
In one of the biggest wins for the corporate lobby under President Donald Trump, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission voted 3-2 along partisan lines to raise the re-submission thresholds for motions that shareholders file on company ballots and to put new requirements on firms guiding investors how to vote in corporate elections. 
Both shareholder proposals and proxy advisory firms are cornerstones of corporate governance and how investors hold management accountable.
Both changes will be subject to public comment. 
Democrats Rob Jackson and Allison Herren Lee voted against the rules, saying they tilted the playing field toward corporate management. 
""In each aspect of today’s two proposals, the odds are stacked against shareholders,"" Lee said. 
The current thresholds for re-submissions of proposals date from 1954, SEC officials said. Under the new rule, proposals resubmitted to companies within five years must have won 5% support in the past, up from 3% under current guidelines, with other minimum thresholds increasing for the second and third times proposals are resubmitted, SEC officials said.
The agency's proposed rule aims to end shareholder proposals that appear on corporate ballots with diminishing levels of support, officials said.
The SEC also proposed to require proxy advisory firms to give companies two chances to review their recommendations before they are sent to shareholders. 
Proxy advisory firms, including Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., recommend to investors how to vote and cast ballots on behalf of some asset managers.
Tuesday's proposal seeks to impose a ""review and response process"" by allowing companies five days to review proxy adviser proposals and provide feedback to the advisers, who would then have two days to notify companies when they will send their recommendations, SEC officials said.
The process aims to ""allow advisers and companies to better communicate about the aspects of the proxy advisory report that meets a standard of interest"" on proposed issues, they said.
Industry groups, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, both of which lobbied aggressively for the proposals, praised the SEC's moves.
""The current opaque system of proxy advice degrades the information available to investors,"" Tom Quaadman of the Chamber told Reuters. 
""Reforming the proxy process will empower manufacturers to invest in our people and our communities more confidently,"" said NAM chief executive, Jay Timmons.
New York City Comptroller, Scott Stringer, said that if implemented, the agency's actions would be ""a shameful gift to corporate executives at the expense of shareowners.""
ISS President and Chief Executive Gary Retelny said in a statement that institutional investors, which hire proxy advisers, had not called for the new rules.
“Rulemaking typically is a lengthy and deliberative process and one can hope the SEC listens to and addresses the concerns of the investors it is charged with protecting."" 
Jackson said the agency should have a taken a more ""nuanced approach"" in its data analysis to determine which shareholder proposals are value-enhancing versus value-destroying, and tailored the proposal accordingly. 

""Whatever problems plague corporate America today, too much accountability is simply not one of them,"" he said.

399,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 02:36PM ET</span>",Sondland Revises Testimony on Aid Suspension: Impeachment Update,"(Bloomberg) -- House committees investigating President Donald Trump released transcripts Tuesday of closed-door testimony from Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and former special envoy Kurt Volker.
The Sondland transcript is here and here, and Volker’s transcript is here and here.
Sondland Revises Testimony on Aid Suspension (2:19 p.m.)
Sondland filed a supplemental statement on Monday revising his original testimony, saying that “by the beginning of September 2019, and in the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I presumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement” by Ukraine.
Read the full transcript of Kurt Volker’s interview: Part 1  and Part 2.
In Sondland’s initial testimony, he said he didn’t recall when he became aware that the corruption that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani was pushing to investigate was actually related to Joe Biden and his son.
Sondland said he reviewed the testimony of two other U.S. officials -- William Taylor and Timothy Morrison -- and their opening statements “refreshed my recollection about certain conversations in early September 2019.” Sondland said he did recall a Sept. 1 conversation in which Ukraine’s president asked Vice President Mike Pence about the U.S. aid for Ukraine that was being withheld.
The statement also said that Sondland now recalls a conversation in which he told Ukrainian official Andriy Yermak that a “resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.”
Volker Defends Biden’s Ukraine Policy (1:53 p.m.)
Volker warned Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani that allegations raised by former Ukraine prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko were not credible, and he defended Joe Biden’s push to have Ukraine fire him when Biden served as vice president.
“He was executing U.S. policy at the time and what was widely understood internationally to be the right policy,” Volker told the committees.
Read the full transcript of Gordon Sondland’s interview: Part 1 and Part 2.
He said that when Trump officials recommended to the president on May 23 that he schedule an Oval Office meeting with Ukraine’s new president, Trump said Ukrainians “tried to take me down” and said they should talk to Giuliani.
Volker testified that he was never told why Trump withheld security aid from Ukraine, saying it struck him as “unusual” because the Pentagon, the State Department and the National Security Council all thought the aid was “really important.”
Volker said he first learned of the aid freeze on July 18, a week before Trump’s call with Ukraine’s president -- and he assumed the aid would eventually be released given the support for it inside the administration.
Sondland Cites Conditions for Trump Meeting (1:45 p.m.)
Sondland testified that a promise by Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden’s son and the 2016 election was a condition that “would have to be complied with” for the country’s leaders to get a meeting with Trump.
“That was my understanding,” Sondland said in excerpts of his interview transcript released by House Democrats on Tuesday.
Sondland says the requests for the Ukrainian government, led by Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, were initially just related to corruption, but “kept getting more insidious” as time went on. He said he wasn’t aware of the connection between the Bidens and the Ukrainian gas company Burisma until later, at least after July.
Sondland said Secretary of State Michael Pompeo described Giuliani’s involvement in foreign affairs as “something we have to deal with.”
“People usually smiled when they heard Rudy’s name because he was always swirling around somewhere,” Sondland said.
Sondland, Volker Interview Excerpts Released (1:32 p.m.)
House committees leading the inquiry released excerpts from Sondland and Volker’s testimony. The excerpts for Sondland can be found here. The excerpts for Volker can be found here.
Sondland and Volker had pivotal roles in the Trump administration’s interactions with Ukraine that are at the heart of the impeachment probe. They and Energy Secretary Rick Perry were the “three amigos” deputized by the White House to help Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani lead back-channel administration overtures to Ukraine.
The releases are part of House Democrats’ effort to open the impeachment process ahead of public hearings expected later this month. Republicans have criticized the private depositions that were attended by members of both parties who sit on the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees. -- Billy House
Mulvaney Asked to Appear for Questioning (12:39 p.m.)
Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney was asked to appear for questioning this Friday by the three House committees leading the inquiry.
The committee leaders said in a statement that their probe shows he may have been “directly involved” in an effort led by Trump, his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others to “withhold a coveted White House meeting and nearly $400 million in security assistance in order to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to pursue investigations that would benefit President Trump’s personal political interests, and jeopardized our national security in attempting to do so.”
The committee leaders cited Mulvaney’s Oct. 17 press conference in which he acknowledged a political motivation for withholding aid to Ukraine, rather than the national interests of the U.S.
The invitation to appear follows an Oct. 4 subpoena for White House documents. The White House didn’t respond to the demand. -- Billy House
White House Aide Doesn’t Appear for Hearing (9:34 a.m.)
Griffith has not arrived for his closed-door testimony and is not expected to, according to an official familiar with the actions of the three House committees leading the inquiry.
Duffey’s testimony is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, but White House officials have said that he won’t appear. -- Billy House
Key Events
Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said she was warned by officials in the country that Rudy Giuliani was maneuvering against her and that the Ukrainian officials were concerned about getting dragged into U.S. politics, according to a transcript of her testimony released Monday.The transcript from Michael McKinley, former senior adviser to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, shows he proposed publishing a statement of support for Yovanovitch after Trump’s criticism of her became public, but Pompeo didn’t put out the statement.None of the four scheduled Trump administration witnesses appeared Monday to be deposed by House investigators. They are National Security Council attorney John Eisenberg; Robert Blair, aide to White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney; Michael Ellis, deputy legal adviser to the NSC; and Brian McCormack, an associate director at the Office of Management and Budget.Other transcripts were released Monday.

Companies are targeting oil in the fast-growing field, but pipeline construction has lagged, leaving natural gas as a byproduct to be burned or vented. 
Producers should get flaring and venting rates to 2% or less and not drill wells before pipelines are complete, Sheffield said during a call with analysts.
""We do not connect any new horizontal wells to production unless the gas line is already in place,"" Sheffield said. ""I think that's something that should be adopted by all producers in the Permian Basin.""
Pioneer's flaring rate is around 1%, the second-lowest in the basin behind  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), according to an investor presentation with Rystad Energy data. The average for its peer group was a 5% flaring rate.
Gas flaring and venting in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico reached a new high of 750 million cubic feet per day in the third quarter, according to estimates released on Tuesday by Rystad Energy.
During the previous nine months, flaring and venting averaged 600 million to 650 million cubic feet per day, Rystad said.
The upswing is being driven by more drilling and fracking, pipeline bottlenecks and new production in areas that lack gathering lines and processing plants.
The Texas portion of the Permian's Delaware Basin accounted for 40% of the field's flaring and venting, Rystad said.

401,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 02:29PM ET</span>","FCC releases order approving Sprint, T-Mobile merger, vote was along party lines","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday released its order approving T-Mobile US Inc's (O:TMUS) proposed $26.5 billion tie-up with Sprint Corp (N:S) in a vote split along party lines.
Chairman Ajit Pai and two other Republican commissioners voted to approve the deal while two Democratic commissioners voted against it. The FCC commissioners voted earlier this month but the order was not made public until they could cut confidential information and give commissioners time to draft statements.
The two companies, the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers, have been fighting for government approval since April 2018, and still face a lawsuit brought by a group of state attorneys general, headed by New York.
The lawsuit - against Sprint and its parent company, Softbank Group Corp (T:9984), and T-Mobile and its parent, Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn) - argues the deal will lead to higher prices for consumers. A trial date has been set for Dec. 9.
Pai said in a statement that the deal would allow T-Mobile to deploy the next generation of wireless, called 5G, even in rural America, where connectivity has lagged.
""While Sprint is not on the brink of financial collapse, there are serious questions about how strong a competitor it can be in the years to come on a standalone basis,"" he said in a statement accompanying the order.
Democratic FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks said in his dissent, ""the most likely effect of this merger will be higher prices and fewer options for all Americans."" He added the deal ""is exactly the type of merger that the Justice Department and the Commission have discouraged and rejected in the past: one that would harm competition and result in higher prices and poorer service, particularly for the most vulnerable consumers.""
The U.S. Justice Department approved the deal in July.

Under the Justice Department deal, the companies would divest Sprint’s prepaid businesses, including Boost Mobile, to satellite television company Dish Network Corp (O:DISH), and provide it with access to 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations. That deal is worth about $5 billion.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A Brazilian mining joint venture between Vale SA (SA:VALE3) and BHP Group Plc (L:BHPB), paralyzed after a fatal dam collapse, is soon expected to resume talks to restructure $4 billion in defaulted debt in coming weeks, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.
The venture, Samarco Mineracao SA, last month won permission to resume operations at its Germano iron ore mine, four years after a dam burst in the city of Mariana, in Minas Gerais state, that killed 19 people and contaminated rivers.
The license, granted in late October, clears the way for production to resume in the second half of 2020, but at a fraction of its output before the accident, meaning limited potential revenue to service debt, at least initially.
Although restructuring talks had not been formally interrupted, they were paused over the last two years as the company and prosecutors negotiated a time frame to resume operations.
Vale is being advised in the talks by  Moelis & Co  (N:MC), BHP Plc by Rothschild, and Samarco by JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), according to the sources.
Vale, Samarco and BHP declined to comment.
An agreement with creditors on the debt restructuring, which is expected to address the pace of payments as well as any reduction in principal, could take months, the sources added.
Resumption of operations at the mine depends on Samarco's planned adoption of mining waste disposal techniques that avoid the use of tailings dams similar to those which collapsed near Mariana and - earlier this year in a similar fatal disaster - the town of Brumadinho.
Production could resume at 8 million tonnes of iron ore a year, with Samarco not returning to its pre-collapse level output of 25 million tonnes for a decade, the company has said."

PARIS (Reuters) - Lazard's Jean-Louis Girodolle has no intention of becoming a ""public figure"" as he emerges from the shadow of Matthieu Pigasse as the investment bank's new boss in France.
Pigasse, a former senior French Treasury official, was widely credited with bringing in millions of dollars of business during his 17 years at Lazard, including its mandate to advise oil giant Saudi Aramco on its planned listing. 
His abrupt exit last month raised questions over Lazard's (N:LAZ) ability to adapt its business model to life without a key ""rainmaker"".
""It's not a one-man show,"" Girodolle, the new CEO of Lazard's investment banking in France, told Reuters in an interview at its Paris offices on Boulevard Haussmann.
""My intention is not to run alone. I will make sure that everyone feels included, listened to and part of the game,"" the 51-year old executive said.
Paris is the firm's second most important hub after New York, running much of its European and Middle Eastern business, as well as all of its sovereign advisory work.
Lazard ranks as France's second biggest advisory firm after  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) for the first 10 months of 2019, Refinitiv data showed. 
""Matthieu didn't leave because the Paris office is in some kind of crisis,"" said Girodolle, sporting a goatee beard and dressed in a black suit. 
""This is one of the most dynamic offices within the organization and we don't feel the need to change our strategy.""
Girodolle, who joined Lazard in 2007, is known by rivals as the archetypal French banker, having previously worked for the French Government Shareholding Agency as well as the Ministry of Finance in various senior roles. 
Like Pigasse, also 51, Girodolle studied at the prestigious Sciences Po university in Paris before attending the Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA), well-known as a stepping-stone for France's political and business elite.
He initially handled major deals involving state-backed firms, but his responsibilities grew in recent years to overseeing operations while Pigasse was on the road hunting down deal mandates.
Pigasse, who has said he is looking to pursue a ""new entrepreneurial project"", declined to comment when approached by Reuters. His farewell followed the departure of two other bankers Nicolas Constant and Pierre Pasqual, who left in early October, prompting speculation of further defections among the roughly 140 bankers at Lazard Paris.
Ken Jacobs, Lazard's group chairman and chief executive, flew to Paris from the United States in late October to manage the exit of Pigasse, which the firm had denied just one week earlier.
Pigasse oversaw an influx of six managing directors from rival banks in the last two years, while only two internal bankers were promoted, leading some to question his approach to developing talent within the firm.
""Under Pigasse's leadership, it was difficult for junior partners to emerge as he used to centralise the coverage of France's biggest clients and personally handle these relationships,"" former  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) banker Xavier Mayer said.
""Those who were supposed to replace the old guard ended up leaving and were never replaced,"" he told Reuters.
Shortly after Pigasse left, Jacobs broadened the leadership in Paris, appointing senior partners Charles-Henri Filippi and François Kayat to new co-chairmen roles for investment banking in France.
""MOMENT TO SHINE""
Girodolle has no immediate plans to significantly change staff numbers at Lazard, focusing instead on making its office in Paris a more ""inclusive"" workplace and giving everyone ""their moment to shine"".
""We're not currently planning to hire senior people and if we did it would be on a very selective basis,"" he added.
He stressed the change in leadership will not lead to a change in strategy even if the bank faces an increasingly competitive landscape with several U.S. boutique banks looking to hire in Paris.
Lazard has consistently ranked as one of France's top five advisers since 2015, Refinitiv data shows, but its arch rival Rothschild remains the highest fee earner across all French investment banking. 
""Lazard's dominance in France is on the wane as they are under pressure from both bulge-bracket banks and rival M&A boutiques,"" said Mayer, whose grandfather Antoine Bernheim was a star Lazard M&A banker over three decades. 
Although Lazard is advising  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles' (MI:FCHA) majority owner Exor (MI:EXOR) on its merger talks with  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP), sources told Reuters it failed to land a major role representing Louis Vuitton parent company LVMH (PA:LVMH) on its $14.5 billion bid approach for jeweller Tiffany & Co (N:TIF).
Girodolle is taking nothing for granted. 

""You are never the owner of a client. Day after day you need to demonstrate that you deserve to be your client's first choice,"" he said.

The company's UK sales have been hammered by intense competition from supermarket groups and online retailers as well as by rising costs.
Mothercare, which has been hit hard by intense competition from supermarkets and online retailers in its main domestic market, said that it appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) as administrators to its trading unit, Mothercare UK Ltd and to Mothercare Business Service.
""UK high street is facing a near existential problem with intensifying and compounding pressures across numerous fronts​"", the company said.

Rosenblatt raised its price target on  Roku  to $159 from $134, estimating that the third-quarter earnings and guidance are set to outperform expectations. Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) bounced off session lows to trade roughly flat.
Rosenblatt estimates that the company managed to grow its active accounts by 31% during the quarter.
But leading up to the quarterly earnings print, not everyone is convinced that Roku deserves a spot on the list of fashionable investing.
Just last month, Pivotal Research slapped a sell rating on Roku, warning that its valuation was running too hot at a time when competition is heating up.
Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has rolled out its Xfinity Flex streaming box and Facebook (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:FB) launched its Portal TV streaming device.
“We see dramatically more competition emerging that will likely drive the cost of OTT (over the top) devices to zero and put material pressure on advertising revenue,” Pivotal said.
Looking ahead, many expect that the company will find it hard to turn a profit for several years as it funds its international expansion and competes for TV licensing contracts.
Roku is up 356% for the year and has an average price target of $135, according to consensus estimates from Investing.com."

DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - The Saudi government plans to sell 2% of state oil giant Aramco in a domestic listing on Dec. 11, three sources familiar with the matter said, but restrictions on future share sales mean an international IPO is ruled out for at least a year.
Final pricing for the IPO (initial public offering) is scheduled for Dec. 5 and the world's most profitable company is expected to start trading on the Riyadh bourse six days later, the sources said.
The Saudi government will face a one-year restriction on selling more Aramco shares following the domestic listing, according to the sources, meaning any overseas IPO is unlikely to be held in 2020.
Saudi Aramco declined to comment while the Saudi government's media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Aramco fired the starting gun on the domestic IPO on Sunday after a series of false starts. However it did not give details on how much of the company would be sold, or when the listing would happen, while expert valuations of the company vary wildly from around $1.2 to $2.3 trillion.
Sunday's announcement had said Aramco and the selling shareholder would be subject to restrictions on the sale, disposition or issuance of additional shares, but did not provide the lock-up period.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is seeking to raise billions of dollars to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil by investing in non-energy industries. 
Initial hopes for a 5% initial public offering (IPO) on domestic and international bourses were dashed last year when the process was halted amid debate over where to list Aramco overseas.
Aramco said the IPO timetable was delayed because it began a process to acquire a 70% stake in petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp. 
ON THE ROAD 
Aramco roadshows for the Riyadh IPO will begin on Nov. 18, according to the sources. 
Bankers have told the Saudi government that investors will likely value the company at around $1.5 trillion, below the $2 trillion valuation touted by Prince Mohammed when he first floated the idea of an IPO nearly four years ago.
Sources had told Reuters earlier the oil company could offer 1%-2% of its shares on the local bourse, raising as much as $20 billion to $40 billion. 
A deal over $25 billion would top the record-breaking one of Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) in 2014.
A $2 trillion valuation would be almost twice that of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), currently the world's most valuable listed company and seven times that of  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), the biggest listed oil major by market cap. 
The Saudi government is looking to list 2% of the company on the Saudi bourse though, rather than listing the entire share capital on the exchange, the sources said.
Normally public companies list the entire share capital on the exchange and have a portion of that as free float. 
""Aramco would become the largest company by market cap in the MSCI EM index following listing but would account for only 0.5-0.6% of the index given an expected low index weighting,"" Bernstein analysts said in a note on Tuesday.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler and  Peugeot  owner PSA's pledge not to close factories if they merge is likely to come under heavy strain as the combined group would have spare production capacity of almost six million vehicles in a slowing autos market. 
The companies last week unveiled plans to create a $50 billion group that would leapfrog Hyundai, General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford and Honda to become the world's No.4 automaker, based on their combined 8.7 million vehicles sold last year.
The new car and truck making giant would have potential manufacturing capacity of 14 million vehicles, forecasters LMC Automotive told Reuters. But the industry has entered a downturn and the European small car market in particular - where both PSA and Fiat Chrysler (FCA) are heavily exposed - is under pressure. 
""The utilization rate would be low at 58%, which would leave the group with almost six million units of spare capacity worldwide,"" LMC Automotive said. ""Europe is likely to bear the brunt of any potential plant closures.""
Labor unions and politicians have already voiced concerns about job losses, and both France-based PSA (PA:PEUP) and Italian-American FCA (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) have ruled out factory closures in an attempt to quell fears.
But a deadline to meet 2021 and 2025 emissions goals in Europe adds pressure on FCA to adopt PSA's more efficient engines, calling into question some of FCA's engine plants in Europe - mainly in Italy, as well as in Poland - in particular.
""The focus will be Europe, where sub-scale product lines, powertrains and future EV (electric vehicle) investments could be combined,"" Bernstein Research analyst Max Warburton, said in a recent note.
A combined PSA-FCA would have a market share of 22% in Europe, September registration data from auto industry association ACEA shows, leapfrogging Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) which, with a market share of 20%, has been the largest carmaker in Europe. 
VULNERABLE
PSA has already helped Opel, bought from General Motors in 2017, to make progress with emissions targets by rolling out the group's small car platform and engines to the Opel factory in Zaragossa, Spain, where it builds the Opel Corsa.
The CMP platform is now used in factories in Poissy, France, Trnava, Slovakia, and Kenitra, Morocco to build Peugeot, Citroen and DS branded vehicles, and could be extended to fit FCA's Lancia, Alfa Romeo and Fiat models to boost economies of scale.
The market for small cars is under pressure because emissions rules are forcing entry level cars to add complex catalytic converters, making them less affordable.
""Under the new CO2 targets these cars will need to get several updates that will be expensive. This will force some players to drop some of these models as the level of investment is very high,"" according to Felipe Munoz, global analyst at JATO Dynamics, a forecasting firm. 
PSA has already axed the Opel Adam and Karl models because it became uneconomical to make these entry level vehicles emissions compliant. Meanwhile, Ford has dropped its Ka model, which shared a platform with FCA's Fiat 500.
Overall, the market share of cars in the so-called A and B small car segments is expected to shrink to 38% in Europe by 2021, down from 40% last year, whereas demand for sports utility vehicles is expected to hold up well, LMC's Sammy Chan said. 
As a result, low volume manufacturing plants in Europe are increasingly vulnerable, such as Fiat's Kragujevac factory in Serbia and PSA's Vauxhall plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton in Britain, LMC said.
In terms of engine plants, PSA has major operations in Tremery and Douvrin in France, and has also retooled the former General Motors Szentgotthard factory in Hungary. FCA's Fiat, Lancia and Alfa Romeo brands currently source their engines from plants in Termoli and Pratola Serra in Italy, as well as the Bielsko-Biala plant in Poland. 
""In terms of engine plants, it is likely that in the long term, one or two FCA plants in Europe would no longer be needed,"" LMC said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - At a time when U.S. utilities face pressure to rely more on renewable energy, a well-known investor in the space said it is equally important to judge companies by their spending on less glamorous areas like power lines and grid reliability.
Kera Van Valen, managing director and portfolio manager at Epoch Investment Partners, said on Tuesday that she finds companies including  Ameren Corp  (NYSE:AEE) and WEC Energy Group Inc appealing because of their infrastructure spending.
Those companies - and their regulators - understand that ""you're going to need to connect more and more to the alternative energy sources and you need that distribution network to be able to do so,"" Van Valen said at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook 2020 Summit in New York.
She said she had avoided holding California utilities, notably the now-bankrupt PG&E Corp, on concerns that state officials were not focused enough on areas like grid reliability. ""We didn't feel the state regulator was as constructive as some of the other states within the U.S.,"" she said.
Van Valen is a portfolio manager for Epoch's equity shareholder yield strategies focused on areas like companies' dividends and buybacks. Epoch managed $33.1 billion for clients as of Sept. 30.
(For other news from the Reuters Global Investment Outlook 2020 Summit, click on https://www.reuters.com/summit/investment20)
Van Valen has been a long-standing holder of leading cigarette maker  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc, with a stake accounting for about 1% of her portfolio. She defended the holding despite scrutiny of smokeless tobacco technologies and public health concerns.
She said Altria and rivals have ""tremendous pricing power."" Even if sales volumes decline, ""the pricing does allow for the company to generate growth and strong cash flows.""
Recent regulatory attention to vaping could ultimately benefit large tobacco companies, she said, given much of the concern stems from products made by smaller companies or illicit use.
""Everybody wants to see this regulation come through. It actually could be quite beneficial to the large tobacco companies,"" she said.
Van Valen said about 5% to 10% of her strategies' investors currently ask for a few holdings to be stripped out because of environmental, social or governance (ESG) issues. Despite her holdings in industries like tobacco, her portfolios still rate highly on some ESG metrics because they include many companies that are tightly overseen.
""The reason we're more comfortable with them is they're following the regulations,"" she said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) Chairman Dave Calhoun said on Tuesday the company's board believed Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg ""has done everything right,"" just days after he came under attack from U.S. lawmakers and repeatedly refused to step down at a hearing on two fatal crashes involving Boeing 737 MAX airliners.
""He has our confidence,"" Calhoun said in a CNBC interview, adding that Muilenburg called him on Saturday, offering to give up much of his compensation for 2019 and could lose equity grants until early 2021. The board had stripped Muilenburg of his chairman title last month. 
""From the vantage point of our board, Dennis has done everything right,"" Calhoun said.
Boeing did not plan to cut the production rate of the 737 MAX or to rebrand it, he said.
Last week, several U.S. lawmakers urged Muilenburg to resign https://www.reuters.com/article/us-boeing-airplane-congress/u-s-lawmakers-will-press-boeing-ceo-on-day-2-of-testimony-idUSKBN1X912Y, pressed him on whether he would refuse compensation and criticized him and Boeing for not being entirely candid. 
Muilenburg repeatedly said last week his focus was on seeing the MAX through to returning to service and told Congress: ""It's not about the money for me.""
In the wake of the criticism by lawmakers, Muilenburg called Calhoun on Saturday to suggest that he not be awarded any bonuses for 2019 or any equity grants ""until the MAX in its entirety is back in the air and flying safely,"" which Calhoun said could be by the end of 2020 or in early 2021. 
In 2018, Muilenburg received $23.4 million in total compensation.
""It was a significant move on his part,"" Calhoun said, adding Muilenburg ""always does the right thing."" 
Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe confirmed the board has endorsed Muilenburg's proposal to significantly reduce his compensation.
The board is not seeking to claw back any of his prior compensation, Calhoun said.
Muilenburg faced intense grilling by U.S. lawmakers over what the company knew about its MCAS stall-prevention system linked to the two deadly crashes, and about delays in turning over internal 2016 messages that described erratic behavior of the software in a simulator. 
""Our job is to fix MCAS,"" Calhoun said.
Calhoun said a decision on compensation for U.S airlines, like Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) and  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), that canceled thousands of flights because of grounded 737 MAX planes was ""way long out from now."" 
The two crashes killed 346 people and prompted the grounding of Boeing's best-selling plane in March. The Federal Aviation Administration is not expected to allow the plane to return to service until December at the earliest.
""Something went drastically wrong, a total of 346 people died, and we have a duty to fix it,"" Representative Peter DeFazio said last week.
The board is getting daily updates on the effort to return the airplane to service, said Calhoun, who has suggested Muilenburg could remain as CEO after the 737 MAX begins flying again, saying: ""Remember, Dennis didn’t create this problem.""

Federal prosecutors aided by the FBI, the Transportation Department's inspector general and several blue-ribbon panels are investigating the 737 MAX’s certification.

LISBON (Reuters) - Amazon's cloud computing customers have to decide themselves how best to protect sensitive information online, a senior executive said on Tuesday, following accusations by U.S. lawmakers that the web giant has not done enough to secure data on its servers.
Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud computing arm of Amazon.com (O:AMZN), has come under fire following a series of high-profile data breaches, including one this year involving the personal information of 106 million people stored on its servers by  Capital One  Financial Corp (N:COF).
Chief Technology Officer Werner Vogels said AWS provided multiple services to help customers identify if their data was being stored appropriately and flag any possible problems, but the decision about which settings to use lay with those clients.
""We feel we have a responsibility in making sure you take the right actions, but in the end it's only you who can decide what is the right action there and what's not,"" he told Reuters on the sidelines of the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon.
""I'm not going to look at your data thinking like 'hey, these are cat videos, maybe you shouldn't do that'."" He added that customers should use tighter security controls for sensitive data such as credit card information.
Cybersecurity researchers say data hosted on AWS servers is often accidentally exposed due to mistakes made by the company's clients configuring their security settings.
The alleged Capital One hacker, for example, was able to access the firm's data due to a wrongly-configured web application firewall, U.S. prosecutors have said.
Analysts at Gartner predict client mistakes will account for 99 percent of ""cloud security failures"" over the next six years.
Vogels said the AWS system warned customers with a ""massive red button"" when they configured online storage containers - known as buckets - to be accessible by anyone online, a setting deliberately chosen for some products and applications.
The company also provides tools which clients can run to analyze the type of data they are storing and spot commonly associated slip-ups, he said.
""If you (change) the configuration on your bucket to world-readable, you will get lots of alarm bells going off,"" he said. ""It's up to the individual customer to decide what's right and what's wrong."""

Known for its on-demand workout programs on exercise bikes which allow riders to join virtually with other participants, the company in September was the latest in a run of startups to receive a subdued reception from stock market investors this year.
Peloton, which posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss, said it expects to report an adjusted loss of between $150 million and $170 million before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for 2020.
""We are within striking distance of profitability,"" Chief Executive John Foley said on a call with analysts on Tuesday.
""I believe if we pulled back on growth we could be profitable tomorrow but that is not what the board and the leadership of Peloton believes we should do.""
Foley said the company is making investments in new products, content and more retail locations, and plans to launch Peloton in Germany this month.
""We think this opportunity globally is so big that we think we're right on the right balance of investing for future growth,"" Foley said.
The company sells exercise equipment and a subscription service for streaming exercise classes. Its flagship product is a stationary bike priced at over $2,200."

421,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 10:11AM ET</span>","How will Apple, Disney, AT&T and Netflix retain streaming subscribers?","By Helen Coster
(Reuters) - When Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's video streaming service made its debut on Friday, it came with $2 billion worth of original programming - a feature widely considered to be the most powerful magnet for new subscribers.
But for Apple TV+ and its rivals, whose monthly subscriptions are cheaper than traditional cable packages, keeping viewers is a huge challenge.
Streaming providers like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Apple TV+, Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+ and AT&T's HBO Max tout flexibility: sign up to watch a new show, cancel when you want.
Besides spending millions of dollars on library content, media companies are using programming, promotions and other strategies to avoid cancellations, or ""churn"" in industry parlance, and retain subscribers who are costly to acquire and easy to lose.
""Churning off of a service once meant finding the phone number of your cable operator, navigating an automated menu and waiting on hold,"" said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners. ""We now live in a world where with a couple of clicks of your finger on your phone, all of the friction from cancellation is gone.""
Disney is the only streaming provider that has used a multi-year promotion to lock in subscribers. In August, the company offered new and existing members of its D23 fan club an annual rate of $47 for a three-year commitment to Disney+ - 33% off the standard price.
Disney has the advantage of making content for children, who watch the same movies and TV shows again and again. Netflix, HBO Max and Apple TV+ have invested in kids' content to keep subscribers from canceling while they wait for the next original, adult-focused show. 
In May Netflix made a rare acquisition, of the children's media brand StoryBots, for an undisclosed sum. In July it announced seven new series targeting preschoolers.
Apple TV+ programming includes two series from Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit that makes ""Sesame Street."" HBO Max is airing new ""Sesame Street"" episodes and most of the show's library.
Streamers are also being strategic about the number and timing of new releases.
""There has to be a cadence to the release slate so there's something you want to watch coming out throughout the year,"" said Fitch analyst Patrice Cucinello.
HBO Max will air one new episode of its original series per week. For most Apple TV+ drama series, including ""The Morning Show"" and ""See,"" Apple will release three episodes at a time, followed by one per week. Disney+ will unveil one episode per week for new series such as ""Loki.""
Hulu for years has been releasing weekly episodes of its original series such as ""The Handmaid's Tale"" and ""Castle Rock."" CBS Corp's CBS All Access, another streaming pioneer, releases most original shows weekly. 
CBS All Access and its sibling Showtime engage in campaigns to win back subscribers who cancel, according to Marc DeBevoise, chief executive of CBS Interactive. The services contact viewers when a show they used to watch is back on the air, and often offer a promotional rate.
Showtime is in active talks with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc, Apple and Roku Inc about creating bundles of two or three services, said a source familiar with the premium cable and satellite TV network. The combined services, with a diverse menu, could replace the cable bundle as a one-stop shop for programming.
HBO Max and Netflix are also investing heavily in broad swaths of content. Netflix paid roughly $15 billion cash for content in 2019, and AT&T (NYSE:T) will spend $4 billion over the next three years building HBO Max.
Losing subscribers could cost more. 

""If I were these companies I would plaster the word 'churn' in everyone's offices,"" said Greenfield. ""Churn will kill.""

Now the bulwark is being dismantled in a rapid rotation out of winning haven trades and into riskier plays.
Thank the prospect of a U.S.-China deal and improving economic data. Bond yields are jumping again, debt-like equities are down, and volatile stocks from small-caps to cyclical companies are back in favor.
It’s all a big change in tone from the wariness that marked most of the S&P 500’s advance this year, during which many investors clung to downside protection. That caution left defensive trades extended, setting the stage for the rally to continue -- especially if America and China finally put pen to paper on a phase-one deal.
“The market’s expectations for a U.S.-China trade agreement are becoming stronger with each passing day, and many investors seem to have come to the conclusion that they have no choice but to take on more risk,” Masanari Takada, a strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc., wrote in a note.
A glance at the various stock characteristics -- or factors -- that drive many quantitative trading strategies shows how extreme the rotation has been.
The value strategy of buying cheap stocks has staged a comeback, beating typically expensive shares with high growth prospects. The former also tends to do better when the yield curve is steepening, in part because that signals a brighter economic outlook favoring the more cyclically oriented value cohort.
The momentum strategy of buying the past year’s winners -- in this case, defensive stocks -- on Monday plunged the most since the factor quake in early September.
Sanford C. Bernstein upgraded the value factor in the U.S. and Europe while remaining bearish on momentum on Tuesday. The strategists cited improving earnings revisions and inflows into global equities among other reasons, though they stressed it was a tactical rather than a longer-term call.
“Although fundamental hedge funds have lowered their momentum exposure, they can still drop it further,” the team led by Inigo Fraser Jenkins wrote in a note. “We have yet to see meaningful rotation to value, so the trade is by no means ‘done’ after the September move.”
Low-volatility shares, which tend to be filled with stodgy sectors less exposed to the economic cycle, have started to underperform after beating the market for years.
Equity gains for much of 2019 had been fueled by stable, large companies, but a new exuberance is starting to spread. In the U.S., small-caps are at last gaining some ground versus the corporate giants which have dominated for so long.
A brighter outlook for international commerce could also rupture America First trades. Emerging-market shares are starting to gain ground versus American equities amid optimism that easing tensions will lift economic growth in trade-sensitive countries such as China.
In a sign of improving sentiment, the yuan on Tuesday strengthened past 7 per dollar for the first time since August -- a fillip for global cyclical trades."

KUWAIT (Reuters) - Regulators should work together in recertifying the grounded Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX airliner instead of pursuing separate approval processes, the head of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Tuesday. 
""For us, it's a big, big, big mistake. Because we have built the safety of this industry on the single certification decision and the mutual recognition and it has worked very well,"" IATA boss Alexandre de Juniac told Reuters in an interview in Kuwait.
Some international regulators have said they plan to conduct they own checks and not simply follow the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) should it recertify the plane.
The U.S. FAA has traditionally taken the lead in certifying Boeing aircraft, but two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia involving the Boeing 737 MAX have sparked criticism of the FAA's oversight and its close links with the U.S. planemaker.
""If you want to restore the confidence ... we need to come back to this single, mutual recognition which has been so efficient,"" de Juniac.
Any changes to the certification process should be made jointly and transparently by regulators, he said.
Otherwise, he said there was a risk that discrepancies could emerge if regulators followed different procedures, making the process more complex, increasing costs, and potentially less safe because of the lack of unanimity.
Boeing’s top-selling jet was grounded in March following the two crashes which killed all 346 people aboard.
Boeing is updating flight control software at the center of both crashes. This must be approved by regulators before the plane can fly commercially again.
The planemaker has said it aims to return the 737 MAX to service by the end of 2019 after making software changes.

The MAX could return to service in Europe during the first quarter of 2020, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said on Monday.

He also wanted to lift profit margins to 7-8% over the medium term. Air France KLM's operating margin came in at 4.8% for the first nine months of 2019, a 1.7 point decline from the same period a year earlier.. 
As part of the five-year plan, the group said it aimed to sharpen the focus of its three main airline brands, after already closing its low-cost carrier Joon earlier this year and further phasing out regional brand Hop. 
Air France will push harder into premium travel, its more profitable segment, with KLM positioned as a competitive network operator of connecting flights through Amsterdam. 
Transavia, meanwhile, will expand in the low-cost market, including with a new base in the French city of Montpellier next spring, despite coming up against hurdles such as the terms of labor agreements that have held back pilot recruitment.
Air France-KLM shares had extended losses by 1218 GMT and were down 6.2%. The stock has risen 11.5% so far this year, partly in anticipation of Smith's mid-term performance plan.
FLEET CHANGES
The group also pledged to drive costs lower by speeding up the renewal of its planes and being more flexible in managing the combined Air France-KLM fleet of more than 500 aircraft. 
""It's a good time to buy long-haul airplanes,"" Smith said, adding the market was down, which would benefit Air France's renewal plans in particular. 
Renewing the airline's fleet would add 300 million euros to its operating profit over the next five years, the group projected, while at KLM it would bring in an extra 130 million euros.
Air France-KLM took a 100 million euro charge last quarter to retire its Airbus A380 superjumbos early and replace them with more fuel-efficient planes.
Smith also overcame Dutch objections earlier this year to push through an integration plan combining management of the Air France and KLM aircraft fleets, which were still being handled separately 15 years after the airlines merged. 
Smith said the group would consider acquisition opportunities, in part as a result of a wave of aviation bankruptcies reshaping the industry, when they made sense. 
Union accords prevented Air France from acquiring Aigle Azur, a smaller domestic rival that went bankrupt in September, after the group withdrew an initial bid.

Smith added that management changes were on the cards at Air France as part of plans to simplify the organization.

The founder of Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. has seen his net worth slide about $6 billion from its peak this year after his strategy of aggressively backing technology pioneers backfired. His fortune tumbled to roughly $13.8 billion as of Tuesday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, after peaking in July at about $20 billion.
Son will give details of the damage on Wednesday when his Japanese conglomerate reports earnings, including likely writedowns for Uber and WeWork. The Vision Fund, its primary investment vehicle for startups, is said to be planning to swallow a charge of at least $5 billion. Some of that stems from the spectacular implosion of WeWork, the once-celebrated co-working company that SoftBank is now bailing out after systemic governance failures tanked its IPO attempt. The U.S. company, which raised money at a $47 billion valuation in January, was said to be valued at less than $8 billion in the rescue package.
“Son has been through a number of ups and downs before, but it seems like these days he’s taking on more and more risk,” said Mitsushige Akino, an executive officer with Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “What’s really spooking investors is that they don’t know if WeWork is just the tip of the iceberg for SoftBank’s trouble.”

Uber and WeWork, once among the brightest stars in the SoftBank constellation, now number among its worst performers. Their shrinking valuations have called into question Son’s investment credibility at a time he’s trying to raise an even larger successor to his original mega fund.
Analysts expect SoftBank to post a net loss of about 300 billion yen in the quarter ($2.8 billion), compared with a profit of more than 500 billion yen a year earlier. Shares of Uber tumbled 34% in the third quarter, while Slack Technologies Inc., another SoftBank investee, dropped 37%. The poor public performance of its marquee investments also raises the question of whether the Vision Fund should reassess the valuations of other growth-focused companies in its portfolio, from ride-hailing giants Didi Chuxing and Grab Holdings Inc. to hotel startup OYO Rooms and food delivery app DoorDash Inc.
SoftBank may book a $3.54 billion drop in the value of its Uber stake, a $750 million decline for Guardant Health Inc., and take a $350 million hit for Slack, according to Chris Lane, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. The combined writedown for WeWork may be as much as $2.82 billion, assuming a slide in the company’s valuation to $15 billion from $24 billion, but remains uncertain. He said his estimates represented a worst-case scenario and may be offset by gains from other unlisted companies.
SoftBank Gives ‘Very Public Lesson’ to Founders in WeWork Ouster
Son has a lot at stake personally. His net worth excludes $8.3 billion worth of SoftBank shares he put up as collateral for personal loans from 19 banks, including  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG and Julius Baer Group Ltd. The billionaire has pledged 38% of his stake in the Japanese firm, according to a June regulatory filing. That’s up from 36% at the start of the year -- and triple the level in June 2013.
The 62-year-old also leveraged his stake in the Vision Fund, the world’s single largest investment pool for startups. And SoftBank’s compensation plan involves a lot of debt. Son loaned himself around $3 billion to invest in the first Vision Fund, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.
While SoftBank’s February announcement of a record 600 billion yen buyback sent its shares to a record in April, the stock has since lost most of the gains and closed at 4,294 yen in Tokyo on Tuesday.
“Son is desperate enough to potentially announce another big buyback to show his confidence in the business and the Vision Fund,” said Amir Anvarzadeh, a market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors Pte in Singapore who recently removed SoftBank from his short-sell list. “If they do, and stock jumps further, we’ll be shorting it again,” he told Bloomberg Television.

430,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 08:19AM ET</span>",Huawei Forecasts Smartphone Growth Despite Trump Blacklisting,"(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. expects smartphone shipments to grow 20% next year even if it’s blocked from the latest Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) software, suggesting the Trump administration efforts to contain the company’s rise may not be working.
The world’s largest smartphone maker after Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. can rely on its massive home market and in-house software to keep the division humming, said Will Zhang, president of corporate strategy. Sourcing the hardware for smartphone manufacturing wasn’t a problem because of the availability of global supply, he told Bloomberg News.
Huawei is approaching a critical juncture in its fight for survival, six months after Washington barred it from buying key U.S. components and software without special licenses. Those include Google’s Android operating system, semiconductor design tools from Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) Inc. and Cadence Design (NASDAQ:CDNS) Systems Inc. and radio frequency chips made by Qorvo and Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS). That threatens to dent Huawei’s smartphone business, which ships more than twice as many devices as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., while impeding its ability to make fifth-generation networking gear.
“There are many ways for our U.S. partners to find global solutions, rather than ship from a single U.S.-based source,” Zhang said at Huawei’s Shenzhen headquarters.
Zhang said in the past Huawei set one target for smartphone shipments, but now because of increased uncertainty in the market it developed three different goals that include best and worst case scenarios. Under a moderate scenario, smartphone shipments could rise around 20% next year, he said. “Even for the pessimistic one, we see small growth,” said Zhang. The best case projection is for 40% growth.
Huawei, which gets roughly half of its revenue from its smartphone division, has so far managed to sustain an enviable pace of growth despite its precarious situation. It gained market share against Apple and Samsung in the third quarter by expanding smartphone shipments 29%. In its home market shipments jumped 66% in the third quarter but only rose about 18% sequentially abroad, according to Canalys. Huawei posted a 24% surge in revenue in the first nine months of 2019, boosted by a 26% jump in smartphone shipments to 185 million units.
Billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei once predicted the Trump administration’s move could knock $30 billion off his company’s revenue. That amount was later trimmed to $10 billion. Zhang revised down the total impact amount again on Tuesday. “Now I think it’s less than $10 billion,” he said. A significant part of that comes from Huawei’s server business, which he said had been expected to generate revenue of $8 billion this year. “But that will be cut in half,” he said, because Huawei was having difficulty making x86-based servers.
Zhang also said 20% to 40% of Huawei’s products were affected by the ban. “Some impact was small, so we could easily find a solution within half a year or three months. But for servers, it impacted our business, our revenue and our strategy for the future as well.”
Longer term, the company is exploring ways to get around a Google blockade. Huawei introduced its Mate 30 series in September, the first marquee phone that runs an open-source version of Android and lacks Google-licensed apps from Gmail to YouTube and Google Play Store.
Huawei is also developing its own operating system, HarmonyOS, which is designed primarily for Internet of Things devices but can also power smartphones. In September, the company offered $1.5 billion to lure global developers to create software for its own ecosystem.

432,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 07:52AM ET</span>",Bullet dodged? Markets bet global recession averted,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares climbed back toward record highs and safe-haven bonds tumbled on Tuesday, as hopes that Washington may roll back some of the tariffs it has imposed on Chinese imports rekindled optimism about the global economic outlook.
A year-end rally looked to be building. Wall Street's main markets were expected to add to their 20% gains and best year since 2013. MSCI's 49-country world index (MIWD00000PUS) was just 1.4% shy its early 2018 peak. 
Europe had galloped to a 21-month high on Monday before retreating on Tuesday. Asia had raced to its highest since May. China's yuan climbed beyond 7 per dollar for the first time since August. 
Hopes of a trade truce between the United States and China this month fueled the optimism, with some more details being filled in on what’s expected to be a ""phase one"" agreement. 
As part of this agreement, China is pushing U.S. President Donald Trump to remove more tariffs imposed in September, according to reports. Beijing and Washington spoke of progress in the talks and U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said licenses for U.S. companies to sell components to China's telecoms giant Huawei will come ""very shortly"".
""The big picture is that everyone is now setting themselves up for the strong rebound case (for the global economy),"" said Peter Garnry, Saxo Bank's head of global equities. ""And with the flood gates open for monetary policy, assets are just flying, especially equities.""
Global readings of the October manufacturing business surveys showed the aggregate ticked up for the third month in a row last month to show an expansion in factory activity.
Forward-looking indicators from the survey, such as the new- orders component, moved into positive territory for the first time since April, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
It all helped ease concern about the recession risks facing the global economy, sparking a selloff across the major bond markets that nervy investors huddled into when worry levels spiked earlier in the year.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose 4 basis points to around 1.83% (US10YT=RR) and the U.S. yield curve -- measuring the gap between two- and 10-year yields -- was at its steepest in three months . 
In Europe, 10-year yields on safe-haven German Bunds also climbed to their highest since July (DE10YT=RR). French yields were close to breaking back into positive territory. 
In price terms, Germany's 10-year bond has now lost just over 4 percent of its value since early September.
""The markets are adjusting to stronger phase in the cycle, I would say,"" said SEB investment management's global head of asset allocation, Hans Peterson. ""I'm just frustrated because I don't have enough equities.""

YUAN RECLAIMS KEY LEVEL
In Asia, the mood was also helped by the People's Bank of China cut in its a medium-term lending rate, the first since early 2016. It was only a token 5 basis points to 3.25%, but it underscored Beijing's ongoing desire to support its economy.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) gained 0.6% to reach levels last seen in early May. It was led by gains in Chinese shares (CSI300), which jumped as much as 1.3% to their highest since late April. 
Taiwanese shares (TWII) gained 0.75% to near three-decade highs and Japan's Nikkei (N225) rose 1.75% to a one-year peak after a market holiday on Monday.
That followed record closing highs for the U.S. S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq and after the Financial Times had reported that the U.S was considering rolling back levies on $112 billion of Chinese imports, which were introduced at a 15% rate on Sept. 1.
China is pushing U.S. President Donald Trump to remove more tariffs as part of a U.S.-China trade deal, expected to be signed later this month, people familiar with the negotiations said on Monday.
""There may have been some expectations that the U.S. may postpone the remaining tariffs, which are due to kick in on Dec. 15. But if it goes further by rolling back existing tariffs, that would not only benefit the economy but would also make the truce seem more permanent,"" said Yukino Yamada, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.
The next focus on the U.S. economic front is a U.S. non-manufacturing survey due later on Tuesday, with economists expecting a rebound in business sentiment from a three-year low.
Saxo Bank's Garnry said a better-than-expected reading could fire markets higher again.

In the currency market, the dollar gained 0.2% on the yen to 108.80 , extending its recovery from the 107.89 touched on Friday.
Trade optimism pushed the Chinese yuan to its highest levels since mid-August, after the onshore yuan posted its strongest close since Aug. 2. .
The euro was little changed at $1.1126 (EUR=), off last week's high of $1.1175. The Australian dollar gained 0.2% to $0.6900  on the trade hopes and after the nation's central bank held interest rates after three cuts this year.
Oil prices gained, staying near their highest since late September, buoyed by an improved outlook for crude demand as better-than-expected U.S. jobs growth added to the hopes for a U.S.-China trade deal.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) traded at $56.95 per barrel, up 0.7% after reaching a six-week high of $57.43 on Monday. International benchmark Brent (LCOc1) gained 1% to $62.74 per barrel.

Rising economic optimism dented gold, which fell 0.5% to $1,503 per ounce .

433,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 07:48AM ET</span>",China presses Trump for more tariff roll-backs in 'phase one' trade deal,"By David Lawder and Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China is pushing U.S. President Donald Trump to remove more tariffs imposed in September as part of a ""phase one"" U.S.-China trade deal, people familiar with the negotiations said on Monday.
The deal, which may be signed this month by Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a yet-to-be determined location, is widely expected to include a U.S. pledge to scrap tariffs scheduled for Dec. 15 on about $156 billion worth of Chinese imports, including cell phones, laptop computers and toys.
A U.S. official said the fate of the Dec. 15 tariffs is being considered as part of negotiations and a potential signing trip this month.
Another source briefed on the talks said Chinese negotiators want Washington to drop 15% tariffs on about $125 billion worth of Chinese goods that went into effect on Sept. 1. They are also seeking relief from earlier 25% tariffs on about $250 billion of imports from machinery and semiconductors to furniture.
A person familiar with China's negotiating position said it is continuing to press Washington to ""remove all tariffs as soon as possible.""
China's request to remove the Sept. 1 duties was earlier reported by Politico, citing sources. The Financial Times newspaper also reported the White House was considering whether to roll back the Sept. 1 tariffs, which cover some clothing items, flat-screen televisions, smart speakers and Bluetooth headphones.
Geng Shuang, a spokesman at the Chinese foreign ministry, said the two sides remained in touch.
""Trade consultations have made progress and are advancing in accordance to plan,"" Geng said.
On the tariff issue, Geng said he could only give an answer ""in principle"".
""Adding tariffs is not the correct way to resolve trade issues,"" he told reporters at a regular briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.Taoran Notes, an influential WeChat account run by China's Economic Daily, said the removal of the additional tariffs already imposed by the United States was China's ""most core concern"".
""Any miscalculation on this issue could well cause further back and forth in the consultations,"" it wrote.
Ralph Winnie, director of the China program at the Eurasia Center, said wrapping up the interim trade pact would provide a boost to both the U.S. and Chinese economies, while handing Trump an important win among farmers - a core constituency.
""It’s in both countries’ interest to have this trade deal,"" Winnie said. ""If he seals the deal, it will be looked on very favorably by the American people. It’s a win-win for both countries.""
Speaking on Tuesday at an import fair aimed at burnishing China's free-trade credentials, President Xi Jinping called on countries to stand against protectionism and reiterated pledges to open China's economy and strengthen protection of intellectual property rights.
Foreign governments and business groups have become skeptical of Chinese reform promises and have longed warned that China would invite retaliation if it didn't match the openness of its trading partners.
COPYRIGHTS, NOT SUBSIDIES
Since Trump took office in 2017, his administration has been pressing China to curb massive subsidies to state-owned firms and end the forced transfer of American technology to Chinese firms as a price of doing business in China.
Analysts say the phase one deal will fail to adequately address these issues, focusing largely on Chinese purchases of U.S. farm goods and intellectual property protections related to copyright and trademark issues. It will not address industrial subsidies at all.
China was requesting some changes to the text, but parts of the agreement are “very close to finished,” including the text on financial services, said a U.S. source briefed on the negotiations. The text on agriculture was “dozens of pages long and nearly completed,” the source said.
“It is important to both sides to get this agreement across the finish line,” said the source, adding that the two presidents were very likely to meet this month.
Charles Boustany, a former congressman from Louisiana and counselor at the National Bureau of Asian Research, said any initial agreement would likely be short-term in nature and unstable.
""Even though there's some talk about a phase one agreement, we don't think it’s going to be substantive in terms of addressing any of the structural problems,"" he said. ""It would largely be a status quo situation where China continues to do what it’s doing.""
Some business groups complain that a central component of the ""phase one"" deal - increased access to China's financial services market - will fall short of its promises, because of inconsistencies in China's new foreign investment law.
In comments submitted to the Chinese government by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Chamber of Commerce in China and the U.S. Information Technology Office, the groups pointed out that Beijing's draft regulations ""do not address clear differences between the treatment of China's state-owned enterprises and the private sector,"" according to a person familiar with the comments.
Trump had said on Friday that negotiations on the initial phase agreement were going well and he hoped to sign the deal with Xi at a U.S. location when work on it was completed."
434,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 07:46AM ET</span>","U.S. boards end era of impunity for 'skirt-chasers,' McDonald's firing shows","By Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Directors of U.S. companies are increasingly showing zero tolerance for executives' sexual relationships with employees, even consensual ones, an attitude shift evident in McDonald's Corp's (N:MCD) dismissal of CEO Steve Easterbrook this week. 
Boards of directors in a different era turned a blind eye to executives' so-called ""skirt-chasing,"" corporate governance experts said. But now boards focus on the risks to the company from relationships between supervisors and employees, a view shaped in part by the fallout from sexual misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein, former CEO of The Weinstein Company, in 2017 that fueled the #MeToo movement.
""Things people denied or swept under the carpet before, they no longer do,"" said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a dean of leadership programs at the Yale School of Management. ""It's being reported more, and boards of directors are acting on the reports."" 
Easterbrook, who reported to McDonald's board, had a recent consensual relationship with an employee of the burger chain, violating company policy. Last year, Brian Krzanich resigned as chief executive of technology company  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) after an investigation found he had a consensual relationship with an employee, breaking company rules.
Companies see relationships between supervisors and their reports as problematic because workers often feel they cannot turn down sexual advances from superiors without negative repercussions, corporate governance experts said.
""It's an imbalance in the power situation,"" said Mark Spund, head of the employment law practice at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP. ""For most companies, it's a violation of their regulations, and most of the time it will lead to a termination of an executive.""
More CEOs are being pushed out of their jobs for ethical lapses ranging from sexual indiscretions to fraud than in the past. Of those forced out of their jobs in 2018, 39% exited for ethical reasons, a greater number than for financial performance or board struggles, according to a study from a division of accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
In 2017, 26% of CEO exits were for ethical lapses, according to the study, while a decade prior it was 8%. 
Earlier examples of corporate bosses leaving under ethical pressure include former  Best Buy  Co Inc (N:BBY) CEO Brian Dunn who resigned in 2012 following allegations of personal misconduct relating to a relationship with a female staffer, and Mark Hurd, who left HP Inc (N:HPQ) in 2010 amid sexual harassment allegations, though an internal probe later cleared him of the charges.
Corporate boards of directors are also more frequently discussing company-wide policies including rules that prohibit fraternization among employees, said Gillian Emmett Moldowan, an attorney at Shearman & Sterling LLP. In the past, boards were less likely to review broad-based policies implemented by human resources, she said. 
Emmett Moldowan added that boards' compensation committees often look at these issues, but because of the reputation risks some pose to the company, the whole board will take them up.
'TOXIC CULTURE'
Some companies' policies will allow relationships between peers in different departments, Sonnenfeld said. But every other worker at the company would be off limits to Easterbrook as McDonald's CEO and the fast food chain's top employee, corporate governance experts said.
One unanswered question is whether Easterbrook's firing and the naming of Chris Kempczinski to replace him will impact low-level workers at the company's restaurants who have claimed they regularly face groping, lewd comments and sexual propositions.
Fight for $15, a group campaigning for higher minimum wages, said that more than 50 sexual harassment complaints have been made against McDonald's. 
""McDonald’s culture is toxic – all the way from top where CEO Steve Easterbrook had an inappropriate relationship with one of his staff, down to the bottom where managers mock, fire, or retaliate against victims of sexual harassment,"" the group said.

""With a new CEO, McDonald’s has an opportunity to change their culture.""

The New York-based fashion house is spending more to expand globally, especially in China where the Coach brand has been holding fashion shows, partnering with celebrities and using local social media to woo high-spending consumers.
The high-end fashion industry has been focusing on China, with companies from New York, Paris and Milan sending their priciest products to the world's second largest economy as consumers increasingly choose to splurge at home rather than on overseas trips.
Global same-store sales at Coach rose 1% in the first quarter, while the company's Kate Spade brand fell 16%.

Japanese bonds, U.S. Treasuries and European securities all slumped as the potential removal of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods revived optimism over the economic outlook. In Europe, where sovereign yields have hit record lows this year on fears of recession, French rates climbed to near positive territory for the first time since July.
For some, the bond declines bear a resemblance to the market “tantrum” of 2015, when German borrowing costs soared after the European Central Bank indicated it wouldn’t cut rates further. This time around, the Federal Reserve has played a similar role, signaling that it is taking a pause, while Australia’s central bank held rates Tuesday and Sweden’s Riksbank is determined to hike by the end of the year.
“It is starting to smell a bit like the sell-off in the spring of 2015, but it is actually easier to put some factors behind it this time,” said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, head of fixed-income research at Danske Bank A/S. “Pricing is no longer for lower rates and momentum has shifted.”
If so, it would mark a major turnaround for bond markets that have been dominated by growing demand for haven securities -- such as U.S. Treasuries and German bunds -- as well as a hunt for yields. That has seen investors dive into riskier assets such as Italian and Greek bonds.
French 10-year yields rose three basis points to -0.01%, the highest since July. Those on similar-dated U.S. Treasuries climbed four basis points to 1.82%, with trading running at around 160% of the recent average. In Japan, 10-year yields rose five basis points to -0.12% as the Bank of Japan cut debt purchases for the first time in more than a month, and in a catch-up move following a public holiday Monday.
Investors also showed signs of struggling to digest a deluge of supply, including $38 billion of U.S. three-year notes, German inflation-linked securities and a euro-denominated bond from China on Tuesday. In corporate debt, more than 20 tranches are hitting the European market, including from Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc and Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LON:LLOY), making it the busiest day of issuance since at least mid-September."
439,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 07:05AM ET</span>","Goldman's Solomon Says Profit Matters After Uber, WeWork Losses","(Bloomberg) --  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., stung by losses in Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. and WeWork, has a message for investors in growth stocks: profit matters.
After years of pursuing revenue growth at all costs, driven by cheap money, markets are increasingly focusing on whether companies can translate top line expansion into profitability, Chief Executive Officer David Solomon said Tuesday in a wide-ranging interview that also touched on Europe’s negative interest rates and his plans for the bank’s investor day in January.
“It’s important for people to grow, but there’s got to be a clear and articulated path to profitability,” Solomon said in a Bloomberg TV interview with Matt Miller in Berlin. “I think there’s a little more market discipline coming into play.”
Goldman Sachs, which relies on investments with its own money as a key profit driver, last quarter suffered the worst performance in more than three years from equity wagers in public and private companies. The slump in prized holdings added to a perception that the investments are subject to unpredictable swings even as the company works to provide more disclosure.
The bank took a $267 million hit on public equity investments such as ride-hailing company  Uber Technologies Inc ., Avantor Inc. and Tradeweb Markets Inc. Its stake in WeWork declined by $80 million after plans for an initial public offering collapsed.
Solomon stopped short of comparing the recent troubles in the market for IPOs to the dotcom crisis, though they underscore how, after years of ultra-loose monetary policy, markets are demanding proof that companies can make money.
“The monetary policy that has been ramping around the world has basically forced people out on the risk curve, has forced people to look for other ways to drive returns and one of the things they’ve been chasing is growth and to some degree growth at all costs,” Solomon said in the interview. “The market here is speaking and telling people here, let’s rein that in a little a bit.”
The CEO also waded into the debate about negative interest rates, suggesting history will take a dim view of that monetary policy experiment. The European Central Bank has imposed negative rates on banks for half a decade now. Some of Europe’s most senior bankers have blasted the policy, with  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing saying it ruins the financial system in the long run.
Europe’s Experiment
While central bankers argue they support the economy, the burden on commercial banks is mounting and the industry is warning about detrimental long-term side effects. Solomon, who took over at the helm of Goldman Sachs a little more than a year ago, also questioned their economic benefit.
“When we look back on negative rates, I think when the book’s written, it’s not going to look like a great experiment,” he said. “Growth in this part of the world has been lagging and negative rates have not allowed an acceleration of that growth in my opinion.”

The losses on the equity investments last quarter add to headwinds for Solomon, 57. Shares of Goldman Sachs, which celebrates its 150th anniversary this year, have trailed peers as investors await the fallout from a global corruption scandal involving Malaysia’s investment fund 1MDB. The CEO has also struggled to revive the trading unit, and pleaded for patience with a fledgling consumer business started by his predecessor.
Solomon is tightening the bank’s partnership ranks and installing new leaders across divisions. He has promised to lay out a vision for the firm’s future at the firm’s inaugural investor day in January that could serve as a catalyst for its stock, though he cautioned on Tuesday that shareholders shouldn’t expect a shift in strategy.
“We’ve got very, very good businesses that we’re very proud of and we’d like to evolve those businesses a little bit,” Solomon said. “I wouldn’t expect any big reveal.”"

Exynos mobile processor chips are considered a hallmark of the South Korean firm's attempts to reduce its reliance on memory chips and increase sales of logic chips that are used to power mobile devices and autonomous vehicles.
But the proprietary chips, which are found in Samsung's flagship Galaxy series smartphones and compete against Qualcomm Inc's (O:QCOM) marquee mobile processors, have struggled to find external customers.
The decision to shut down the division, which will make some 300 jobs redundant, point to challenges Samsung faces in promoting Exynos chips, analysts said.
""(Exynos) chips are not really used anywhere else and continue to lose ground in the mobile processor market, raising concerns about the company's competitiveness,"" said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities.
The move has led to speculation that Samsung will use core designs from ARM or semi-custom designs. Park added that Samsung is not likely to give up the Exynos business entirely. 
Samsung said it will continue to develop and produce Exynos chips regardless of the termination of CPU (central processing unit) core projects, and some of 300 affected employees could be relocated to different projects.
""Based upon a thorough assessment of our System LSI business and the need to stay competitive in the global market, Samsung has decided to transition part of our U.S.-based R&D teams,"" it said in a statement, referring to its logic chip business.
Affected employees will mostly come from its Austin R&D Center, which had been researching CPU core since 2010, while a small number of employees at its CPU project team at Advanced Computing Lab in San Jose will be let go or relocated to other divisions, a company spokeswoman said.
""Core research brought less value than expected to Samsung's entire logic chip business,"" said source with direct knowledge of the matter who was not authorised to speak to media on the matter and declined to be identified. 

The termination of its CPU core projects comes after Samsung, the world's largest memory chipmaker, said in April that it plans to invest $116 billion in logic chips through 2030.

448,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 05:17AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Siemens Gamesa Hit by Wind of Change in Power Markets,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- You’d think if anyone was going to do well out of “headwinds” it would be a maker of wind turbines but, alas, no.
Siemens   Gamesa   (MC:SGREN), the world’s biggest maker of offshore wind turbines, fell as much as 12% on Tuesday after warning that its margins are likely to be squeezed increasingly hard next year, as countries move away from generous subsidies for greening their electricity systems and towards more market-driven mechanisms.
The company announced a further 600 job cuts on top of the 600 it had announced in September when closing some legacy operations in Denmark.
“The adverse factors affecting the wind industry will persist in the short term, despite solid future prospects,” the Spanish-based company said. That will “lengthen the pathway to normalized margins,” it added in a notable piece of management-speak.
The shares subsequently pared losses but were still down 8.0% by 5:15 AM ET (1015 GMT) at their lowest in nearly a month, dragging the shares of Danish rival   Vestas Wind   Systems (CSE:VWS) down by over 3% into the bargain.
Profit margins before interest and tax fell to 7.1% in the year through September, at the bottom end of a range between 7% and 8.5%, while revenue also crept in at the lower end of the expected 10-11 billion euro range at 10.23 billion ($11.4 billion). It said revenue growth would be minimal in the next 12 months while the EBIT margin may shrink to as little as 5.5%. That’s partly because it expects a bigger share of its business to come from more competitive, mature onshore markets.
Despite all that, the company said its long-term outlook was as solid as ever, given the global consensus on migrating to renewables. Its order backlog rose 12% on the year to a record 25.5 billion euros. Moreover, it expects to benefit from global consolidation, with the turbine market shaking down to four major players in onshore and only three in offshore, which should stabilize margins before too long.
Even in the U.S., where federal government hostility to renewables has been offset by generous state subsidies and increasing investment from private sector players such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) seeking to reduce their carbon footprint, sales and orders both rose by over 20% year-on-year.
Siemens Gamesa was something of an outlier on Tuesday, when most European markets trended higher on the back of rising hopes that the U.S. and China would agree to a mutual roll-back of some import tariffs as part of their ‘phase-1’ deal. The Stoxx 600 rose 0.1% to 403.74, while Germany’s DAX was up 0.2% and the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.4%."
449,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 05:16AM ET</span>","Floundering tech bets put spotlight on SoftBank results, Son","By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp and its founder Masayoshi Son face a day of reckoning on Wednesday when the investment juggernaut is likely to post weak quarterly results, hit by hefty falls in the valuation of some of its biggest tech bets.
SoftBank has come under renewed investor scrutiny after it was forced to bail out one of its best known portfolio companies - the cash-burning, office-sharing firm WeWork - for $10 billion.
That has deepened concern about Son's strategy of pouring billions of dollars into unproven, money-losing startups at a time it is getting squeezed by a sell-off in most of its listed bets.
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc posted on Monday a wide quarterly loss, sending its shares sliding in after-hours trading. SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund has a $7.7 billion investment in the U.S. ride-hailing firm.
SoftBank's quarterly results come at a crucial time for Son, when he is trying to raise capital for a successor to the Saudi Arabia-backed Vision Fund. 
SoftBank is expected to post an operating loss of 48 billion yen ($442 million) for the July-September quarter on Wednesday, according to the average forecast of four analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
That would be its first quarterly loss in 14 years, Refinitiv data shows, and compares with an operating profit of 706 billion yen a year earlier. 
SoftBank has delivered multiple quarters of sector-beating gains driven by internal revaluations of tech bets by the Vision Fund, which had its first major close in May 2017. 
Analysts estimates vary widely, in part because SoftBank provides little detail on how it accounts for those gains or losses on its books. 
A further lack of disclosure over valuations on Wednesday would ""risk losing the trust of investors,"" said Amir Anvarzadeh, market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors.
Given its falling share price - down around 30% since July - the conglomerate may unveil a share buyback of around 500 billion yen to try and stem the slide, Anvarzadeh said. SoftBank announced a 600 billion yen buyback in February. 
UNUSUAL STEP 
Investors will be looking closely at how SoftBank accounts for the value of its stake in WeWork, into which it has poured $13 billion to take a majority stake. WeWork was valued by SoftBank as high as $47 billion as recently as January, but is currently valued at just $8 billion.
The Japanese company is expected to announce on Wednesday a writedown of at least $5 billion due to a slump in values of WeWork and some other top holdings, Bloomberg reported late last month. 
SoftBank has taken the unusual step of structuring the bailout to avoid having to consolidate WeWork on its books, despite taking an 80% stake, reducing its disclosure requirements as it tries to avoid liability for the startup's onerous lease obligations.
Dan Baker, analyst at Morningstar, said he is marking the value of WeWork at zero until SoftBank's restructuring has demonstrated a clear path to profitability.
SoftBank said last week it will post a $2.6 billion gain on the value of its stake in Son's most acclaimed tech bet,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding.
With the Vision Fund facing headwinds, sellside analysts are emphasizing the value of other parts of SoftBank's portfolio, including telcos SoftBank Corp, which on Tuesday reported a 9% rise in second quarter profit, and Sprint.
Sprint has been struggling to close its $26 billion merger with T-Mobile due to legal hurdles, in a deal which if successful will remove the telco's debt from SoftBank's highly leveraged balance sheet.
SoftBank also owns chip designer Arm, for which Son paid a large premium in a $32 billion deal in 2016, banking the company, which is dominant in the mobile sector, could repeat its success in nascent sectors where it lacks critical mass. 

Arm, which under SoftBank ownership has become money losing, plans to return to the public markets by 2023.

TOKYO (Reuters) - WeWork's Japan unit can become profitable ""in the near future"", the Japanese partner of the U.S. office-space sharing startup said on Tuesday, amid investor scepticism over its path to profitability.
WeWork Japan, a joint venture between the U.S. startup, telco SoftBank Corp (T:9434) and its parent SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), is growing well with high occupancy rates, SoftBank Corp's CEO Ken Miyauchi said.
SoftBank was forced to rescue WeWork last month following a flopped IPO attempt. That makes the Japanese investment group WeWork's biggest shareholder as it leads a restructuring at the money-losing startup.
By contrast WeWork Japan, which has 23 locations in 6 cities, needs to expand as it currently has only 240 staff, Miyauchi told an earnings news conference, adding that locations are being filled as soon as they are announced.
The remarks came after the telco reported a 9% rise in second-quarter operating profit, beating estimates, buoyed by its cash-cow mobile business.
SoftBank Corp's results are closely watched by investors not only as it is Japan's third largest telco and has committed to pay out 85% of its profits as dividends, but as an indicator of the health of parent SoftBank Group Corp, which has a 67% stake.
SoftBank Group, which reports its earnings on Wednesday, is trying to raise funds for a second technology fund but is widely expected to report large writedowns on some of the big tech bets it and its $100 billion Vision Fund have made.
SoftBank Corp's results follow those of rivals NTT Docomo (T:9437) and KDDI Corp (T:9433), which last week reported that profits fell 13% and rose 9%, respectively.
Price pressure on Japan's big three telcos has been relieved by delays in the roll-out by  Rakuten Inc  (T:4755) of its own mobile network, which has been hit by base station construction delays, with the company yet to announce a concrete commercial service launch date. Rakuten reports its earnings on Thursday.
As e-commerce firm Rakuten expands into mobile, SoftBank is pushing further into retail, cementing its grip over Z Holdings Corp (T:4689), formerly Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Japan, which in turn has agreed to acquire fashion e-tailer Zozo Inc (T:3092).
Zozo will begin selling its wares on the new PayPay Mall, a major advance into online retailing by SoftBank, which also operates QR code payments app PayPay - one of a huge number of such services jostling for consumer attention as Japan belatedly shifts to cashless payments.
In support of that push, SoftBank's baseball team, SoftBank Hawks - which last month topped its league for the third straight season - will change the name of its stadium in Fukuoka to PayPay Dome from Yahuoku Dome."

(Reuters) - European shares fell slightly on Tuesday, a day after hitting their highest levels since 2015, with a sales warning from Danish jewelry maker  Pandora  and a glum forecast from wind energy company Siemens  Gamesa  weighing on the benchmark index.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) fell 0.03%, although declines were capped by hopes that a U.S.-China trade deal could be signed this month.
Healthcare (SXDP), utilities (SX6P) and real estate (SX86P) stocks, commonly considered defensives, recorded some of the biggest losses in early trading.

""But investors still want to see something concrete out of these discussions, even after the positive developments so far.""
The telecoms index (SXKP) fell 0.5%, the most among the major European sub-sectors, dragged down by a 1.6% fall in shares of Spanish telecoms group  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) after it posted quarterly profit below analysts' forecast.
A strong start to the European earnings season and hopes of a resolution in the economically damaging trade war have helped European shares log a strong start to the month, with the STOXX 600 now inching closer to a record high hit in April 2015.
More than half of European companies have already reported results, with most of them beating significantly lowered analysts' estimates.
But on Tuesday, Pandora (CO:PNDORA) fell 12% and was on track for its worst day in more than a year as it warned of a steeper-than-expected fall in sales this year. The stock pulled the wider country index (OMXC20) down 0.7%.
German-Spanish company Siemens Gamesa (MC:SGREN) tumbled 10.3% to its lowest level since January after lowering its forecast for 2020.
In a bright spot, the chemicals sector (SX4P) rose 0.5% after strong earnings reports by Dutch specialty chemicals company DSM (AS:DSMN) and German chemicals group Evonik Industries (DE:EVKn).

The transformation at the Smithfield, Virginia, plant shows how the global meat industry is adapting to profit from African swine fever, a fatal pig disease that has killed millions of hogs in China and turned the world's top pork consumer into a major meat importer.
Bought by China's WH Group Ltd (HK:0288) six years ago for $4.7 billion, Smithfield Foods has retooled U.S. processing operations to direct meat to China, which produced half the world's pork before swine fever decimated the industry.
The world's biggest pork processor operates a white, box-shaped meat plant in Smithfield, Virginia, home to 8,000 as well as the company's headquarters and a wider tourist economy built on its famous hams, bacon and sausages.
Since late spring, pigs trucked to the plant have been slaughtered and sliced into thirds for shipment to China, where Chinese workers process the carcasses further, company employees and industry sources told Reuters. 
""They got an order to fill: China,"" said one plant worker, who asked to remain anonymous.
Smithfield Foods declined to comment on the change or allow a reporter to visit the Virginia plant, which slaughters about 10,000 pigs a day. 
The company previously said it was upgrading the facility, without giving details, and that U.S. business was a priority. Other Smithfield Foods plants in the United States have continued to slaughter pigs for the home market, industry sources said.
WH Group, known as Shuanghui International Holdings when it bought Smithfield Foods, did not respond to a request for comment.
However, Arnold Silver, Smithfield's director of raw materials procurement, said at a recent industry conference that sales to China could eventually create bacon and ham shortages for American consumers. 
    The outbreak of African swine fever has killed up to half of China's hog herd since August 2018 and pushed prices so high that Chinese importers are willing to pay hefty tariffs that Beijing imposed on U.S. pork as part of the countries' bruising trade war.
U.S. pork producers say China's losses from the disease have created a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for sales.
After shifting operations, Smithfield Foods can process pigs more quickly in Virginia because employees are doing less work on each carcass, according to the plant worker. The job is still difficult, though.
""They freeze it up. It's heavy,"" said the employee, who was wearing a brace to support his back and a sweatshirt to keep warm. 
PIGS WILL FLY
The United States exported 294.5 million kilograms of pork to China between January and August, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, more than in the whole of 2018.
Frozen carcasses accounted for about 20% of exports by weight from January to August, up from 0.3% during the same period in 2017, the data show.
Smithfield Foods was the top shipper this summer, sending at least 17.6 million kilograms of pork to China between June and September, according to Panjiva, a division of S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Market Intelligence. Kansas-based  Seaboard Corp  (A:SEB) sold at least 5.3 million, Panjiva said. The firm noted its data does not capture all shipments.
Seaboard did not respond to a request for comment.
""Down the road, if this continues and we ship a lot of product to China, certainly I think we could see shortages, particularly on hams and bellies,"" Smithfield's Silver told the conference.
Smithfield Foods renovated its Virginia plant to supply carcasses to China, according to a person with direct knowledge of operations who asked not to speak publicly about the changes.
""There were departments that were completely eliminated or erased or remodeled,"" the person said.
 Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) and JBS USA [JBS.UL] are also maneuvering to increase sales by stopping the use of the growth drug ractopamine, which is banned by China. 
THE WHOLE HOG
China is importing U.S. hog carcasses because it needs the entire animal, rather than specific parts, market analysts said. China has excess capacity in its processing industry due to the disease outbreak and can cut up U.S. carcasses to meet domestic tastes more cheaply than buying already-butchered pork, they said.
China's tariffs on frozen carcasses are also 62%, compared with 72% for muscle cuts, said Erin Borror, economist for the U.S. Meat Export Federation, an industry group.
""They need to be able to run their plants and keep workers employed to the extent possible,"" she said. 
Smithfield Foods said it is subject to the same Chinese trade tariffs as other U.S. pork producers, despite being owned by a China-based company.
The United States did not export any hog carcasses to China between January and May of this year but shipped 6 million kilograms in June, 28 million kilograms in July and 26 million kilograms in August, U.S. Census Bureau data show. 
The start of shipments coincides with the conversion of Smithfield Foods' Virginia operations, traders said.
Increased exports of hog carcasses are so new that the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it plans to clarify its reporting requirements for shippers to make sure sales are being counted accurately. Some meat traders said weekly recorded sales have looked low.
Bob Brown, a longtime U.S. livestock market analyst, said tracking carcass sales to China should not be difficult because most are being done by Smithfield Foods from its Virginia facility.
""This is one plant, one company, one place,"" Brown said.
NERVOUS WORKERS
Smithfield Foods' latest turn toward China is an unusual shift for America's so-called ham capital, which boasts a museum featuring the world's oldest ham and streets dotted with brightly colored pig sculptures. 
Mayor T. Carter Williams (NYSE:WMB) said he heard from company workers that the plant is shipping more pork to China.
""It doesn't bother us at all,"" Williams said. ""The meat's in the store. All the local supply is still here.""
Smithfield Foods workers are worried, though. Many were shuffled to different jobs in the slaughterhouse due to the overhaul, according to employees.
""They say they're doing everything short now and cutting out a lot of jobs,"" said James Moton, who cuts hair at Hamtown Barber & Styling in downtown Smithfield.

A former sanitation worker at the slaughterhouse, Moton learned of the operations changes from customers who still work at the facility. ""They're hoping they still have a job.""

Associated British Foods (LON:ABF), the owner of Primark, said net profit fell 5% on the year to 1.28 billion pounds mainly due to a 79 million pound charge on the closure of some of its businesses.

That clouded a slightly better-than-expected results at the underlying level for its full fiscal year through September, thanks to a strong performance from the fashion chain and translation gains on foreign currency earnings.

Adjusted earnings per share rose 2% to 1.41 billion pounds ($1.82 billion), while net cash flow came in at 936 million pounds, compared to guidance of 900 million three months ago.
 “Next year the group is well-positioned for further progress, with the continued expansion of Primark, a material improvement in our Sugar profit and strong profit growth in Grocery,” CEO George Weston said in a statement.

Tobacco giant Imperial Brands' (LON:IMB) profit for the full fiscal year fell short even of the reduced expectations it announced in September.
Adjusted per share earnings fell 1.6%, due in part to the cost of terminating supply contracts for next generation products (NGP) that have come under increasing regulatory scrutiny in the U.S.
Revenue grew 2.2% in the year through September, as previously guided.
The NGP problems also weighed on the outlook for the next 12 months: Imperial has lowered its outlook after cutting its investment in the area, and doesn’t expect to see much benefit from its investment until the second half of fiscal 2020. Overall, it expects “low single-digit revenue and earnings per share growth,” although it reassured that its traditional tobacco business will deliver “modest revenue growth, high margins and strong cash flows.” 

Imperial also said Thérèse Esperdy, currently senior independent director, will succeed Mark Williamson as Chairman from Jan. 1.


Heavy equipment supplier  Weir Group  (LON:WEIR) cut its outlook for 2019 after taking a 20 million pound restructuring charge in an oil and gas division struggling with cutbacks in expenditures by drillers in the U.S. shale patch. Orders for its O&G division fell 32% on the year.
The company said it had started a 30 million-pound cost cutting program at the oil and gas division, where it expects profits to fall further in the fourth quarter.
Weir’s mining division performed more strongly, most notably with a 100 million pound order for an iron ore project in Australia.
Like-for-like orders were unchanged on the year in Q3, while orders from continuing operations were up 4%. The group said its guidance for the non-O&G operations was unchanged.

  National Grid   PLC (LON:NG) said its head of U.S. operations Dean Seavers is to leave 'for personal reasons.' He'll stay on until Dec. 31 to help arrange an orderly transition, while the company searches for a replacement. It will consider both internal and external candidates.

Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ) said passenger traffic rose 21.3% on the year in October while the load factor rose to 95.3% from 94.0% a year earlier. On a rolling 12-month basis, passenger numbers were up 16.3%.

Trainline (LON:TRNT) raised its guidance for the 2020 fiscal year after reporting a 29% rise in revenue in the six months through September to 129 million pounds. It now expects revenue to grow just above 20% this year.
Operating losses were 8 million pounds, while the net loss was 89 million, due largely to the costs of its IPO earlier in the year.
Operating free cash flow was 60 million, while adjusted EBITDA doubled to 42 million.

458,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 01:16AM ET</span>","Japan's aging, labor-starved construction industry gives economy a capex boost","By Daniel Leussink and Izumi Nakagawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - As Japan's construction firms are squeezed by the tightest labor market since the 1970s and a rapidly ageing population, they are pouring investment into technology - and providing unexpected support to an economy reeling from the bitter U.S.-China trade war.
The industry sees artificial intelligence and robots - which can that scurry around building sites day and night, preparing equipment and moving materials for the next day's construction - as a way to future-proof and close the labor gap.
But a side effect is that one of Japan's least-productive sectors is bolstering capital expenditure even as the world's third-largest economy flirts with recession amid a global growth slowdown.
Construction company Shimizu Corp (T:1803), which spent about 3 billion yen ($27.7 million) for robots over three years, is a case in point.
Equipped with state-of-the-art AI, cameras and sensors, the machines handle everything from transporting building materials and welding steel to installing ceilings.
For now, Shimizu estimates the labor savings from the robots in its construction work to be 1.1%, far off the land ministry's goal of a 20% productivity boost for the sector by the middle of next decade.
But the company hopes to eventually automate three-fourths of its work as it expands the range of tasks robots perform, said Masahiro Indo, general manager of its construction technology division.
""When it's hot, workers need to take breaks and drink water. Robots don't need that as they don't get tired, so that's good,"" he said. ""Once the robots become smarter, we are looking to increase the range of work.""
MORE PROJECTS
Construction work has blossomed in Japan under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ""Abenomics"" stimulus and an infrastructure boom ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.
The government is also spending heavily on disaster relief as the country recovers from a slew of typhoons and flooding.
Capital expenditure in the sector rose 7.7% in the April-June quarter - far above the 1.9% gain for all industries - after a 15.3% jump in the previous quarter, government data showed.
That has moderated the pain of a 6.9% fall in manufacturers' spending.
Construction firms plan to boost research and development spending by 15.5% in the fiscal year ending in March 2020, faster than the previous year's 13.8% gain and 7.7% rise in the year before that.
It was the highest among all sectors, which overall plans to increase such spending by just 3.3%, the Bank of Japan's quarterly ""tankan"" survey for September showed.
(Click here for an interactive graphic of the growth of the construction sectors' R&D spending: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/JAPAN-ECONOMY-ROBOTS/0H001QXGP982/index.html)
Year-on-year, total capital expenditure in Japan rose for the 10th straight quarter in the April-June period, helping gross domestic product (GDP) expand an annualized 1.3%.
""Construction projects need a long time to complete. That means once investment starts, the impact lasts for a long time,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""While the short-term boost could be small, construction investment tends to offer long-term support to the economy.""
AGEING WORKERS
The pain of a small labor pool is made worse by an ageing population. Japanese aged 60 or older now make up about a fourth of the construction industry's skilled workers, while those under 30 are just over a tenth of the total, down from about a fifth in the late 1990s.
That means all companies are fighting for workers as the jobless rate hovers at more than two-decade low of 2.2% and the number of job openings for every applicant is near its highest point in 45 years. (Click here for an interactive graphic of skilled construction sector workers grouped by age: https://tmsnrt.rs/36rHubs)
There were 5.1 million construction workers in Japan as of end-August, a 27% decline from 20 years ago.
Battling such headwinds while enhancing productivity are crucial, particularly for huge infrastructure projects such as overhauling the area around one of the busiest train stations in Tokyo.
The renovation of the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line's station in shopping hub Shibuya, handled by  Tokyu Construction  Co (T:1720) and other firms is complex and includes moving an entire train platform.
In the past, that involved stopping train operations on weekends and intense training for workers on the project.
Now, a three-dimensional simulation of the process is shared among the workers, allowing them to identify potential problems with construction in advance.
The computer model reduced personnel expenses for that part of the project by about 60%, said Fumihiro Ojima, group leader of the ICT project group in the company's civil engineering division.
""We could do things in the simulation model that are impossible in reality, such as removing a building and looking at it"" from another angle, he said.
But such changes also bring challenges, such as requiring older workers to adjust to new technology.
""Workers will need to improve their skills,"" said Kentaro Arita, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute. ""But that's a high hurdle, and a full-fledged shift could be stalled if that can't be done."""

U.S. authorities say about $4.5 billion was siphoned from sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) in a scandal spanning several countries but Malaysian officials say much more was stolen. 
The United States struck a deal last week to recover about $700 million more from fugitive financier Jho Low, who has played a central role in the scandal. He had previously forfeited a $126 million yacht and $140 million in other assets.
But about 18 billion ringgit ($4.34 billion) in assets remain unidentified and Malaysia was working with at least five countries to recover the amount, Latheefa Koya, the head of Malaysia’s Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), told reporters.
""This what we're working on... to locate, investigate and research where these properties are,"" Latheefa said. 
She declined to give further details on the assets sought or the countries involved, citing pending investigations. 
At least six countries, including Singapore and Switzerland, are investigating alleged graft and money laundering at 1MDB, founded by former prime minister Najib Razak. 
Najib, who lost a general election last year, has since been charged with 42 criminal offences related to losses at 1MDB and other state entities. 
He has consistently denied wrongdoing and his lawyers say he was misled by high-ranked officials at the fund.
Malaysia estimates that Low stole more than $10 billion from 1MDB, attorney-general Tommy Thomas told the Nikkei Asian Review last month. 
Low, who faces charges in Malaysia and the United States over the scandal, has consistently denied wrongdoing. His whereabouts are unknown.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Airlines struggling to cope with the grounding of the 737 MAX could face a markedly different problem when Boeing Co's (N:BA) best-selling jet is cleared to re-enter service: a switch to concerns about aircraft oversupply, carriers have been warned.
The U.S. planemaker has continued to produce the jet since it was grounded in March after two fatal accidents, and is expected to speed deliveries by 40%, to 70 units a month, when its factory doors reopen, in a bid to clear the backlog.
Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at UK-based Ascend by Cirium, said the combination of any rapid rebound in deliveries, economic worries and an accumulation of market pressures dating back before the crashes could make it hard to absorb the jets.
""Next year is the challenge. When the dam breaks and the MAX starts to flow, there are going to be a lot of aircraft,"" Morris told financiers at a Hong Kong briefing late on Monday.
""There could potentially be as many as 1,000 surplus aircraft next year."" 
The forecast is based on both a rebound in MAX deliveries and a potential glut of second-hand airplanes flooding back onto the market after standing in for the MAX during the grounding.
The crisis has rekindled demand for older and less efficient jets, with airlines using more than 800 planes that are more than 15 years old, compared to conditions four years ago, Morris told the Airline Economics Growth Frontiers conference on Tuesday.
TWO-YEAR LOGJAM
Until now, most concern has focused on whether regulators would permit an orderly return to service by avoiding gaps in approvals by different countries.
But Morris, who has warned a long up-cycle in aviation is nearly over, said there were also risks in opening floodgates too quickly, overwhelming fragile growth in travel demand.
Still, he and other delegates at back-to-back aviation finance gatherings in Hong Kong agreed it would take Boeing 18 months or longer to deliver all the stranded aircraft.
The operation will be one of the industry's biggest ever logistical challenges and any glitches or delays could further brake supply. 
""Getting all those aircraft, that are currently parked, off the ground could take two years,"" John Plueger, chief executive of  Air Lease Corp  (N:AL), told Reuters, adding he did not see fundamental changes as a result of the MAX's return.
""It is not as if all these MAX could be delivered over a one-, two- or three-month period ... so it is not an open floodgate and 350 planes all coming onto the market tomorrow,"" he said on the sidelines of last week's Airfinance Journal Asia Pacific conference.
Boeing aims to return the 737 MAX to service in the United States by the end of 2019, after making software changes in the wake of the crashes, which killed 346 people.
Europe's top regulator said on Monday the airliner is likely to return to service in Europe in the first quarter of 2020.
Analysts say more than 300 MAX aircraft have been produced since March, when commercial flights were banned and deliveries frozen. This could rise to 400 by the time it resumes service.

Boeing is additionally expected to deliver close to 600 jets straight from the production line next year. It has indicated it plans to deliver up to 70 jets a month, equal to a previous record. Of this, analysts say around 20 are expected to be drawn from inventory parked at its factories and the rest newly built.

464,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 08:50PM ET</span>",U.S. House Democrats to continue probe after Boeing testimony,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the head of its aviation subcommittee said on Monday that it will continue its investigation into two fatal 737 MAX crashes after Boeing's testimony prompted new questions.
Representatives Peter DeFazio and Rick Larsen said in a joint letter to fellow lawmakers that Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg's answers at Wednesday's hearing ""were consistent with a culture of concealment and opaqueness and reflected the immense pressure exerted on Boeing employees during the development and production of the 737 MAX."" 
The letter said the victims' loved ones ""deserve a thorough investigation from our Committee about how the regulatory system and the law failed, and that’s exactly what our committee intends to do.""
Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe said Monday the company ""will continue to cooperate with the committee."" The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) declined to comment.
Muilenburg and Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Engineer John Hamilton's testimony prompted ""a litany of new questions for both Boeing and the FAA about the failures that led to the tragic and unnecessary deaths of 346 innocent people.""
The committee released documents about Boeing's decisions during the development of the MAX and a key safety system known as MCAS that led to the two fatal crashes and the plane's grounding in March.
""Our investigation shows that from almost the start, Boeing had a bad design on MCAS with a single point of failure. Then, Boeing couldn’t even meet its own design requirements. MCAS was fundamentally flawed, and according to Boeing’s own analysis, could result in catastrophic consequences in certain cases,"" the letter said.
The letter said the operation of MCAS on the two deadly flights violated Boeing’s own design criteria for MCAS that required that ""MCAS shall not interfere with dive recovery"" and “MCAS shall not have any objectionable interaction with the piloting of the airplane.""
The letter referenced Muilenburg's testimony Wednesday that the plane would have been grounded after the first fatal crash in October 2018 if the company knew then what it knows now.
""Our investigation has already shown that Boeing leadership was aware of many of the problems that engineers are now attempting to fix during the design and development phase of the 737 MAX,"" DeFazio and Larsen said. ""The bottom line is that there are a lot of unanswered questions, and our investigation has a long way to go to get the answers everyone deserves.""

The FAA in recent days has been conducting a software audit of Boeing's planned new safeguards to MCAS and other architecture changes to the MAX. The FAA will not unground the MAX until December at the earliest.

465,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 08:04PM ET</span>",Uber's quarterly loss widens as costs rise; shares fall,"By Tina Bellon and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) -  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) on Monday posted a wider third-quarter loss as the company tries to outspend competitors through discounts and invests heavily in loss-making new business ventures, sending its shares down 5.5% in after-hours trading.
Nevertheless, the company promised it would be profitable by the end of 2021 as quarterly revenues, driven by its global ride-hailing business, beat expectations.
Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi told journalists on a conference call the company as a whole would achieve adjusted EBITDA profitability for the full year of 2021, but declined to provide details on the performance of individual business units by that time. 
The move follows a similar announcement by smaller ride-hailing competitor  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) on Wednesday.
Uber's costs jumped about 33% to $4.92 billion in the latest quarter. Gross bookings, which include ride-hailing, mobility, food delivery and freight payments, rose 29% from a year earlier to $16.47 billion.
Overall, the company's net loss widened to $1.16 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $986 million a year earlier, while net loss on a per-share basis narrowed to 68 cents from $2.21.
""Uber would be EBITDA positive if it wasn't also investing in Uber Eats, the freight operation and autonomous driving capabilities,"" said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell.
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/UBER-RESULTS/0H001QXH2998/eikon.png
Known for its ride-hailing app available in more than 700 cities worldwide, Uber has vastly diversified its business over the past years. 
The company is building out its long-haul trucking and food delivery business Uber Eats, developing self-driving cars, offering banking services to its drivers and even planning commercial passenger drone shuttles by 2023. 
It collected total third-quarter revenues of $3.81 billion, up nearly 30% year over year, beating estimates of $3.69 billion.
But Uber is facing regulatory challenges to its business model and shareholders so far appear unimpressed by the company's push to diversify.
Its shares have lost some 30% since going public in May as investors lose patience with venture capital-fueled startups offering only murky paths to profitability.
They stood at $29.36 in Monday after-hours trading.
Shares are expected to be squeezed further on Wednesday, when a restriction on selling stock lifts. Some analysts expect more than 80% of the company's outstanding shares will become eligible for sale.
With Uber under pressure, investors are keen to see the company expanding market share. 
Uber's monthly active users across rides, bike shares and food delivery rose to 103 million globally in the third quarter, from 82 million a year earlier. But they fell short of analysts' estimates of 105.5 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Monday's results also heightened the differences between Uber and Lyft, which only operates in the United States and Canada. 
Lyft executives on Wednesday, in an apparent dig at Uber's sprawling business ventures, emphasized they remained squarely focused on mobility.
Revenue from Uber's ride-hailing business rose about 19% to $2.90 billion and contributed $631 million to third-quarter earnings. 
Sales from Uber Eats, the company's fastest-growing unit, rose 64%, but nearly 40% of revenues were spent on incentive and referral payments, as Uber tries to gain market share.
""At least over the next couple of quarters we still see a lot of money flowing into (Eats),"" Uber Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai said during a Monday analyst call.
Uber hopes its ride-hailing business will come in handy, allowing the company to undercut competitors' delivery costs by having drivers ferry around pizzas instead of passengers when demand is low.
In doing so, Uber, like other ""gig economy"" businesses, is largely relying on freelance contractors.
A new California law, set to go into effect on Jan. 1, would turn most of the state's roughly 450,000 gig workers into full-time employees and has garnered nationwide attention. 
Uber, Lyft and food delivery company DoorDash have pushed for separate legislation that would increase pay and benefits for drivers yet maintain their status as independent contractors.
Khosrowshahi on Monday said he was hoping U.S. politicians would be willing to work with the industry.

""But if not, we'll continue to aggressively defend our drivers' right to flexibility,"" the CEO said.

466,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 07:11PM ET</span>","U.S. overtakes Germany, France in UK firms' trade sights: HSBC","By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - The United States has pushed past Germany and France as the most common trading partner for British businesses, and looks set to keep this position after Britain leaves the European Union, according to an annual survey by HSBC.
The proportion of British businesses naming Germany or France as one of their top three export destinations has almost halved over the past year, a period of political and economic uncertainty when Brexit was delayed three times.
""Although the future of Brexit remains unclear, we are seeing that businesses are thinking beyond traditional markets in the EU,"" Ian Tandy, head of global trade finance at HSBC UK, said on Tuesday.
Under Prime Minister Boris Johnson's latest Brexit deal - which he hopes to get through parliament if he wins an early election on Dec. 12 - British exporters will almost certainly face greater barriers to sales in Europe than at present.
However, Johnson and other Brexit supporters hope that being outside the EU will make it easier to strike trade deals with the United States and other economies.
In the HSBC figures, 24% of British businesses named the United States as one of their top three trading partners, down from 29% in 2018.
But there was a much sharper fall for Germany and France, dropping by almost half to 16% and 15%, losing their first and joint-second spots respectively.
Overall, the survey of more than 1,000 British-based businesses presents a brighter picture for exports than a number of other recent studies of business sentiment, which have shown Brexit and the U.S.-China trade conflict badly hurting morale.
Some 86% of British businesses surveyed for HSBC in August and September said they were positive about the outlook for trade, up from 74% in 2018.
""This is surprising, and a testament to the resilience of the business community,"" Tandy said.
The European Union as a whole is by far the largest market for British exports of goods and services, accounting for 291 billion pounds ($376 billion) of overseas sales in 2018, according to official data, while the United States was the biggest single country, receiving 121 billion pounds of exports.
Germany, the Netherlands, France and Ireland followed in the official rankings.
In terms of where firms see scope for export growth, the United States remained in the top spot, named by 22% of firms, followed by France, Canada and Germany."

490,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 06:36PM ET</span>",Expect more money market jitters at year end: fund managers,"By Megan Davies and Dan Burns
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors should expect another bout of money market volatility as the banking system's year-end funding crunch approaches and the Federal Reserve has not arrived at a permanent fix for the problem, top bond market players said on Monday.
The Fed was also to slow to respond in the first place to market ructions in September that drove up key interest rates, they said. Cash available to banks for their short-term funding needs all but dried up, and interest rates in U.S. money markets shot up to as high as 10% for some overnight loans, more than four times the Fed's rate.
""I think the pressures will be similar at the end of the year, but the Fed has committed to a pretty big repo facility that they'll deploy faster this time,"" Anne Mathias, global rates and FX strategist at Vanguard, told the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit. ""Part of the problem the first time is that it took them a while to get the facility going.""
""The Fed made a major mistake here. They weren't listening to the market and were too busy doing the blame game,"" said Gregory Peters, managing director and multi-sector and strategy head at PGIM, the asset management arm of insurer Prudential Financial Inc (N:PRU).
Since September, the Fed has been pumping tens of billions of dollars of cash injections a day to stabilize a key funding market known as the repurchase agreement, or repo, market. Last month, it increased the daily offering to at least $120 billion and a senior Fed official on Monday said the Fed would adjust its operations as warranted to ensure smooth conditions.
The Fed has also begun buying $60 billion a month of Treasury bills to help replenish the stock of bank reserves, which had fallen too low this fall and proved insufficient at a time when financial institutions' cash requirements were high.
""You have a confluence of balance sheet reduction, financial regulation, tax bills,"" Mathias said.
Peters said the Fed's actions are providing only limited relief to an entrenched problem.
""The truth is that the structural and regulatory environment isn't helping. Banks are penalized for holding Treasuries,"" Peters said.
""They will throw money at it, but it doesn't solve the underlying issue. Doing this backdoor (quantitative easing) thing helps on the margin, but the fact they were asleep at the switch is more concerning on a looking-forward basis.""
Peters is also concerned that the position of head of market operations at the New York Fed has gone unfilled since becoming vacant following the departure of its long-standing director, Simon Potter.
""The NY Fed is by far the most important institution in the market, and some people who were really well respected have left the building,"" Peters said.

491,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 06:31PM ET</span>",Lasry's Avenue seeking $500 million venture debt fund,"By Megan Davies and Lawrence Delevingne
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Marc Lasry's Avenue Capital Group LLC is raising an about $500 million venture debt fund, which could take advantage of a recent reckoning of what fast-growing startups such as WeWork are actually worth.
Avenue, the $10.4 billion New York-based distressed investment firm, has commitments of $100 million from one investor and aims to raise the remainder by the end of the year or the first quarter of 2020, Lasry said on Monday at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook 2020 Summit in New York.
He used WeWork as an example of a company that could be a potential target for the new venture fund.
In August, WeWork filed for an initial public offering but abandoned the effort in September as investors balked at high valuations. The deal had originally valued the company at $47 billion.
""What WeWork tells you is just stop going to the extremes,"" said Lasry, referring to increasingly high valuations for unprofitable companies. ""Do your work ... it's not that complicated.""
Lasry said that Avenue is also benefiting in its lending from a shift by borrowers to avoid large institutions and governments, and that banks no longer had the edge in such a market.
""There's a fear of governments and a fear of institutions. There's been a paradigm shift. Ten years ago, we had to convince people to do business with us,"" Lasry said. ""Today, people are coming to us. I think people just feel more comfortable dealing with private individuals than government entities.""
Lasry said the trend was seen in Europe, particularly northern Europe, and in Asia in countries including Indonesia, India and Australia.
""It has changed since five years ago, part of the reason is then, everything was growing quite a bit, China was growing, banks were very willing to lend. Today everyone is pulling back, there is more limitation, more disclosure.""

492,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 06:01PM ET</span>","Halkbank says it will seek dismissal of U.S. indictment, judge's recusal","By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A lawyer for Turkey's state-owned Halkbank (IS:HALKB), which has been criminally charged by U.S. prosecutors with helping Iran evade sanctions, said in a letter on Monday that it would seek to dismiss the case and have the judge assigned to it recuse himself.
In a letter to U.S. District Judge Richard Berman in Manhattan, Andrew Hruska, a lawyer for Halkbank, said the bank was not agreeing to appear in court on the charges. He asked that he be allowed to represent the bank for the limited purpose of arguing the dismissal and recusal motions.
A hearing is scheduled in the case on Tuesday, and prosecutors have said they may seek a fine against Halkbank if it refuses to appear.
A spokesman for the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment. Hruska did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan brought the criminal charges against Halkbank on Oct. 16. The bank called the charges an escalation of Washington's sanctions on Ankara over its military incursion in Syria, while Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called them an ""unlawful, ugly"" step.
Hruska said in Monday's letter that the bank's ""incidental contacts with the U.S. are insufficient to establish... jurisdiction"" in the New York federal court.
He also said that Judge Berman must recuse himself because he had ""made statements both in and out of the courtroom that call into question the court's impartiality,"" without giving details.
The judge previously presided over a criminal case against Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab and Halkbank director Mehmet Hakan Atilla. Zarrab had moved for Berman's recusal on the grounds that he made statements critical of the Turkish government while attending a 2014 symposium in Istanbul.
Zarrab pleaded guilty before trial and testified against Atilla, who was convicted and sentenced to 32 months in prison. Atilla returned to Turkey earlier this year after serving his sentence, and has been named general manager of the Istanbul stock exchange.
U.S. prosecutors have said that Zarrab, Atilla, Halkbank and multiple Turkish government officials took part in a scheme between 2012 and 2016 to help Iran spend revenue from oil and gas sales abroad using sham food and gold transactions, in violation of U.S. sanctions.
At the time of Atilla's trial, Erdogan condemned the case as a political attack on his government."
493,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 05:27PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow. 
1. U.S. Services, Trade and Labor Data Due
U.S. trade data due Tuesday will offer clues on President Donald Trump’s efforts to reduce the deficit between the U.S. and its trading partners at a time when trade tensions continue to cool amid reports that phase one of the U.S.-China trade deal is nearing the end game. 
The Commerce Department will release the latest trade balance figures at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
On average, economists expect that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $52.50 billion in September, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
With manufacturing activity on the wane – largely due to the U.S-China trade war – the services sector, which makes about two-thirds of U.S. economic growth, has picked the slack.
The ISM survey on service sector activity is due at 10 AM ET (15:00 GMT). Economists predict ISM nonmanufacturing data for October to show an uptick to a reading of 53.5 from the prior reading of 52.6.
On the heels of the services data, the Labor Department will release its September Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTs).
On average, economists expect that job openings fell to 7.028 million in September from 7.051 million the prior month, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
2. API Crude Inventories in Spotlight 
Oil prices got the week off to a winning start, buoyed by hopes that the U.S. and China are closing in on a partial trade deal that some hope could steady global growth and support oil demand. 
Late Tuesday, domestic crude supply will come into focus as American Petroleum Institute is set to release its weekly petroleum inventory numbers.
The API data often serves as a snapshot of the Energy Department’s petroleum data slated for a day later on Wednesday.
Crude oil futures rose 0.6% to settle at $56.54 a barrel.
3. Peloton Rolls Out Earnings 
Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON), seller of connected exercise machines that are paired with on-demand fitness classes, is scheduled to report fiscal first-quarter earnings on Tuesday before the opening bell.
Ahead of its earnings, Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) has struggled to find its footing. Shares have fallen about 15% since going public at $29 in September as traders have ditched loss-making entities.
The company said it sold 577,000 fitness machines and scooped up 511,000 subscribers to its core streaming offering in fiscal 2019, which costs $40 a month.
Its net loss widened to $245.7 million in the fiscal year ended June, from a net loss of $47.9 million a year earlier, largely driven by a surge in spending on sales and marketing.
But with its ability to generate repeat revenue from subscribers, Peloton has won the backing of many on Wall Street, who believe the company will be able to cash in on efforts to create a new market in connected fitneso.
New York-based Peloton is expected to report a loss of 36 cents a share on revenue of $199.06 million.
Among other notable earnings, Allergan (NYSE:AGN) and Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) both release quarterly earnings before the U.S. stock market opens.
Allergan (NYSE:AGN) is expected to generate earnings of $4.23 a share on revenue of $3.89 billion, while Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) is forecast to report earnings of $1.13 a share on revenue of $3.01 billion."
494,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 05:19PM ET</span>",SAP to return 1.5 billion euros to shareholders in 2020,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German business software group SAP (DE:SAPG) said on Monday it would return an extra 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) to shareholders in 2020, with the enhanced payout made possible by its strong financial and operational performance.
SAP, Europe's most valuable technology firm, said after U.S. market hours that its supervisory board had approved a management proposal for extra payouts either through share repurchases or a special dividend.
The announcement comes ahead of SAP's capital markets day on Nov. 12 in New York at which some investors - including U.S. activist fund Elliott that declared a stake in SAP earlier this year - had hoped for a far larger buyback.
SAP said, however, that the extra capital return to shareholders - which comes on top of its policy of paying out 40% of after-tax profits in dividends - would be made with the company's long-term prospects in mind.
""The Supervisory Board and Executive Board are confident that SAP's strategy of investment in innovation and profitable growth, together with disciplined capital return, will maximize shareholder value for the long term,"" it said in a statement.
The capital markets day will be the first major outing for new co-CEOs Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein. The duo have taken over from long-time boss Bill McDermott, who is leaving to head up ServiceNow (N:NOW)."
495,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 05:11PM ET</span>",Avenue Capital's Lasry leases old planes while Boeing's 737 MAX sits grounded,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's struggle to return its 737 MAX planes to the skies after two fatal crashes has been a boon for Marc Lasry, the billionaire chief executive of Avenue Capital Group, who is buying inexpensive, older aircraft for his leasing business.
Speaking at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook 2020 Summit in New York, Lasry said he is raising $1 billion to buy ""mid- to end-of-life"" planes, including the narrow-body Airbus 320 and wide-body Airbus 330, to lease to airline customers, often for three or five years.
Lasry specializes in distressed and undervalued debt, as well as equity opportunities in the United States, Europe and Asia at Avenue, which invests $10.4 billion of assets. He also co-owns the National Basketball Association's Milwaukee Bucks.
Forbes magazine estimates Lasry's net worth at $1.8 billion.
He said older planes can be more profitable to lease than newer, more fuel-efficient planes because they cost far less to buy, at a time when fuel prices are low.
""There's just more and more people flying,"" Lasry said. ""You can either go out and buy a plane for $100 million that's more fuel-efficient, or buy a plane for $10 million and lease it out. They're paying more in fuel but they didn't spend $100 million.""
It can be lucrative too. ""The fact that we are generating sort of mid-teen type of returns, I think we can raise $2 or $3 billion,"" he said. ""The reason we said a billion is we know we'll raise a billion.""
Boeing has said it hopes to return the 737 MAX to the air this year, after making software changes following two crashes that killed 346 people.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration grounded the 737 MAX in March, as have regulators in other countries.
On Monday, the head of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said the plane was likely to return to European skies in the first quarter of 2020.
Lasry said Boeing's problems have helped his strategy.
""It is a trickle-down, so it has been beneficial to us,"" he said. ""There is a demand for older planes... and people can demand a higher price for that.""
Passengers, moreover, are not flying less just because 737 MAX planes are parked, he said.
""You're either going train, or going by car, or flying,"" he said. ""If you're going from New York to Florida, you're going by plane, especially for business.""

496,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 05:07PM ET</span>","Stocks - Dow, S&P Hit New Highs on China Trade Deal Hopes","
Investing.com – The stock-market party rolled on Monday with the Dow joining the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Nasdaq 100 indexes in hitting record highs.
If there was a downside, it was that most of the gains came soon after the market opened and faded a bit by the close.

The Dow Jones industrials finished up 0.42%, or 115 points, at 27,462 but the blue chips had surged more than 170 points in the first half hour of trading.

The S&P 500 rose 0.37% to a new record close and hit a new intraday high of 3,085.20. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.56% and hit an intraday peak of 8,451.37. The Nasdaq 100 finished up 0.61% after hitting an intraday record of 8.223.33. 

The catalyst was the firm belief that a phase one trade deal between the United States and China is coming. It was backed up by positive comments even from China. So, maybe this time, something will happen.
But there are risks. Politico reported this afternoon China was demanding the Trump Administration remove tariffs scheduled to take effect in December and tariffs imposed in September before it will sign a deal.
 

The market was subject to some profit-taking, particularly among the Dow stocks that suggested many investors (or their algorithms) are taking a show-me attitude toward the pronouncements. Home-building shares were off, including two of the biggest: PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) and DR Horton (NYSE:DHI).
At the same time, the market may be pressured Tuesday after Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) results beat estimates on the bottom line but still showed big losses. While CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told CNBC Monday afternoon he expects the company will be showing positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2021, shares were off more than 5% after hours. 
Energy, industrial and financial stocks were the strongest sectors. Utilities and real estate shares were the laggards, in part because of rising interest rates. Interest rates were higher. The 10-Year Treasury yield was at 1.781% from Friday's 1.728%.
 

More than 270 stocks hit new highs, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Deere (NYSE:DE),   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT), Honeywell (NYSE:HON), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) and AT&T (NYSE:T).

Boeing (NYSE:BA) was nowhere near a new high, but its 1.71% gain to $351.09 did contribute about 40 points to the Dow's gain.

Crude oil finished higher, although gains of 2% or higher faded to under 1%. Gold Futures were flat at $1,511.10 an ounce in New York.
 

  Cimarex Energy   (NYSE:XEC),   Pioneer Natural Resources   (NYSE:PXD),   Devon Energy   (NYSE:DVN) and   Noble Energy   (NYSE:NBL) were among the top S&P 500 performers. 
Under Armour (NYSE:UA), PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM), Motorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI) and DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) were among the weakest S&P 500 performers.

The transaction, the second-largest U.S. bank merger this year by assets, received a positive response from both sets of shareholders: First Horizon and IBERIABANK stock ended 3.2% and 2.8% higher respectively on Monday.
Structured as a merger of equals, albeit with legacy First Horizon shareholders controlling 56% of the new entity, the combined bank - called First Horizon - will have around $75 billion in assets and a presence in 11 southeastern U.S. states.
""We have a complementary market presence throughout the south, and the combined franchise will have a good mix between high-growth and stable markets,"" Bryan Jordan, chief executive of First Horizon, told an analysts' call.
American banks have been under pressure to consolidate as a way to manage the increased costs of regulatory compliance and spending on technology, as well as combat heightened competition in many markets from the largest four lenders in the country.
The recent reversal in interest rate outlook - the U.S. Federal Reserve cut rates for the third time in 2019 last week - also makes it harder for banks to generate profits.
In February, BB&T Corp (N:BBT) and SunTrust Banks Inc (N:STI) said they would combine in the largest U.S. bank merger since the global financial crisis. That is also structured as a merger of equals.
The combined First Horizon/IBERIABANK would have a market capitalization of more than $9 billion, based on current valuations. The current chief executives, Daryl Byrd of IBERIABANK and First Horizon's Jordan, will serve as executive chairman and CEO respectively.
Under the terms of the deal, IBERIABANK stockholders will receive 4.584 First Horizon shares for every share they own. The new bank, following the closing of the deal in the second quarter of 2020, will be headquartered in Memphis.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) was financial adviser to First Horizon, with Sullivan & Cromwell LLP acting as legal counsel. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) provided financial advice and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP were legal advisers to IBERIABANK."

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) has laid off 120 temporary workers at a plant in Texas following its decision to cut production in the wake of a fall in sales due to U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war with China.
The layoffs, which took place at the hydraulic excavator facility in Victoria on Nov. 1, were confirmed to Reuters by a company spokeswoman on Monday. The facility had about 820 employees.
Kate Kenny, Caterpillar's spokeswoman, attributed the decision to ""market conditions.""
Caterpillar shares closed up 1.7% at $146.92.
In October, the world's largest heavy equipment maker said it was taking steps to cut production after sales fell across all product segments and in most regions in the latest quarter. 
Sales in Asia-Pacific, its third-biggest market, fell 13% as Caterpillar faced falling demand in China and competition from cut-price domestic rivals, while revenue in its main developed world market in North America fell almost 3%.
The Illinois-based manufacturer said trade tensions made customers wary of committing to large capital expenditures, hitting quarterly profits and forcing a cut in its full-year profit outlook. It expects the uncertainty to result in lower sales this year.
Kenny did not say whether the production cuts would lead to a workforce reductions at other facilities. When asked, she said Caterpillar was taking ""a variety of actions at its global facilities to align production with demand.""
Caterpillar, an industrial bellwether and proxy for global economic activity, benefited in the past year from the strongest global growth since 2010. However, a tariff war between the United States and trade partners, including China, has sapped business confidence and weakened the global economy.
Last month, the International Monetary Fund warned that the Sino-U.S. trade war will cut 2019 global growth to its slowest pace since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, adding that the outlook could darken further if trade tensions remain unresolved.
Henry Guajardo, who runs Workforce Solutions - a state-funded local workforce development agency - said the affected employees were all production workers.
Since Caterpillar notified his agency about the layoffs at the Victoria facility, Guajardo said dozens of workers have come to his office seeking help in securing a livelihood. 
Other manufacturers have also let go of workers, citing weak demand. Last month, farm equipment maker Deere & Co (N:DE) announced indefinite layoffs for 163 manufacturing workers.

In September, analysts at Moody's Analytics estimated the trade war had cost almost 300,000 jobs in the United States.

500,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 04:26PM ET</span>",New York police commissioner to step down from 'a job that consumes you',"By Gabriella Borter
NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Police Department Commissioner James O'Neill will step down to take a new job in the private sector, he said on Monday, about three months after his decision to fire an officer accused of using a banned chokehold that caused the death of a black man.
Dermot Shea, currently the NYPD's chief of detectives, will replace O'Neill.
""This is a job that consumes you,"" O'Neill said at a news conference attended by Shea and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. O'Neill said he would leave the post in a month.
O'Neill, who was appointed in 2016, said criticism leveled at him for his decision in August to throw Daniel Pantaleo off the police force, five years after the death of Eric Garner in New York's Staten Island borough, was not a reason for his leaving. 
Even so, O'Neill said the controversy troubled him deeply.
""It wasn't a motivating factor in my decision,"" O'Neill said. ""I'm not going to stand up here and say it didn't weigh on me heavily.""
Both the Staten Island prosecutor and the U.S. Justice Department declined to charge Pantaleo in the case. An NYPD administrative judge found him guilty of committing reckless assault and violating department rules by using a banned chokehold.
The Police Benevolent Association (PBA), which represents NYPD officers, blasted O'Neill for firing Pantaleo.
Garner's death was one of a series of killings that sparked nationwide #BlackLivesMatter protests over allegations of police mistreatment of minorities.
Pantaleo filed a lawsuit against the NYPD last month, alleging that he was wrongfully terminated. 
""We look forward to working with Commissioner Shea to combat the current anti-police atmosphere and make positive changes that will improve the lives of our police officers and every New Yorker we protect,"" the PBA said in a statement.
O'Neill's next job is in the private sector, de Blasio said. O'Neill declined to provide further details, saying only that it was ""something I couldn't pass up.""
De Blasio praised O'Neill for his efforts to fight crime and improve relations between New Yorkers and police.
""Jimmy can be proud of the fact that crime in New York City today is at the lowest level its been since the 1950s,"" de Blasio said. 

O'Neill, who has worked in New York City law enforcement since 1983, started his job as commissioner on the day a bomb exploded in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, injuring 30 people in September 2016.

The company also lifted its guidance, forecasting a smaller loss for the full year. 
Uber reported a loss per share of 68 cents on revenue of $3.53 billion, compared with estimates from Investing.com for a loss of 70 cents a share on revenue of $3.63 billion. 
The narrower-than-expected loss comes even as costs continued to surge as the company grows its food delivery and freight businesses.
Costs surged 32% to $4.9 billion for the quarter from a year earlier. 
In a sign of rising competition, the company reported a rise in excess driver incentives that pressured contribution profit – how much money the company receives after deducting direct expenses.
In the third quarter, adjusted losses before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (LBITDA) – previously called contribution profit or losss – widened 28% to $585 million, with its faster growth business, UBER EATS, falling 67% in the quarter.
The company grew monthly active consumers 26% to 103 million in the previous quarter.
Gross bookings, a measure of total value of rides before driver costs and other expenses, rose 29% to $16.5 billion from a year ago.
""We expect ANR growth to accelerate again in Q4 and continue to focus on financial discipline. As such, we are improving our full year Adjusted EBITDA guidance by $250 million to a loss of $2.8-2.9 billion,"" said Nelson Chai, CFO. ""We are also providing additional disclosure, both to deliver more visibility into our business and to further align our internal focus on efficiency with our external reporting."""
502,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 04:15PM ET</span>",Fund managers avoid risk in fixed income as U.S. growth slows,"By Megan Davies, Kate Duguid and Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fixed income managers are insulating themselves from pockets of risk, positioning their portfolios more defensively as trade tension weighs, the 2020 U.S. elections loom and global growth slows.
""The concern I have around the global economy is you are seeing slowing growth,"" said Gregory Peters, managing director and multi-sector and strategy head at PGIM. He is shifting into higher-quality structured products and retreating from the high-yield space.
""In our active funds, our focus has been a little more defensive. We've been a little worried about the trade war, so we've been investing in entities less exposed to trade,"" said Anne Mathias, global rates and FX strategist at Vanguard, citing healthcare, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, U.S. utilities and some media firms, among others.
Last week, the U.S. Commerce Department reported gross domestic product increased less than expected in the third quarter, at a 1.9% annualized rate, as trade tensions led to a decline in business investment. The trade war with China, now in its 16th month, has also slowed growth and hiring in the U.S. manufacturing sector.
Although fund managers are showing signs of caution, they do not see recession on the horizon, despite the warning signs in the inverted U.S. yield curve during the summer. A yield curve inversion has preceded every U.S. recession for the past 50 years.
Mathias does not see a recession before the end of 2021; Peters too is looking beyond 2020: ""I'm not envisioning a meltdown next year by any stretch.""
Both cited the continued strength of the U.S. consumer as a reason for confidence, as well as demand for U.S. bonds as interest rates fall globally.
Peters said PGIM has reduced risk in credit by avoiding leveraged loans and pulling out of high-yield debt, particularly the most speculative bonds.
Shorting double-B rated debt, the first notch into the ""junk"" bond space, was a traditional hedge against a downturn, as the best-rated speculative-grade bonds have lots to lose as growth slows. But Peters says trade has been overplayed and is rotating out of that space.
Peters said there are opportunities in single-B rated credits and highly rated structured products. Single-B rated credits are higher risk than double-Bs, but are still attractive as Peters moves out of high-yield debt more broadly.
In structured finance, Peters is moving into higher-rated products.
""We continue to believe the cheapest risk-adjusted asset in fixed income continues to be high-quality structured products. Triple-A CLOs, triple-A CMBS, different parts of the subprime market,"" he said. ""What we're continuing to do is shift our portfolios into higher-quality structured products.""

503,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 04:05PM ET</span>",China Reviews Xi's Options to Visit U.S. to Sign Trade Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. 
China is reviewing locations in the U.S. where President Xi Jinping would be willing to meet with Donald Trump to sign the first phase of a trade deal between the world’s two largest economies, people familiar with the plans said.
Officials in Beijing had hoped that if Xi traveled to the U.S. to sign stage one of the agreement it would be as part of a state visit, but they’re open to having him go even if it isn’t, people familiar with the matter said. No final decision has been made, said a Chinese official, who asked not to be named discussing the private negotiations.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Monday met a U.S. delegation that included National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien and U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross at a regional summit in Bangkok.
Before meeting Li, Ross told a morning business forum that the U.S. was “very far along” with “phase one” of a trade deal with China. Earlier, Trump told reporters that a trade agreement, if completed, would be signed somewhere in the U.S.
The remarks were the latest in a series of recent moves pointing to an easing of tensions in a trade conflict that’s more than a year old and involves nearly $500 billion in goods shipped in both directions. Earlier, the Communist Party’s Global Times newspaper reported that China, heartened by progress made in the talks, may temporarily hold off on imposing $3.6 billion in sanctions on U.S. products as recently approved by the World Trade Organization.
“We’re relatively close to an agreement,” O’Brien told reporters in Bangkok on Monday, adding that Trump invited Xi to the U.S. if the two sides are ready to sign the phase one agreement. “I’m cautiously optimistic about it.”
In an interview with Bloomberg on Sunday, Ross expressed optimism the U.S. would conclude an initial agreement with China this month before working on additional phases. He also said licenses would be coming “very shortly” for U.S. firms to sell components to China’s Huawei Technologies Co.
U.S. equity futures advanced along with stocks worldwide on signs that trade tensions are easing. China’s offshore strengthened as much as 0.27% to 7.0227 per dollar on Monday, at one point breaking through its 100-day moving average for the first time since May.
Ross called the phase one agreement “particularly complicated” and said the U.S. was “making sure that each side has a very correct and clear, detailed understanding of what each side has agreed to.” Iowa, Alaska, Hawaii and locations in China were all possible places for Trump and President Xi Jinping to sign the deal after the cancellation of this month’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile.
“We’re in good shape, we’re making good progress, and there’s no natural reason why it couldn’t be,” Ross said. “But whether it will slip a little bit, who knows. It’s always possible.”
Downgraded Delegation
Ross and National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien are leading a downgraded American delegation to meetings hosted by the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Thailand. Ross said Monday that the Trump administration remained “fully committed” to the Indo-Pacific region, amid questions over U.S. strategy fueled by the president’s absence.
Asian leaders were separately expected to announce a breakthrough on another trade pact, the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, at the end of the meetings. It remained uncertain whether the pact would include India, which jeopardized it with last-minute requests.
Ross in the interview downplayed the significance of RCEP, which would lower tariffs in an area that represents roughly a third of the global economy, and defended U.S. engagement in Asia after Trump skipped the Asean meetings for a second straight year.
No Trump or Pence in Bangkok Has Asia Questioning U.S. Strategy
Contentious issues remain and the terms aren’t yet known, but RCEP would at least partly fill a trade gap left by Trump’s 2017 withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Southeast Asia collectively has the world’s fifth largest economy and has struggled to wade through the economic fallout of U.S.-China trade tensions.
‘Constructive’ Call
Top American and Chinese negotiators both spoke on the phone Friday and described the talks as “constructive” as they look to lower tensions in a trade war that has roiled global growth. On Saturday after the call, Chinese state media reiterated the nation’s core demands, including the removal of all punitive tariffs.
The deal would see China increase purchases of U.S. agriculture products, keep its currency stable and open financial services markets to American firms. In return, Beijing wants the U.S. to do away with new import taxes due to take effect Dec. 15 on goods including smart-phones.
Ross remained non-committal on whether the Trump administration would suspend the December tariff hike. He also said further phases of the deal would depend on things involving legislation on the part of China and an enforcement mechanism.
Asked about a potential meeting between Xi and Trump, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang repeated that the two are in “in touch by various means” at a regular briefing in Beijing on Monday.
Chinese officials have cast doubts about reaching a comprehensive long-term trade deal even as the two sides close in on the phase one agreement, Bloomberg reported last week. China has stated for months that a final deal must include the removal of all punitive tariffs, and has balked at reforms in areas such as state-run enterprises that could jeopardize the Communist Party’s grip on power.
Trump has placed dozens of Chinese firms on the Commerce Department’s “entity list,” hampering their ability to purchase American software and components. It first targeted Huawei in May for national security reasons, and last month added 28 more companies including artificial intelligence giants SenseTime Group Ltd., Megvii Technology Ltd. and Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co.
Awaiting Licenses
Entities on the list are prohibited from doing business with American companies without being granted a U.S. government license, although some have maintained relationships with banned companies through international subsidiaries. China’s government has signaled it will hit back over the blacklist, and the companies have denied wrongdoing.
The blacklist is also hurting American companies that do business with China, and particularly Huawei. Trump said in June after meeting with Xi in Japan that he’d “easily” agreed to allow American firms to continue certain exports to Huawei, and weeks later Trump said he’d accelerate the approval process for licenses.
How Blacklisting Companies Became a Trade War Weapon: QuickTake
Still, none have been granted so far. The president as recently as this month green-lit the approval of licenses in a meeting with advisers, according to people familiar with the matter, but an announcement has yet to be made.
Ross on Sunday said the licenses “will be forthcoming very shortly,” noting that the government received 260 requests.

504,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 04:05PM ET</span>",Record Short VIX Positioning Reflects a Ton of Fear Elsewhere,"(Bloomberg) -- Bearish bets on stock volatility are close to a record high, raising investor concern that the market is ripe for turmoil. There’s a more benign explanation.
Futures linked to the measure of S&P 500’s implied volatility, known as the “fear gauge”, tend to move inversely to equities. The net non-commercial position -- long contracts outstanding less short positions -- sank to minus 187,948 last week, its lowest level ever.
If speculators are net short, somebody else must be net long. And some of the exchange-traded products used by retail investors are reflecting exactly that. Shares outstanding in three such offerings (VXX, UVXY and TVIX) are all at record highs. The iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX short-term futures ETN (VXX) is the second itinerant of this note, and was launched in 2018.
“Retail builds up a big position and that’s reflected in the term structure. Speculators have the other side,” said Benn Eifert, chief investment officer at QVR Advisors. “It’s the wrong interpretation to say a big speculative VIX net-short position necessarily means it’s a good time to be long.”
Pravit Chintawongvanich, equity derivatives strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), added that the shape of the curve is often used as a guide for speculative positioning. The steep contango -- which reflects higher uncertainty about the medium-term outlook for volatility relative to the near term -- encourages increased exposure to a short-vol trade.
While the sheer size of shorts is elevated, it’s still below the 2019 peak and well off levels that prevailed before the Feb. 5 volatility explosion. This entails there’s less that would need to be covered in the event of a meaningful market tumult.
If there’s a reason for caution regarding S&P 500 options, it’s that they may be reflecting greed rather than complacency, according to analysts. One example is that a gauge of investors’ demand for options that offer protection against 10% downside versus (90-110 one-month put-call skew) has crated since early October to near its lows of the year."
505,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 04:04PM ET</span>","Trade Is Investors’ Top Election Concern, Morgan Stanley Says","(Bloomberg) -- Responses from 645 investors worldwide surveyed by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) show they are most concerned about trade policy, fiscal policy and taxes, strategists Michael Zezas and Meredith Pickett and others wrote in a 100-plus page note on the 2020 election.
Respondents are least concerned about immigration and energy and climate policy, they said. Most expected a Democrat would be more likely than a Republican to boost financial regulations, de-escalate China tariffs, and go for prescription drug changes. Respondents associated Republicans with a higher likelihood of pursuing fiscal stimulation.
“Election-driven market volatility is to be expected,” they wrote, as “investor expectations are at odds with a market priced for a status quo policy outcome.” In particular, broad equity index, tech and financials sector options aren’t pricing in potential pressure from a possible Democratic victory.
At the same time, the analysts were mindful that policy ambitions may “fall short in practice,” with only a portion of a candidate’s platform likely to be enacted. Neither party is likely to “take control in a way that gives it legislative carte blanche,” they said.
They added that President Donald Trump’s ability to repeat his 2016 victories in the upper Midwest and Pennsylvania may depend on how local economies perform. Morgan Stanley will watch softening economies in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, adding that other swing states -- Arizona, North Carolina, Florida -- are doing well economically.
Morgan Stanley sees the greatest probability of “meaningful fiscal stimulus” in the event of a sweep by either party. Infrastructure spending would be more likely under a unified Democratic outcome."

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A union representing workers at Chile's state oil company ENAP [ENAP.UL], the country's main fuel importer, on Monday threatened a stoppage in support of a wave of social protests that have shaken the country in recent weeks.
Rumors of a strike began to circulate on social media at the weekend with an audio recording purportedly of the union's president Iván Montes announcing the strike and warning that Chile, which imports all of its fuel, would run dry within five days.
On Monday the ENAP Petrox union, which represents workers at the company's refinery in southern Bio Bio province, said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post that its members would strike.
In the declaration, the union said that following a meeting of its members, ""the intention to carry out a production strike has been ratified, within the framework of the social mobilizations that began more than two weeks ago in our country"".
The statement did not specify when or for how long the strike would last.
ENAP said in a statement that it was ""unacceptable to incite the paralysis of the operations for a vital public service"" and that it would continue working to maintain operational continuity."

The officers also said they were seeing weaker demand for business loans from firms but that interest in most commercial real estate loans changed little.
""Major shares of banks that reported reasons for tightening standards or terms on (business) loans cited a less favorable or more uncertain outlook; a reduced tolerance for risk; and a worsening of industry-specific problems as important reasons,"" the U.S. central bank said in its quarterly survey.
U.S. banks previously reported keeping loan standards unchanged for many business loans while tightening commercial real estate loans in the second quarter.
Last week the Fed cut interest rates for the third time this year as insurance against economic headwinds caused by slowing global growth and the U.S.-China trade war, but signaled that it was now likely to hold rates steady unless there was a material deterioration in the U.S. economy.
Banks also reported tightening lending standards for credit card loans while standards for residential real estate loans and auto loans were unchanged, according to the survey.

LONDON (Reuters) - Asset managers must ensure effective liquidity management of their funds, even where investment decisions have been delegated to others, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said.
The FCA is investigating the suspension in June of the now-closed flagship equity fund run by Neil Woodford, one of Britain's highest-profile asset managers, which was unable to meet daily calls from investors for redemptions.
""Good fund governance ensures the liquidity of your funds' underlying assets is appropriately considered,"" Nick Miller, FCA head of asset management, said in a letter to asset managers which was published on Monday. Such letters are sometimes read as a warning that enforcement action is the next step.
For funds, liquidity refers to the ease of selling assets, critical for those that offer daily cashbacks to investors.
Miller said asset managers should check if they are managing liquidity in their funds in line with the FCA's best practice. 
""Open ended"" funds come under EU rules that set a cap on illiquid assets, which the Woodford fund breached twice.
Earlier this year the FCA set out new rules on illiquid assets at funds that do not come under the EU rules.
These rules come into force in September 2020 and Miller said fund managers ""may wish to consider whether it would be in investors' interests to adopt some of the measures"" earlier.
Asset managers should consider whether a security is in practice sufficiently liquid even when listed for trading on an exchange, Miller said.
Some of Woodford's assets were listed in Guernsey, where little trading took place.
""Where assets are less liquid, robust valuation practices are vital,"" Miller said.
Separately the Bank of England and FCA will give an update on Dec. 10 on their review into the costs and benefits of aligning redemption terms with the typical time it takes to sell assets in normal and stressed market conditions.

 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) upgraded Marvell to outperform from market perform and raised its price target on the chipmaker's stock to $35 from $32 a share. Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) shares surged 6%.
With the era of 5G-enabled smartphones underway, the adoption of Marvell's 5G chips is at a ""tipping point"" and will likely experience a surge in demand, underpinning sales, according to Wells Fargo analyst Gary Mobley.
""We believe Marvell should continue to experience robust 5G-basestation-related sales to Nokia (HE:NOKIA) and Samsung (KS:005930) for the balance of 2019 and into 2020,"" Mobley said.
The revival of spending in the data-center market will also be a tailwind, Mobley noted.
Spending on data-center equipment is forecast to decline 2.8% to $204 billion in 2019, driven by a decline in spending on servers amid a drop in average server selling prices, according to research firm Gartner.
Marvell's surge was also supported by a broader move higher in chip stocks amid positive developments on the U.S.-China front.

The U.S. government on Oct 24 temporarily blocked a creditor seizure of PDVSA's U.S. subsidiary Citgo, whose shares were used as collateral for the bond issue. Venezuela opposition leader Juan Guaido took control of Citgo in February after Washington recognized him as the country's legitimate president.
The following week, the bond went into default when a $913 million payment came due and Guaido's allies filed a U.S. lawsuit requesting that the bond be declared null.
On Monday, the Venezuela Creditors Committee, which groups holders of Venezuelan government and PDVSA debt, said the U.S. government had deprived them of their ""ability to defend its interests"" and said Guaido's team had failed to open dialogue.
""We urge the U.S. Government to remove the newly imposed restrictions on the ability of the 2020 bondholders to enforce the security interest freely granted to them,"" the Committee said in a statement.
The Committee criticized Guaido's team for preferring to file a lawsuit than ""engage constructively with creditors.""
""If the Guaido Government wishes to engage with the country's creditors in good faith and to pursue an orderly and consensual renegotiation of the country's external debts, it will have to change its approach dramatically.""
A spokesman for Guaido did not immediately respond to a request to comment.
Guaido won the backing of the United States and some 50 other countries in January, but President Nicolas Maduro retains control of most state functions and the Venezuelan operations of PDVSA.
The U.S. Treasury Department, which maintains a broad sanctions program against Maduro's government, said no transfers or sales of Citgo shares linked to the PDVSA bond could take place until Jan. 22."

The company also said its global Chief People Officer David Fairhurst will leave McDonald's, but did not provide any further details.
Fairhurst has been with the company for nearly 15 years, holding key human resources positions, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile.
On Sunday, McDonald's, the world's biggest fast-food chain, said it had dismissed Easterbrook over a recent consensual relationship with an employee, which the board determined violated company policy.
""In consideration for (severance) benefits, Mr. Easterbrook has agreed to a release of claims in favor of the company,"" McDonald's said in regulatory filing. Easterbrook received total compensation of $15.88 million in 2018, according to a filing. He would get about $675,000 in severance after six months, based on his 2018 base salary of $1.35 million. Easterbrook is also eligible for 18 months of health benefits, the filing showed. McDonald's said Easterbrook's separation agreement contained a two-year post-termination non-competition clause, which is six months longer and more expansive in scope than his existing agreements. New CEO Chris Kempczinski will have an annual base salary of $1.25 million, with a target-based bonus of 170% of his annual base salary, McDonald's said.

516,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 12:33PM ET</span>",Boeing's MAX likely to return to European service in first-quarter: regulator,"By Laurence Frost
HELSINKI (Reuters) - Boeing's (N:BA) grounded 737 MAX airliner is likely to return to service in Europe during the first quarter of 2020, the head of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said on Monday.
While the European regulator expects to give its approval in January, preparations by national authorities and airlines may delay the resumption of commercial flights by up to another two months, EASA executive director Patrick Ky indicated.
""If there are training requirements (and) coordination to be done with the EU member states to make sure everyone does the same thing at the same time, this will take a bit of time,"" Ky said. ""That's why I'm saying the first quarter of 2020.""
Boeing has said it aims to return the 737 MAX to service by the end of 2019 after making software changes in the wake of two deadly crashes, which killed 346 people and led the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ground the plane in March.
Besides damaging Boeing, the grounding has hit airline customers due to the hundreds of jets now stuck on the tarmac. Low-cost operator Ryanair (I:RYA), one of Boeing's biggest MAX clients, said on Monday it expected further delays to MAX deliveries to reduce its growth in 2020.
The FAA has primary responsibility for vetting a Boeing-designed fix to avoid situations in which data from a single faulty airflow sensor can cause the flight software to send the plane into a dive. Instead, the so-called MCAS software will monitor data from a pair of the sensors.
EASA also plans to carry out its own program of checks including simulator and flight tests, before allowing flights to resume in Europe.
European experts traveled to Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL) facilities in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, last week to begin an audit of a ""reasonably final"" software version, the EASA chief told Reuters on the sidelines of the agency's annual safety conference in Helsinki. Rockwell Collins, a unit of United Technologies (N:UTX), developed the MAX flight control software with Boeing.
""There has been a lot of work done on the design of the software,"" Ky said. But he added: ""We think there is still some work to be done.""
Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe declined to comment. A spokesman for the FAA also declined to comment.
Ky would not elaborate on the likelihood that regulators will require additional simulator training for MAX pilots, which would add more delay and cost for many airline customers.
That decision can be taken only after EASA's own simulator and flight tests, he said. ""It's really at the end of the process because it's much more operational.""

The European watchdog hopes to complete a detailed software review by the end of this month, followed by December flight tests ""if everything goes well"", he added.

The carrier has faced increasingly stiff competition from low-cost carriers including easyJet (L:EZJ), Wizz Air (L:WIZZ) and Ryanair's (I:RYA) Laudamotion on short-haul routes out of its base, Vienna.

521,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 11:56AM ET</span>","Wall Street hits record high on energy, tech boost","By Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - Gains in technology and energy shares pushed Wall Street's three main indexes to record highs on Monday, as hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal and an improving domestic economy boosted risk appetite.
Washington and Beijing said on Friday they had made progress in defusing an economically damaging trade war, with U.S. officials indicating that a deal could be signed this month.
Adding to the optimism, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Sunday licenses for U.S. companies to sell components to China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd would come ""very shortly"".
Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with the energy shares (SPNY) gaining the most on the back of higher oil prices. The sector along with technology shares (SPLRCT) provided the biggest boost to the benchmark index.
Helping the tech sector was a rally in trade-sensitive chip stocks, which also drove the Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX) to a record high.
""Signing these deals take time. All that is needed for markets to be happy right now is for an agreement to be announced,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.
""The earnings period was certainly enough to support current stock prices. It wasn't good enough to lead stocks higher but not bad enough for them to go any lower,"" he added.
The third-quarter earnings season has been fairly upbeat, with 76% of the 360 S&P 500 companies that have reported results so far beating profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data.
Last week's interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, growing expectations of a trade deal and a better-than-feared October jobs growth report have been the main catalysts of the recent rally.
A report on Monday, however, showed new orders for U.S.-made goods fell more than expected in September and business spending on equipment was slightly weaker than initially thought, suggesting that manufacturing remains soft amid the ongoing trade war.
At 11:21 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 136.74 points, or 0.50%, at 27,484.10, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 14.22 points, or 0.46%, at 3,081.13 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was up 42.34 points, or 0.50%, at 8,428.74.
The biggest drag on the blue-chip Dow Jones index was a 2.6% drop in shares of McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) after the fast-food giant dismissed Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook over a recent consensual relationship with an employee, which the board determined violated company policy.
 Under Armour  Inc (N:UAA) fell 15.4% as it lowered its full-year revenue forecast for a second straight time, a day after it confirmed a federal probe related to its accounting practices.

JURMALA, Latvia (Reuters) - Latvia's central bank chief, who led the former Soviet republic into the euro, appeared in court on Monday accused of bribery in the first corruption trial of a European Central Bank governor.
Latvia's public prosecutor has accused Ilmars Rimsevics, 54, of accepting the offer of a 500,000-euro bribe and taking a paid holiday in Russia.
Rimsevics' trial is a landmark case for the 20-year-old euro currency bloc, which spans EU countries from Portugal to the three Baltic nations that neighbor Russia.
The case has tarnished the image of the ECB, where Rimsevics sits on the governing council, which decides the price of money in the euro zone and has the final say in supervising banks.
Rimsevics appeared in court alongside Latvian businessman Maris Martinsons, who prosecutors say acted as a middleman.
State prosecutor Viorika Jirgena said the central charge against Rimsevics was that he took a bribe. If convicted, he could face jail. Rimsevics denied the accusation, while Martinsons' lawyer also denied the charges. 
The case centers on allegations of a 500,000 euro bribe promised, and partly paid, by two shareholders of Trasta Komercbanka at a time when the Latvian bank was worried about its future.
Part of the evidence is based on conversations between the defendants in a sauna, secretly recorded by Latvian investigators. 
Jirgena has earlier said the bribery dates back to 2010, when the shareholders paid for Rimsevics to spend a vacation in Kamchatka, a wilderness region in Russia’s far east.
In return, Jirgena said Rimsevics helped them prepare answers to questions from the Latvian regulator, the Financial and Capital Market Commission (FCMC).
Later, in 2012, the shareholders agreed to pay him 500,000 euros in two equal installments, in return for Rimsevics using his influence to soften treatment of the bank.
Lawyers for Rimsevics persuaded the judge on Monday to allow him travel to Frankfurt in December for what will be his final ECB Governing Council meeting before his term expires.
He had earlier been reinstated in that post after the ECB challenged his suspension from office. Rimsevics' lawyers argued in court that his position with the ECB granted him immunity from such a prosecution.
The prosecutor alleges that Rimsevics was unsuccessful in preventing Trasta Komercbanka's demise and that, as a result, the shareholders refused to pay the second 250,000-euro installment.
The bank closed in 2016 after the Latvian regulator said it had broken money-laundering rules.
The shareholders approached Latvian anti-corruption investigators, handing over evidence of the bribery.
As central bank governor, Rimsevics was entitled to attend meetings at the FCMC regulator and was also responsible, along with the finance ministry, for proposing its head.
A spokeswoman for the FCMC said it took decisions independently. The ECB declined to comment.
The stakes are high for Latvia. After securing independence from Russia in 1991, more than a dozen of its banks have promoted themselves as a gateway to Western markets for clients in former Soviet states, promising Swiss-style secrecy.
Its prime minister, Krisjanis Karins, has pledged to end that and promised to overhaul the banking sector but his efforts have been overshadowed by slow progress in the Rimsevics case. Rimsevics was originally detained in early 2018.

(Reuters) - Saudi Aramco's blockbuster listing remained shrouded in mystery on Monday, a day after the company finally announced its plans, with scant details disclosed and expert valuations varying wildly from around $1.2 to $2.3 trillion.
The state oil giant, the world's most profitable company, fired the starting gun on a domestic initial public offering (IPO) on Sunday after a series of false starts that had kept the investment world guessing. 
However potential investors, rattled by a damaging attack on Aramco's facilities in September, were not given key details usually included in ""intention to float"" notices - such as how much of the company will be sold, and when the sale will happen. 
Now fund managers are poring over bank research about the famously secretive company, but little certainty has been provided even by analysts from the Wall Street giants with roles in the IPO, five investment and banking sources told Reuters. 
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has said he wants a $2 trillion valuation, seeking to raise billions of dollars to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil by investing in non-energy industries. 
That valuation figure is almost twice that of Microsoft (N:MSFT), currently the world's most valuable listed company and seven times that of  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), the biggest listed oil major by market cap. 
Analysts from banks working on the Riyadh bourse listing have met Aramco's management in Dhahran over the past month to get more information on the company, but their valuations of the company still vary by around $1 trillion. 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) has a range of $1.2 trillion to $2.3 trillion while EFG Hermes says $1.55 trillion to $2.1 trillion, according to two fund managers who have seen the reports. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) - one of the IPO coordinators - has put the valuation between $1.6 trillion and $2.3 trillion, two separate sources said. Credit Suisse's research offers a similarly wide range, one of the fund managers said.
A major factor in the broad spread is the various assumptions analysts are making for the future direction of oil prices, said a source familiar with the deal.
The banks were not immediately available for comment.
Sources have told Reuters that Aramco could offer 1%-2% of its shares, raising as much as $20 billion to $40 billion. A deal over $25 billion would top the record-breaking IPO of Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (N:BABA) in 2014.
Aramco Chairman Yasir al-Rumayyan said a decision on an international listing would be made in the future.

Graphic: Aramco vs oil majors market cap, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/7183/7165/Pasted%20Image.jpg
ROADSHOWS AND RISK
Two bankers working on the deal estimated around 80% of shares would be sold to local retail and institutional investors, with about 20% likely to go to international buyers.
Having a large domestic investor base is expected to make it easier to achieve a higher valuation. Three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters a government committee had been securing pre-sale commitments from wealthy Saudis, while retail investors were being offered cheap credit.
Aramco did provide investors with some extra financial information on Sunday and Monday, including its nine-month earnings, which showed net income fell to $68.2 billion by the end of September 30, down from $83.1 billion a year earlier.
The Saudi Arabian Oil Company, to give its full name, did not give a reason for the fall, but it likely reflects lower oil prices.
In 2016, when the oil price hit 13-year lows, Aramco's net income was only $13 billion, according to a company bond prospectus this year, compared to $111 billion in 2018.
Its net income for the third quarter of 2019 amounted to $21.1 billion, according to Reuters calculations. By contrast, Exxon Mobil's income for the period was just over $3 billion.
Aramco said it did not expect the Sept. 14 attacks on its facilities, which initially halved its production, would have a material impact on its business.
However the attacks underlined the potential political risk associated with the state company. Saudi Arabia blamed arch-rival Iran, a charge rejected by Tehran.
The analysts' roadshow for Aramco, where analysts from banks working on the IPO speak to investors, began in the Middle East on Sunday and will run for a fortnight, involving 26 to 27 analysts across the world, a source familiar with the deal said. 
Roadshows involving senior management will begin after analysts' meetings while pricing is likely to be announced around Nov. 28, the source added.

ASSET MANAGER UNDECIDED
Legal & General Investment Management, one of Britain's biggest asset managers, has not yet decided whether to invest in Aramco, its chief investment officer Sonja Laud told the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit on Monday. She added ""concerns from a corporate governance viewpoint are well-flagged"". 
The close relationship between the crown prince and new Aramco Chairman Rumayyan, who also heads the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, is a governance concern for some investors, sources have previously said.
The wealth fund will use the proceeds of the IPO to deliver on the prince's ambitious reforms.
Among other expert valuations for Aramco, Bernstein analysts estimate ""a fair value range"" is $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion.
Others are more conservative.
A more reasonable valuation is around $1 trillion, said Anish Kapadia, head of London-based independent oil and mining advisory Palissy Advisors.
""Our view is that an aspirational $2 trillion valuation is extremely high from a fundamentals perspective.""

President Donald Trump told reporters Sunday a trade deal, if completed, will be signed somewhere in the U.S.

Chris Kempczinski, who was in charge of McDonald's operations in the United States, took over from Easterbrook on Sunday, following his dismissal over a recent consensual relationship with an employee, which McDonald's board determined violated company policy.
Piper Jaffray & Co on Monday downgraded the stock to ""neutral"" from ""buy"", citing the likely disruption from a sudden change of this magnitude.
""Our experience leads us to take a more cautionary view noting the potential lack of momentum and time involved in formalizing a new team,"" analyst Miller Regan said.
Kempczinski has inherited the top spot at the world's largest fast-food chain when its struggling to bring in more customers at its restaurants amid a shift to healthier food choices and delivery apps available at their finger tips.
McDonald's has spent billions to modernize stores, add digital kiosks and automate parts of the ordering process as part of its turnaround plan under Easterbrook, who took over as the CEO in 2015.
He was credited with franchising 95% of McDonald's U.S. fleet, launching the popular all-day breakfast, revamping restaurants to add digital ordering kiosks and making tech acquisitions to remodel stores. The company's stock has nearly doubled in value under him.

""Easterbrook was a change-agent at McDonald's and his leadership, particularly in the face of difficult decisions ... will be missed,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Jon Tower said.
For Kempczinski, a Harvard alumnus, the biggest challenge will be rapid changes in the industry and the push to grow restaurant traffic, especially after McDonald's remodeling investments, a switch to fresh beef and cheaper menu items that weighed on margins and service time.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Virgin Hyperloop One said Monday it is asking states to support and host the development of a center to advance its futuristic super high-speed travel plans by testing and validating the technology.
Hyperloop systems involve fixed intercity transportation systems in which passengers are transported in low-pressure capsules or pods that operate in sealed partial-vacuum tubes at 600 miles (966 kmph) an hour or faster.
Los Angeles-based Virgin Hyperloop One said its system uses a ""proprietary magnetic levitation system"" that could make ""speeds up to 700 miles per hour"" possible and reduce the time to travel from New York to Washington to 30 minutes, compared with more than two-and-a-half hours on a high-speed train.
Virgin Hyperloop said Monday it was issuing a request for proposals to states, regional or local governments and private organizations, foundations and academic institutions to create a ""Hyperloop Certification Center"" to establish ""regulatory and safety standards, research frameworks, and testing infrastructure.""
West Virginia and Georgia state officials said they were interested in the idea and planned to review the proposal.
""We are looking for states that believe our technology is the giant leap forward we need,"" Virgin Group founder Richard Branson said in a letter accompanying the proposal.
""We imagine a future where cities are connected like metro stops, and catching a ride to see your family in the next city
is as easy as traveling across town.""
Virgin Hyperloop has raised at least $295 million since its founding in 2014 and has a strategic partnership with the Virgin Group and financial backing from Dubai Ports World (DI:DPW) and other investors.
Virgin Hyperloop said it expects the center would be funded through public and private sources but did not specify how much it forecast the center would cost or how much it would contribute.
The company wants to begin construction of the center by 2021 with completion and regulatory approval by 2025 - including a certification track that would be at least six miles long for testing. The company's goal is to launch the first hyperloop routes by 2029.
In September, Virgin Hyperloop showed off one of its travel pods in New York and then brought it to Capitol Hill to show U.S. lawmakers last month. The company has had a hyperloop test site in North Las Vegas, Nevada since 2017.
In March, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said she was creating an internal deliberative body to help resolve jurisdictional and regulatory gaps that may impede new technology, ""such as tunneling, hyperloop, autonomous vehicles, and other innovations.""
In April, the Transportation Department issued a draft environmental assessment for public comment for a Washington, D.C. to Baltimore tunnel that would carry passengers between the cities at high speeds in autonomous electric vehicles, the first step in a governmental review of the project from Elon Musk's Boring Co.
Boring has proposed a privately funded 35.3-mile ""loop project"" that would include twin underground tunnels transporting passengers at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour. Boring says the loop tunnels would be compatible with hyperloop requirements and the loop tunnels eventually could be part of the faster system."
534,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 09:07AM ET</span>",Microsoft rolls out new cloud tool for analyzing business data,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced on Monday a new service aimed at helping large businesses put to use the huge amounts of data stored in corporate systems.
The Azure Synapse system, to be unveiled at an event in Florida, is part of the company's fast-growing cloud computing unit, which has driven the company's shares up over the past five years. The tool is meant to help companies build out systems that analyze large amounts of data to make better business decisions, such as whether a digital marketing campaign is driving more traffic to stores and websites.
The Synapse aims to solve two problems for businesses building those systems, Rohan Kumar, the corporate vice president of Azure Data, told Reuters in an interview.
The first is that businesses need different software tools to analyze data held in systems like customer databases - where names and addresses sit in neat rows and columns and look like a spreadsheet - versus newer systems like website monitoring tools, where clicks are recorded as a long stream of numbers and time stamps. The Synapse tool is designed to handle both kinds of data, he said.

535,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 09:03AM ET</span>","ETFs That Echo Hedge Funds Are Set to Double Assets, Report Says","(Bloomberg) -- A relatively new category of exchange-traded fund is poised to hit it big, according to Greenwich Associates.
Institutional investment in so-called liquid alternative ETFs -- including products that seek to mirror hedge funds -- will more than double to $114 billion during the next 12 months, analysts led by Andrew McCollum wrote in a report Monday. The study was commissioned by IndexIQ, part of New York Life Investment Management, which runs two of the largest ETFs with hedge fund-like strategies, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Pension funds, endowments and other large investors currently have $882 billion invested in liquid alternatives -- a catch-all pot that encompasses everything from hedge funds and real estate, to private equity and infrastructure -- but only about $47 billion of that is in ETFs, Greenwich found. However, that gap could soon shrink as almost 20% of institutions not currently investing in these funds told Greenwich that they will consider using them in the next 12 months.
“The interest to allocate more to liquid alternative investment strategies overall is really investors’ need to get a diversified source of return to reduce volatility in their portfolio, especially as we are getting to an extended bull market,” said Kelly Ye, director of research and alternative investments with IndexIQ.
The firm’s IQ Hedge Multi-Strategy Tracker ETF and IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF together oversee more than $1.7 billion.
Alt Appeal
Alternatives can help diversify portfolios as their returns aren’t necessarily correlated with the movement of the stock or bond markets, where most investors deploy the majority of their capital. But some of these strategies can be hard to access, hence the appeal of a daily-traded ETF -- or even mutual or closed-end funds -- to make investing easier.
Many of the 107 fund professionals questioned by Greenwich are interested in ETFs for liquid alternatives because of their enhanced liquidity, improved portfolio diversification and heightened transparency. However, just one in 10 had actually used these funds, and only for a small proportion of their assets.
Complexity could be a roadblock to increased adoption, according to Shana Sissel, a senior portfolio manager at CLS Investments, who specializes in alternatives. Any underperformance by these strategies can be difficult to explain to investors, she said.
Still, more people are starting to ask about liquid alternative ETFs, says Gary Stringer, chief investment officer at Stringer Asset Management.
“People are looking around for areas to generate some kind of return that is better than what the traditional fixed-income market is offering,” he said."

The company said it lost 91,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the second quarter. Analysts were expecting a net loss of 145,000 subscribers, according to research firm FactSet.
Sprint, the fourth largest wireless carrier by subscribers, has been aggressive in its 5G push, offering the faster mobile technology in nine cities and bundling it with media content like Hulu and Amazom.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Prime. 
The company, which has been struggling to close its $26 billion-merger with T-Mobile (O:TMUS) due to legal hurdles, said total net operating revenue fell to $7.8 billion from $8.43 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $8.17 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net loss attributable to the company was $274 million, or 7 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a net income of $196 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier.
Analysts were expecting a loss of 2 cents per share.

Shares of the company were up nearly 2% at $6.40 in trading before the bell.

538,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 08:13AM ET</span>",Goldman Says U.S. Stocks Still Reign Supreme,"(Bloomberg) -- The S&P 500 may be trading at record highs, but  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). is telling its rich clients that U.S. stocks still reign supreme among assets.
“The main returns in our view still come from having an overweight to U.S. equities,” Silvia Ardagna, managing director in the investment strategy group within Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management, said in an interview in London. “The U.S. has the prominence over others.”
The reason is simple, according to the Goldman unit, which manages about $500 billion. With global growth slowing and Germany slipping into a technical recession, the U.S. economy is looking more robust in the medium-term compared to other countries. And this may just be the case as U.S. payrolls on Friday showed surprising resilience in October, validating the Federal Reserve’s signal to pause rate cuts.
The progress in U.S.-China trade talks is making high-net-worth clients more keen to put their cash to work, Ardagna said. And the facts back this up as risk assets are becoming more popular, with $6.1 billion going into global stock funds in the week through Oct. 30. That was after weeks of redemptions when U.S. equity funds lost about $58 billion since the start of the year, according to Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and EPFR Global data.
“The de-escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China has triggered the question whether investors have been too negative and there could be some positive surprises,” said Ardagna, a former associate professor at Harvard University. “If we get better economic data and there’s a stabilization in the manufacturing and the services sector remains robust, this rally can clearly extend.”
Many fund managers have chosen to sit out this year’s rally in equities and hide in cash or bonds amid fears that global growth is stalling and the decade-long bull market is nearing its end. Whereas Friday’s jobs data were reassuring, trade tensions can reemerge at any moment. On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that Chinese officials were casting doubts about reaching a comprehensive long-term trade deal with the U.S.
Yet, on Monday, stocks around the world rallied after the two nations signaled further progress toward a breakthrough in discussions.
Goldman Private Wealth Management’s preference for U.S. equities also comes amid an array of challenges haunting European stocks, including Germany’s recession. The team is neutral U.K. assets because of political uncertainty, and Ardagna says that even Brexit’s resolution wouldn’t be enough for investors to stop being skeptical about Europe unless economic growth picks up.
But there are a few exceptions to the asset manager’s wariness of European equities. Euro-zone bank stocks make the cut because of low valuations and improved fundamentals and it’s overweight on Spanish stocks because of their pricing and as domestic growth outpaces the region.
Still, although European and emerging-market equities trade at a discount to the U.S., Goldman Private Wealth Management doesn’t anticipate lower valuations will deliver subsequent outperformance.
“We expect the data to hold up well in the U.S.,” Ardagna said. “If the 2% growth in the U.S. gets validated by high-frequency data for the fourth quarter, the market will digest well the Fed’s message that they’ll be less aggressive in their rate cuts going forward.”"
539,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 07:48AM ET</span>","Trouble cooking? GrubHub, Uber Eats get pushback from restaurants on fees","By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK (Reuters) - In a letter to investors before its share price plunged last week, online food delivery service GrubHub Inc (N:GRUB) cited its profitable ties with small and medium-sized restaurants, saying they generate 80% of the orders on its platform.
""This is a highly lucrative relationship for both parties,"" the letter said. 
But some restaurants think otherwise and have begun pushing back against what they see as the relationship's unfair distribution of profits.
A growing number of small and mid-sized food chains want to reduce ordering and delivery commissions as high as 30% charged by the big four third-party platforms - GrubHub, Uber Technologies Inc's (N:UBER) Uber Eats, DoorDash Inc and Postmates Inc, industry sources say.
""They hate the relationship and they are getting raked over the coals,"" said Ben Gaddis, president of T3, a digital marketing and tech consultant to restaurants such as Pizza Hut and Schlotzsky's. ""The smaller they are, the more it impacts their margins.""
The delivery platforms charge restaurants for having their menus listed on their sites, which customers can use to place orders - similar to the way consumers book hotel rooms through third-party online marketplaces like Priceline, Kayak or  Expedia  (O:EXPE). Restaurants pay higher fees if they want to be listed more prominently, or if they use the services to deliver the orders placed through them. 
""They've become this necessary evil,"" said Bareburger Group Chief Executive Euripides Pelekanos, referring to the delivery platforms. The organic burger chain with 46 stores mostly in the northeast hopes to be rid of all third-party platforms by 2020.
In 2017, Bareburger booked $20 million in revenue from orders placed through third-party platforms, Pelekanos said, but it also spent about $2.5 million to $3 million in related fees. 
For the restaurant industry, that roughly 15% rate ""is our whole margin,"" Pelekanos said.
Thanks to intense competition among third-party services, restaurants with just 25 to 50 locations recently have found they have more leverage to negotiate better terms, according to Gaddis, the tech consultant. 
Last week, GrubHub shares tanked, closing the week down more than 40% after the company reported weak sales and lowered forward guidance, citing hyper competition from rivals.
When Uber reports earnings on Monday investors were expecting to see that price-competition in its core ride-hailing business has eased - even as it heats up for the food delivery business.
Uber may be spreading itself too thin with Uber Eats, particularly in a market where no U.S. company has shown sustained profitability, some analysts say.
""Some investors may prefer Lyft's higher growth and absence of exposure to Eats, which remains very competitive,"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analyst Justin Post said in a note to clients.  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) is Uber's leading rival in the ride-hailing business, which Uber has acknowledged may never be profitable.
Uber said it could not comment on its food delivery business during its quiet period ahead of earnings. 
As it faces demands for lower fees, GrubHub acknowledged in a statement to Reuters that its commission rates are negotiable, depending on the level of services required.
Chicago-based GrubHub also said restaurants had been ""getting more orders with larger overall ticket prices through our platform on a year-over-year basis"" since 2014.
""Not only are restaurants getting more orders, but each order is getting bigger as well. This translates into increased incremental revenue that we believe off-sets a negotiated commission,"" the company said.
Still, some restaurants are building their own apps and turning to alternative delivery operations. Having their own apps also allows them to hold on to valuable data about customers who place orders.
In February, Bareburger rolled out its own app and website through a startup called Lunchbox, which it helped launch. The service costs about $750 per month per location.
The burger chain is also using a company called Relay, which charges $5 to handle each delivery. The costs are well below the $8,000 per month each Bareburger outlet spends on third-party platforms and related apps, Pelekanos told Reuters.
Bareburger employees also staple advertising cards to orders delivered through GrubHub, to redirect customers to Bareburger's own site.
Bareburger is still taking roughly 80% of its delivery transactions through GrubHub, but the chain plans to dump third-party platforms once its own Bareburger channels start processing at least 50% of all digital orders. 

It took one of its restaurants off all the platforms last year for a one-month trial. Sales volume fell, but profits remained the same, Pelekanos said.

""We want to invest more intensely in the U.S. in the next two years,"" Benko told an event in Berlin, adding that part of the motive for seeking to build up a second base alongside his European portfolio was to diversify his currency exposure.
Benko bought the Chrysler Building - an art-deco tower which is considered a crown jewel of the city's skyline - in partnership with property firm RFR Holding LLC for about $150 million, Signa's debut in the U.S. property sector.
Founded by Benko in 1999, the value of Signa's real estate assets will exceed 20 billion euros ($22 billion) by the end of the year, including landmark buildings like Berlin's KaDeWe department store and Vienna's Goldenes Quartier.
Signa said in September it had raised 700 million euros in new funds from existing investors and was planning a 500 million euro capital increase to give it liquidity reserves of more than 1 billion euros for future acquisitions.
Benko has diversified into retail in the past few years, buying German department stores Kaufhof and Karstadt and merging them into Europe's second biggest department store chain.
Benko said he was upbeat about the prospects for city center real estate despite ecommerce players taking sales from bricks-and-mortar stores, because people still come downtown to eat, work and enjoy cultural offerings, as well as shop.
""We are optimistic that inner cities will flourish in the next few years,"" he said, adding he was no longer investing in shopping malls to focus instead on inner cities.
Signa is working hard to improve the online offering of Kaufhof and Karstadt, Benko said, noting that only a small proportion of the 1.7 million articles on sale in store were currently available online.
About 1 billion euros of Signa's 7.5 billion in retail revenues come from ecommerce and Benko wants to grow that, particularly if stores and websites work better together, for example allowing goods to be shipped from stores to home.
However, he expects ecommerce to face increasing hurdles as cities push back against the congestion caused by delivery vans and as concerns mount about the environmental impact of packaging and returns of unwanted goods ordered online.
""If the volume of online trade keeps doubling there is a natural barrier,"" he said."

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Monday said it would commit $2.5 billion to easing a housing shortage that has driven up prices across California, with most of the money dedicated to funds that will be run either with or by the state government.
One billion dollars will go to a jointly run fund with state officials aimed at jumpstarting delayed or stalled affordable housing projects. Another $1 billion will go to a state-run fund to provide first-time home buyer financial assistance to teachers, nurses and first responders such as police and firefighters, among others.
In an interview with Reuters, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company felt a ""profound responsibility"" to improve California's housing crisis. Apple's current headquarters - a ring of gleaming metal and glass nicknamed the ""spaceship"" in Cupertino, California - sits less than five miles from the suburban family home where co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak assembled the first Apple computers in the 1970s.
""We want to make sure that it is a vibrant place where people can live and also raise a family,"" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview. ""And there's no question that today that isn't possible for many people, that the region suffers from an affordability crisis that is existential.""
The move comes after  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc-owned Google both committed $1 billion toward California housing initiatives while  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) committed $500 million in the Seattle, Washington area.
Apple said the project-financing fund was the first of its kind. Real estate developers often secure bonds for affordable housing development but must service the debt during construction until the houses are built and start to generate revenue. Apple and state officials hope to provide bridge financing during construction at rates below those from commercial lenders. 
Apple said the funding could take two years to deploy but that it hopes to recycle the funding for future projects over five years.
“This unparalleled financial commitment to affordable housing, and the innovative strategies at the heart of this initiative, are proof that Apple is serious about solving this issue,"" California Governor Gavin Newsom said in a statement.
The $2 billion in funding will be deployable across California, while the remaining $500 million will go toward efforts specific to Apple's home region in Northern California, where fast-growing tech companies have drawn protests from residents who blame them for rising housing costs. 
Apple will make available about 42 acres of land in northern San Jose, California valued at $300 million on which it hopes nearly 3,800 affordable housing units can be built. It will also donate $150 million to a Bay Area affordable housing fund and $50 million to Destination: Home, a public-private group addressing homelessness in Silicon Valley, home to some of the world's most valuable public companies.

(Reuters) - Takeaway.com (AS:TKWY) has changed its line of attack in the battle to buy food delivery ordering service  Just Eat  (L:JE), effectively lowering the threshold for approval of its offer to fend off rival suitor  Prosus  (AS:PRX).
Just Eat had previously agreed on the terms of a 4.7 billion pound all-share deal that prompted internet giant Prosus to weigh in with an unsolicited cash offer of $6.3 billion, or 710 pence per share, setting an increasingly fractious contest in motion. 
A merger of Takeaway and Just Eat would create one of the biggest food delivery groups outside China, rivaling Uber Eats (N:UBER), with market leadership in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada. 
At Takeaway's current share price of 72.45 euros, its offer is valued at 607 pence per share, equating to roughly $5.3 billion.
Takeaway announced on Monday that it had changed the structure of its takeover attempt from a scheme of arrangement that needed 75% approval by both sets of shareholders to a formal offer that requires 75% of Just Eat shareholders to give the nod.
If the Takeover panel agrees, that could drop as low as 50% plus one share.
""With this switch, we provide additional deal certainty to the Just Eat shareholders,"" said Takeaway CEO Jitse Groen.
Just Eat's board unanimously recommended its shareholders accept the Takeaway offer.
Takeaway spokesman Joris Wilton said the new structure gives the company ""increased flexibility"" in the fight, including the possibility that the deal could be allowed to go through with a bare majority of 50%.
Shares in Just Eat rose 0.5% to 740 pence, significantly above the Prosus offer, indicating that investors expect a higher bid from one side or the other.
Wilton said Takeaway has no plans to raise its bid or add a cash component. Prosus could not immediately be reached for comment and Just Eat did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
The change also means that a planned Dec. 4 shareholder vote on the original agreement has been put on hold. Takeaway will instead launch a tender offer that is expected to expire before the end of the year, Wilton said.
""All eyes will be on whether Prosus increases its offer,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said. 
Takeaway and Just Eat share at least six investors, including Cat Rock, Refinitiv data shows. 
The takeover battle heated up last month after Cat Rock accused German rival Delivery Hero (DE:DHER), which is 22% owned by Prosus, of selling down its 13% stake in Takeaway to suppress the value of the shares and lower the attractiveness of Takeaway's offer.

547,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 06:11AM ET</span>",How Brazil's SoftBank-backed Banco Inter aims to supercharge loan growth,"By Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's Banco Inter SA, a SoftBank-backed online lender that has seen rapid growth thanks to its free checking accounts, is preparing to launch a smartphone app offering food delivery and ride hailing, its chief executive told Reuters.
The bank has seen deposits skyrocket in recent years but remains a relative bit player in Latin America's largest economy.
It is hoping the app will lure more clients and encourage more of them to borrow, said João Vitor Menin, the scion of a prominent Brazilian real estate family who reinvented the traditional mortgage bank into a tech-heavy lender five years ago.
The 25-year-old bank's push to launch an app that lets customers book movie tickets and hotels will test its belief that Brazilian consumers are hungry for a one-stop shop on their smartphones similar to ""super apps"" that have proliferated in Asia - including some also backed by SoftBank Group Corp.
""It is uncertain if super apps will prevail in Brazil, but it may speed up Inter's profitability,"" Tatiana Brandt, an analyst at research firm Eleven Financial said in an interview, adding she thinks that a lot of potential growth is already priced into the stock.
The lender, in which SoftBank bought a 14.9% stake earlier this year for roughly 1.5 billion reais ($370 million), represents the Japanese conglomerate's second-largest Latin America bet and its sole publicly traded business in the region after Colombian delivery app Rappi.
Its shares surged as much as 75% in the weeks following SoftBank's initial investment in July. But since then they have trimmed those gains by about two-thirds.
Although Banco Inter has just 6.8 billion reais ($1.67 billion) in assets, its free checking accounts - a relative novelty in a country where most bank accounts incur substantial fees - had lured 3.3 million clients by the end of September.
That is roughly three times the level a year earlier and makes Banco Inter Brazil's largest digital lender.
Although Banco Inter is one of the few financial startups that manages to turn a profit, it still makes money the old-fashioned way, by extending loans to consumers as opposed to offering financial innovations distinct from traditional banks.
CASH BACK
The bank is hoping to grow its loan book further by getting more of its depositors to borrow, Menin said. The bank estimates it had a 2% market share in the country's number of clients, while its market share in loans was 0.2% in June.
A partnership with a card processing firm to be forged in January is also likely to bring as clients small enterprises, he said.
Once the new app is launched later this month, Banco Inter also expects to widen an existing cash back program to lure more customers under which it shares commissions from third party vendors such as supermarket chain  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) Brasil.
Bank clients in Brazil are mostly focused on getting access to credit, said Banco BTG Pactual analyst Thiago Kapulskis, but he said the new app could provide a fresh revenue stream.
""Brazil has a large number of mobile phones, but many devices have low memory,"" he said. ""So a super app may make sense, as people may seek only one-app-for-all-things.""
Others argue that Banco Inter shares, valued at 6.2 times its book value, are already priced for perfection. By comparison, Itau Unibanco Holding SA, Brazil's largest private-sector lender with 1.69 trillion reais in total assets, trades at 2.7 times its book value.
""While client growth has been impressive, the company's ability to monetize clients is not evident,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Jorge Kuri said in a note, commenting on the bank's second-quarter results. ""Expenses are still growing significantly faster than revenues.""
The app's multifunctional nature recalls that of several Asian startups including India's top digital payments firm Paytm, whose executives have sat down at least once in a meeting with Banco Inter brokered by SoftBank, their common investor.
Menin expressed optimism about consumer acceptance given what he described as Brazilians' fondness for new technologies. But it remains unclear whether super apps will catch on as widely in the Americas as they have in Asia, where many people gravitate to a single app to deal with everyday tasks from messaging to social media to shopping.
Many such platforms, like Tencent's Wechat and Alibaba-backed Alipay, have emerged as challengers to traditional banks by providing financial services.
The app launch means that - at least in Brazil - Banco Inter will be taking on delivery app Rappi, SoftBank's largest investment in Latin America, which is already offers a range of services including rudimentary banking."

Ebury is a trade and foreign exchange facilitator for small and medium-sized companies which operates in 19 countries and 140 currencies, Santander said in a statement.
Santander said it is acquiring 50.1% of Ebury for 350 million pounds, of which 70 million will be new primary equity to support Ebury's plans to enter new markets in Latin America and Asia.
The bank said it expects a return on invested capital (RoIC) higher than 25% in 2024.
""Small and medium-sized businesses are a major engine of growth around the world, creating new jobs and contributing up to 60% of total employment and up to 40% of national GDP in emerging economies,"" said Santander executive chairman Ana Botin.
Like banks across Europe, Spanish lenders have turned to more profitable enterprise lending in a bid to lift earnings as low interest rates squeeze financial margins.
Santander is also focusing on emerging economies while cutting costs to counter squeezed margins from ultra-low interest rates in mature European markets.
Santander said Ebury's existing investors, including co-founders and management, would reinvest in the transaction and the current management team will remain.
Ebury has generated average annual revenue growth of 40% in the last three years, Santander said in its statement."

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) expects further delay to its Boeing (NYSE:BA) MAX 737 deliveries and may still be without the jets next summer, it said on Monday after half-year results that gave the Irish airline's shares a 7% uplift.
While investors appeared to focus on the better than expected profit and fares, Europe's largest budget carrier said it now expects to fly 157 million passengers in the year to March 31, 2021. 
That represents only 2.6% growth from the current financial year, its slowest in seven years. And further delays on the jets could reduce that to zero growth at an airline that has increased passenger numbers by more than 10% on average since 2014. 
However, finance chief Neil Sorahan said there is ""no risk at all"" that the airline would fail to meet its target of flying 200 million passengers a year by March 2024. 
Ryanair is one of Boeing's biggest customers for the grounded MAX 737, with 210 on order, and said in July that it expected to be flying 30 of the planes next summer after taking its first delivery in January. 
CEO Michael O'Leary on Monday said the company had lowered its estimate to 20 planes by next summer with ""a real risk of none"". 
""The risk of further delay is rising,"" he said in a post-results video presentation, adding that he does not expect Boeing to achieve its target of getting the plane back in service in the United States by Christmas. 
U.S. carriers do not expect to fly the MAX until 2020, schedules show, as they wait for regulators to end the worldwide grounding that followed two deadly crashes.
AVERAGE FARES
Ryanair faces longer delays because it has to wait for approval by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and specific certification for Ryanair's MAX200 model, each of which are likely to cause several weeks of delay. 
The airline reported post-tax profit of 1.15 billion euros ($1.3 billion) for the six months to Sept. 30, its most profitable part of the year, beating a consensus forecast of 1.08 billion euros in a company supplied poll of analysts.
Falls in average fares were less than feared and revenue for optional extras surged 28% after the introduction of a charge to bring a 10kg piece of hand luggage on flights. 
It now expects full-year profit of between 800 million and 900 million euros, versus a previous forecast of 750-950 million euros and a consensus analyst estimate of 836 million euros.
That would represent a continued decline from last financial year's 1.02 billion euro profit, which was down from 1.45 billion euros the year before that.
Ryanair said it expects modest growth in average fares this winter, with strong sales of optional extras to raise full-year revenue per passenger by 2-3%. 
It also warned of higher than expected losses at its Austrian subsidiary Laudamotion because of overcapacity in Austria and Germany.

""Q2 was ahead of consensus, with average fares not as bad as feared,"" Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said in a note, adding that the balance of risks to next year ""is modestly on the downside given further MAX delivery delays.""

MUMBAI (Reuters) - A combination of further easing by global central banks, a temporary truce in the Sino-U.S. trade war and under-ownership of emerging markets make equities more attractive than bonds, Mirae Asset Global Investments' chief investment officer for emerging markets said.
""Going into 2020, I would be cautiously optimistic,"" Hong Kong-based Rahul Chadha told the Reuters 2019 Investment Outlook Summit.
""We are advising clients to increase equity allocations as global bond valuations are not favorable from a risk-reward perspective.""
In a chat with the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Monday, Chadha said Mirae, which manages $120 billion in assets, of which 20% are invested in stocks, broadly favors markets in India and Vietnam.
Chadha, who manages the firm's emerging market funds, said he liked select sectors in China, South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines. Within those markets, Chadha picked semiconductor stocks in Korea, and banks and consumer companies in Indonesia and the Philippines.
Chadha has also been investing in sectors such as financials, insurance and real estate in India, increasing investment in cyclical stocks such as banks and cement firms, and selectively booking gains in expensive consumer staples companies.
""Longer term, we are positive on the real estate sector,"" he said, while explaining that after India's Real Estate Regulatory Authority was set up in 2016 to manage a largely unsupervised sector, the stronger market players had gained share.
""Affordability is the best in the last 20 years for both residential and office space,"" Chadha said.
Chadha also sees fiscal maneuverability as the biggest challenge for most emerging market economies, but said the recent tax cuts in India and Indonesia were positive.
""Tax cuts will rekindle a positive investment climate and attract businesses as they look for an alternate manufacturing base from China in light of the trade war,"" he said.

Saudi Arabia is pulling out all the stops to ensure the success of Aramco’s initial public offering after Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman finally decided to offer shares in the world’s largest oil producer.
The kingdom cut taxes on the company for a third time, revealed incentives for investors not to sell and is considering boosting dividends further. Yet the Saudi government has already conceded the company probably isn’t worth the $2 trillion valuation Prince Mohammed has long advocated.
More than three years after the IPO was first mooted, Aramco published a so-called intention to float on Sunday, the most dramatic change to the Saudi oil industry since the company was nationalized in the 1970s. The IPO is a cornerstone of Prince Mohammed’s Vision 2030 plan to make the Saudi economy ready for the post-oil era.
Saudi Arabia is aiming for a valuation of between $1.6 trillion and $1.8 trillion, according to people familiar with the matter. Analysts at banks working on the deal offered wildly diverging estimates:  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). told investors Aramco is worth between $1.6 trillion and $2.3 trillion. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., another top bank on the deal, had the bottom of its range at just $1.2 trillion.  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) gave an estimate of $1.42 trillion.
With Aramco employing more than 20 banks on its IPO, investors have few options for truly independent research. Still, a few outfits have started publishing their estimates. Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., for example, said fair value is between $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion, well below what the banks working on the IPO have projected.
“This is the right time for us,” Chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan said at a news conference at Aramco’s headquarters in the eastern city of Dhahran on Sunday.
Aramco’s net income last year of $111 billion made it the most profitable of any corporation -- more than Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Google’s parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). combined -- but the company has pledged to pay a minimum of $75 billion in dividends, leaving it vulnerable to a downturn in oil prices.
Most of the banks valuations are based on oil prices staying above $60 a barrel and assume Aramco will be able to raise oil production by 2021. Almost every bank assumes Aramco will need to take debt this year and next year to cover spending and dividend payments. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. published a 118-page report without offering a valuation, but called Aramco the first “mega-major” oil company. UBS Group AG also didn’t give a valuation in its report.
To boost investor appetite, Aramco said it will pay an income tax rate of 20% on its domestic downstream business starting next year, compared with current levies of between 50% to 80%.
In addition to already announced changes in royalty payments, the government has also exempted condensate -- a light oil produced in conjunction with natural gas -- from the tax until 2033. Those measures would have boosted free cash flow by $4.5 billion in the first six months of this year, the company said in the intention to float document.
Saudi retail investors will be eligible to receive one share for every 10 allotted shares if they continuously hold the shares for 180 days from the first date of trading and listing, Aramco said.
Aramco earned net income of $68 billion and generated $244 billion in revenue and income related to sales in the first nine months of the year, it said in a statement. It expects capital expenditure of $35 billion to $40 billion next year, rising to $40 billion to $45 billion in 2021.
Global banks have hotly contested a role in the deal. More than 20 have been mandated, with the top roles going to firms including  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. To get the deal done, bankers will need hefty contributions from the kingdom’s richest families, many of whom may have been targeted during a declared corruption crackdown in 2017 when scores of wealthy Saudis were held in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton Hotel.
Aramco must also contend with the strengthening global movement against climate change that’s targeted the world’s largest oil and gas companies. Many fund managers are concerned that the shift away from the internal combustion engine -- a technology that drove a century of steadily rising demand -- means consumption of oil will peak in the next two decades.
Investors will also have to weigh up how to factor in heightened geopolitical risks after attacks in September on Aramco’s crude-processing facilities knocked out half of its production. The company said it quickly restored output and never missed any customer orders, but the incident highlighted its vulnerability to regional military threats.

554,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 05:19AM ET</span>",Trade deal hopes boost stocks as recession fears recede,"By Tom Wilson
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares touched a 21-month high on Monday on signs that the United States and China could soon put an end to a damaging trade war as well as indications that the world may yet dodge an economic recession.
Beijing and Washington spoke on Friday of progress in talks aimed at settling a trade dispute that has bruised the global economy and repeatedly shaken financial markets, with U.S. officials saying a deal could be signed this month.
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, climbed 0.2% to its highest since February 2018, with major European indexes following Asia upwards.
The broader Euro STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.6%, with Frankfurt's main index (GDAXI), seen as highly exposed to the trade war, climbing 0.8% to reach its highest since June last year. Wall Street futures (ESc1) gained 0.4%. 
The optimistic tone reached currency markets, too, as the Chinese yuan  rose to a 12-week high versus the dollar.
Investors expect the world's two biggest economies to reach a ""phase one"" trade deal, with U.S. President Donald Trump hoping to sign an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
The key date in focus is Dec. 15, when new U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports from toys to electronics are due to kick in.
Both sides have an interest in averting those tariffs, with Trump in particular seen as aiming to reap political benefits from sealing a deal ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
""It will be a convenient decision for President Trump to let phase one be signed,"" said Alessia Berardi, senior economist at Amundi. ""This is a kind of low-hanging fruit to collect and is very much possible."" 
Still, Berardi warned that intellectual property would be a thornier issue and could yet complicate talks next year.
Earlier, the positive mood on trade had sent Asian stocks surging, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) up 1.2%. 
Indexes in Hong Kong (HSI) and Seoul (KS11) gained 1.7% and 1.$% respectively, while mainland Chinese blue chips (CSI300) added 0.7%.
Also emboldening investors was a sense that a global recession, predicted by many economists and investors to hit next year, was a diminishing risk.
On Friday, a better-than-expected U.S. jobs report added to signs of economic resilience. Job growth slowed less than expected in October, with hiring in the two months before that better than previously estimated.
""The macro environment is still resilient, stabilized and maybe even showing signs of improvement - and that is a net positive for risky assets,"" said Olivier Marciot, senior portfolio manager at Unigestion.
Bond markets, too, suggested that the United States may have dodged a slowdown. The three-month to 10-year Treasury yield curve - a key warning sign of U.S. recession when inverted - is rising again after staying in negative territory for long periods since May.
And on the earnings front, U.S. results are for the third straight quarter defying expectations for an annual aggregate contraction.
""Expectations were low going into earnings, and things are getting better than expected,"" Marciot said.

WAITING FOR LAGARDE
As the Chinese yuan strengthened, the euro trod water. Investors were waiting for Christine Lagarde's first speech as European Central Bank president.
Markets are assuming that Lagarde, due to talk at 1800 GMT, will stick with the easy policy script of her predecessor, Mario Draghi.
Lagarde has struck a balanced tone in recent comments, saying an accommodative monetary policy was needed but also had side effects that needed monitoring.
The euro (EUR=EBS) was last flat at $1.1165, close to the $1.1180 high reached last month. The dollar against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) was flat at 97.222. 

In commodities, oil prices slipped as investors locked in profits ahead of European and U.S. manufacturing data. Brent crude futures (LCOc1) fell 2 cents to $61.67 a barrel shortly after 0930 GMT.

555,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 04:52AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Europe Hits 22-Month High on Auto Trade Hopes; Ryanair Soars,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Europe’s benchmark stock index hit its highest since August last year Monday, lifted by hopes that the U.S. will back down from its threats to levy import tariffs on European cars.
Comments in a series of interviews from U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross over the weekend suggested that President Donald Trump’s administration was having second thoughts about saddling U.S. consumers with yet more import tariffs less than a year before he seeks re-election.
In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Ross, who has previously taken a hard line in reducing the U.S.’s deficit in autos, referred to “very good conversations with our European friends, our Japanese friends, our Korean friends, and those are the major auto-producing sectors.”
""Our hope is that the negotiations we've been having ... will bear enough fruit that it may not be necessary to put the 232 [Section 232 of a 1962 trade law] fully into effect, may not even be necessary to put it partly in effect.""
The comments were enough to send the German DAX and the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 to their highest levels since January 2018. The Stoxx was up 0.7% at 402.00 by 4:45 AM ET (0930 GMT), while the DAX was up 0.9% at 13,080.19.
The DAX was led by auto components group Continental (DE:CONG) and by   Daimler   (DE:DAIGn), the parent of Mercedes-Benz. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW also rose more than 2%, while   Covestro AG   (DE:1COV), a materials group which sells largely to the auto sector, was up 1.7% and non-DAX steelmaker Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) was up 3.8%.
Other auto names were also strong,   Peugeot   (PA:PEUP) rising 4.3% and   Fiat   Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) rising 3.4%. Truckmaker Traton (DE:8TRA), spun off earlier this year from Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), lagged after posting a gloomy outlook for 2020.
Elsewhere, shares in ‘no-frills’ airline Ryanair (LON:RYA) soared after a half-year update that was padded nicely by…frills. The group said extras such as seat selection and priority boarding meant that revenue grew in line with passenger traffic (up 11% on the year), despite a drop in basic fares. “Ancillary revenue” (the stuff traditional airlines never charged you for in the first place) rose 28% on the year, helping overall profit to come in comfortably ahead of analysts' forecasts at 1.15 billion euros ($1.29 billion).
Ryanair also warned the delayed arrival of its Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX airplanes meant it would not be able to deliver promised unit cost savings until fiscal 2021. Ryanair is set to be one of the biggest European buyers of the 737 MAX, which burn 16% less fuel while carrying more passengers. However, it now expects to receive only 20 MAX-200s (previously 58) in time for the 2020 summer season. As a result, Ryanair cut its forecast for passenger growth in the year through March 2021 to 3% from 7%."
556,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 04:51AM ET</span>",China markets feel the pain of stalled derivatives rollout,"By Samuel Shen and Alun John
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - A long list of stock and currency derivatives has been lying in wait for regulatory approval at the China Financial Futures Exchange (CFFEX), some for nearly a decade.
The exchange is hoping foreign asset managers will help vouch for these products and smooth the way forward for their eventual launch.
""You need to tell the public that not every fund manager coming to China is George Soros, that you use derivatives to manage long positions, not to short China,"" the exchange's vice president Zhang Xiaogang told a seminar in Shanghai.
Zhang told his audience of mostly China-based executives of global money managers to speak up for the benefits of derivatives in investments, as ""bad public perception makes it difficult for new products to be approved"".
Options, futures and other derivatives are in disrepute in China, particularly since 2015 when speculation in stock index futures was blamed for the violent market crash.
Billionaire investor George Soros, for example, is well-known in China for his attack on the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the U.S. currency during the Asian financial crisis, and often the face of the deep distrust.
Unlike many other countries, China manages a highly centralized approval process for financial derivative launches, which explains why many products are stranded at CFFEX.
Delays in approvals are costing China. A dearth of tools for managing risk has become a major source of concern for global investors, even affecting the country's inclusion in global indexes managed by the likes of MSCI and FTSE Russell.
It hinders Beijing's efforts to attract foreign portfolio investment at a time when its long-running trade war with the United States has sapped export revenues.
Shanghai is losing market share in derivatives to other financial centers such as Singapore and Hong Kong, where rival exchanges that are subject to less government interference are rushing in with China-related products.
Liu Wencai, a former CFFEX official who helped design China's index futures, seeks reform in the way exchange products are vetted for approval.
""As foreign money rapidly flows into China's capital markets, our exchanges need to accelerate the rollout of financial futures and options,"" said Liu, who founded risk-management consultancy D-Union after quitting CFFEX in 2015, when index futures were nearly killed by regulators.
Liu feels index futures were made the scapegoat in a politically-charged blame game during that crisis, and suggests the decision to launch new products be left to exchanges, rather than the securities regulator and the State Council.
China's securities regulator and CFFEX did not return emailed requests for comment.
BADLY NEEDED
At present, only six financial products - three stock index futures contracts and three bond futures contracts - trade on the 13-year-old CFFEX.
The list of products CFFEX has developed include futures based on the MSCI China A-share index and small-cap indexes such as ChiNext, sources with knowledge of the situation told Reuters.
Also being tested are 30-year bond futures, short-term interest rate futures and forex derivatives including dollar-yuan futures.
Foreign investors say they desperately need such tools to manage China risks.   
MSCI, which added Chinese A shares into its emerging markets benchmark in 2018, decided in March to quadruple China's inclusion factor to 20% - a process that will be completed later this month.
But any proposal by MSCI (N:MSCI) to increase that ratio further may be denounced by global investors who fret over the lack of efficient hedging tools in China, said Wei Zhen, head of China Research at MSCI, who predicted huge appetite for MSCI China A index futures.
The limited access to derivatives also contributed to FTSE Russell deciding not to add China to its widely-tracked government bond index in September.
""If I want to be able to trade interest rates and manage my exposure, I need to be able to trade China government bond futures,"" said David Campbell, head of fixed income at lobby group ASIFMA. ""And right now, that's not available to the vast majority of foreign investors investing in China.""
While efforts to launch derivatives stall on the Chinese mainland, overseas exchanges are competing to offer derivative products to fill the vacuum.
The Singapore Exchange (SGX) (SI:SGXL) is aggressively promoting an ""all-China envelope"" of risk management tools that include MSCI China futures, USD/CNH futures and iron ore futures and options.
Greater participation outside Asia pushed trading volumes in SGX's listed yuan futures to record highs this year.
The Hong Kong stock exchange (HK:0388) has also seen rapid growth in yuan futures trading and is planning new products, including MSCI China A-share index futures.
""This is the number one product that people want in the world right now,"" said Alex Siu, co-head of equities product development at HKEX. ""China is not fully open yet. That's the power of Hong Kong."""

(Reuters) - European shares touched their highest level in nearly two years on Monday on hopes that a U.S.-China trade deal could be in the offing, while a strong earnings report by Ryanair lifted Irish stocks to a one-year high.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.5% to its highest since January 2018.
The benchmark index is inching close to a record high hit in April 2015, after ending Friday with its fourth straight weekly gain as upbeat U.S. jobs numbers and a bounce in Chinese manufacturing tempered concerns over slowing economic growth.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Sunday licenses for U.S. companies to sell components to China's Huawei Technologies Co will come ""very shortly"", adding there was no reason a trade deal could not be on track to be signed this month.
""The question now is how much markets are pricing in a deal between the United States and China and I would say there is a 50% chance that they will get it done,"" said Teeuwe Mevissen, senior market economist at Rabobank.
Tariff-exposed European miners (SXPP) gained 1.9%.
Auto stocks (SXAP) rose 3%, logging the biggest gain among the market's main sub-sectors. The rally was also led by reports that  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and  Peugeot  owner PSA (PA:PEUP) aimed to sign a final merger agreement as early as next month.
Germany's BMW (DE:BMWG), the biggest U.S. automotive exporter by value, rose 2.2%. The company had warned last month that an intensifying global trade war could threaten jobs at its South Carolina plant, which exports about 70% of its production.
Trade-sensitive Frankfurt shares (GDAXI) rose 0.8%.
Siemens Healthineers (DE:SHLG) jumped 5.5% to a record high after it said it expected strong growth to continue next year following a better-than-expected fourth quarter.
Expectations had been low for third-quarter earnings from European companies, and most firms have surpassed estimates four weeks into the reporting season.
Ryanair (I:RYA) rose 6.5% to a one-year high after the budget carrier beat first-half profit expectations. Its shares helped Irish stocks (ISEQ) jump 1.5%, the most among regional indexes.
Dutch oil and chemicals storage company  Vopak  (AS:VOPA) fell 3.6% after it reported quarterly earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) slightly below consensus.
Meanwhile, investors shrugged off weak manufacturing data from major European regions, even as the factory activity in the bloc's powerhouse, Germany, remained in recession in October."
558,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 03:24AM ET</span>",Equity trading to only get bloodier in Europe after Macquarie exit,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Macquarie Group's (AX:MQG) sudden exit from European and U.S. equity trading may just be the start of a large-scale retreat from the once-thriving business, as all but the biggest global banks struggle to make it pay.
The cash equities business - servicing investors to buy and sell shares - is going through a shakeout as falling trade volumes and costly regulations bite.
The changes have led to razor-thin margins at best and made it difficult for smaller rivals to compete with the leading Wall Street powerhouses such as JPMorgan (N:JPM), Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS).
While margin pressure has been building globally over the last five years, Europe has been hit even harder by rules introduced in 2018 that unbundle trading from other broker services such as research and introductions to investors.
That reduced their ability to cross-subsidise different parts of the business, triggering a 50% fall in European cash equity revenues over this period, industry data tracker Coalition Development estimates. 
Over the same timescale, the headcount of those working in cash equities is down 20%, while the broader equity team headcount is down by 13.6%, the financial consultancy said.
""Revenues have declined sharply and headcount has not been cut (as much), so they're sitting on a very high cost base,"" Coalition's research director Amrit Shahani said. ""And that's really led to the operating margin pressure.""
FURTHER PRESSURE 
Crucially this year, cash equities, equity derivatives and prime brokerage (catering for hedge funds) businesses have all been in decline at the same time for the first time since 2015, leaving no place to hide.
That perfect storm means European revenues in equities trading fell around 15%-17% in the first half of the year from the same period a year earlier, Coalition data suggests, heaping further pressure on the many banks running at low or negative margins. 
In practice, this means only the top three banks in any given cash equities market, or the top five when adding in prime brokerage and derivatives, have the scale to weather the tough conditions, thereby scooping up an even greater market share.
A growing preference for passive investing has also been hurting these players. Jefferies recently said exchange-traded funds and other indexed products soared from less than $700 billion pre-2008 to more than $5 trillion in 2018.
This shift, along with the negative or low interest environment and post-2008 regulatory changes, have sharply hit profits and put pressure on boards and senior management of small- and mid-sized banks to justify running their equity operations in other regions at zero or negative margins.
""You need to be hitting a good 15-20% operating margin consistently to have a healthy business. The large banks continue to undercut on pricing to pick up volume, so it leaves the smaller banks and brokers with little chance,"" Shahani said. 
The top-five U.S. banks - also including  Citigroup  (N:C) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (N:BAC) - have pulled away from Europe's seven biggest rivals in cash equities over the last five years, with a market share of 59.1% in the first half of 2019, up from 46% in 2014.

EQUITIES EXIT
While Macquarie is not the first bank to flag plans to exit equities this year, or even the biggest -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) announced plans to exit in July - the move came as a surprise given that until recently it was hiring for its London office.
A Reuters search of networking site LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) for Macquarie staff based in London showed 38 employees whose job title showed a clear link to the company's equity team, such as sales, trading or finance, of whom 20 started in either 2018 or 2019.
The announcement also came just days before Macquarie released first-half results, showing record profits and a 15% jump in revenue in its Commodities and Global Markets business.
Macquarie could not see an opportunity to make a good value return on the time or the investment made in cash equity activities in North America and Europe, Chief Financial Officer Alex Harvey told Reuters. 
""So the decision was made to close down those businesses,"" Harvey added.
Macquarie is the second major Asia-Pacific bank after Japan's Nomura Holdings (T:8604) to cut jobs this year in its European trading business.
But while Macquarie's decision to throw in the towel on cash equities will result in 100 job cuts, it is keen to let clients know they were not being cut adrift - a cooperation deal with broker Kepler Cheuvreux has been announced.
The preliminary deal with Kepler will see the French company support Macquarie's European clients in European equity trading and research, with Kepler's Asian clients getting a similar service in return from Macquarie.
While partnering across regions to maintain a semblance of a global operational footprint is not new -  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) outsourced its Asian equity trading in 2016 for example - Macquarie's agreement is likely the first of a fresh wave of deals.
""It's (doing a partnership of some form) been talked about a lot over the last five years, but hasn't really happened that much,"" said Shahani. ""With this year's decline in revenues some of the strategies banks were trying to implement are likely to go forward."" 
ARMY OF AUTOMATONS
There have been twice as many job cuts in cash equities in the first half of this year compared with the average of culls over the past three years, according to Coalition data.
Interviews with current and ex-traders suggest many are willing to take pay cuts to continue working in the industry, while others are turning to the trendy fintech industry or setting up their own businesses.
""My old boss set up an online estate agency,"" Robert Austin, former director of equity derivatives sales and trading at a major French bank, said. 
Austin's role was made redundant last year.

""Banking is still more lucrative than the average job, but it's not as much fun, it's not as well paid as it once was,"" Austin added. ""And the individual with huge value-add has been replaced by an army of automatons who simply read from a hymn sheet of plagiarism.""

559,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 02:25AM ET</span>",Premarket London: IAG Buys Air Europa; Hiscox Warns of Storms Hit,"Investing.com -- Here is a roundup of regulatory news releases from the London Stock Exchange on Monday, 4th November. Please refresh for updates
British Airways' parent International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:ICAG) said it had agreed to buy Spanish long-haul specialist Air Europa for 1 billion euros ($1.11 billion) in cash, saying the deal ""re-establishes IAG as a leader in the highly attractive Europe to Latin America and Caribbean market.""
IAG (LON:ICAG) expects the deal to be earnings-accretive already in the first year after completion, which it expects in the second half of 2020
""Acquiring Air Europa would add a new competitive, cost effective airline to IAG (LON:ICAG), consolidating Madrid as a leading European hub and resulting in IAG achieving South Atlantic leadership, therefore generating additional financial value for our shareholders,"" CEO Willie Walsh said in a statement.
Air Europa has a network of 69 destinations, including European routes to Latin America, the United States of America, the Caribbean and North Africa. In 2018, it generated revenue of €2.1 billion and an operating profit of €100 million. It carried 11.8 million passengers in 2018 and ended the year with a fleet of 66 aircraft.

Insurer  Hiscox  (LON:HSX) announced a provision of $165 million to cover claims arising from Hurricane Dorian and Typhoons Faxai and Hagibis earlier this year and warned that there is still “significant” uncertainty over the final losses for the industry.
It also warned that fees and commissions will be around $25 million lower at year-end.
Additionally, Hiscox said it is exposed to the recent wildfires in California, but the scale of any potential loss is still unclear. The company still expects to post “a small positive reserve development” in aggregate for the year.
Gross written premiums grew 7.3% in the first nine months of the year, a slight uptick from a rate of 7% through the first half, and Hiscox said it expects 2020 to the third straight year of improving rates in the key London market.
Takeaway.com (AS:TKWY) rejigged its proposed merger with   Just Eat   (LON:JE), saying that it will now proceed as a recommended offer, rather than through the court-approved scheme of arrangement previously announced. 
The threshold for acceptances is 75% of all Just Eat shares, including at least 50% of its voting shares.
Just Eat said it continued to recommend the Takeaway offer over a rival all-cash bid of 710 pence per share from   Prosus   (AS:PRX). Takeaway.com’s all-share offer valued the company at 731 pence per share.

Gaming group GVC Holdings (LON:GVC) confirmed it has appointed Barry Gibson to succeed the controversial Lee Feldman as non-executive chairman.
Currently chairman of HomeServe, Gibson was formerly a Non-Executive Director of William Hill and bwin.party digital entertainment, where he was the Senior Independent Director.

Marston’s (LON:MARS) said it has agreed to sell 137 pubs for £44.9 million to Admiral Taverns as part of its plans to reduce its net debt by 200 million pounds ($259 million). The deal is expected to complete before by 2023, a target it repeated on Monday.
The deal is expected to be completed by the end of November. 
The pubs being disposed of contributed EBITDA of £4.8 million and operating profit of £3.7 million for the year to 28 September 2019. They have a book value of £62.6 million. The disposal will result in average profit per pub in the retained estate increasing by around 7% and return on capital improving by 0.2% post the transaction.

563,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2019 08:31PM ET</span>",McDonald's ousts CEO over consensual relationship with employee,"By Mike Spector
(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp dismissed Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook over a recent consensual relationship with an employee, which the board determined violated company policy, the fast-food giant said on Sunday.
The board found that Easterbrook, 52, who had led McDonald's since 2015, had ""demonstrated poor judgment"" involving the relationship, McDonald's said in a news release. Easterbrook relinquished his seat on the company's board as well.
""This was a mistake,"" Easterbrook said of the relationship in an email to employees on Sunday released by the company. ""Given the values of the company, I agree with the board that it is time for me to move on.""
His departure was among the most significant in corporate America in the past several years over relationships deemed inappropriate.
Scrutiny of executives and their treatment of employees has intensified amid the #MeToo social media movement, which highlighted instances of sexual harassment in the workplace. In June 2018,  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich resigned after an investigation found he had a consensual relationship with an employee that breached company policy.
Chris Kempczinski, 51, most recently president of McDonald's USA, was named the company's new CEO, effective immediately. He also joined the McDonald's board.
In his own message to employees, Kempczinski thanked Easterbrook for recruiting him to McDonald's and said he expected the company to continue its customer-focused growth plan. McDonald's Chairman Enrique Hernandez Jr. called Kempczinski ""instrumental"" in developing the company's strategic plan.
Chicago-based McDonald's, one of the world's most recognizable brands, recently celebrated the 40th anniversary of its Happy Meal for children and is known for its family-friendly reputation.
The company did not provide further details on the circumstances surrounding Easterbrook's departure. McDonald's is expected to disclose financial information related to Easterbrook's dismissal in a securities filing as soon as Monday, the company said.
The company named Joe Erlinger, who has been president of international operated markets, as president of McDonald's USA, succeeding Kempczinski.
""While clearly a loss, McDonald's maintains one of the deepest and longest-tenured management teams, which should help provide some stability through this unexpected transition,"" Raymond James analyst Brian Vaccaro said in a research note about Easterbrook's exit.
RIVALS CHALLENGE DOMINANCE
McDonald's shares roughly doubled during Easterbrook's tenure. But the chain in October missed Wall Street profit estimates for the first time in two years as it spent money remodeling U.S. restaurants and speeding up service to address declining customer visits.
Rival fast-food chains in the United States have challenged McDonald's dominance with value meals and new menu items, including plant-based burgers and meat substitutes launched by rivals including Restaurant Brands International Inc’s Burger King and Yum Brands Inc’s KFC. McDonald’s is seen late in reintroducing chicken sandwiches and rival Wendys Co has started serving breakfast.
The remodeling of the company's 14,000 U.S. restaurants includes introducing digital ordering kiosks, mobile ordering and pay-and-pickup services, while partnering with app-based delivery services GrubHub Inc, Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats and DoorDash.
Easterbrook turned around McDonald’s operations in the UK, where he was born, by refocusing on burgers and burnishing the brand with an ad campaign that sought to debunk unflattering rumors about its food.
A cricket enthusiast who earned a reputation among former UK colleagues for being funny, fair and a lover of simplicity, Easterbrook was also the rare McDonald’s CEO with experience running other restaurant chains.
HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS
Following the disclosure of Easterbrook's ouster, a labor movement advocating for a $15-an-hour minimum wage and union rights on behalf of fast-food workers, alleged McDonald's had failed to address a sexual harassment problem at the company.
""McDonald’s needs to sit down with worker-survivors and put them at the center of any solution,"" the group, the Fight for $15 and a Union, said in a statement. ""And the company needs to be completely transparent about Easterbrook's firing and any other executive departures related to these issues.”
McDonald's had no immediate comment on the group's statement.
McDonald's has faced allegations in the past year of condoning sexual harassment in the workplace and retaliating against employees who spoke up about it.
In September, scores of local government officials from 31 U.S. states pressured McDonald’s to do a better job of protecting workers from groping, obscene comments and other forms of sexual harassment, adding their voices to an employee-led campaign that has seen walkouts at several stores.
McDonald's pointed then to an August announcement of a new training program for safe workplaces supported by more than 2,000 franchisees. Kempczinski said at the time the company and franchisees ""have a responsibility to take action on this issue and are committed to promoting positive change."""

The Baltimore-based company confirmed that it is under investigation and is cooperating with the Justice Department and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It also defended its accounting practices and disclosures.
The Journal, citing unnamed sources, said in its report https://www.wsj.com/articles/under-armour-is-subject-of-federal-accounting-probe-11572819835?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1 that a criminal inquiry is being conducted by Justice Department prosecutors, who are also coordinating with civil investigators at the SEC.
In an emailed statement, an Under Armour spokesperson said, ""The company began responding in July 2017 to requests for documents and information relating primarily to its accounting practices and related disclosures, and the company firmly believes that its accounting practices and disclosures were appropriate.""
Last month, Under Armour said longtime Chief Executive Officer Kevin Plank was stepping down from the role next year, handing the reins of the company to operations head Patrik Frisk in an attempt to help battle brutal competition from  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) and Adidas AG (DE:ADSGn) in the United States.
The company, which is due to report third-quarter results on Monday, has been restructuring its operations as it struggles to stand out in the United States, its biggest market, where it has been introducing products to shore up market share.
In July, Under Armour cut its full-year revenue forecast and said it expected a slight decline in North America revenue for fiscal 2019 as demand at its stores and online faced pressure from relentless competition from bigger rivals."

566,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2019 06:02PM ET</span>","Saudi Aramco kick-starts what could be world's biggest IPO, offers scant details","By Rania El Gamal, Marwa Rashad, Saeed Azhar and Davide Barbuscia
DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's giant state oil company finally kick-started its initial public offering (IPO) on Sunday, announcing its intention to float on the domestic bourse in what could be the world's biggest listing as the kingdom seeks to diversify its economy away from oil.
But in its long-awaited announcement, Aramco, the world's most profitable company, offered few specifics on the number of shares to be sold, pricing or the date for a launch.
Bankers have told the Saudi government that investors will likely value the company at around $1.5 trillion, below the $2 trillion valuation touted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman when he first floated the idea of an IPO nearly four years ago.
Aramco also did not mention what measures it has taken to beef up security following unprecedented attacks on its oil plants in September.
Sources have told Reuters the oil company could offer 1%-2% of its shares on the local bourse, raising as much as $20 billion to $40 billion. A deal over $25 billion would top the record-breaking one of Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (N:BABA) in 2014.
""Today is the right opportunity for new investors to reap the benefits of Aramco's ability to achieve value, and boost it on the long-term,"" Aramco Chairman Yasir al-Rumayyan told a news conference at the company's headquarters in the eastern city of Dhahran.
The company will spend the next 10 days talking to investors and sounding out their interest and the price range will follow, he said.
The IPO is designed to turbocharge Prince Mohammed's ambitious economic reform agenda by raising billions to build non-energy industries and diversify revenue streams.
Rumayyan said a decision on an international listing for Aramco shares will be made in the future, without giving a time frame or possible venue.
""Selling a small piece of Aramco in a captive market gives the KSA (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) more control to prop the value of Aramco up over its fair value,"" said Gary Ross, CEO at Black Gold Investors.
Confirmation of the sale of shares in the oil giant, whose formal name is Saudi Arabian Oil Co, comes about seven weeks after the crippling attacks on its oil facilities, underlining Saudi Arabia's determination to push on with the listing regardless. 
Aramco said it does not expect the Sept. 14 attacks, which targeted plants at the heart of Saudi Arabia's oil industry and initially halved its production, would have a material impact on its business, operations and financial condition.
Aramco accounted for about one in every eight barrels of crude oil produced globally from 2016 to 2018, it said on Sunday.
Its net income for the third quarter of 2019 amounted to $21.1 billion, according to Reuters calculations, dwarfing the income for the same period of oil giants such as  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), which was just over $3 billion. 
Chief Executive Amin Nasser said at the news conference that Aramco plans to release the prospectus on Nov. 9.
To help get the deal done, Saudi Arabia is relying on easy credit for retail investors and hefty contributions from rich locals.
""Whatever this local round achieves, with domestic players being strong armed into investing, international investors are still going to value this well below the expectations of (Crown Prince) Mohammed bin Salman,"" said Rory Fyfe, managing director at Mena Advisors.
LURING INVESTORS
The Saudi stock market fell 2% on Sunday after the announcement. The benchmark index (TASI) is down nearly a fifth since May as local institutions sold shares to prepare for the Aramco deal, fund managers and analysts say.
Salah Shamma, head of investment, MENA, at Franklin Templeton Emerging Markets Equity, said some local investors could be selling other shares in order to shift investments to Aramco, but this could well be a case of ""short-term pain for long-term gain.""
To comfort investors, Aramco said on Sunday the state will forgo its right to receive a portion of cash dividends on shares, giving priority to new shareholders.
Aramco is also cutting royalties it pays to the state. Effective Jan. 1, 2020, it will adopt a progressive royalty scheme, with a marginal rate set at 15% up to $70 per barrel, 45% between $70 and $100, and 80% if the price rises higher.
The firm said the Saudi market regulator, which approved the application to list on Sunday, issued an exemption for non-resident institutional foreign investors to subscribe.
Saudi investors would be eligible to receive bonus shares - a maximum of 100 bonus shares for every 10 allotted shares.
At a valuation of $1.5 trillion, Aramco would still be worth at least 50% more than the world's most valuable listed companies,  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL), which each have a market capitalisation of about $1 trillion.
But a 1% sale would raise ""only"" around $15 billion for Saudi coffers, ranking Aramco as the 11th biggest IPO of all time, Refinitiv data show. (For a graphic on the top 10 largest global IPOs, see https://tmsnrt.rs/33gWypM)
""Some perspective on the Aramco IPO for the overall Saudi diversification story is needed: the likely Aramco IPO proceeds will be less than the Aramco dividends the government received in the first half of 2019 alone,"" said Hasnain Malik, head of equity strategy at Tellimer.
(GRAPHIC: Aramco vs. Oil Majors 9-month earnings: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/7184/7166/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
THE 'RIGHT TIME'
The promised listing has had Wall Street on tenterhooks since Prince Mohammed flagged it in 2016.
Aramco mandated 27 banks to work on the deal including  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), HSBC, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
""I think this is the right time for us to take Aramco to be a public company ... we wanna go IPO and we wanna go now,"" Rumayyan told reporters on Sunday when asked about the timing.
Initial hopes for a blockbuster international listing of about 5% were dashed when the share sale was halted last year amid debate over where to list Aramco overseas.
Aramco said the IPO timetable was delayed because it began a process to acquire a 70% stake in petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SE:2010).
Prince Mohammed also came under intense international criticism last year for the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul by Saudi operatives, a murder for which the crown prince has said he bears responsibility ""because it happened under my watch.""
The death tarnished the image of the kingdom's de facto ruler and imperiled his plans to diversify the economy. Republican and Democratic lawmakers, also citing the civilian toll from a Saudi air campaign in Yemen, have ramped up efforts to block U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia.
IPO preparations were revived this summer after Aramco attracted huge interest in its first international bond sale, seen as a pre-IPO relationship-building exercise with investors.
But a listing announcement expected on Oct. 20 was delayed after advisers said they needed more time to lock in cornerstone investors, three sources told Reuters.
A growing movement to fight climate change and embrace new ""green"" technologies have put some fund managers, particularly in Europe and the United States, off the oil and gas sector.
The bond sale in April forced the secretive company to reveal its finances for the first time, including net income of $111 billion -- more than a third bigger than the combined net income of the five super oil majors. Those companies have been raising payouts to shareholders to counter rising pressure from climate activism.
Aramco said on Sunday it intended to declare aggregate ordinary cash dividends of at least $75 billion in 2020.
At a valuation of $1.5 trillion, this would mean a dividend yield of 5%, below that offered by rival Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa). Shell's dividend yield is over 6%, according to Refinitiv data.

569,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2019 09:06AM ET</span>",Wall Street's leading stocks reveal investor caution,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks have climbed to record highs as worries over U.S.-China trade relations and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy have receded, but cautious investors have been sticking with technology shares and some defensive stocks over value stocks and more speculative plays such as IPOs.
That's unlikely to change in the near term even if stocks keep rising, strategists say, as uncertain economic conditions lead investors to shares of companies with solid earnings and growth prospects.
As concerns over a slowdown in global economic growth have loomed, technology shares and defensive shares in the real estate, utilities and consumer staples sectors have alternated in leading U.S. stocks higher. Technology companies are considered capable of earnings growth even if the economy falls into a recession, while defensive shares offer steady dividends.
The S&P 500 (SPX) has gained 22% this year in large part because of the 36% gain in technology shares (SPLRCT), which have an outsized impact on the benchmark index. The S&P 500 tech sector includes the two largest U.S. companies by market capitalization, Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT).
Apple shares have surged 62% year-to-date, Microsoft 41%. Overall, tech stocks account for roughly a third of the benchmark index's gains.
Real estate shares have risen 26%, the second-largest percentage gain among S&P sectors, but they have a miniscule weighting on the index.
Shares of less fundamentally sound companies, by contrast, have faltered. The small-cap Russell 2000 index (RUT), a third of whose constituents have no net income, has underperformed the S&P 500 in 2019. And shares of several companies that have gone public this year have fallen sharply since their debuts, including  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT),  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and  Slack Technologies Inc  (N:WORK).
Unprofitable U.S. companies holding IPOs this year have had a median stock return of 0%, according to a Reuters analysis.
Investors are ""not just going to buy anything indiscriminately,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise in Boston. ""We want to see some earnings or some prospects for earnings.""
Recently, trading patterns among the S&P 500 have begun to shift. Defensive shares underperformed in October as the United States and China appeared on the verge of signing a limited trade agreement and the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for a third time this year. At the same time, value shares, so named because of their relatively low price-to-earnings ratios, have perked up. Over the past two months, the Russell 1000 Value (RLV) index has outperformed the Russell 1000 Growth index (RLG).
The improved performance of value shares, concentrated in economically sensitive sectors such as financials, has prompted suggestions of a rotation in leadership among U.S. stocks. But even though conditions could support a breakout of such shares, some investors say they are reluctant to make bold bets until economic data confirms a rebound. On Friday, the Institute for Supply Management's U.S. manufacturing index showed factory activity contracting for a third straight month in October.
""We're not positioning ourselves for value to all of a sudden come back,"" said Mark Stoeckle, chief executive officer of Adams Funds in Baltimore. ""I'd rather have the data tell me it's time to be in value.""
Indeed, the S&P 500 technology index has made new highs in the past week and throughout the year, while the S&P 500 financial (SPSY) index remains below its 2018 peak.
""We're looking for signs that tech is going to roll over,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. ""At this point, it's too early to say that."""

(Reuters) - Airbnb Inc banned ""party houses"" on Saturday after five people were killed in a shooting at a large Halloween gathering inside a rental home in Northern California that was advertised on the online listing service.
Police were still searching for the shooter who opened fire on Thursday night at the costume party, which authorities say was attended by more than 100 people at the house in Orinda, less than 20 miles (30 km) east of San Francisco.
The death toll rose to five when a 19-year-old victim died of her wounds at a hospital, the Contra Costa Sheriff's Office said on late on Friday.
The party host rented the home through Airbnb and told its owner she was holding a reunion for only a dozen people, the San Francisco Chronicle reported citing the owner, Michael Wang.
""Starting today, we are banning 'party houses' and we are redoubling our efforts to combat unauthorized parties and get rid of abusive host and guest conduct, including conduct that leads to the terrible events we saw in Orinda,"" Airbnb co-founder and chief executive Brian Chesky said on Twitter.
The company was expanding manual screening of ""high-risk reservations"" flagged by its risk detection technology, and was creating a house party ""rapid response team,"" Chesky added, without elaborating. 
Valued at $31 billion in its most recent private fundraising round, Airbnb said in September that it planned to become a publicly listed company in 2020, making it one of the biggest names considering a stock market float next year.
Orinda police received noise complaints about the party at 9:19 p.m. and 10:25 p.m. local time, and at 10:48 p.m. an officer was dispatched to the address, the sheriff's office said in a statement. The suspect opened fire about two minutes later.
Police have not publicly identified any suspects, and the sheriff's office said on Saturday that it had no further details of the incident.
Authorities identified the victims who died as: Oshiana Tompkins, 19; Tiyon Farley, 22; Omar Taylor, 24; Ramon Hill Jr., 23; and Javin County, 29.

Several other people were wounded, police said, without giving an exact number. Some of the victims transported themselves to the hospital in the chaos after the shooting which sent young people, including some in Halloween costumes, fleeing from the scene.

DETROIT (Reuters) - The president of the United Auto Workers union, who has been linked https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-corruption-labor/federal-corruption-probe-hits-home-for-uaw-boss-contract-talks-under-storm-cloud-idUSKCN1VI229 to an ongoing corruption probe by U.S. federal officials, has taken a leave of absence, the union said on Saturday in a statement.
Gary Jones' leave of absence, which follows a vote by the executive board, will be effective beginning Sunday, the UAW said. He will be replaced on an acting basis by Rory Gamble, who recently led the team https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-autos-labor/ford-reaches-tentative-labor-deal-with-united-auto-workers-union-idUSKBN1XA044 that negotiated a new labor deal with  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), the union said.
""The UAW is fighting tooth and nail to ensure our members have a brighter future. I do not want anything to distract from the mission. I want to do what’s best for the members of this great union,"" Jones said in the statement, which did not give a reason for his decision.
UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg declined to comment on the matter. An attorney for Jones, who has not been charged with any wrongdoing, could not immediately be reached for comment.
The FBI has been conducting a wide-ranging investigation into illegal payoffs to UAW officials by  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA), and the union had hoped to put the federal probe behind it by electing Jones, a former regional director for the union, as president in 2018.
Jones will be paid while on leave, according to a person familiar with the process who asked not to be identified. 
He had been chosen as president as he seemed removed from the scandal, sources have said, but in late August, the FBI conducted searches https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-corruption-labor/federal-corruption-probe-hits-home-for-uaw-boss-contract-talks-under-storm-cloud-idUSKCN1VI229 at Jones’ suburban Detroit home and other locations.
A source previously said Jones was ""UAW Official A"" identified in criminal complaints filed against other UAW leaders. The complaints said that officials took part in alleged schemes to embezzle funds from the union.
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit has declined to identify the unnamed union leaders in the criminal complaints it has filed.
The widening probe raises questions about whether the U.S. government might seek to take over the UAW. 
In 1988, the U.S. Justice Department sued to force out senior leaders at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union and appoint a trustee because of the union's connection to organized crime. The government oversaw the union from March 1989 until 2015, when it agreed to a five-year transition period that will end in February 2020.
On Friday, the UAW's senior leaders at Ford's U.S. plants recommended approval of a tentative four-year labor agreement with the U.S. automaker, sending the deal to the 52,000 UAW members at Ford for final approval. The union previously ratified a similar deal with General Motors Co (N:GM) and will soon move to negotiate with Fiat Chrysler.
Gamble said in the UAW statement that the contract talks would not be impacted by Jones' absence.

“Together throughout the last few months, we’ve achieved substantial victories for UAW members and we know that we have more work to do,"" he said. ""We want better health care coverage, better salaries and respect for our work. That will not change,"" he said.

573,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2019 10:29AM ET</span>","Buffett's Berkshire tops profit forecasts despite trade drag, record cash","By Jonathan Stempel and Shubham Kalia
(Reuters) -  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) on Saturday said its quarterly operating profit rose more than analysts expected, as growth in several business lines offset the drag from trade tensions and tariffs and billionaire Warren Buffett's inability to deploy the conglomerate's cash.
Berkshire benefited as resilience in consumer spending helped cause U.S. economic growth to slow less than expected, offsetting a contraction in business investment.
But rising stock prices are still impeding Buffett's efforts to find places to invest.
Berkshire ended September with a record $128.2 billion of cash, despite repurchasing $700 million of stock in the quarter.
Buffett has gone nearly four years since making a major acquisition for Berkshire, whose stock price has lagged the broader market by the most since 2009.
""There is a growing frustration among investors that the cash hoard is not being effectively deployed,"" Cathy Seifert, an equity analyst at CFRA Research in New York, said after Berkshire released its results. ""The flip side is that Berkshire's stock tends to do well when the economy softens.""
Seifert also said Berkshire's sprawl means results will often mirror macroeconomic trends. ""It's not surprising that tariffs had a negative impact on its consumer and industrial businesses,"" she said. Seifert rates Berkshire ""hold.""
Berkshire said third-quarter operating income rose 14% to $7.86 billion, or roughly $4,816 per Class A share, from $6.88 billion, or roughly $4,189 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average expected operating profit of $4,405.16 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES.
Net income fell 11% to $16.52 billion, or $10,119 per Class A share, from $18.54 billion, or $11,280 per share, reflecting fewer gains from Berkshire's investments.
A U.S. accounting rule requires earnings to reflect unrealized gains, including on Berkshire's respective $57 billion and $27.8 billion stakes in Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC). Buffett said the resulting volatility can mislead investors.
Berkshire is based in Omaha, Nebraska, and operates more than 90 businesses including the Geico auto insurer, BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, and its namesake energy company and real estate brokerage.
Class A shares of Berkshire closed Friday at $323,400, up 5.7% in 2019, lagging the 22.3% gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 (SPX). Class B shares closed at $215.83, also up 5.7%.
TARIFFS WEIGH
U.S. gross domestic product increased at a 1.9% annualized rate in the third quarter, the Department of Commerce said on Wednesday in its advance estimate of economic growth.
But the Federal Reserve on the same day nevertheless lowered interest rates for the third time this year amid uncertainty over trade policy, slowing global growth and Great Britain's proposed exit from the European Union.
BNSF, one of Berkshire's largest businesses, was able to boost profit 5% to $1.47 billion.
The railroad's cost-cutting helped offset lower revenue as demand for consumer, coal, industrial and agricultural products declined, the latter in part because of new trade policies.
Berkshire also blamed U.S. tariffs for cutting into sales of gas turbine and pipe products by its Precision Castparts unit.
Insurance underwriting profit was essentially unchanged at $440 million, as improved results from reinsurance offset higher loss claims at Geico.
Berkshire warned that Typhoon Hagibis, which caused widespread damage in Japan last month, will likely hurt fourth-quarter underwriting results.
Nevertheless, float, a major driver of Berkshire's growth that reflects insurance premiums collected before claims are paid, rose about $2 billion in the quarter to $127 billion.
Profit from manufacturing, services and retailing rose 2%, to $2.46 billion, as higher sales from Berkshire's auto dealer and Clayton Homes mobile home units offset lower revenue from the Duracell battery, Forest River RV, and apparel and footwear businesses.
Tax credits, meanwhile, helped Berkshire Hathaway Energy boost profit 8%, to $1.18 billion."

DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Friday agreed that the initial public offering of state oil giant Aramco will be announced on Sunday, five sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The world's top oil company will announce its intention to float (ITF) on Nov. 3, the sources added.
""The crown prince finally gave the green light,"" one source said.
Aramco declined to comment.
Saudi Aramco officials and advisers have held last-minute meetings with investors over the past few days in an attempt to achieve as close to a $2 trillion valuation as possible ahead of an expected listing launch on Sunday, according to sources.
The final meeting by the Saudi government on Friday evening was to decide whether to go ahead with the listing.
Although Crown Prince Mohammed put a $2 trillion valuation on the company in early 2016, bankers and company insiders say Aramco's value is closer to $1.5 trillion.
At that price, Aramco would still be worth at least 50% more than the world's most valuable companies, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which each have a market capitalisation of around $1 trillion.
Riyadh is looking to list a 1%-2% stake on the Saudi stock market to raise at least $20 billion-$40 billion.
If the deal exceeds $25 billion, Aramco will become the biggest IPO in the world, topping Alibaba's $25 billion IPO in 2014.
The listing is the centrepiece of the crown prince's plan to shake up the Saudi economy and diversify away from oil. But there have been various delays since it was first announced in 2016.
Prince Mohammed wants to eventually list a total of 5% of the company. An international sale is expected to follow the domestic IPO.
Analysts' meetings with top institutional investors are likely to begin on Sunday, another source said.
The state-owned oil major has also approached governments in the Gulf and Asia, including China, to try to secure the bulk of the investment from countries on friendly terms with Saudi Arabia, as the reception elsewhere has been cooler, sources have previously said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Manhattan judge has dismissed Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc's lawsuit challenging a New York City law limiting the number of licenses for ride-hailing services, the first such cap by a major American city.
In a decision made public on Friday, New York State Supreme Court Justice Lyle Frank rejected Uber's argument that the city wrongly gave its Taxi and Limousine Commission power to enforce the cap.
Frank was also unconvinced that the cap, part of Local Law 147, would impede state efforts to reduce traffic congestion through ""congestion pricing"" on vehicles entering high-traffic areas of Manhattan.
""It would appear that LL 147, rather than being in conflict with the congestion pricing law, in fact appears to complement it,"" Frank wrote. His decision is dated Oct. 31.
“We’re disappointed that the TLC's cap that punishes drivers who are forced to rent vehicles will remain in effect,"" Uber said in a statement.
Nicholas Paolucci, a spokesman for the city's law department, said in an email: ""Hardworking for-hire vehicle drivers and everyone else impacted by our congested roads should be pleased with this court ruling.""
The August 2018 law was meant to give New York City greater oversight of ride-hailing companies such as Uber and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT).
It included a one-year freeze on new licenses to for-hire vehicles, which was later extended through August 2020, and also set minimum pay standards for drivers.
The case is separate from Uber's Sept. 20 challenge to a New York City ""cruising cap"" rule limiting how much time its drivers could spend without passengers in Manhattan south of 96th Street.
Based in San Francisco, Uber has drawn criticism from many cities that its vehicles increase congestion, and commandeer business from taxis.
The value of medallions, which are permits needed to operate yellow taxis in New York City and are distinct from ride-hailing licenses, has plunged as Uber and Lyft gained popularity.
""This cap has been life saving & is the basis for any group of drivers - Uber or yellow cab - to come out of poverty & instability,"" Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, said on Twitter.

The case is ZEHN-NY LLC et al v City of New York et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 151730/2019.

DETROIT (Reuters) - United Auto Workers leaders from Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's U.S. plants on Friday recommended approval of a tentative labor agreement that would allow the No. 2 U.S. automaker to avoid a strike like the one that cost its larger rival General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) about $3 billion.
The union turned to Ford to negotiate a new four-year agreement after ratifying a contract last week with GM following a 40-day U.S. strike that shut down almost all of that company's North American operations. Ford and the UAW quickly reached a tentative deal on Wednesday.
""This contract continues a strong pattern that gives all workers a path to traditional wages and maintains the job security and benefits our members deserve,"" UAW President Gary Jones said in a statement. 
Ford confirmed the deal in a statement and declined further comment. 
The deal now must be ratified by the 55,000 UAW workers at Ford, with voting running through Nov. 15. While GM's deal was approved, ratification is not a sure thing, as union members at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV in 2015 rejected the first version of a contract.
Detailed terms of the Ford deal echoed those agreed to with GM, as the union typically uses the first deal as a pattern for those that follow. The UAW said the deal included agreements by Ford to invest more than $6 billion in its U.S. plants, and to create or retain more than 8,500 UAW jobs.
The spending includes a $1.1 billion investment in Ford's Wayne, Michigan, pickup truck plant; $1 billion for the Louisville, Kentucky, plant, where Ford makes pickups and SUVs; and $900 million in an Ohio plant where it produces heavy-duty pickup trucks. A new unnamed vehicle will be added to the Ohio plant in 2023.
The deal also includes building hybrid and fully electric versions of various SUV models and the best-selling F-150 pickup truck, the union said.
Full-time UAW members at Ford will receive a signing bonus of $9,000, but the deal will allow the Dearborn, Michigan, company to close an engine plant in Romeo, Michigan.
The deal includes pay raises and lump-sum payments over the life of the contract, a pathway to full-time employment for temporary employees and unchanged healthcare coverage.
Once the Ford deal is ratified, the UAW will turn to Fiat Chrysler to complete its quadrennial talks with the Detroit automakers.

The talks have at times been overshadowed by an ongoing federal corruption probe that has involved several UAW senior leaders and been linked to Jones. A UAW spokesman on Friday declined to address the probe.

579,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 09:22PM ET</span>","AT&T to add directors, sell up to $10 billion in assets next year","By Sheila Dang and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) on Monday unveiled a three-year strategic plan that included selling up to $10 billion worth of businesses next year, paying off all its debt from the purchase of Time Warner and adding two new board members, bowing to pressure from activist investor Elliott Management.
The second-largest U.S. wireless phone carrier by subscribers has struggled with a stagnant stock price despite having spent billions on a bet that owning media content, as well as all the ways that people can access it through their phones, TVs and the internet, would pay off.
The result of that wager, AT&T's HBO Max subscription streaming video service, will be unveiled on Tuesday in Burbank, Calif.
AT&T's heavy debt load and declining revenue from segments like satellite TV provider DirecTV caught the attention of Elliott, one of the industry's most powerful activist investors, which bought a $3.2 billion stake earlier this year.
The New York-based hedge fund, which invests $38 billion, last month criticized Dallas-based AT&T, which has market capitalization of $283 billion, for its acquisitions, bloated costs and leadership structure. It asked the company to stop buying more companies, review its portfolio and costs and add new board members, laying the groundwork for an attack on one of the biggest corporate targets ever.
By Monday, about seven weeks after Elliott made its suggestions, AT&T committed to buying back stock, adding two new directors and reviewing its portfolio. 
There are ""no sacred cows"" when it comes to reviewing the business portfolio, long-serving CEO Randall Stephenson told analysts. While Stephenson had planned to retire soon, he pledged to stay through 2020 and oversee the changes himself.
While DirecTV will be an important piece of AT&T's strategy over the next three years, AT&T will consider multiple options, including partnerships and other structures, Stephenson said.
AT&T shares were up 4.8% to $38.70 in midday trading.
Stephenson took control of the negotiations with Elliott, with the two sides meeting in New York and Dallas and often by phone to reach Monday's announcement, a person familiar with the talks said.
Elliott got almost everything it asked for but made no commitments that prohibit it from exerting further pressure on the company, an unusual outcome in activist fights.
In a sign the two sides had quickly found common ground, Stephenson told Reuters on Monday that a standstill agreement, which could have prevented Elliott from taking further action, did not come up. 
Publicly, Elliott was keeping a low profile, commending the company but saying nothing beyond its statement. 
As a first step, AT&T plans to name a new board member with expertise in technology and cost cutting soon, Stephenson said on an analyst call in which he also had warm words for the hedge fund.
A second board member will be named next year and will have media credentials, the person familiar with the matter said, adding that both sides are still reviewing possible candidates.
To reduce its debt of $153.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, AT&T has been on a selling spree. Over the weekend, it sold Central European Media Enterprises Ltd (CME) to investment group PPF in a cash deal valued at about $2.1 billion.
The company expects to generate $14 billion through asset sales and other initiatives by the end of this year. It has reduced its net debt by $12.7 billion so far this year.
WEAK RESULTS
Monday's announcement presented an ""awkward conundrum"" as AT&T issued financial guidance through 2022 that was ahead of Wall Street's consensus, though its quarterly results fell short of expectations in every segment, Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research, said in a note. 
AT&T lost 1.2 million premium TV customers, which includes DirecTV, as well as 195,000 streaming video customers, as it has sought to roll off subscribers who had signed up with price promotions.
Revenue from WarnerMedia was down 4.4% from the previous year to $7.8 billion as it made less money from the Warner Bros. movie studio. 
Total operating revenue in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 fell to $44.59 billion from $45.74 billion a year earlier, missing analyst expectations of $45 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.. 
Excluding items, AT&T earned 94 cents per share, above analysts' estimates of 93 cents.

The carrier added 101,000 net new phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill during the third quarter. Wall Street estimated it would gain 61,000 net new customer additions, according to a note from Cowen analysts.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A Texas retirement system and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) pulled a combined $584 million from Fisher Investments on Friday, after allegations that firm founder Ken Fisher made sexist comments at a conference. 
The withdrawals come despite an apology from Fisher and new diversity initiatives by his firm. Those efforts may help Fisher maintain its asset base, which stood at $114 billion this week and is concentrated among high net worth individuals.
But holding on to high-profile pension and fund contracts may now prove difficult. On Friday, a spokeswoman for the Texas Employees Retirement System said after a due diligence review sparked by Fisher's comments it is withdrawing $350 million from Fisher, citing ""our fiduciary duty.""
The money is being redistributed within a portfolio of stocks, said spokeswoman Mary Jane Wardlow.
In addition, a securities filing on Friday by Goldman Sachs states Fisher's asset management unit will no longer be a subadviser to the $600 million Goldman Sachs Multi-Manager Global Equity Fund , effective on or around Oct. 31.
A Goldman Sachs spokesman did not comment on how much Fisher manages for the fund or give a reason for the change. Fisher was among 10 outside managers listed by the fund in a company disclosure as of March. Fisher managed $234 million for the fund, according to a source close to the matter.
Fisher did not comment on the moves, which bring to more than $3 billion the total withdrawn after comments Fisher made at an investor conference this month. Others that dropped his firm include Fidelity Investments and pension managers in Michigan and Iowa.
According to a conference attendee, Fisher made derogatory remarks about genitalia and picking up girls among other topics.
After a public backlash, Fisher apologized in a memo to his firm's employees, and to the public.

""Some of the words and phrases I used during a recent conference to make certain points were clearly wrong and I shouldn’t have made them. I realize this kind of language has no place in our company or industry. I sincerely apologize,"" Fisher said in a statement sent by a representative.

Loeb also said he was still speaking with Sony and remained committed to creating value at the Japanese company even after management largely ignored his proposals for ways to streamline the company's portfolio. 
Loeb wrote a letter to investors seen by Reuters that he and Third Point executives had met with many EssilorLuxottica executives and expect the company to increase earnings and free cash flow at mid-teens CAGR (compound annual growth rate) for several years. 
""Combined with the GrandVision acquisition, we expect EL to earn over 8 euros of EPS in 2023, nearly doubling the figure from 2019,"" the letter said.
Loeb, whose firm oversees $14.5 billion and is widely watched for its activist investments, also said that he is disappointed with Sony's decision to stick with the ""status quo"" after Third Point presented a list of ways to unlock value.
""While we did not expect that all our requests, such as the separation of the image sensor business, would be addressed immediately, we did expect that the Company would make some
recommendations to address the structural impediments to long-term value creation for Sony’s shareholders,"" he wrote in the letter.

Still he says that he is committed to ""constructive dialogue"" with the company and said that discussions are ongoing. He calls Sony one of the ""most undervalued large capitalization stocks in the world"" and noted that it has contributed to the firm's 12.7% return this year.

582,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 09:22PM ET</span>",Workers in pain: Employers take a new twist to prevent costly injuries,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Your job does not have to be physically demanding to literally be a pain in the neck, or knee, or lower back. 
Musculoskeletal conditions are among the top expenses for employee healthcare benefits, accounting for about a third of all worker injury and illness cases, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). 
With healthcare costs projected to rise 4.9% in 2020, according to Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW), many large companies are ready to try something new. They plan to spend more upfront to try to prevent higher costs later on. For conditions like chronic back pain, that means trying to prevent injuries or treat them with innovative physical therapy to avoid surgery and potentially, opioid additions. 
PREVENTION FIRST
Some companies take a traditional proactive approach, like Rosen Hotels & Resorts, an Orlando-based chain, which has morning stretches for hotel staff, a free gym, plus a full-scale primary care health clinic with a physical therapist and chiropractor. 
""Our cost per individual is half what the cost is nationwide,"" said Harris Rosen, founder and chief executive. ""We know, because we have lived through it, that if you focus on wellness and health, your healthcare costs decline.""
Other companies are trying to ""appify"" their care delivery. Brakebush Brothers Inc, a chicken processor headquartered in Wisconsin, turned to a third-party provider, Solveglobal, to crunch frequent worker surveys about their pains down to a line level on a specific shift, according to Matt VanderKooi, chief operating officer at Solveglobal. 
One time they solved a rash of low back pain problems by figuring out that workers were reaching too much at a specific spot. Another time they could find no common source for random physical complaints from workers on a shift, but were able to identify that the problems were caused by work stress from a new supervisor. 
Savings: $1 million this past year, said VanderKooi. 
Post Holdings Inc. is using the service Hinge Health, which gives participants a tablet pre-loaded with exercises specific to their condition. So far 15% of the 1,200 employees eligible for the pilot are participating, out of about 8,000 on the U.S. medical plan, said Karen Little, vice president of payroll and benefits for Post.
Cost savings are not apparent yet, but Little said musculoskeletal disorders were running about 15% of Post's total healthcare costs.
Hinge Health fees are based on a multiple of the projected savings and come with a money-back guarantee. 
""Employers like a simple story. We’re avoiding surgeries and that’s where savings are coming from,"" said chief executive officer Gabriel Mecklenburg. ""We've never had to pay back a dime.""
DIVERSIONARY TACTICS
Typically, people in pain go to a doctor. These new, voluntary worker benefits depend on promotions and word-of-mouth to get employees interested. 
Physera clients receive email and postcards about medical services. The company also hosts pop-up clinics, said Dan Rubinstein, chief executive officer. 
Since launching fully in 2019, the free version of the Physera app has 25,000-plus users, along with 1,000 participants in the full corporate program. 
Physera measures success based on actions and improvement. Users are asked what steps they are likely to take - like getting an MRI. Out of 100 patients, a handful consider surgery and ultimately decide they do not need it.
""Early physical therapy intervention results in a 30-40% reduction in spending,"" said Rubinstein. 
For those suffering from painful disorders, any solution seems better than surgery and opioid prescriptions. 
""I’ve been there on lower back pain,"" said David Chase, author of ""The Opioid Wake-up Call"" and co-founder of Health Rosetta. ""And we completely botch it. At some level, plan design can make a difference.""
For Jenna Kreitinger, a 27-year-old veterinary technician from Mesa, Arizona, the difference has been nothing short of life-changing. After she used Hinge Health consistently, her chronic spinal pain dissipated after years of trying many other solutions. 

""Physical therapy was costly, and it was hard to find the time,"" said Kreitinger, who now has a baby and is back to work full-time. ""Just those small changes I made, it has helped me so much.""

583,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 09:22PM ET</span>","After Ken Fisher no-show, LA pension system terminates his firm","By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - The Los Angeles fire and police pension system voted to terminate Fisher Investments on Thursday over allegedly sexist comments made by founder Ken Fisher earlier this month.
Five of the system's nine commissioners voted during a webcast meeting to remove the $511 million the system had under management with the firm, of which Fisher is the majority owner.
Several members voiced concerns about the costs involved and suggested diversity improvements Fisher might make instead. But ultimately Fisher's decision not to show up personally for the pension system's meeting and instead send several of his executives contributed to the lost business.
""Their management team now is running around the country putting out fires while apparently Mr. Fisher is behind the computer doing deals,"" said Brian Pendleton, one of the commissioners supporting the termination. 
The action brings to more than $2.5 billion the amount withdrawn from Fisher Investments over its founder's remarks. Investors including pension funds in Iowa, Michigan and Boston and Fidelity Investments have moved to sever ties with the firm. The withdrawals represent just 2 percent of the firm's total assets of about $114 billion, however.
Other systems have put the firm under review over Fisher's remarks at an investor conference but not taken further action. According to a conference attendee, Fisher made derogatory comments about genitalia, picking up girls and financier Jeffrey Epstein, among other topics.
Epstein committed suicide in August while in jail awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. 
After a public backlash, Fisher apologized in a memo to his firm's employees on Oct. 11. He had been invited to Thursday's Los Angeles meeting but instead sent executives including firm Chief Executive Damian Ornani.
The executives reiterated the apology and said the firm was taking steps on diversity, including having executives go through sensitivity training. Fisher himself, Ornani said, is not speaking to large audiences ""in the near term.""
Speaking to a question about the firm's stability raised by a pension consultant last week, Ornani said the firm is ""very stable."" 
With about $114 billion under management, total assets are higher than the $110 billion they stood at before Fisher spoke at the conference, Ornani said, and it is adding new institutional clients. The majority of the firm's business, more than $67 billion, is with high net worth individuals, according to Fisher's website.
Ornani and others did not directly address a question about whether Fisher might resign, although one executive said that would impair the company's investment process.
In addition, Fisher Senior Executive Vice President Carrianne Coffey said the firm has hired consulting firm Russell Reynolds Associates to help with its diversity efforts. These include a task force on diversity and inclusion previously announced.
Several commissioners of the Los Angeles system said they were impressed by the Fisher executives' commitments but still wanted to hear from Fisher himself.
""Talk is cheap. First of all, an apology from you folks... that's nice but it doesn't mean squat,"" said one, Kenneth Buzzell.
A transition plan will be developed by November, said system general manager Ray Ciranna.

585,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 09:14PM ET</span>",Starved for income? Hungry investors hunt dividend ETFs,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK(Reuters) - Rock-bottom interest rates may be great for lots of people - but not for savers.
With a brand-new quarter-point rate cut from the Federal Reserve and ten-year government bonds yielding 1.84%, there is almost nowhere for them to go. That is why dividend exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been grabbing investor attention.
The most prominent names in the space include the $47.8-billion Vanguard Dividend Appreciation, the $34.8-billion Vanguard High Dividend Yield, the $18.9-billion SPDR S&P Dividend (NYSE:SDY) and the $17.8-billion iShares Select Dividend.
Caveat emptor, though. In the dividend world you need to be cautious and understand what exactly you are buying. A few pointers:
* Not all dividend strategies are alike. 
Novice investors might assume that all dividend-oriented funds are similar. Not so. In fact the differences from one fund to the next can be “enormous,” said Dave Nadig, managing director of independent news and analytics site ETF.com.
For instance: Some funds screen purely for high yield, while others screen for dividend growth. Those two strategies are going to give you very different underlying portfolios.
In particular, hunting for yield alone is a risky game to play – some companies may offer sky-high dividends because they are in deep trouble. Meanwhile dividend “growth” doesn’t necessarily mean high overall payouts; VIG, for instance, offers a modest 1.77% yield, which may not be quite what you were hoping for.
The point: “Really understand what’s under the hood,” Nadig said.
* Dividend ETFs are not bonds.
Many investors think of dividend-paying equities as bond proxies – a way to generate some income, while still enjoying the upside potential of stocks. They are also seen as a relatively safe portion of the stock market, as big, blue-chip companies are typically well-positioned to weather downturns.
But make no mistake, these are equities we are talking about. That means there is downside exposure, and you will be assuming much more risk than if you simply stuck to Treasuries.
“If the Dow takes a dive of 30%, guess what?” said Tom Roseen, head of research services for fund analysts Lipper at Refinitiv. “Your equity ETF is likely going to take a dive, too.”
* Understand payout schedules.
Dividend ETFs pass along yield, but on their own schedule. They essentially collect the dividends of the underlying securities, and then most set a quarterly date for payout. That may come in the form as cash, or as reinvestment in shares of the fund, depending on the ETF. Read the prospectus for details. 
You can plow the cash back in on your own through your brokerage via dividend reinvestment programs (DRIPs), which can be a powerful tool for long-term returns. So powerful, in fact, that you may need to think about rebalancing down the road, lest your portfolio becomes overly skewed toward equities.
* Look abroad.
American companies have actually become quite stingy when it comes to dividends, so you may want to look overseas.
In emerging markets “you can find yields like 4-5-6%,” Nadig said.
One suggestion: Cambria’s Emerging Shareholder Yield, with its basket of almost 100 holdings and 3.6% yield. “Their well-managed, diversified approach is something that a lot of investors could benefit from,” Nadig added.
* Remember the taxman.
Generating cash flow is great - but as always, Uncle Sam will want a taste. If your ETFs are in a tax-deferred retirement account, not to worry yet. But if they are in a regular brokerage account, then tax implications come into play.
The dividends you receive will either be qualified or non-qualified, depending on factors like how long stocks were held by the fund. If non-qualified, dividends are subject to ordinary income tax rates. If qualified, they are subject to capital gains tax rates, which are lower; those depend on household income, but typically knock you 15%.
* Yield is one factor among many.
Yes, yield is a sexy top-line number. But there are other important attributes to keep in mind as well, such as “consistent return, expenses, total return, and preservation of capital,” said Roseen.
Good thing Lipper ranks all such funds, with five being its highest grade in any given category, and a few getting fives across the board. One Roseen mentions: SPDR International Dividend, with its eye-catching 4.34% yield.

Do that due diligence, and no matter what the economy or stock market does, dividend ETFs will be slipping a little extra cash in your pockets for many years to come.

586,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 09:14PM ET</span>",Google unveils quantum computer breakthrough; critics say wait a qubit,"By Douglas Busvine and Paresh Dave
BERLIN/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google said on Wednesday it had achieved a breakthrough in computing research by using a quantum computer to solve in minutes a complex problem that would take today's most powerful supercomputer thousands of years to crack.
Google researchers expect that quantum computers within a few years will fuel advancements in fields such as artificial intelligence, materials science, and chemistry. The company is racing rivals including  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Corp and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) to be the first to commercialize the technology and sell it through its cloud computing business.
""We're hoping that when people start using this and looking at performance stability and cloud interface, they'll get really excited about what we have to offer at Google,"" John Martinis, the company's chief scientist for quantum hardware, told reporters.
The breakthrough was described in a paper https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5#Sec4 published in science journal Nature. It followed weeks of controversy since a draft leaked over whether Google's claim of ""quantum supremacy"" was valid.
IBM said a supercomputer employing a different set-up could solve the same challenge in under three days, while chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) said ""quantum practicality"" remained years away.
Google defended its position, but did not dispute rivals' contentions. It has manufactured a handful of chips with 54 'qubits', vastly more powerful than the standard 64-bit chip in many consumer devices. However, for the technology to be useful to customers it would need to make chips with thousands of qubits.
Martinis said Google sees ""a pathway"" to a computer with 1,000 qubits and expressed confidence that it had a reliable process to make its new chip, dubbed Sycamore.
The U.S. and Chinese governments have led in the burgeoning quantum technology field, pledging billions of dollars in funding to corporate and state researchers to fast-track quantum development and mitigate possible issues, including the tech's expected ability to break digital encryption.
Google has been among the beneficiaries of the American support. ""The United States has taken a great leap forward in quantum computing,"" said U.S. chief technology officer Michael Kratsios on Wednesday.
LONG-HELD DREAM
For decades, computer scientists have sought to harness quantum physics, laws governing the behavior of particles that are smaller than atoms and can simultaneously exist in different states.
Quantum bits, or qubits, can be set to one and zero at the same time, unlike today's computer bits that are either ones or zeros. This superposition property multiplies exponentially as qubits become entangled with each other, meaning the more qubits connected, the vastly more powerful a quantum computer becomes.
But there is a catch: Quantum researchers need to cool qubits to about absolute zero (-273 degrees Celsius or -460 degrees Fahrenheit) to limit vibration - or ""noise"" - that causes errors in calculations. It is in this challenging task that Google, which has designed much of its own electronics and used liquid helium for cooling, has made significant progress.
CEO Sundar Pichai compared the achievement to building the first rocket to leave Earth's atmosphere and touch the edge of space, an advance that brought interplanetary travel into the realm of the possible.
""For those of us working in science and technology, it's the 'hello world' moment we've been waiting for - the most meaningful milestone to date in the quest to make quantum computing a reality,"" Pichai wrote in a blog https://blog.google/perspectives/sundar-pichai/what-our-quantum-computing-milestone-means.
Sycamore, measuring about 10 mm (0.39 inch) across, is made using aluminum and indium parts sandwiched between two silicon wafers. In their experiment this year, the researchers were able to get 53 of Sycamore's qubits to interact in a quantum state.
They then had the quantum computer detect patterns in a series of seemingly random numbers, and it succeeded in 3 minutes and 20 seconds. They estimated that the same problem would take 10,000 years for a Summit supercomputer - the most powerful in the world today - to solve.
HOLD ON A QUBIT
While the peer-reviewed research has drawn plaudits, with MIT's William D. Oliver comparing it to the Wright brothers' first flights, skeptics say Google is over-selling its achievement.
IBM said a supercomputer with additional disk storage can solve the random number problem in at most 2-1/2 days and with greater accuracy. It also said Google risked misleading the public by implying the new-style computers would replace existing ones.
""Quantum computers will never reign 'supreme' over classical computers, but will rather work in concert with them, since each have their unique strengths,"" Dario Gil, director of research at IBM, wrote in a blog https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/10/on-quantum-supremacy.
Torsten Siebert, manager of the quantum computing research program at Germany's Fraunhofer Society, agreed that ""progress was likely to be achieved through such hybrid combinations.""
Researchers also have expressed concern about quantum computers being used, for example, to unseal secure data and passwords or enable new forms of surveillance. 
But before quantum computers can break codes, security experts have plenty of time to adapt, Martinis said. 

""We're pretty confident we'll all stay safe and secure in the future,"" he said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Twitter's technology tools removed one in two tweets containing abusive content posted in the first half of this year, it said on Thursday, amid calls to the U.S. social media company and its peers to do more to tackle the issue.
Silicon Valley tech giants have in recent months pledged to tighten rules and share more information on abusive content posted on their platforms to avoid more heavy-handed regulatory action on both sides of the Atlantic.
Twitter said in its transparency report that it was investing in proactive technology to reduce the burden on people reporting abusive content to the company.
""More than 50 percent of tweets we remove for abuse are now proactively surfaced using technology, rather than relying on reports to Twitter,"" the company said. That compared with 20% a year ago.
The report came a day after Twitter said it would ban political advertising on its platform next month as it and peers including  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) also face pressure to stop carrying ads that spread false information that could steer elections.
The report noted a 105% increase in accounts locked or suspended for violating its rules during the six-month period.
There was a 48% rise in accounts reported for potential violation of Twitter's hateful conduct policies while 115,861 accounts were suspended because of their terrorist content, down 30% from the previous year. 

The company also received 67% more legal requests to remove content from 49 countries, 80% of which came from Japan, Russia and Turkey.

(Reuters) - Google on Thursday petitioned a Texas judge to ensure that the state-led probe into possible antitrust violations by the Internet search and advertising company will not compromise its confidential business information.
The request by Google and its parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) came after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is leading the probe by 48 U.S. states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, hired two consultants who have worked for Google rivals or critics.
Google wants an order preventing the consultants Cristina Caffarra, an economist who has worked for  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and News Corp (O:NWSA), and Eugene Burrus, a former Microsoft lawyer, from disclosing sensitive information or working for rivals until one year after their consultancies end.
""Given the breadth of confidential information sought by (Paxton's office) and the heightened risks of leaks and disclosure to Google's competitors and complainants in this and other regulatory proceedings, a protective order is appropriate and necessary,"" Google said.
A spokesman for Paxton said the attorney general had made a number of proposals to ensure that sensitive Google information would be used only in the probe, which was announced in September, and not by rivals.
""Google's petition is nothing more than an effort to hamstring the investigation,"" the spokesman, Marc Rylander, said in a statement. ""But Google is not entitled to choose the states' expert or run the states' investigation.""
Technology-related companies such as Google, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) have faced growing antitrust concerns from regulators and lawmakers.
The industry has been scrutinized over such issues as their growing or dominant market shares, their ability to protect users' privacy, and whether they are spreading misinformation or favoring certain viewpoints over others.
In a petition filed with a Travis County, Texas state court, Google said Paxton has refused to accept ""necessary limitations"" on the use of its confidential information, such as forbidding the consultants from working for rivals during the probe.
Caffarra, a competition expert at Charles River Associates, was described as a ""public critic"" of Google who has challenged the company's business practices before the European Union, and in Russia on behalf of  Yandex  (O:YNDX), a rival in that country.
The petition also said Burrus, an adviser to McKinsey & Co, claimed to have ""developed"" a case that led to a $2.7 billion EU fine for Google in June 2017.
Google did not name Caffarra, Burrus or the third consultant, Notre Dame law professor Roger Alford, as respondents in its petition.

It said the protective order should also cover Alford, should others hire him for future legal work against Google.

(Reuters) -  Pinterest Inc  (N:PINS) fell short of Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue on lower-than-expected average revenue per user and its revised full-year sales forecast came marginally below expectations, sending its shares tumbling 19%.
Thursday's after-market plunge is expected to wipe out a majority of the gains since the online scrapbook company's blockbuster initial public offering in April, leaving the stock just about 6% from its IPO price.
Pinterest on average posted revenue of 90 cents per user globally in the third quarter, falling just short of analysts expectation of 91 cents, according to research firm FactSet.
The company's net loss widened to $124.7 million from $18.9 million a year earlier, as total costs and expenses nearly doubled to $413.4 million.
Pinterest has been investing in areas such as advertiser diversification which would ""bear fruit over the coming several quarters and years,"" Chief Financial Officer Todd Morgenfeld said on a post earnings call with analysts.
""We're still in the early days of that, and it will unfold over a period of time.""
Pinterest, which calls its users ""Pinners"", said monthly active users jumped 28% to 322 million. Analysts had expected about 307 million users.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's antitrust body has sought more information from Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) about its planned acquisition of a stake in India's Future Retail (NS:FRTL), sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, which could potentially delay the deal. 
Amazon in August agreed to acquire a 49% stake in a unit of India's Future Group which owns 7.3% of Future Retail, giving the U.S.-based company a 3.58% stake in the retailer which operates more than 1,500 stores in the country.
The deal would help Amazon tap into the booming retail market in India, as it separately boosts its e-commerce operations, offering everything from electronics to groceries on its Indian website. Future Retail runs 290 budget department and grocery stores branded ""Big Bazaar"".
In a notice to Amazon last month, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) said ""in certain overlapping segments and areas of operation of the parties, the combined market share exceeds the threshold specified in the combination regulations"", one of the sources told Reuters.
The CCI also queried the procedure Amazon adopted to seek approval. Amazon had notified the CCI through a so-called Form I, instead of a Form II that is more onerous and is required when parties assess the combined entity will exceed a pre-defined market share threshold.
The CCI sought justification from Amazon on why it chose to file a Form I, the source added, which could potentially delay approval of the deal. A Form I filing typically takes 2-3 months compared with three to six months for a Form II.
Amazon and Future Retail declined to comment for the story. A source at Future group said it had recently answered the CCI's questions related to the deal, but did not elaborate.
The CCI did not respond to Reuters queries.
Additionally, the competition watchdog has asked Amazon more than 40 questions related to the deal and its businesses, the first source with knowledge of the matter said. 
A second source confirmed to Reuters that the CCI had sent additional queries to Amazon, calling it part of the regular deal approval process by the watchdog.
""There are questions about e-commerce ... the CCI needs to assess whether there is any adverse impact on competition or not,"" the source said.
Amazon's notification available on the CCI's website says the company believes the deal is ""not likely to cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition"" in India. 
""Such queries mean the deal is being closely scrutinized and could face potential delays, but it can eventually sail through if no antitrust concerns are found,"" said Karan Singh Chandhiok, an antitrust partner at Indian law firm Chandhiok & Mahajan who is not involved in the proposed stake purchase. 

Typically in such cases, the company needs to defend its decision and, if the watchdog disagrees, has no choice but to give more details in a Form II filing, Chandhiok added.

Fiat Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and  Peugeot  owner PSA (PA:PEUP) plan to join forces in a 50-50 share merger to create the world's fourth-largest automaker, seeking scale to cope with costly new technologies and slowing global demand.

The German rail operator is also still preparing for a potential flotation of Arriva, the person said.
Arriva, which employs 53,000 people across Europe and is expected to be valued at 3-4 billion euros ($3.35-$4.5 billion), runs British rail franchises including Northern and the London Overground as well as buses around the country.
Previously, Apollo (N:APO) had been working on a competing offer.

As the Saturday deadline for signing approached, Asda said the workers would have a seven-day ""cooling off period"" to change their minds before losing their jobs.
Chief Executive Roger Burnley wrote to staff, saying almost 120,000 employees had signed up to the more flexible contract and fewer than 1,000 had not. 
""On Saturday, once the closing date has passed, we will write to them again, offering them the opportunity to sign up because we really don’t want any colleague to make a decision to leave and then regret it,"" he said.
A spokesman for Asda said any worker who has not signed the contract but turns up for work on Sunday or Monday will be asked again to sign.
Of Britain's big four grocers - market leader  Tesco  (L:TSCO), Sainsbury's (L:SBRY), Asda and Morrisons (L:MRW) -Walmart (N:WMT) owned Asda is the last to implement more flexible working contracts as it seeks productivity improvements in a fiercely competitive market.
All the big four grocers are continuing to lose market share to German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl, which are aggressively opening new stores.
Asda's new standardised contracts increase the base rate of pay for retail workers to 9 pounds ($11.64) per hour from Nov. 3 and to 9.18 pounds from April 1 2020, plus premiums, while maintaining benefits including an annual bonus, share save scheme and staff discount.
The new contracts also remove paid breaks and require employees to work across departments and on some bank holidays.
Asda says the new contract represents an investment of more than 80 million pounds and is not a cost-cutting exercise.
The GMB union has called the contracts ""draconian"". 
In April, Sainsbury's agreed bid of 7.3 billion pounds for Asda was blocked by Britain's competition regulator. A month later Walmart said it would instead look at a stock-market listing for Asda and in July Burnley said this could happen in two to three years.

The deal, announced on Thursday, would create the world's fourth-largest automaker.
""We will obviously look at it very, very carefully,"" Kudlow said on Bloomberg. ""The president has not commented on the deal ... We're not afraid of doing business with international companies, Lord knows.""
When asked about the 12.2% equity stake and 19.5% voting stake China's Dongfeng Motors holds in PSA, Kudlow said: ""With respect to the Chinese story, we obviously are alert and on guard.""
The deal, which would be structured as a 50-50 merger, would create the fourth-largest global automaker with annual sales of nearly 9 million vehicles. Fiat Chrysler told employees the deal could generate synergies of 3.7 billion euros but added ""these synergies are NOT based on closing plants.""
Fiat Chrysler declined to comment.
There has been speculation Dongfeng might sell its holdings, which could help ease the deal's passage through U.S. regulators, given U.S.-Chinese trade tensions.
""We will welcome a good deal. We hope it will get more production in the United States, more factories and workers and employment in the U.S. And with respect to the Chinese angle, we will take a careful look at it,"" Kudlow said.

Fiat Chrysler said on Thursday that ""teams at both companies are working to finalize discussions and reach a Memorandum of Understanding in the coming weeks.""

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco officials and advisers are holding last-minute meetings with investors in an attempt to achieve as close to a $2 trillion valuation ahead of an expected Sunday announcement that the initial public offering (IPO) will go ahead, according to three sources.
Failure to reach the target would cause a dilemma for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - swallow the bitter pill of going ahead at a lower valuation or postpone the initial public offering (IPO) once again. 
The Aramco officials and advisers are meeting institutional investors around the world, according to the three people familiar with the matter. Chief executive Amin Nasser has been meeting investors in New York and London this week, they added.
Saudi Arabia's crown prince on Friday approved the go ahead of the IPO of state oil giant Aramco, five sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
The main sticking point remains the $2 trillion valuation, which has often been considered too ambitious by advisers and some insiders, according to the three sources. A valuation closer to $1.5 trillion is more likely, with wealthy Saudi families the main investors in the IPO, they said.
""Saudi Aramco does not comment on rumours or speculations,"" the company said in an emailed response to Reuters' queries about the meetings and IPO launch date. Aramco added it was ready for the IPO, and that the timing would depend on market conditions. 
Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz said on Wednesday that it would be a Saudi decision, specifically by Crown Prince Mohammed.
A weak outlook for oil prices, against a gloomy global economic picture and increasing climate change activism, could dampen investor interest, particularly in the Western world. 
""Aramco's officials and advisers are still on the road,"" said one of the sources, a major institutional investor. 
Saudi Arabia is separately still holding government-to-government meetings to attract investment from sovereign wealth funds, the investor added.
The state-owned oil major has also approached governments in the Gulf and Asia, including China, to try to secure the bulk of the investment from countries on friendly terms with Saudi Arabia, as the reception elsewhere has been cooler, sources have previously said.
DIVIDEND PAYOUT
The listing is the centrepiece of the crown prince's plan to shake up the Saudi economy and diversify away from oil. But there have been various delays since the 2016 announcement. A launch is now expected on Sunday, sources have previously said.
Aramco has said it will pay a base dividend of $75 billion, which at $2 trillion would mean a dividend yield of 3.75%, below those already offered by competitors like  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa).
Shell's dividend yield is over 6% and Exxon's over 5%, according to Refinitiv data.
Oil majors have been raising payouts to shareholders over the past years to counter rising pressure from climate activism on investors to dump oil stocks and help the world switch to cleaner fuels such as wind and solar.
To achieve $2 trillion, in the largest IPO in history, Riyadh needs the initial listing of a 1% to 2% stake on the Saudi market to raise at least $20 billion to $40 billion. 
Prince Mohammed wants to eventually list a total of 5% of the company. An international sale is expected to follow the domestic IPO.
The close relationship between new Aramco chairman Yasser al-Rumayyan, who also heads the PIF, the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, with the crown prince was a governance concern of some investors, the sources said. 

The PIF (Public Investment Fund) will use the proceeds of the Aramco IPO sale to deliver on the prince's ambitious domestic and economic reforms.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) asked the Trump administration to waive tariffs on Chinese-made Apple Watches, iPhone components and other consumer products, according to company filings with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office.
The company on Thursday sought tariff exclusions from 11 products, including HomePod speakers, iMac computers, parts for use in repairing iPhones, iPhone smart battery cases, AirPods and others. The public has until Nov. 14 to submit comments on the requests.
Apple told the U.S. Trade Representative's Office the products were consumer electronic devices and ""not strategically important or related to 'Made in China 2025' or other Chinese industrial programs.""
The exclusions seek relief from 15% tariffs that took effect on Sept. 1.
FitBit Inc asked the administration to waive tariffs on its fitness trackers. The company told the administration ""the vast majority of global production capacity for wrist-wearable communications devices is in China.""
The company added that ""while Fitbit is aware of facilities currently producing such devices in Taiwan and South Korea, these facilities are fully owned by, or otherwise contracted to, Fitbit competitors that use them for their own branded production, rendering them unavailable to Fitbit."" Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc announced Friday it has reached a deal to acquire Fitbit.
Apple submitted the requests on the first day the Trump administration began accepting them. An Apple spokesman did not immediately comment.
Apple's wearables and accessories business - which includes the Apple Watch, AirPods and HomePod - brought in $24.5 billion in its fiscal 2019 ended in September, or about 9.4% of Apple's revenue. Sales in the segment were up 41% versus the prior year, and the devices have become an important driver of Apple's business as iPhone sales declined for the past four straight quarters. 
Apple chief executive Tim Cook said Wednesday on the company's earnings call the company is paying ""some tariffs today, as you know, some that went into effect pre-September and some others that went into effect in September. So we are paying some.""
Christie's Inc has asked the administration waive tariffs on Chinese sculptures, statues, paintings, antique furniture and silverware and other collectible items.

Sea Eagle Boats Inc submitted requests to waive tariffs on inflatable stand up paddleboards.

599,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 09:10PM ET</span>","Wall Street Week Ahead: Travel, leisure company reports set to give view of economy, consumer","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A wide swath of the U.S. travel and leisure industry is set to provide insight next week on the state of the economy, including trends in consumer spending, fallout from U.S.-China trade tensions and any damaging impact from the stronger U.S. dollar.
Third-quarter reports from several major hotels and online booking agencies roll in along with perspective coming on cruise lines and theme parks that will offer a window into the travel and tourism industry, representing nearly 3% of U.S. economic output.
Of special interest is the consumer, who has been seen as a steady economic pillar at a time other areas such as industrial manufacturing are showing weakness. U.S. economic growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter, according to data on Wednesday, as a further contraction in business investment was offset by resilient consumer spending.
The travel and leisure companies could provide a ""good initial read"" on their spending, given that most major retailers are not due to report until later in the month, said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in South Carolina.
""Everybody is so focused on the fact that the consumer is what is holding the economy up, it’s that much more important to understand the health of the consumer,"" Todd said.
The travel and leisure reports arrive more than halfway through a corporate earnings season that overall has been better than expected for large U.S. companies but remains lackluster in terms of profit growth. S&P 500 companies are now expected to have posted a 0.8% decline in third-quarter earnings, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Among the S&P 500 travel and leisure companies reporting next week are Marriott International Inc (O:MAR) and Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (N:HST), online travel companies Booking Holdings Inc (O:BKNG),  Expedia  Group (O:EXPE) and TripAdvisor (O:TRIP), and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (N:NCLH). Media and entertainment giant Walt  Disney  (N:DIS), which operates theme parks around the world, is set to post results on Thursday.
An index of five S&P 500 hotels and cruise lines <.SPLRCHOTL> has gained about 13% so far in 2019, but that has lagged the roughly 21% gain for the overall S&P 500 (SPX).
Graphic: Hotel, cruise stocks vs market, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/8067/7998/Pasted%20Image.jpg
Marriott, which is expected to post a 12.5% drop in earnings per share when it reports on Monday, will be particularly in focus due to its diversity of both hotel offerings and locations, according to Greenwood Capital's Todd.
""They are so big now and touch so many geographies and different stratas of incomes within their hotel portfolios, it gives you a good window into different pieces of the economy,"" Todd said.
Hotels that have reported so far have largely moderated their forecasts for revenue per available room, a key industry metric, said Dan Wasiolek, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, noting that the U.S.-China trade dispute ""continues to have an impact on corporate travel.""
“When companies are uncertain about policy that can impact their business, they are unsure how to budget for that and that can therefore slow business meetings,"" Wasiolek said. ""And if that slows business meetings, it slows travel and it slows people staying at hotels.""
In  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings' (N:HLT) conference call last week, Chief Executive Christopher Nassetta noted leisure business was ""down a tick"" in the third quarter.
Hotels' leisure business has been strong in 2019, said Brian Dobson, an analyst at Nomura Instinet, ""but just at the margin, we are starting to see a little bit of weakness.""
""That is something we will certainly be keeping an eye on and want to hear more about from Marriott,"" Dobson said.
 Royal Caribbean  (N:RCL) shares ended down 3.4% following the cruises company's quarterly report on Wednesday as it pointed to ""certain changes in our cost base"" in the coming years. But Royal Caribbean's demand outlook otherwise has a ""positive read-through"" for Norwegian's results next Thursday, Nomura Instinet analysts Harry Curtis and Dobson said in a note.
Disney's quarterly earnings are expected to fall by about 36%, according to Refinitiv, and investors will be focused on the company's video streaming plans. In its last report, operating income declined at Disney's U.S. theme parks as the company cited expenses for a ""Star Wars""-themed expansion at California's Disneyland and lower attendance.
One factor that could make tourist travel to the United States more expensive is the strength of the dollar, said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide, especially in light of other economic and political uncertainty such as Britain's planned exit from the European Union.
The dollar (DXY) climbed 4.5% against a basket of currencies from the third quarter of 2018 through the third quarter of this year.

“The biggest issue is the foreign traveler because of the dollar,"" Hackett said. ""Are they willing to come over with the headwind of the dollar given all the other stresses and worries?”

The S&P 100 Index also set a record close, up 0.98% to 1,363.03. 
The rally was set off by the Labor Department's report that employers added 128,000 jobs in October, more than expected. The unemployment rate moved up to 3.6%, but economists said that was a function of more people coming into the labor force. Reports in August and September were revised higher, meaning the summer and early fall hiring has been little affected by trade woes or the recently settled General Motors (NYSE:GM) strike. 
The report confirms the assessment of many economists and the Federal Reserve that the domestic economy is growing steadily, despite the U.S.-Chine trade fight and slowing economies around the world.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), up 22% since the end of August, has seen its market cap grow by $213 billion. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is up by 4.1% in the same time frame. Its market cap is up $43 billion.

603,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 04:19PM ET</span>","In the Future, We Will All Work in Food Service","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Of the 128,000 new nonfarm payroll jobs created in October, according to today’s employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 47,500 were at food services and drinking places. While that 37% share was anomalously high, the sector has been a major driver of job gains for this entire expansion. Of the 20 million new jobs created since employment bottomed out in February 2010, 3 million, or almost 14%, have been at food services and drinking places, much higher than their 8% share of employment. The restaurant employment boom seemed to be fizzling in late 2017, and definitely proceeded at a slower place for most of 2018 and earlier this year. But now it seems to be gaining strength again.
The continued rise of food services employment says something encouraging about the current business cycle. Regardless of some weakness this year in manufacturing and oil and gas, and worries that the longest-ever expansion might finally be fading, Americans in general are still going out for meals and drinks — and restaurant and bar owners are still hiring workers to serve them.
Over the longer haul, the rise of the restaurant tells several different stories, not all of them so encouraging. For example, employment at food services and drinking places hasn’t passed employment in manufacturing yet, but seems destined to overtake it before long.
Food services jobs don’t pay as well as factory jobs or offer as regular hours: average weekly earnings in October were $389 in the former, $1,198 in the latter. Minimum wage laws and other policy efforts may be able to raise that pay somewhat, but there are limits because productivity growth in the sector is so slow. Since 1990, real output per hour worked has risen 10% at food services and drinking places, and 116% in manufacturing. A shift away from making stuff to providing services and experiences is perhaps inevitable in a wealthy, maturing economy, but it does pose challenges for maintaining economic growth and broadly shared prosperity.
The rise of restaurants also signals a change in how we get our food. Overall spending on food has declined a lot as a share of disposable income since the 1920s, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But restaurants have actually been taking a growing share of our paychecks over time, and thanks to them the overall food share has barely budged over the past decade.
This is isn’t just about restaurants, of course. Full-service restaurants remain the biggest employer in the food services sector, with limited-service ones (e.g., fast food and fast casual) a close second, and together they accounted for more than 81% of the food services and drinking places jobs gains since February 2010. But the fastest growth has come at what the North American Industry Classification System refers to as snack and nonalcoholic beverage bars, a category that likely (the BLS never says) includes national chains such as Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Smoothie King as well as the locally owned coffee shops and juice bars one now finds in virtually every American downtown.(1)
Microbreweries that serve drinks and even food generally aren’t included here, because they’re counted as manufacturers, but they’re clearly part of this phenomenon as well. Employment at breweries, wineries and distilleries was up 103,300, or 144%, from February 2010 through September, and small establishments where customers often show up in person have driven most of those gains.
Feeding and serving drinks to people outside of their home has been a business for an awfully long time, but it also appears to be a major 21st century growth industry.
(1) Data for narrower jobs categories comes out with a one-month lag, which is why this chart only goes to September."

It may be old but it’s not slowing down.
A bull market that traces its lineage to the depths of the financial crisis is revving up again, notching its fourth straight weekly gain and pushing its gain in 2019 above 22%. After wavering at mid-year amid a U.S.-China trade war and recession anxieties, American stocks are back in melt-up mode, ending three of the past five sessions at a record.
While nobody knows if it’s getting late for this decade-old rally, gains like these have been common at the tail end of bull markets past. A study by Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). on equity peaks since 1937 shows that being uninvested in the last year of an advance meant foregoing one-fifth of the rally’s overall return.
The S&P 500 powered to a new record Friday after an unexpectedly strong hiring report offered hope that the labor market can propel consumers to keep spending and extend the record-long expansion despite weak business investment and trade tensions. Stocks got a brief boost and the dollar pared losses after China’s Ministry of Commerce said trade negotiators had achieved a “consensus in principle” with the U.S.
The latest economic data come after the Fed lowered rates Wednesday and signaled it is unlikely to make further changes, up or down, any time soon. That sent stocks to a record, before a batch of weak economic data and renewed worries over trade weighed on the measure Thursday. The S&P 500 is up 1.5% in the week. Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida reiterated in Bloomberg Radio interview that monetary policy is “in a good place” and the consumer is strong.
The jobs report “reinforces the thesis that the economy is hanging in there with steady growth thanks to the consumer, jobs, low rates, strong housing and that the global picture is weak,” said Alec Young, managing director of Global Markets Research at FTSE Russell.
Friday’s good news on the trade front follows a tough Thursday session that saw markets rattled as Chinese officials cast doubts about reaching a comprehensive long-term trade deal with the U.S.
In earnings news,  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) reported solid results, while  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. rose after its report. European bonds slipped. Oil edged higher though headed for its biggest weekly loss in a month on swelling American stockpiles. Earlier, risk sentiment got a boost from better-than-expected Chinese manufacturing data, even as uncertainty remains over an interim trade deal. Gold fell after a 1% rally Thursday.
“Markets participants, as well as maybe even the Fed, have been very optimistic” on the trade truce, Tiffany Wilding, chief U.S. economist at Pacific Investment Management Co., told Bloomberg TV. “We can see some more deterioration there.”

White House Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow says additional tariffs on Chinese goods are still possible as negotiators from the U.S. and China hash out details of the potential first step in a trade accord.
“They’re still on the table until this phase one deal is completed, or worst case not completed,” Kudlow said Friday in an interview on Bloomberg Television. “The president has hinted, depending on the process of phase one, he may be willing, I say may be willing, to take a look at those tariffs.”
Principles from the world’s two largest economies including China’s Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer held meetings by phone Friday to negotiate details of a phase one deal that was announced Oct. 11.
Mnuchin and Lighthizer “had a constructive call” with Liu and discussions will continue at the deputy level, the USTR said in a statement later Friday. “They made progress in a variety of areas and are in the process of resolving outstanding issues,” according to the statement.
Kudlow’s comments came before a ruling by the World Trade Organization on Friday that awarded China permission to impose $3.6 billion in sanctions against the U.S. The case predates the tariff war between the two nations but may add a layer of tension to ongoing talks.
Negotiators are close to finishing details of the pact on China’s increased purchases of U.S. agriculture products, currency stability and opening of financial services markets to American firms, Kudlow said. They’ve also made “excellent progress” on the issue of intellectual property theft, he said. Disputes around so-called forced tech transfer will likely not be resolved until a possible phase two of the deal.
Both countries are seeking an alternate location to sign a deal, if they reach one, after Chile canceled a summit this month where President Donald Trump and China’s leader Xi Jinping were aiming to meet.

606,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 04:16PM ET</span>","Apple Requests Tariff Waivers on iPhone Parts, Watch and AirPods","(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). is seeking exclusions from President Donald Trump’s tariffs that went into effect Sept. 1 on the Apple Watch, iMac, parts for the iPhone and other components imported from China.
The company filed requests for exclusions from 15% duties on 11 products or components Thursday, the first day U.S. firms could seek relief from the tariffs on about $110 billion in Chinese imports. The iPhone maker had mixed results on its requests for exclusions from the previous round of duties.
Apple also is seeking to avoid tariffs on the HomePod, the Beats Pill+ wireless speaker, AirPods and Beats wireless earbuds, iPhone smart battery case, the charging case for AirPods and the PowerBeats, storage components for the Mac Pro, and batteries for the iPhone and MacBook, according to the request posted online.
Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said earlier this week that Apple is already paying tariffs on some products.
Exclusion decisions are based on whether a product is available only from China, is strategically important or related to Chinese industrial programs, and whether duties will “cause severe economic harm” to the company or U.S. interests.
In its requests for tariff waivers, the Cupertino, California-based company said it hasn’t identified a source outside of China that is able to meet U.S. demand for the products or components in the coming year. An Apple spokesman declined to comment Friday.
Apple made similar requests for relief from 25% duties on $200 billion in goods imposed last year. While the U.S. Trade Representative’s office denied exclusions on five Chinese-made components for the upcoming Mac Pro computer, it approved tariff waivers on 10 parts for the product.
The company announced in September it would make new Mac Pro computers at a plant in Austin, Texas -- which it has operated since 2013 -- after originally considering shifting production to China like its other products."
607,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 04:15PM ET</span>",Most Loved (and Hated) Quant Trade Lures $3 Billion to ETFs,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s one of the most polarizing strategies there is, yet betting on value stocks is back in vogue for investors in exchange-traded funds.
More than $3 billion poured into ETFs that focus on undervalued companies in October, the most this year, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show. The Vanguard Value ETF was the biggest beneficiary, adding close to a third of that amount. The fund rose 1% at 2:18 p.m. in New York Friday. Just this week, the SPDR S&P 400 Mid Cap Value ETF saw its largest inflow since December.
Buying cheap stocks has been a losing strategy for much of the last decade. The S&P 500 Growth Index has outperformed the equivalent measure of value by more than 80 basis points over that time frame, prompting some traders to declare that this style of investing is dead. But others remain convinced that the approach is due for a renaissance, particularly as the stock rally shows some fatigue after reaching a record.
“Every time the market has set a new high, something has come along to take it down,” said Stephen Cucchiaro, chief investment officer and founder of Boston-based 3Edge Asset Management, which oversees more than $900 million. “There’s a lot more upside in these undervalued markets, and we wouldn’t be chasing these overvalued markets.”
ETF investors seem to agree. While value funds added money in October, growth ETFs saw withdrawals for a fourth straight month -- the longest streak in more than three years. A gauge of value stocks outperformed growth by almost 1 percentage point in October.
For Cucchiaro, who set up 3Edge three years ago after founding an ETF-focused advisory firm that was acquired by  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp. in 2010, it’s a signal of the time to rotate. His valuation models -- which look at price versus sales, rather than the price-to-earnings ratio -- show U.S. equities are the most stretched since the late 1990s.
He’s looking overseas as a result, particularly at Japan, where Cucchiaro says policy makers are getting savvy to the importance of managing the yield curve. In the U.S., small-cap value stocks are appealing, according to him. That’s a position that Michael Burry -- whose bet against mortgage securities was depicted in “The Big Short” -- has also championed.

608,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 04:15PM ET</span>",Big Oil Earnings Provide an Opening for Aramco,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will reportedly spend the weekend musing on whether to finally pull the trigger on the world’s biggest, and most elusive, IPO. At this point, it’s impossible to say if he will finally give the thumbs up for Saudi Aramco’s debut. Yet he may take some encouragement from a Big Oil earnings week that has been, to use the old euphemism, mixed. 
All but one of the big five — BP Plc,  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX),  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)., Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc and  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) — beat earnings estimates (and even Chevron’s miss owed much to a one-off tax charge). On the other hand, analysts spent the summer lowering the bar, so the companies all won in the way all the kids win at Saturday morning soccer.
All that really matters is how much cash they’re generating and what they’re doing with it. And it’s here that things got mixed, even garbled at times — and which might provide Saudi Arabian Oil Co. an opening.
All five oil majors covered capital expenditure from internal cash flow, and all except Exxon covered dividends too. Beyond this, only Chevron and Shell have buyback programs of any appreciable size; and of the two, Chevron was able to cover that from operating cash flow.
Not bad, but problems lurked for most. Exxon’s continuing out-of-sync upswing in capex, while bearing fruit in Guyana and elsewhere, leaves it borrowing to cover dividends for now. Chevron’s numbers were much more in tune with what oil investors demand these days. However, cost inflation in its Tengiz expansion project in Kazakhstan provided an unwelcome reminder of the bad old days, when hefty capex bills pushed free cash flow sharply into the red. Chevron didn’t raise its annual capex budget, though.
Over in Europe, Total delivered a solid quarter, adding credibility to its recent dividend increase. The biggest stumbles came from Shell and  BP  (LON:BP), and their stocks were punished swiftly. Both fumbled a recalibration of investor expectations around payouts. BP was forced to clarify it hadn’t yet decided on dividends after its CFO suggested on the earnings call that a much-anticipated increase might have to wait until next year. Shell, meanwhile, distributed almost as much cash as Chevron and Exxon combined last quarter. But it ended up hosting a largely defensive analyst call after saying a weaker economic outlook could cause it to slow buybacks next year.
Shell’s drubbing was perhaps the most ominous. We expect investors to revolt if dividends are frozen or suspended. In this case, they threw up their hands at an oil major slowing prospective buybacks due to deteriorating macro conditions. If the industry needed any reminding their owners remain laser-focused on extracting more cash from them, then this provided it.
This is Aramco’s potential opportunity. I am skeptical of both the likelihood of MBS getting his desired $2 trillion valuation and even its utility. Why simultaneously cap the potential gains of ordinary Saudi shareholders and create a country-sized shorting opportunity? But recent moves to reduce Aramco’s royalty rates and to guarantee dividend payments to minorities for five years show its bankers have gotten the message from potential investors.
It is worth remembering Aramco’s IPO is in itself a sign that oil’s growth prospects are dimming. This is a big reason why energy stocks are so out of favor, with weighting in the stock market at historic lows. In all likelihood, therefore, if and when Aramco does come to market, a significant proportion of international investors deciding to buy will do so via reallocation from existing energy or emerging-market portfolio holdings, rather than injecting a lot of new money. Much as Riyadh likes to think of Aramco as being in a class of its own, it will have to compete for interest like any other oil major once it dips a toe into the public equity market.
The flip side is that the gravitational pull of an Aramco IPO presents a hazard for the oil majors, which, in this light, represent pools of capital to draw upon. That isn’t to say someone holding Exxon is bound to redeploy toward Aramco’s stock, given their differing risk profiles. But some is bound to leak away, and Aramco’s emphasis on payouts is a powerful counterargument set against these recent results. Of the five, Shell and BP look most at risk given their mixed messages on dividends next year and relatively high leverage. But Exxon, too, may struggle to prevent defections given high spending and a lack of buybacks.
Having also worked quickly to calm nerves after September’s missile attacks on its facilities, Aramco has also suppressed the higher oil prices that would bolster bigger payouts by its western rivals next year. The prince’s inexplicable fixation on that $2 trillion number may yet delay the IPO once more. But in competing for the relatively limited pool of dollars targeting energy these days, this week’s earnings from Aramco’s rivals provides good reasons to make a move."

Negative interest rates! They’re all the rage in Europe, but could this trend come to the U.S. financial system in the foreseeable future? Lauren Goodwin, an economist and multi-asset portfolio strategist at New York Life Investment Management, explains how it could happen on the latest episode of the “What Goes Up’’ podcast.“Two major things go into U.S. yields,” says Goodwin. “One of them is expectations for the Fed funds rate, which would go to zero if we move into a recession in the U.S.; The other thing is the term premium.”
“What makes term premiums zero or even negative, as they’ve been in the U.S. even this year, are things like investor fears; some of the concerns we’ve seen about global growth, trade wars,” she says. “So if you see the U.S. inch a little closer to recession and see some of these fears take hold, you could easily see negative U.S. yields.’’

A bankruptcy judge approved the sale of Barneys brands and other intellectual property to Authentic Brands, a firm that acquires and licenses brands, on Thursday. The deal closed on Friday, Authentic Brands said. 
The store's well-known eatery, Fred's, will also remain open.
""We have come to terms with Authentic Brands Group, Barneys new owner, to keep the Madison Avenue store open in a smaller footprint for the next 12 months while we continue to explore longer term solutions,"" Daniel Levy, president of real estate investment firm Ashkenazy Acquisition Corp, the store's landlord, said in a statement on Friday. 
Levy said the New York store generates about $20 million in annual profitability for Barneys, even with a recent raise in rent.  
A cultural touchstone for generations of New Yorkers and followers of fashion, Barneys filed for bankruptcy protection in August, citing rent hikes as a factor. 
Authentic Brands, which bid roughly $271 million for Barneys, said it will turn the Madison Avenue location into a pop-up store.
The firm plans to license the Barneys brand to Hudson's Bay Co (TO:HBC) owned Saks Fifth Avenue and will open shops in Saks locations across the United States and Canada. 
That will start with an attempted Barneys reboot on the fifth floor of the Saks Fifth Avenue location in Manhattan. Remaining Barneys stores are expected to close. 

""Over the past several months, we have worked diligently with the court, our lenders and creditors to maximize the value of the Barneys assets and we're pleased to have reached the conclusion of this process,"" Barneys said in a statement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks climbed on Friday as the S&P hit an intraday record for the fourth time this week after an upbeat U.S. jobs report and data on Chinese manufacturing lessened concerns about slowing global growth.
Job growth slowed less than forecast in October, as a drag from a strike at General Motors (N:GM) was made up for in other areas of the labor market, while job gains in the prior two months were stronger than previously thought.
""It's really good. The market should like it because obviously with the GM strike, manufacturing being affected by that, it is a very nice report and one people should be pretty excited about overall,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.
The strong jobs number helped overshadow a report that showed the manufacturing sector contracted for a third straight month.
Along with the S&P's new high, the Nasdaq topped its July intraday record after both indexes closed out October with their best monthly performance since June as quarterly earnings have come in stronger than anticipated and U.S.-China trade rhetoric has appeared productive.
Prior to the jobs report, sentiment was supported by data showing China manufacturing activity unexpectedly expanded in October, easing concerns about a slowdown in demand from the world's second-largest economy as a result of U.S. tariffs.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 250.48 points, or 0.93%, to 27,296.71, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 24.68 points, or 0.81%, to 3,062.24 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 73.29 points, or 0.88%, to 8,365.65.
U.S.-China trade news remained supportive for stocks, as Beijing's state-media Xinhua News Agency reported the two countries have ""reached consensus on principles."" Earlier, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the ""phase one"" trade pact with China appeared in good shape.
About 76% of the 356 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data.
However, profit growth forecasts for the next four quarters have been revised lower, even as expectations for a decline in third-quarter earnings have shrunk to 0.8% from 2.2% at the start of October.
Oil major  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) rose 2.70% after it beat recently lowered third-quarter profit expectations. The energy sector (SPNY) gained 2.29% as the best-performing S&P sector, and oil prices jumped on trade deal progress.
 Qorvo Inc  (O:QRVO) jumped 19.71% after the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier announced a $1 billion share buy-back plan and forecast third-quarter revenue above expectations.
But  Pinterest Inc  (N:PINS) plunged 16.39% after the online scrapbook company missed quarterly revenue estimates.
 Arista Networks  Inc (N:ANET) slumped 24.80% after the cloud infrastructure supplier forecast current-quarter revenue much below Wall Street expectations.

Last week, members of the United Auto Workers ratified a new four-year labor deal, ending the strike that began on Sept. 16 over higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits.
Below are companies impacted by the strike:
AMERICAN AXLE & MANUFACTURING HOLDINGS INC
The driveline and drivetrain systems maker said the strike reduced third-quarter sales by $57 million and also warned of an about $250 million hit to full-year revenue, prompting the company to lower its 2019 forecast.
APTIV PLC
The auto parts maker said the strike wiped off $70 million from the company's revenue and reduced profit by 10 cents per share in the third quarter.
The company's full-year forecast includes an estimated $250 million impact from the GM strike.
TENNECO INC
The auto parts maker expects the strike to have a negative impact of about $35 million on fourth-quarter EBITDA.
AK STEEL HOLDING CORP
The company cut its forecast for full-year earnings and flat-rolled steel shipments, citing the strike.
It predicted a reduction of flat-rolled steel shipments to between 5.3 and 5.4 million tons for the full year, citing the strike.
KAISER ALUMINUM CORP
The company said it had lower-than-expected automotive shipments in the third quarter, partly due to the GM strike, and flagged a potential $3 million to $6 million EBITDA impact.
PULTEGROUP INC
The U.S. homebuilder said it saw an impact on demand in many of Midwest markets from the lengthy labor dispute.
GENTEX CORP
The automatic-dimming rearview mirror maker said the GM strike hit third-quarter net sales by about 2%.
Gentex also lowered its full-year sales forecast, and said it expects about $7 million to $8 million in lost sales per week of the strike.
PAM TRANSPORTATION SERVICES
The U.S. truckload services provider said the GM-UAW strike impacted its quarterly earnings.
LINAMAR CORP
The Canadian auto parts maker said it estimated a profit impact of up to C$1 million ($761,035) per day due to a fall in orders from General Motors."

Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) acquired Fitbit in a deal that valued the wearables company at $2.1 billion, or $7.35 a share. And now traders are asking whether other hardware makers like GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), maker of the Hero line of action cameras and Karma drones, will be snapped up, too.
It is not the first time that GoPro has been touted as an acquisition target. Tech giants Xiaomi and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were rumored to be circling GoPro last year in an effort to expand their push into the wearables market. But both have so far decided to take a pass.
Many believe an acquisition for GoPro is not a matter of if, but when. With a balance sheet of a lot of debt and continuing losses, the company could do with some financial strengthening.
Speculative bets aside, investors will have the opportunity to get a deeper look at the action-camera maker when it reports third-quarter earnings after the market closes on Nov. 7.
But investor sentiment ahead of earnings has taken a hit after the company recently downgraded its full-year guidance for 2019, blaming a production delay for its new HERO8 Black camera.
GoPro is up just 3.5% for the year so far and has an average price target of $5.50, according to consensus estimates from Investing.com."

(Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc-owned Google will buy Fitbit Inc for $2.1 billion, as the biggest Web search company looks to take on Apple and Samsung in the crowded market for fitness trackers and smart watches.
Google said on Friday that it sees an opportunity to introduce its own wearable devices and invest more in digital health. The purchase will also bring a rich trove of health data gathered by millions of Fitbit's devices. 
Fitbit's fitness trackers and other devices monitor users' daily steps, calories burned and distance traveled. They also measure floors climbed, sleep duration and quality, and heart rate.
Fitbit's share of the fitness tracking market has been threatened by deeper-pocketed companies such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd as well as cheaper offerings from China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] and Xiaomi Corp.
""We believe Google is a natural fit. The deep health and fitness data, coupled with the 28 million active users on the Fitbit platform, offer a tremendous value,"" Craig Hallum analysts wrote in a note.
Xiaomi dominates the global wearables market, with a 17.3% market share in the second quarter of 2019, followed by Apple. Fitbit owns 10% of the market, according to data from market research firm International Data Corp.
Reuters first reported the deal on Monday. 
HEALTH DATA
Fitbit, which helped pioneer the wearable devices craze, has been partnering with health insurers and has been making tuck-in acquisitions in the healthcare market, as part of efforts to diversify its revenue stream. Analysts have said that much of the company's value may now lie in its health data.
U.S. antitrust regulators have little reason to oppose Alphabet's plans to buy Fitbit, but that does not mean that U.S. officials, backed by a bevy of anti-Google lawmakers, will not give the proposed purchase extra scrutiny. 
Google is already under antitrust investigation by the Justice Department, the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee and dozens of state attorneys general for allegedly using its massive market power to crush smaller competitors.
Fitbit has raised privacy concerns in the past: In 2011, the sexual activity of people using the health and fitness tracker was found to be publicly accessible online.
The company said on Friday that its users' health and wellness data would not be used for Google ads. Google said in a blog post that it would give Fitbit users the choice to review, move or delete their data. 
Google, which has been defending its privacy practices after a number of regulatory probes, said it would be transparent about the data it collects for its devices and would not sell that data.
Fitbit brings to the deal partnerships it has struck with some large drug companies. In October, Fitbit announced a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Co and  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) on early detection of irregular heartbeat, or atrial fibrillation, on its devices.
Fitbit in August also launched its latest smart watch, Versa 2, adding Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's voice assistant Alexa, online payments and music storage to the device's capabilities. 
Fitbit has been offered $7.35 per share in cash, the company said, a premium of about 19% to the stock's closing price on Thursday. The company's shares were trading up 15% at $7.11. Shares of Alphabet were nearly flat at $1,263.18. 
The company's shares have gained more than 40% since Reuters reported on Monday that Google had made an offer for Fitbit. 

Qatalyst Partners LLP was financial adviser to Fitbit on the deal, which is expected to close in 2020. Fenwick & West LLP was the legal adviser.

623,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 12:07PM ET</span>",China may impose $3.58 billion in annual trade sanctions on U.S.: WTO panel,"GENEVA (Reuters) - A World Trade Organization (WTO) panel said on Friday that China was entitled to slap compensatory sanctions on U.S. imports worth $3.579 billion annually for the U.S. failure to remove anti-dumping duties - roughly half the amount China had sought.
The decision came as the world's two biggest economies try to clinch Phase 1 of a trade deal. President Donald Trump and U.S. negotiators are ""very optimistic"" about concluding it, White House adviser Larry Kudlow said.
In the WTO ruling, a three-member arbitration panel said Chinese exporters suffered impairment to trade valued at $3.579 billion annually. China may now ask the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body for a green light to impose the retaliatory tariffs on imported U.S. goods valued up to that amount each year.
China told the WTO in September 2018 that it had suffered $7.043 billion in damages annually due to U.S. anti-dumping duties ruled illegal by a WTO panel in 2016 and later upheld. China therefore requested permission to raise trade barriers on U.S. goods to the same amount, as allowed under WTO rules.
As the Trump administration objected to the amount, the issue was sent to arbitration.
The case relates to U.S. dumping duties on industries including machinery and electronics, light industry, metals and minerals, and the U.S. Commerce Department's way of calculating the amount of ""dumping"" - Chinese exports that are priced to undercut American-made goods on the U.S. market.
The U.S. calculation method, known as ""zeroing”, tended to increase the level of U.S. anti-dumping duties on foreign producers and was repeatedly ruled to be illegal in a series of trade disputes brought to the WTO. 

The U.S. Trade Representative's office in Washington had no immediate response.

624,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 11:48AM ET</span>",Three flight attendant unions voice alarm after 737 MAX hearings,"By Tracy Rucinski 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Unions representing flight attendants at the three U.S. airlines that operate Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX said they are more reluctant to support the grounded jet's return after congressional hearings this week on its development.
Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) and United Airlines (O:UAL) flight attendant union leaders joined colleagues' demands for an active role in regulators' and airlines' decisions to let the 737 MAX fly again after two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. 
The two unions spoke after news that the head of American Airlines' (O:AAL) flight attendants union had sent Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg a letter saying that the Washington hearings raised questions about 737 MAX supervision and oversight.
""The emails, the testimony... it all leads to more questions than answers,"" Chad Kleibscheidel of the Southwest flight attendants union said in reference to employee memos about the aircraft's safety before it was certified in 2017 that came to light during back-to-back hearings.
Southwest is the world's largest 737 MAX operator and has over 15,000 flight attendants trained to fly the aircraft.
Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents flight attendants at 20 airlines including United, said: ""This week took a step backward in this process, not forward.""
Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe said in an emailed statement that the company is committed to providing flight attendants, pilots and its airline customers the information they need to re-earn their trust and that of the traveling public.
Southwest and United executives have told Reuters that flight attendants - along with pilots, call center agents and gate agents - will play a key role in defending the jet to passengers once it is approved to fly again.
U.S. flight attendants were among the groups that called for the Federal Aviation Administration to ground the 737 MAX after an Ethiopian Airlines jet nose-dived after taking off from Addis Ababa on March 10, five months after a similar crash on a Lion Air flight in Indonesia. The two crashes killed 346 people.
Southwest, United and American are scheduling without the 737 MAX into early next year as the plane approaches a nine-month grounding, causing thousands of canceled flights for each airline and a hit to profit.
Southwest pilots have sued Boeing for lost wages during the grounding.
""Flight attendants have taken a big hit to their salaries too,"" said Kleibscheidel, who is first vice president of the Southwest flight attendants union, Transport Workers Local 556 .
""People have bills to pay and mouths to feed. No planes, no pay.""

625,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 11:28AM ET</span>",Not just the MAX: planemakers face slump in demand for wide-body jets,"By Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - Orders for long-distance wide-body jets are on track to fall this year by the most since the throes of the 2008 financial crisis, fuelling concerns that the drop will eat into future cash flow at Boeing (N:BA) and its European rival Airbus (PA:AIR).
Boeing, heavily hit by this year by the grounding of its single-aisle 737 MAX planes, said last month it would cut production of its bigger 787 Dreamliners in late 2020 due to a drought of orders from China, the world's second largest market by passenger air traffic.
This means over $1 billion (£772 million) less in annual cash flow starting in 2021, analysts estimate, and if demand remains weak, Boeing could be forced to further cut the 787 production in the next few years.
A Reuters analysis of two decades' worth of Boeing and Airbus orders data shows that when the economy weakens, orders for wide body jets, more expensive and with longer delivery times, fall more than those for smaller jets.
Graphic: Net industry orders for commercial aircraft - https://graphics.reuters.com/AIRCRAFT-ORDERS/0100B2L41YZ/Net-industry-orders.jpg
""Demand for wide-body aircraft remains soft and is unlikely to improve while the world continues to slow down,"" Berenberg analyst Andrew Gollan says. 
That bodes ill for both planemakers since wide-body aircraft is a higher margin business. 
At over $200 million, the 787s and Airbus A350s cost twice as much as smaller planes and analyst estimate they generate about half of commercial aircraft gross profits while only accounting for a quarter of their sales.
Between January and September, combined net orders for Boeing and Airbus wide-body jets fell by 56.4% to 105 planes. If the trend continues, the annual drop could be nearly as bad as a 70% plunge in 2009, the data suggest.
Graphic: Year-on-year sales for Boeing and Airbus - https://graphics.reuters.com/AIRCRAFT-ORDERS/0100B2L51Z1/Boeing-vs-airbus.jpg
While Boeing is bound to be hit harder if the worldwide ban on its 737 MAX after two crashes that killed hundreds continues, analysts expect it to compete fiercely for wide-body orders, which in turn could pressure Airbus' margins and possibly hurt its cash flow.
""Boeing will almost certainly compete more aggressively,"" Berenberg's Gollan says. ""If demand does not improve in the coming years it maybe even force (Airbus) to look at production rates.""

HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) reported a 36% drop in third-quarter profit on Friday, hit by lower oil and gas prices and refining margins, and warned higher costs would affect results in its current quarter, sending shares lower. 
Results mirrored weaker earnings at  BP  (LON:BP) Plc and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), which indicated they might delay dividend increases or a buyback program due to low prices.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) earlier on Friday reported its profits fell by nearly half from a year ago, citing lower oil and gas prices.
""Lower crude oil and natural gas prices more than offset"" production increases, Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in a statement.
Chevron's profit fell to $2.58 billion, or $1.36 per share, in the quarter, from $4.05 billion, or $2.11 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges and foreign currency gains, the company said it earned $1.55 per share, exceeding the $1.45 per share expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv IBES.
""This was a solid quarter for the company,"" said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones, with cash from operations exceeding spending on major projects and shareholder dividends. ""We expect robust cash returns to shareholders to continue, she added. 
However, the company offered a tepid outlook for the fourth quarter, saying it expected full-year oil and gas production to fall in the middle of its forecast increase of 4% to 7%. 
It also warned that overall costs for a giant oil project in Kazakhstan would rise 25% to $45.2 billion. Exxon, a partner in the field, on Friday also said costs of the Tengiz project would affect its future spending. 
Chevron shares were down less than 1% on Friday morning.
The second-largest U.S. oil company also said it expects additional costs in the fourth quarter from ""high"" refinery maintenance and from a $430 million tax payment.
Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production grew about 3% to 3.03 million barrels per day, but average sales prices fell both in the United States and internationally.

Production in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, rose 35% from the same period a year ago to 455,000 barrels of oil and gas daily, but its average U.S. liquids price was $47 per barrel, down from $62 a year ago.

628,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 10:45AM ET</span>",Aramco IPO Waits on Crown Prince as Saudi Rich Pressed to Invest,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will decide in the next two days whether there’s enough support from local investors to finally go ahead with the initial public offering of state oil producer Aramco.
Aramco is preparing to announce its intention to float on Sunday, according to people familiar with the matter. The final decision will be made by Prince Mohammed after he hears feedback from bankers who’ve been pitching the deal to investors in Saudi Arabia and beyond, the people said, asking not to be named discussing private deliberations.
“It will be a Saudi decision, first and foremost; specifically, Prince Mohammed’s decision,” Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, Saudi energy minister and the crown prince’s half-brother, said earlier this week.
An earlier plan to kick off the share sale in mid-October was shelved after international money managers balked at the $2 trillion valuation the crown prince has placed on the world’s largest oil producer.
Aramco executives held meetings with investors in London and New York over the last week, but there are few signs they are ready to pay the valuation Prince Mohammed has insisted on since 2016. If the IPO goes ahead now, it’s likely to rely heavily on money from within the kingdom.
The richest Saudi families, many of whom had members held in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton hotel during 2017’s corruption crackdown, have been pressed to commit large sums to the IPO, people with knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing private conversations.
Local asset managers, including those looking after government funds, have also been asked to make significant contributions, while domestic banks have been told to lend generously so retail investors can buy Aramco shares, the people said.
Whether that’s sufficient to get the valuation to $2 trillion remains to be seen. The prince may need to be satisfied with a figure closer to $1.7 billion, if he wants the deal to go ahead, people said.
For Prince Mohammed, getting the IPO done may be more important than achieving the valuation he initially put forward, for two reasons. First, Saudi Arabia is selling a tiny stake -- probably around 2% -- so he isn’t leaving too much money on the table by accepting a lower valuation.
Second, what happens after the IPO may matter more because the ups-and-downs of the share price will be a barometer of the Saudi economy and a successful IPO now opens the door to further sales.
“It’s very important to make sure it’s a successful IPO, where success is defined as a material price increase after flotation. Maximizing shareholder return at this stage is very secondary,” Ali Shihabi, a Saudi commentator with links to the government, said on Twitter. “Also if large numbers of Saudi retail investors participate, as is expected, it’s essential to guarantee them a good return.”
Riyadh still has ambitions to sell Aramco shares on an international exchange -- bankers have talked about London, New York and Tokyo as possibilities -- and the initial 1-2% stake IPO may be a first step in future sales. In 2016, Prince Mohammed said he wanted to sell about 5% of the company.
Even at a valuation of $1.5 trillion, the IPO would be gigantic. That would still create the world’s largest publicly traded company, far outstripping  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., the only two worth more than $1 trillion today.
It would also almost certainly mean a record share sale: selling 2% of Aramco’s equity would yield $30 billion for Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, surpassing the $25 billion raised by China’s  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. in 2014.
A successful sale is key to Prince Mohammed’s Vision 2030 plan to overhaul the Saudi economy and end the kingdom’s reliance on oil exports. The proceeds from the IPO will boost the firepower of the OPEC nation’s sovereign wealth fund, which already has investments in funds managed by Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP and SoftBank Group Corp.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and the other Wall Street giants advising Aramco haven’t given up on luring international investors to the IPO. At management meetings with fund managers in London and New York last week, the reception was mixed, according to people who attended the meetings.
Some investors saw the potential of switching their oil investments to Aramco, where rock-bottom production costs mean they’re likely to outlast less efficient producers as the world shifts away from fossil fuels. But others remain skeptical that Aramco deserves a valuation that would put their dividend yields below established public oil majors like Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM).
The company is ready and timing will depend on market conditions and be at a time of the shareholder’s choosing, Aramco said in a statement.
If Prince Mohammed decides to give the go-ahead, trading in Aramco stock will start on the Saudi Stock Exchange, the Tadawul, on Dec. 11, according to Al-Arabiya. By the end of 2019, the world’s most valuable company will no longer be listed in New York, but in Riyadh."

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) said on Friday it would book a 277 billion yen ($2.56 billion) gain in the second quarter after portfolio company  Alibaba  Group Holding (N:BABA) recorded a $9.7 billion gain related to its stake in Ant Financial.
SoftBank, which will report earnings for the July-September quarter on Nov. 6, has a 26% stake in Alibaba and said it will report the gain under income on equity method investments.
E-commerce giant Alibaba earlier on Friday reported a 260% jump in net income attributable to ordinary shareholders due to the one-time gain.

ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS Group (S:UBSG) could double the profit it makes from its American wealth management arm within a decade even as it cuts staff numbers by targeting the super-rich, the co-head of the business told Reuters.
By encouraging customers to use more lucrative services, such as loans and mandates, where the wealth manager takes more control of a client's investments, UBS could make do with significantly fewer U.S. customer advisers than the 6,600 it now employs, its co-head of wealth management, Tom Naratil, said in an interview.
""Even if our total adviser count in the U.S. drops below 6,000, it would be a group of advisers who are twice as productive as they are today, measured in revenue per adviser,"" he said.
""If we get that kind of profile, then in 5 to 10 years from now we'll have a business that could probably makes twice as much as we do today.""
Naratil heads the business alongside former  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) star manager Iqbal Khan, who joined UBS last month. While at Credit Suisse, Khan managed to double his division’s pre-tax income in just three years.
Both are considered candidates to succeed Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti in the years ahead.
In the U.S. market, UBS defines the high net worth segment as starting at roughly $1 million in investable assets. Over time, that threshold may rise to $5 million, so clients with $5-100 million would be served by its core adviser group.
It is shifting to a model in which those with more than $100 million to invest would be served primarily in partnership with UBS's family office consultants.
Last year UBS made a pretax profit of just over $1.5 billion in wealth management in North and South America, significantly more than in any other region. It was $6.4 billion across the group.    The bank announced its focus on the American market at an investor conference a year ago. Outside the United States, UBS is already heavily involved in the super-rich business.
In the highly competitive U.S. market, the focus has been on wealthy individuals with assets of up to $100 million. Now UBS explicitly wants to address super-rich people with even more money.    New advisers which UBS is wooing from rivals such as JP Morgan (N:JPM) or Goldman Sachs (N:GS) should also help with this growth.
But UBS is being selective, Naratil said. The number of U.S. advisers has shrunk in recent years.
In the first three quarters of 2019 UBS recorded outflows of $8 billion in the Americas region, but much of this is linked to less-wealthy customers with whom UBS also earns less, according to people close to the matter."

638,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 09:06AM ET</span>","Procter & Gamble, rivals take refills into beauty aisle","By Siddharth Cavale and Richa Naidu
LONDON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Under pressure to reduce environmental waste from single-use containers, major consumer companies including Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG),  Unilever  Plc (L:ULVR) and The Body Shop are rolling out more products in refillable form. 
P&G, with roughly $68 billion in annual revenue, said it has invested millions in creating and testing refills for detergents over the years and is now trying to push in to mainstream beauty and body care refills – which are virtually unheard of.
It recently began offering some Olay face-cream jars with refill pouches on Olay.com, telling Reuters it has plans to expand the sales of the pouches in Europe early next year. ""We're learning on our legs so I don't know that we're in a position to say, 'Hey, here's the magic to selling refills,'"" P&G spokesman Damon Jones said.
Beauty products retailer The Body Shop, owned by Brazil's Natura Cosmeticos SA (SA:NATU3), says it plans to roll out ""refill stations"" in its stores globally next year, allowing shoppers to buy reusable metal containers to fill with Body Shop shower gels or creams. The company had offered refills at its stores in the early 1990s, but discontinued them in 2003, citing a lack of consumer demand. 
Unilever, which has set targets for reducing and recycling plastic by 2025, in October announced the planned launch of ""refill sticks"" of deodorants under its Dove line of personal care products on Loopstore.com. The website, operated by recycling company TerraCycle, offers consumers the chance to buy some household products in ultra-durable packaging with refills delivered to their doors, milkman-style. 
Across the consumer goods industry, results for refillable products have been mixed so far as many shoppers are far too set in their ways to be easily weaned from living in a throwaway culture. While refills are less expensive to purchase - generally priced at 20% to 30% less per item than the containers they are aimed to replenish, according to Unilever - shoppers have so far, for the most part, failed to snap them up, the companies said.
CONSUMER APATHY VS. CONSUMER PRESSURE
SC Johnson & Son Inc, marketer of Windex and Pledge, said refills and concentrates so far have not played well with either Americans or Europeans over the decade they have been offered, with unit sales of such products pretty much flat. It pulled concentrated refills for Shout stain remover off the shelves because they were not selling very well. 
In 2010, Unilever put 20-liter tanks to dispense detergents in Walmart Inc's (N:WMT) British supermarket chain Asda, and provided flexible pouches for customers to refill. But with leaky machines, safety and maintenance problems and the high costs of upkeep, Unilever said the tests fell short of expectations. Asda was also unhappy because the tanks occupied a lot of space.
""None of them sell very well – it is a convenience issue,"" SC Johnson CEO Fisk Johnson told Reuters. Johnson said some people find it painstaking to wash and refill bottles themselves while others worry that smaller bottles filled with concentrates are less ""bang-for-your-buck"" than the larger ones they have used for years. 
Still, the privately held company said it was expanding its refill offerings this year to address concerns surrounding plastic waste and is also testing refill stations for cleaning products with UK retailer Waitrose, owned by Britain's John Lewis [JLPLC.UL]. The Waitrose tests are showing the first signs of progress in refill sales, Johnson said, and the company is now thinking of expanding the project. 
Even if consumers are comfortable using refills for some household goods, it is more complicated to sell them for products like Pantene shampoo and Olay creams, P&G spokesman Jones said. For instance, with beauty products, the look and feel of packaging is a big factor in creating and maintaining customer loyalty, while delivering an environmental benefit, he said. 
Some shoppers say they want to buy refillable products, but that the offerings are not available at many stores. Earlier this year, dozens of consumers took to social media to urge The Body Shop to bring back its refill counters.
“Refill, refill, refill!"" Twitter user @JaiChipperfield said on July 22, joining a thread in which several other shoppers demanded the return of refills. ""Seems to me that judging by these comments your customers want to see the return of refills,"" @JaiChipperfield added. ""Me too, it would be brilliant to see that return.”
The Body Shop eventually responded to those pleas.

""Now with the renewed focus on sustainability, we believe it is the right time to return with it,"" Body Shop spokeswoman Lucy Muircroft told Reuters this week.

Shares of the Chicago, Illinois-based drugmaker rose nearly one percent to $80 before the bell.
In June, AbbVie announced a $63 billion deal for Botox-maker Allergan Plc (N:AGN), in a bid to diversify its drug pipeline amid growing threats to Humira's longevity.
The world's top-selling drug, which treats rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, has come under pressure from cheaper rivals in Europe and faces patent expiration in the United States - its biggest market, in 2023.
Humira sales was about $20 billion last year and the drug has accounted for the bulk of AbbVie's revenue for years. 
In the quarter ended Sept. 30, Humira sales dipped 3.7% to $4.94 billion, hurt by biosimilar competition outside the United States, but beat estimates of $4.89 billion, according to five analysts polled by Refinitiv IBES.
Sales of cancer drug Imbruvica rose nearly 30% to $1.26 billion, ahead of estimates of $1.19 billion.
AbbVie raised the lower end of its 2019 adjusted earnings per share forecast by 8 cents to $8.90, while maintaining the top end at $8.92. 
Net earnings fell to $1.88 billion, or $1.26 per share, from $2.75 billion, or $1.81 per share, a year earlier, as research and development costs soared and the company took a charge related to assets acquired as part of an acquisition in 2016. 
Excluding items, AbbVie earned $2.33 per share, above the average analyst estimate of $2.30.
Total revenue rose nearly 3% to $8.48 billion, beating estimates of $8.38 billion.
AbbVie said it still expects the deal for Allergan to close early next year and that both companies were cooperating with regulators after receiving a request for more information from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in September.

642,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 07:52AM ET</span>",Analysts slam Shell over buyback delay warning,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Analysts on Friday slammed Royal Dutch Shell's (L:RDSa) warning of possible delays to its $25 billion share buyback as an unnecessary step that undermines the energy giant's management. 
Shell, the world's second-largest listed oil and gas company, saw its shares close more than 4% lower on Thursday, wiping out $10 billion of its market value. It had earlier reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter profits which were, however, overshadowed by Chief Executive Ben van Beurden's warning about shareholder returns.
""The prevailing weak macroeconomic conditions and challenging outlook inevitably create uncertainty about the pace of reducing gearing to 25% and completing the share buyback program within the 2020 timeframe,"" van Beurden said.
In a call with analysts on Thursday, van Beurden sought to play down the warning, saying Shell still intended to complete the buyback on schedule by the end of 2020.
That did little to ease investor concerns.
""The planned $25 billion share buyback before end-2020 was acknowledged by the CEO as a 'statement of the obvious.' We agree but it had a predictable and in our view unnecessary impact,"" UBS analyst Jon Rigby said in a note. 
The comments, Rigby said, ""are likely to exasperate long-suffering investors further"". Rigby retains a 'buy' recommendation for Shell.
Shell, the most profitable oil major in 2018 ahead of larger rival ExxonMobil (N:XOM), has in recent years been many investors' top pick among the group after the Anglo-Dutch firm cut costs and ramped up commitments for shareholder returns.
Shell plans to boost payouts to investors through dividends and share buybacks to $125 billion between 2021 and 2025.
Bernstein analyst Oswald Clint said van Beurden was being over-cautious.
""We've no doubt reiterating our buy on Shell is like talking to the wall today and it's a blow for one of our 2019 top picks,"" Clint said in a note.
 BP  (LON:BP) on Tuesday also indicated that its expected dividend boost was now likely to happen next year and not by the end of 2019.
After a decade of weakness, concerns over the ability of the world's top oil companies to boost shareholder returns compound worries about the sector as investors shun independent oil and gas producers, particularly U.S. shale firms.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Martijn Rats said he now assumed the buyback program would be completed a year later than planned. 
Given the economic environment and expected decline in cash generation, Shell will be able to cover its $15 billion dividend commitment from its operations, leaving little room for buybacks and debt reduction, Rats said.
Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel said Shell's ""management credibility has now been strained"". Gammel retained his ""buy"" recommendation on Shell, ""with somewhat less enthusiasm"". 
Shell shares were up 0.6% at 1004 GMT.
U.S. rivals Exxon and  Chevron  (N:CVX) report third-quarter results on Friday.

646,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 07:33AM ET</span>",One Sector Is Building Strength Amid Slow Growth,"(Bloomberg) -- If you had to guess which stocks are posting top gains given this year’s gloomy economic outlook, you might be surprised by the answer.
Construction and material shares, despite most macro indicators pointing to slowing global growth, are now leading the pack in Europe. The sector’s up 32% already this year, knocking food-and-drinks stocks off the pedestal, and there appear few signs of the rally stopping anytime soon.
If financial markets are about pricing future growth and risks, then the sector has held up well against recession fears, trade tensions and political woes like Brexit. That’s because construction markets have been resilient in Europe and the U.S., as have good industry fundamentals, according to Citi analysts. They cite lower fuel cost and supply-side consolidation in particular.
Looking at the current relative valuation of members in the Stoxx 600 Construction & Materials Index, it’s still some way away from its 10-year average, suggesting more room for gains.
While the sector offers an estimated dividend yield in the region of 3%, lower than the broader market, it’s still more attractive than some other sectors for investors in search of stable returns in a low-yield environment.
“Companies have continued to deliver mid-single digit growth in revenue and Ebitda this year, while most cyclical sectors have seen significant earnings downgrade,” Citi analyst Ephrem Ravi writes in a note, keeping a bullish view on construction materials. He expects companies to keep delivering positive earnings as U.S. and Europe construction markets remain in “good shape.”
Indeed, the earnings season so far hasn’t derailed the upward trend. Updates from large caps Vinci, LafargeHolcim, Assa Abloy, Sika, Geberit and Saint-Gobain have been reassuring about the demand in the sector. The low-rate environment also provides support, with some construction companies using relatively high leverage.
Looking at the table below, analysts are split on the upside left for the seven biggest components of the index. Saint Gobain (PA:SGOB), LafargeHolcim and  CRH  (LON:CRH) remain the most favored stocks, they are also the cheapest ones in term of valuation. The seven stocks below account for about two-thirds of the index.
Not everyone is buying it. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) strategists downgraded construction materials to underweight yesterday, saying the sector is already priced for global PMI momentum to improve by more than they expect. They’re also bearish on emerging market currencies, another strong driver for the sector, and see 8% relative downside by the end of the first quarter 2020.
Data remains encouraging. This year, the U.S. housing market has provided growth support, while in Europe, construction PMIs only dipped out of expansion territory once over the last three years -- in August.
As for China, its current stimulus is focused on infrastructure spending, more good news for the sector. The construction index in October’s PMI data rose to 60.4, returning to “high-level expansion territory,” according to the National Bureau of Statistics."

648,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 07:30AM ET</span>","Danske Bank to Cut Fixed Income, Currency Jobs as Profits Falter","(Bloomberg) --   Danske Bank   A/S (CSE:DANSKE) will resort to job cuts in its fixed-income and currencies unit as part of a plan to revive profits, it said on Friday.
Details of the measures, contained in a slide that accompanied third-quarter results, show the bank is planning “short-term cost reductions of up to 15% of direct staff costs.” Danske says it hopes most of the cuts will take place through its hiring freeze and “voluntary resignations.”
The bank also used its quarterly report to lower its guidance for a second time since July in response to an increasingly tough business environment shaped by growing compliance costs and negative interest rates.
Denmark’s biggest bank, which is being investigated for money laundering across Europe and in the U.S., reported net income in the third quarter that missed analyst estimates. It now sees net income for 2019 at the lower end of its previously targeted range of 13 billion kroner ($1.9 billion) to 15 billion kroner.
Danske said that measures it’s taking to improve its efficiency “will have a significant effect on the result for 2020, for which we expect a return on shareholders’ equity in the range of 5-6%,” which is considerably lower than previous goals.
Shares in the bank opened about 4% lower when trading started in Copenhagen. The Bloomberg index of European financial stocks was little changed.
“The first nine months of 2019 were characterized by challenging interest rate levels and margins as well as higher impairment levels and an increase in costs, related especially to compliance,” Chief Executive Officer Chris Vogelzang said in a statement on Friday. “We saw a good underlying business with high customer activity and lending growth, but overall, our performance is under pressure.”
The bank’s guidance “is very low” and will disappoint shareholders, Per Hansen, an investment economist at Nordnet, said in a note. “Danske Bank is in a transition phase,” he said. “2019 won’t be great, 2020 will be worse and no one knows what will come in terms of U.S. financial penalties.”
Danske is still dealing with the fallout of its $220 billion dirty-money scandal, and investors are bracing for fines potentially in the billions of dollars. Against that backdrop, regulators have ratcheted up compliance requirements, which come on top of years of extra capital demands. Nordea Bank Abp, the biggest Nordic lender, has had to cut thousands of jobs to adapt to the tougher environment, and has recently made clear there’s more to come.
In its slide on fixed-income and currencies, Danske said the unit faces variety of headwinds including a risk that monetary easing will reduce market volatility. Net trading income fell by two-thirds from a year earlier, depressing income in Danske’s corporates and institutions division, it said.
Danske is operating under an extreme monetary environment in its home market, where interest rates have been negative for more than seven years. A number of Danske’s competitors have responded by passing negative rates on to retail depositors. But most have acknowledged the climate is making it increasingly difficult to run a traditional bank.
Danske also set new targets for 2023. The bank says it wants “to be among the top two on customer satisfaction in everything we do.” And it’s set itself a goal of achieving a return on shareholders’ equity of 9-10%, and a cost-to-income ratio in the low 50s, “by continuously improving the profitability level.” Danske maintained its dividend policy, targeting a payout of 40-60% of profits.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:
“Danske Bank’s new guidance cut is disappointing, yet 2020 should be the low point, with new 2023 targets (9-10% ROE, low-50% cost-to-income ratio) offering a return to normality. Extra anti-money-laundering costs are expected to lower 2020 ROE to 5-6% vs. consensus’ 8%, with those charges fading thereafter. Danske Bank will remain embroiled in its Estonian money-laundering scandal until clarity emerges regarding likely U.S. and domestic fines the lender faces, which we don’t expect until late 2020. Nevertheless, Danske’s $9-$10 billion of lost market capitalization -- which we attribute to the affair -- dwarfs the $2-$2.5 billion fine we ultimately expect, while its capital buffer (16.3% CET1) of about $4 billion cushions that risk. Elevated compliance costs and revenue headwinds wiped about 40% off current-year EPS consensus, but both are likely to return to improving trends after 2020.”----Philip Richards, Senior Banks Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence
Danske’s lowered guidance comes not long after the bank appointed Vogelzang as CEO. Since starting in June, he has made rebuilding trust in the bank a top priority. His predecessor, Thomas Borgen, was fired last year and has since had preliminary criminal charges brought against him, along with a number of other former executives at the bank.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co on Friday named American Stephen Ma as its next finance chief and said some veteran executives were stepping down, putting a new generation in charge of a company battling to recover from plunging profits and management scandal. 
The announcement by Japan's second-largest automaker comes just weeks after it named the head of its China business, Makoto Uchida, as its next chief executive. 
Following the dramatic ouster of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn almost a year ago, Nissan has been battered by sliding profits, uncertainty over its future leadership and tensions with top shareholder  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).
The company is revamping its top ranks with younger executives, picking Ma, its global controller who turns 49 this month, as its next chief financial officer (CFO) to replace Hiroshi Karube, whose departure was also announced. 
Ma, who joined Nissan's U.S. operations in 1996 and has served as CFO of Nissan's joint venture with Chinese partner Dongfeng Motor, will join Ashwani Gupta, the 49-year-old who was appointed chief operating officer last month, in becoming the highest ranking non-Japanese at the company.
""We are trying to achieve a generational change in Nissan management,"" said a source at the company, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
They, along with Uchida, 53, and other top executives, will take on their new positions on Dec. 1.
Among those leaving is Yasuhiro Yamauchi, who was acting CEO and passed over for the top job that went to Uchida.
Nissan, whose shares have slumped about a fifth in value so far this year, also announced the departure of Hitoshi Kawaguchi, confirming an earlier Reuters report. Kawaguchi, who has been in charge of external affairs, had been seen as backing Yamauchi for the CEO position.
Both Kawaguchi and Yamauchi, septuagenarians who between them have served more than 80 years at Nissan, will leave the company at the end of the month. 
They are the latest Nissan veterans to go, after former CEO Hiroto Saikawa was forced to resign in September as directors sought a clean break with the Ghosn era. 
NEW TOP TEAM
Nissan's new executive team will face the task of lifting profits, which have hit their lowest in more than decade. 
Earnings have been undercut, particularly in the United States, a key market, by years of heavy discounts and low-margin sales to rental firms as part of a strategy to raise market share, which has cheapened Nissan's brand image.
They also need to repair Nissan's relationship with Renault, which has soured since Ghosn's arrest on charges of financial misconduct, which he denies.
One official raised concerns about a lack of experience among the new executives in managing the alliance with its French partner.
""We expect we're going to face some difficulty in dealing with Renault,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.
""We need to make solid preparations for that.""
Since Ghosn's ouster as chairman of both companies, Nissan and Renault have squabbled over the selection of Nissan's board members and executives, as well a proposed tie-up between Renault and  Fiat  Chrysler (FCA) (MI:FCHA) earlier this year, which ultimately failed.
The French automaker, which holds a 43.4% stake in Nissan after it saved the Japanese automaker from financial ruin two decades ago, for years has been pursuing closer ties with its bigger partner, only to be rebuffed by Nissan.
The latest strains have sparked investor concern about the future of the Franco-Japanese alliance at a time when car companies desperately need scale to keep up with sweeping technological changes like electric vehicles and ride-hailing.

FCA announced earlier this week it was in talks to merge with Renault rival PSA (PA:PEUP) to create the world's fourth-largest automaking group, closing in on the Renault-Nissan alliance, which ranks among the top three.

650,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 07:22AM ET</span>",AIG third-quarter profit misses estimates,"(Reuters) - Insurer American International Group Inc (N:AIG) missed analysts' estimates for third-quarter profit on Friday due to weakness in its life and retirement business.
Pre-tax income from the business fell 9% to $646 million as it booked a $143 mln charge related to a review of its actuarial assumption.
The company is among a number of life insurers that typically conduct reviews every third quarter of assumptions they made when writing policies many years ago.
Excluding the impact from the actuarial review, adjusted pre-tax income at the unit fell 3% due to elevated mortality and lower alternative investment returns, the company said.
On an adjusted basis, the company posted a profit of 56 cents per share, well below analysts' expectations for a profit of $1 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
AIG's net income attributable to common shareholders was $648 million, or 72 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss $1.26 billion, or $1.41 per share, a year earlier. https://reut.rs/36r6qzt
AIG's net pretax catastrophe loss narrowed to $511 million in the quarter from $1.6 billion a year earlier.
The company, one of the largest insurers in the United States, also reported a narrower underwriting loss in its general insurance business - $249 million from $1.73 billion last year.
The insurer's general insurance accident year combined ratio, excluding changes from losses incurred in past years, was 95.9, compared with 99.4 a year earlier."

By 7:10 AM ET, Dow futures were up 45 points or 0.2%, with the S&P 500 Futures and the Nasdaq 100 futures contracts rising in parallel. The latter continues to be well supported by heavyweight earnings this week and an optimistic outlook for 2020 for the chip sector from Korean bellwether Samsung (KS:005930). 
However, there's little chance of a fresh run at new record highs ahead of the labor market report, where the headline nonfarm hiring number is expected to fall to 89,000 from 136,000 in September. Analysts warn that number is likely to be skewed by the General Motors' strike, but the long-term trend has inevitably been to a slowdown in hiring as the pool of available labor shrinks, with unemployment at a 50-year low. 
Among companies reporting Friday, Colgate-Palmolive reported earnings and revenue numbers largely in line with expectations, while AIG returned to profit on the back of lower catastrophe-related losses and said it was on track to deliver a return on equity of over 10% by the end of 2021. Berkshire Hathaway is also due to report before the open.
The most keenly-awaited earnings will arguably be those of Exxon Mobil and Chevron, which will update on their outlook for 2020 as well as on how they've coped with the decline in oil prices over the summer. Europe's two biggest oil majors   BP   (LON:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) both warned earlier this week about the impact of the global economic slowdown on their businesses. 
Elsewhere, the dollar weakened on hopes that the global economy may be bottoming out. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell to a 10-day low overnight before rebounding slightly to be down 0.1% at 97.100. 
U.S. Crude oil futures rose 0.3 to $54.45 a barrel, while gold futures eased 0.1% after strong gains on Thursday to $1.512.75 a troy ounce. "
652,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 07:13AM ET</span>",Why Brazil's bid to lure low cost airlines may be doomed,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian government officials this week tempted airline executives with a pitch: Latin America's largest domestic aviation market is opening up and it badly needs more competition.
Promises abounded to lure low-cost carriers to fly domestic routes.
The infrastructure minister promised to double the number of passengers in Brazil's skies. A monopoly on jet fuel by government-controlled Petrobras (SA:PETR4) is set to end. An $18 fee charged on every international flight ticket was scrapped.
But many industry veterans say that the new promises and recent reforms are not enough, and the country remains an unattractive money pit littered with barriers.
""It won't happen under the current conditions,"" Peter Cerda, vice president for the Americas at industry group IATA, told Reuters. ""You can have infrastructure. You can be the largest market in the continent. But if you're costly, (new airlines) aren't going to come.""
Brazil transported 118 million passengers in 2018, 20% more than Mexico, Latin America's No. 2 market.
However, experts say airlines in Brazil struggle with sky high fuel taxes, labor costs and legal liabilities - as well as lack of access to the coveted Congonhas airport in Sao Paulo, where the landing slots are fully booked.
Brazil's domestic market is controlled by just three airlines who dominate Congonhas' schedule, meaning a new competitor would have to find its footing elsewhere, a hard pill to swallow.
Those already operating in the country are not particularly profitable. Brazilian carriers lost 10.5 billion reais ($2.62 billion) in the last five years, according to L.E.K, a consulting firm, while local executives do not strike an encouraging tone.
Brazil has historically housed two or three domestic carriers but recently had four, until Avianca Brasil folded in May. Eleven airlines - including former flag carrier Varig - have failed in Brazil so far this century.
""So, is it the case that only incompetent people are in charge in our industry?,"" asked sarcastically Paulo Kakinoff, chief executive of Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (SA:GOLL4), describing the failure rate as ""terrifying.""
Gol, Brazil's largest domestic airline, has lost 9 billion reais since 2008. The market's No. 2 carrier, LATAM Airlines Group (SN:LTM), lost 440 million reais in Brazil in 2018.
To be sure, Brazil has made significant free-market reforms aimed at lowering costs. It has cleared the way for foreigners to establish domestic airlines in Brazil, although only one airline group has publicly expressed interest: Spain's Globalia. Brazil is also privatizing many airports and most of its states have lowered their jet fuel taxes.
""Welcome to the land of freedom, welcome to Brazil,"" said Jose Ricardo Botelho, the director of the airlines regulator, on Sunday at a conference held by a regional industry group.
LOW COSTS WELCOME
Brazil has set its sights on attracting so-called ultra low cost airlines, which can disrupt the market.
The country's Civil Aviation Secretary, Ronei Glanzmann, told Reuters this week that he has been courting Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC), Indigo Partners' JetSMART, Mexico's Volaris (MX:VOLARA) and Chile's Sky Airline. He also met with JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU).
Glanzmann said he was ""very optimistic"" but acknowledged that so far no commitments had been made.
Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said on Twitter on Wednesday that low-cost carriers would arrive ""soon... lowering prices on domestic flights.""
Brazil has already lured some ultra low cost airlines to fly internationally, including Norwegian, Sky Airline and JetSMART.
But international routes are exempted from jet fuel taxes, unlike domestic flights, and cheaper operational costs in the destinations abroad help keep costs below those for serving Brazil exclusively.
Fares in Brazil are at historic lows, averaging $100 each way in 2018. Gol averaged $88. But expenses are high, preventing the efficiencies that allow carriers like Ireland's Ryanair Holdings (I:RYA) to turn a profit.
""The difference is that Ryanair can make money at $88 a ticket and Gol cannot,"" said Carlos Ozores, from consulting firm ICF.
Gol does not think fares can fall much more.
""I don't think that sustainably a competitor could produce much lower costs than ours,"" Kakinoff said on a conference call with investors on Thursday.
In 2018, airlines in Latin America lost $1.70 for each passenger they transported, according to L.E.K, making it the worst performing airline region in the world. Compare that with the most profitable region: North America, at $14.70 per passenger.
Losing $5.20 per passenger, the worst performing market of all those surveyed was Brazil.
This year, ALTA forecasts that airlines in Latin America on average will make $0.50 per passenger.
""Our profits won't even pay for the coffee that we serve on board, even if we serve it without milk,"" said Pedro Heilbron, chief executive of Panama's Copa Airlines (N:CPA)."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - IndiGo  (NS:INGL) must replace all Pratt & Whitney (P&W) engines on its fleet of 97 twin-engined Airbus A320neo family aircraft with new P&W power units, India's air safety watchdog said on Friday following recent inflight engine shutdowns.
The incidents have caused ""serious concern"" and the decision to order the engines be replaced was taken after ""considerable deliberations,"" the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said in a statement.
""You will appreciate that four successive events have not happened ever before and therefore, we call for urgent and effective action. We regret the inconvenience but we need desperate measures to put things in order,"" the DGCA said.
""This situation cannot be allowed to go on indefinitely,"" it said, adding that the engines would need to be replaced by Jan. 31, 2020.
IndiGo is Airbus' (PA:AIR) biggest client for A320neo planes.
While the United Technologies' (N:UTX) Pratt & Whitney engines are fuel efficient there have been issues since they entered into service in 2016, forcing the airline to ground its planes several times.
The groundings have cost IndiGo, which last month posted its biggest-ever quarterly loss after being forced to lease aircraft to replace planes grounded with engine issues.
On Monday the DGCA ordered IndiGo and domestic rival GoAir to modify 29 Airbus A320neo aircraft fitted with Pratt & Whitney engines within 15 days to avoid them being grounded."

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) shares fell more than 4% on Friday after the troubled lender said its annual profit would come in at the low end of forecasts, and unveiled plans to get costs and compliance under control by 2023.
Denmark's biggest lender has seen thousands of customers flee and its chief executive depart since reports emerged in 2017 of its involvement in one of the world's biggest money-laundering scandals via its Estonia branch.
The bank now expects annual net profit to come in at the lower end of its previously announced 13 billion to 15 billion Danish crown ($1.9-$2.2 billion) range.
That followed an announcement earlier this month it had initiated a hiring freeze to cope with rising compliance costs and a tough business environment, which has also prompted two cuts to its annual outlook this year.
The softer guidance came despite a 21% rise in third-quarter profits announced on Friday, above analysts' expectations.
""We saw a good underlying business with high customer activity and lending growth, but overall, our performance is under pressure,"" chief executive Chris Vogelzang said in a statement.
The bank will spend 1.5-2 billion crowns next year on cost management and digitalization, which it expects will result in a return on shareholders' equity of 5-6% next year.
The measure fell to 9.8% last year from 13.6% in 2017, and Danske said it is targeting a move back toward 9-10% by 2023.
Danske shares were trading 4.1% lower at 0921 GMT. Shares have lost about two-thirds of their value since money-laundering allegations against the bank gained pace in March last year and are trading near a 7-year low.
""Everyone needs a strategy, but I don't think the patience of market participants reaches all the way to 2023. I think investors would have liked to see changes happen at a faster pace,"" Handelsbanken analyst Thomas Eskildsen told Reuters.
""To avoid a further drop in profitability, they have to take drastic measures now.""
Danske said it would aim for a cost to income ratio in ""the low 50s"" by 2023. That came in at 58.5% in the first nine months.
Operating expenses rose by 2% in the first nine months of 2019 due to higher compliance costs and anti-money laundering activities.
""We need to be a substantially more effective bank,"" chief financial officer Jacob Aarup-Andersen told Reuters. He said the bank would ""attack"" non-employee related costs such as travel and consultancy expenses and general procurement.
It will have fewer employees by 2023, he said, but could not elaborate on which of the bank's divisions might see job cuts.
As a consequence of the money-laundering scandal, Danske has seen around 18,900 customers leave the bank in the last nine months.
""We are of course sorry that they are leaving and of course it has an economic effect, but in the larger picture, the customer outflow does not have a significant impact on our numbers,"" Aarup-Andersen said.
Separately on Friday, Russia's central bank said that it had revoked the license of Danske's Russian unit. Danske said this was ""according to plan"" after it said in February it would close banking activities in Russia and the Baltics."

The deal marks Ascendas REIT's entry into the United States, where it is buying 28 business parks located in Raleigh, Portland and San Diego. It plans to fund the acquisition mainly through a S$1.3 billion rights issue and loan facilities. 
In the rights issue, Ascendas will sell just over 498 million new units in the REIT at S$2.63 apiece, a discount of 17% to Thursday's closing price of S$3.17. It is likely to be among the largest rights issues by a Singapore REIT.
Several Singapore trusts, including  Mapletree Commercial Trust  (SI:MACT) and Keppel Pacific Oak US Reit (SI:KPEL), have raised capital over the last few months to fund their expansion plans.
Ascendas REIT's portfolio currently consists of properties in Singapore, the United Kingdom and Australia. It embarked on a major expansion into Australia in 2015 when it acquired 26 logistics properties for A$1 billion. (https://reut.rs/2PBNBUz)
Real estate developer CapitaLand said in a separate statement that it expected to realize a gain of about S$95.4 million upon completion of the deal. Including Friday's proposed deal, CapitaLand has announced divestments of more than S$5.2 billion so far this year, it said. 
Trading in Ascendas REIT units were halted ahead of the news on Friday, while CapitaLand shares were 0.8% higher.

(Reuters) - European shares rose on Friday, on track for their best day in more than a week, as a surprise bounce in China's manufacturing activity overshadowed conflicting tones surrounding a possible trade deal between the United States and China.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.3% at 0915 GMT, with China-exposed German shares (GDAXI) up 0.4%, while mining stocks (SXPP) led gains among sub-sectors following upbeat data from the world's top metals consumer.
China's factory activity unexpectedly expanded at the fastest pace in more than two years in October as new export orders rose and plants ramped up production, a private business survey showed on Friday.
""The numbers are good given it came ahead of expectations and expansion is always a welcome,"" said David Madden, an analyst at CMC markets in London.
The latest data is in contrast to an official survey published on Thursday, which showed China's factory activity shrank for the sixth straight month in October.
""The Caixin numbers do seem to be more impartial than official numbers from Beijing, so it is a welcome change, although U.S.-China trade is going to be the main focus for now.""
Conflicting signals on trade gave investors reason for caution after a Bloomberg report said Chinese officials have doubts about whether it is possible to reach a comprehensive long-term trade deal with Washington and U.S. President Donald Trump.
But Trump later said the two countries would soon announce a site where a ""Phase One"" trade deal will be signed after Chile canceled a planned summit set for mid-November that was to be the venue for a signing.
After a volatile week packed with corporate news and conflicting tones on the trade front, the benchmark index was on track to end the week slightly higher.

Indian digital payments took off when the government pushed demonetization in 2016, invalidating most of the country’s high-value currency notes in a move to curb corruption and push Indians away from cash. The Unified Payments Interface or UPI has now surpassed a 100 million users three-and-a-half years after its launch, thanks to booming smartphone use and wireless data rates among the lowest in the world.
Amazon and Google now vie with local startup Paytm, Walmart-PhonePe and a host of other players in a digital payments market forecast to quintuple to $1 trillion by 2023.
“UPI has had the fastest acceptance rate not just among payment platforms but digital platforms of any kind,” said Dilip Asbe, chief executive officer of the National Payments Corporation of India, which groups the lenders that developed the system. “We aim to expand the UPI base to 500 million users in the next three years.”
UPI sports an open architecture allowing digital wallet apps, payment banks and startups to link freely to its platform. That’s a contrast to the closed systems of China’s dominant services, WeChat and Alipay. It simplifies transactions between apps and banks linked through a biometric ID system called Aadhaar. Regulated by the central bank, it allows the instant transfer of funds between bank accounts through a mobile device using a simple virtual handle, without sharing bank or personal details. UPI’s creators now want to take the platform beyond the country’s borders and allow payments in places like Singapore or the Middle East with a dense population of Indian expatriates.Global tech companies are racking up enormous losses as they battle for a slice of a market forecast to grow to $1 trillion by 2023 from about $200 billion early this year, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). Between SoftBank-backed Paytm, Walmart’s PhonePe and Amazon Pay alone, collective losses totaled over $1 billion in the financial year ending March, a 167% spike from the previous year, according to the Economic Times. Losses are mounting as they drive further into India’s smaller cities and towns, luring merchants and first-time phone users with cashbacks and financial sweeteners.
All those players aim to get into services like lending as their next move, so they can start making money, said Arnav Gupta, a New Delhi-based digital strategy analyst at Forrester Research. “The market potential in a country of nearly 1.4 billion Indians is massive.”
But competition is set to worsen.  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).’s WhatsApp is seeking final approval for the full-fledged countrywide launch of its payments service, which has been in a long-drawn pilot phase with just 1 million users. Experts predict that the entry of WhatsApp into the arena will mark another inflection point because of an estimated user base of more than 400 million.
WhatsApp Payments will be launched “soon” in India, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg told investors in a post-earnings conference call this week. WhatsApp is said to be seeking final approval after storing user data on local servers, as mandated by the central bank."

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets were broadly higher after early trade on Friday after a strong manufacturing survey from China supported hopes that the worst of that country’s slowdown is over.
The moves largely corrected losses from earlier in the week and still weren’t enough to get markets like the U.K.'s FTSE 100 or Spain’s IBEX 35 over the gain line for the week, and few were willing to place large new bets ahead of the U.S. labor market report later in the day.
The report will be the first major hard data of the fourth quarter, following on from a mixed bunch of purchasing manager surveys from research firm IHSMarkit this week. Much of Friday’s gains in Europe were due to the big improvement in the IHS/Caixin manufacturing PMI in China, which showed its biggest improvement in two years. Reports from European markets were not as strong, with Turkey, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway all falling, and only Switzerland and the U.K. surprising significantly to the upside.
Among sectors, chipmakers made solid gains on the back of Samsung’s forecast that the memory chip sector will revive strongly next year after a buffeting this year from the U.S.-China trade dispute.

The company expects annual underlying profit to fall by more than two-thirds as the UK car market struggles with dwindling consumer confidence and margin pressures.
Lookers said Chairman Phil White will become executive chairman as Chief Executive Andy Bruce and operations chief Nigel McMinn would leave the company immediately.
Lookers, which warned in July that profit would be below market expectations, said challenges have been worse than expected since mid-September.
The British car industry has been hit by lower vehicle sales amid uncertainty caused by stricter emissions regulations, Britain's impending exit from the European Union and a shift towards sales of electric or hybrid cars.
It now expects underlying profit before tax for the full year to be 20 million pounds ($25.91 million).
Lookers, which sells vehicles for multiple automakers including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Ford (N:F) and Germany's BMW (DE:BMWG), reported adjusted pre-tax profit of 67.3 million pounds in 2018.
The company, which had disclosed a regulatory probe and the exit of its finance chief earlier this year, said it would shut 15 dealerships and take a one-off hit of 8 million pounds."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China's Suntien Green Energy Co. Ltd (HK:0956), a wind power producer and piped gas distributor, plans to build a $1 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) receiving terminal in north China by end-2022, after its investment plans won state approval, a company official said.
The little-known firm, backed by the Hebei provincial government, joins a handful of Chinese companies outside the dominant state energy giants aiming to own and operate a receiving facility for the super-chilled fuel, of which China is the world's second-largest buyer.
In a Hong Kong exchange filing on Thursday, Suntien said the central government had approved its plan to build a gas terminal in the city of Tangshan with an eventual handling capacity of 12 million tonnes a year.
A Hongkong-based investor relations official told Reuters the company would initially invest 8.07 billion yuan ($1.15 billion) for a first-stage terminal able to handle 5 million tonnes of LNG a year by the end of 2022.
The project will include eight storage tanks, each sized 200,000 cubic meters, and a berth able to dock LNG tankers between 80,000 and 266,000 cubic meters, the official said.
Suntien, which has a market capitalization of HK$8.47 billion ($1.1 billion), said it plans to finance the Tangshan project through its own capital and loans from financial institutions.
The company began life in 2010 as a wind power generator, but wants to beef up its natural gas business to contribute half its profit in five years' time, versus 30% in 2018, said the official, who declined to be named as she is not the company's official spokesperson.
The move would compensate for a less prospective wind power business, which is facing headwinds from over-capacity and dwindling state subsidies, the official said.
""The outlook of wind power is less certain ... because of lags in state subsidies and the limits on the amount of generation,"" she said.
Its gas business, however, has been robust.
Suntien currently operates 4,140 km (2,575 miles) of pipelines in Hebei, China's top steel-making province, and last year supplied the province with nearly 20% of its total gas needs, securing gas mostly from top gas producer PetroChina (HK:0857).
Gas demand in Hebei is forecast to hit 20 billion cubic meters in 2020, up more than 40% from 2018, thanks to a strong government push to switch from coal to gas to tackle pollution, the official said."

Russian-based coal and steel group   Evraz   (LON:EVRE) said its total crude steel productions fell 3.4% in the third quarter from the previous three months, due largely to weaker demand at its U.S. and Canadian mills. Output at the Russian mills also dipped due to scheduled maintenance.
Output of coking coal also fell 9.7% on the quarter, as the company focused on whittling down unsold stocks. External sales of coking coal products were flat overall.
External sales of iron ore products fell 31% on the quarter due to capital repairs at its KGOK complex.

Building materials group   CRH   (LON:CRH) said it had completed the 1.64 billion euro ($1.83 billion) disposal of its Europe distribution business, which was originally announced in July.


Mining group BHP (LON:BHPB) said it had taken a step to restarting production at the Samarco mine in Brazil, which has been out of action since a fatal dam burst in 2015. The company said it had approved $44 million in spending related to the restart of a concentrator at the complex. The money will be used to construct a filtration plant over the next 12 months
""Samarco has now obtained all environmental licenses required to progress towards operational restart. Restart can occur when the filtration system is complete and Samarco has met all necessary safety requirements,"" the company said.

Rentokil (LON:RTO) said it had agreed to buy Florida Pest Control, a company with some $66 million in annual revenues. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

Broking group TP ICAP (LON:TCAPI) said revenue rose 13% in currency-adjusted terms from a year earlier in the third quarter, with a strong performance in rates offsetting weaker credit and equities activity and pushing the biggest division, global broking, to a 10% increase.
It also said recent hires and acquisitions had boosted its energy and commodities business, where revenue grew 24%.
However, the group didn’t upgrade its full-year guidance for growth of less than 10% in constant currencies. It said “current geopolitical uncertainties…may have an impact on transaction volumes in the fourth quarter.”

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Asian shares scaled three-month highs on Friday as a surprise bounce in Chinese manufacturing activity eclipsed doubts raised by a Bloomberg news report over whether the United States and China can reach a long-term trade deal.
Shares in Europe were set to follow Asia's lead. Pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures (STXEc1) were up 0.28%, German DAX futures (FDXc1) gained 0.34% and FTSE futures (FFIc1) added 0.19%.
Factory activity in China expanded at its fastest pace in more than two years in October as export orders and production rose, a private business survey showed on Friday.
The expansion, which beat expectations and contrasted with the dour results of an official survey Thursday, helped to boost Chinese blue chips (CSI300), which surged 1.6%.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) added 0.65% and Seoul's Kospi (KS11) rose 0.77%. The Nikkei (N225) underperformed, ending the day down 0.33%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) reversed early losses to touch fresh three-month highs, and was last up 0.4%.
The index's performance reflected a results season that has shown companies to be more resilient than expected, said Jim McCafferty, head of Equity Research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura.
""If you look at the micro data supplied by the companies, then it tells you that customers ... are continuing to do business. So I think that we are in a better state than perhaps investors thought we were just one month ago,"" he said.
Earlier on Friday, losses had mirrored falls in global stock markets, as MSCI's gauge of equity performance in 47 countries (MIWD00000PUS) fell from 20-month highs after a report that cast doubt on the likelihood of a U.S.-China trade deal.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 0.52%, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 0.30% and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 0.14%.
Efforts by Washington and Beijing to end their bruising nearly 16-month trade war appeared on track as U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday said that the two sides would soon announce a new venue for the signing of a ""Phase One"" trade deal after Chile cancelled a planned summit set for mid-November.
Optimism was dampened by a Bloomberg report citing unnamed Chinese officials airing doubts over whether a comprehensive long-term trade deal is possible.
China's doubts were ""not entirely unexpected"", Greg McKenna, strategist at McKenna Macro, said in a morning note to clients, noting that the falls in equity markets overnight were relatively small.
Retreats in the S&P 500 and the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield indicated some technical resistance in the market, he said.
""Either way, today's deluge of manufacturing PMI's and then U.S. non-farm (payrolls) tonight will be an important factor in where markets head next,"" McKenna said.
The Institute for Supply Management is due to release data from its survey of purchasing managers on Friday. A separate PMI survey released Thursday by the Chicago Fed showed a sharper contraction in midwestern manufacturing activity for October.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes (US10YT=RR) was higher at 1.6963% compared with its U.S. close of 1.691% on Thursday. The two-year yield (US2YT=RR), sensitive to market expectations of Federal Reserve policy, was at 1.536%, up from a U.S. close of 1.526%.
The Fed cut interest rates for a third time this year on Wednesday to help sustain U.S. growth, but signalled there would be no further reductions unless the economy takes a turn for the worse.
In the currency market, the dollar was down 0.05% against the yen at 107.97 .

The setback knocked the small-capitalisation company's shares down to A$0.165, off 39%, by 0615 GMT, having earlier touched a more than three-year low with a drop of as much as 46%.
Under a preliminary agreement reached last December, Genex had hoped to finalize a power purchase agreement in 2019 with EnergyAustralia and sell an equity stake in the 250 megawatt project to the country's no.3 electricity retailer.
Genex said on Friday EnergyAustralia, owned by Hong Kong's CLP Holdings (HK:0002), had advised that it could not agree to the deal spelled out in the term sheet last December.
""In light of this development, Genex wishes to advise that it no longer anticipates that it will reach financial close on the project in calendar 2019,"" the company said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange.
As a result of the EnergyAustralia setback, agreements Genex reached for a total of A$635 million ($438.34 million) in funding from the government's Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility and Japan's J-Power (T:9513) would both lapse in December, Genex said.
Genex said it would work with the government fund, J-Power and EnergyAustralia to restructure the financing, which it now hopes to seal in 2020.
""There is more work to be done before we can commit long-term,"" an EnergyAustralia spokesman said in emailed comments, adding that the company hoped an investment decision could be made ""sometime next year"".
The project, which Genex plans to build at an abandoned gold mine in outback northern Australia, is seen as the most promising of a range of pumped hydro projects. It would store energy like a battery to back up variable wind and solar power."

671,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 01:14AM ET</span>",China's online retailers take the battle to the hinterlands,"By Sophie Yu, Yingzhi Yang and Brenda Goh
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Wu Weidong was never much of an online shopper. 
The 47-year-old resident of Yanzhou, a small town in China's eastern Shandong province, typically bought groceries from local stores.
But messages from friends asking him to join their group purchases of fruits at bargain prices on the website  Pinduoduo  (N:PDD) finally persuaded him to open an account there. 
""It's mainly because my friends said the items there are cheap,"" he said. ""So I've started using Pinduoduo more to buy fruits and snacks."" 
Started four years ago by a former Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) engineer, Pinduoduo has become one of China's biggest retail disruptors, breaking the dominance of  Alibaba  (N:BABA) and JD.com  by persuading users like Wu, who live in China's smaller cities, to start shopping online.
Alibaba and JD.com have for years tried to unleash rural China's spending power, teaching residents how to use their online platforms and using drones for deliveries to remote spots, with mixed results. 
But the success of Pinduoduo's model, which offers users deeper discounts on mostly generic products if they buy in groups, and encourages them to share purchases through messaging app WeChat, is driving Alibaba and JD.com to make a fresh push into China's lower-tier cities. 
Alibaba and JD.com now both have e-commerce apps similar to Pinduoduo's and say that they anticipate strong growth from rural consumers. 
In September, Alibaba ran ""Super Bargain Day,"" which took aim at such users with generous coupons and prices halved for 1 million items. 
Pinduoduo is ranked second in the number of active buyers, analysts say. Pinduoduo reported 483.2 million active buyers at the end of June, versus Alibaba's 674 million. JD.com has 321.3 million annual active customer accounts.
However, Pinduoduo's annual spending per active buyer, at 1,467.50 yuan at the end of June, is lower than that of Alibaba, which said in September that users from less-developed areas who have been on its platforms for five years spent on average 10,600 yuan in the 12 months that ended in March. New users from those areas spent on average 2,300 yuan during that period, Alibaba said, 
""China's e-commerce has been a duopoly market for years. Out of everyone's expectation there came Pinduoduo, emerging with a completely different set of practices to engage with users,"" said Keso Hong, a independent internet commentator in China. 
OPPORTUNITIES AND THE ECONOMY
Analysts say Pinduoduo gained a foothold in the market thanks to the shortcomings in some of Alibaba and JD.com's models. 
The two e-commerce giants built their businesses on the country's burgeoning middle class, competing intensely to woo big international brands like Burberry or Valentino to set up online stores. But it was hard to persuade residents in lower-tier cities that they needed to shop for luxury goods online.
Pinduoduo, in contrast, set its sights on bargain-hunters in lower-tier cities. 
""Pinduoduo is similar to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that we designed our feed-based model to recommend products to users,"" Victor Tseng, vice president of corporate development at Pinduoduo, told Reuters.
Its model encourages users to recommend products to friends and family to gain discounts, and heavily leverages WeChat, China's dominant messaging service, which is owned by Pinduoduo-backer Tencent Holdings (HK:0700). 
JD.com, also backed by Tencent, missed an opportunity to promote its WeChat option, Hong said. 
""JD has enjoyed the advantage of being on WeChat for years, yet it failed to find the most efficient way to make use of this treasure,"" Hong said. 
Other economic winds have also helped Pinduoduo.
A slowing economy has hurt Alibaba's purchasing power and JD's big-city core consumer base. Residents in lower-tier cities are starting to have higher disposable incomes compared with their first-tier city compatriots, whose living costs are higher, economists say. 
CHASING AT THE HEELS
To be sure, Pinduoduo's user base remains much smaller than market leader Alibaba's, and its rise has not been without challenges. 
Local media reports last month cited Pinduoduo's founder Huang Zheng as saying in an internal meeting that its gross merchandise volume, the value of goods sold on its websites within a certain time frame, had surpassed that of JD.com. The remarks drew a sharp response from the latter. 
""Based on our internal analysis, we believe there is a significant gap between Pinduoduo and JD.com in terms of GMV (by any imaginable measures), basket size, return rate, and so on,"" a JD.com spokesman said. 
Pinduoduo also remains dogged by accusations that its site hosts counterfeits. The company says it is cracking down on fakes.
Meanwhile, Alibaba and JD are trying to get a foothold in rural areas. 
JD.com in September upgraded its group-buying platform, renaming it Jingxi, and is looking to improve logistics for users, saying that it wants to eventually fulfill deliveries to smaller cities within 24 hours. 
Alibaba has announced a fresh focus on expanding in less-developed areas. Last year, it launched an mobile app called Taobao Tejia, or Taobao Discounts, which offers rock bottom bargain deals.
It also pushed its nearly decade-old group-buying and flash-sale service Juhuasuan to a more prominent position in its e-commerce ecosystem, where it will offer heavily subsidized selling campaigns, discounts, coupons and other perks.
Alibaba vice chairman Joe Tsai in August predicted that retail consumption from the lower-tier cities and townships would triple from $2.3 trillion to nearly $7 trillion by 2030, equivalent to compounded annual growth of 10%.
An Alibaba spokesman said that although 85% of Chinese residents in developed areas have used Alibaba's retail marketplace, the penetration was only 40% in less-developed places. That presents a ""tremendous opportunity"", he said. 

""The growth of the country is slowing. But at the same time, the purchasing power of lower-tier cities are not fully released,"" said Liu Xingliang, an internet analyst at DCCI Data Center.

672,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 12:44AM ET</span>",Taiwan Stocks Suddenly Among Asia’s Best Trades This Year,"(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan stocks can cinch their best year in a decade as long as foreign investors keep piling in.
Outside money, fueled by an easing of U.S.-China trade tensions, has helped boost Taiwan asset prices. The Taiex gauge rose 4.9% in October, its biggest monthly gain since 2012. The Taiwan dollar has strengthened to levels not seen since mid-2018.
The key for the gains has been overseas investors buying about $3.1 billion of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. shares, or nearly half of the total equity inflows. Those purchases have helped the Taiex extend its gain this year to 17% at 11,350 as of Friday morning trading.
Allan Lin, assistant vice president at Concord Securities, predicts the index will close 2019 at a minimum of 11,800.
“Foreign investors will continue to invest in emerging markets including Taiwan stocks if U.S.-China trade talks remain positive,” he said. “Inflows into Taiwan are also seen increasing with foreign firms’ direct investment and repatriated funds due to tax breaks, which will continue to support Taiwan dollar strength.”
Lin predicted the Taiex would close 2018 at 10,500 in a Bloomberg survey a year ago. His forecast was the closest among market watchers to the actual level of 9,727.41.
Foreign investors have poured $6.6 billion into Taiwan-listed equities year-to-date, the most among Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg after India.
On top of that, billions of Taiwan dollars are flowing into the economy after lawmakers earlier this year passed a regulation providing tax breaks for companies and individuals that repatriate assets held overseas. Meanwhile, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. and wind power company Orsted have recently won government approval to invest billions in local projects.
The island’s economy may give investors another reason to be bullish. It expanded at a 2.91% pace in the third quarter, the statistics bureau said Thursday, higher than the 2.45% median estimate of 20 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
To be sure, further gains by Taiwan’s markets depend on how trade talks between the world’s two largest economies pan out. President Donald Trump’s plan to sign the first part of a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping this month has been thrown into question after Chile canceled a summit where the two leaders planned to meet.
Michael Every, head of Asia financial markets research at Rabobank in Hong Kong and the most accurate Taiwan dollar forecaster for last quarter, said he was “generally bearish” on the local currency’s outlook due to concern about U.S.-China relations. The Taiwan dollar weakened 0.1% in early Friday trading as Chinese officials are casting doubts about reaching a comprehensive long-term trade deal with the U.S. even as the two sides get close to signing a phase-one agreement.
“With the optimism we’ve seen in the market,” said Every, “when negative fundamentals emerge, which is possible by year-end, investors may overreact.”

Tavan Tolgoi has been ramping up preparations for the IPO and targets a listing as soon as next year, Bloomberg News reported earlier this week. A successful share sale would mark at least the third effort to raise money to develop the Tavan Tolgoi mine after international partnerships failed in 2011 and 2015.
Mongolian lawmakers in 2018 approved a plan to sell up to 30% of Tavan Tolgoi mine. Tavan Tolgoi could add more banks to the deal at a later stage, the people said.
Representatives for Bank of America and Credit Suisse declined to comment, while representatives for Mongolia’s Ministry of Mining and Tavan Tolgoi didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Tavan Tolgoi, which means “five hills,” refers to the original location of the coal ore, according to its website. The Tavan Tolgoi coal mine, located in the Gobi desert, is the largest coal ore deposit in Mongolia. Its deposit is estimated at a total of over 6 billion metric tons of coal, and more than one-third of which is high-grade hard coking coal, the website shows."

675,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 11:23PM ET</span>",Several automakers back Trump in two other California vehicle emissions suits,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM), Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203),  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) and other major automakers late Thursday sought to intervene on the side of the Trump administration in two additional legal challenges to its efforts to bar California from setting tailpipe emissions standards.
The two lawsuits, brought by California and 22 other states and environmental groups in September in U.S. District Court in Washington, challenge the administration's determination in September that California cannot set vehicle emission standards and zero-emission vehicle mandates.
Late Monday, the automakers and dealers sought to intervene in a separate suit filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia by an environmental group, saying they backed the administration's bid to prohibit states from making their own emissions rules.
The decision to side with President Donald Trump brought thanks from the president on Wednesday and prompted a furious backlash from Democrats and environmentalists.
It also poses a risk for the automakers if a Democrat wins the White House in November 2020 and reverses Trump's actions, allowing California to set its own rules and revert to the tougher national emissions standards of the Obama era.
Other automakers, such as  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), Honda Motor Co (T:7267), BMW AG (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), which announced a voluntary deal with California in July on emissions rules, are not intervening on the administration's side.
The automakers suing include all of the Association of Global Automakers members except Honda, and several Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers members - but not Ford or its German automaker members, including VW.
Those backing Trump also include  Hyundai Motor  Corp (KS:005380), Mazda (T:7261), Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270).
The split comes as the two major auto trade associations have been in merger talks for months. They recently voted to conduct due diligence as they try to finalize a tie-up in coming weeks, four senior automotive officials told Reuters.
Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers spokeswoman Gloria Bergquist said late Thursday the groups ""have collaborated on many projects over the years and we are exploring working together even more closely now, but we don't have anything to announce yet.""
In August 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed freezing fuel efficiency requirements at 2020 levels through 2026.
The Obama-era rules adopted in 2012 called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2026, with average annual increases of nearly 5%, compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration's preferred option.

The final rule is expected to modestly boost fuel efficiency from the initial proposal, with several automakers anticipating annual increases of about 1.5%, but still much less stringent than the Obama rules. An administration official said Thursday the rule is not final and could change before the end of the year.

676,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 11:03PM ET</span>","WeWork, former CEO Adam Neumann accused of pregnancy discrimination","By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The former chief of staff to ousted WeWork CEO Adam Neumann has accused him and the company of discrimination, saying she feared for the health of her unborn baby because of Neumann's penchant for smoking marijuana on chartered planes.
She also said she was replaced by a man making more than twice her salary when she took maternity leave.
In a complaint filed with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Medina Bardhi said she began suffering discrimination soon after telling Neumann that she was pregnant with her first child in 2016.
She said in the complaint that she had been hesitant to tell him early in her pregnancy, but was forced to do so because of his smoking marijuana on the flights, potentially exposing her unborn child to secondhand smoke.
Bardhi said she was fired about six months after giving birth to her second child and just weeks after raising concerns about discrimination in connection with her pregnancy and maternity leave.
""WeWork intends to vigorously defend itself against this claim,"" the company said in a statement. ""We have zero tolerance for discrimination of any kind.""
Medina's complaint, filed on behalf of a proposed class of other female employees, also names Jennifer Berrent, who was WeWork's chief legal officer, saying she referred to Bardhi's first pregnancy as a ""problem"" that needed to be ""fixed.""
Neumann also referred to Bardhi's upcoming maternity leave as a ""vacation,"" the complaint said. 
Bardhi said that when she returned from maternity leave, she was not given her old job back for several months.
The pattern repeated itself when she became pregnant in 2018, had a child and took maternity leave again, according to Bardhi's complaint. She was fired on Oct. 2, about a week after Neumann stepped down as WeWork's chief executive, and was told that her role had been eliminated, according to the complaint.
WeWork is already facing other complaints of discrimination, including a lawsuit by a former senior vice president, Lisa Bridges, who says the company tried to force her out when she presented evidence that it compensated men better than women.
Neumann agreed to resign as CEO and give up majority voting control of the company in September after SoftBank Group Corp and other shareholders turned on him over a plunge in the company's estimated valuation ahead of a planned initial public offering.

677,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 10:45PM ET</span>",U.S. prosecutors file new charges in UAW corruption case,"By Ben Klayman and Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - A United Auto Workers official was charged on Thursday with embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars in an alleged scheme that a person familiar with the case said involved union President Gary Jones.
Edward Robinson, working with several unnamed UAW officials, was charged with conspiracy to embezzle union funds and conspiracy to defraud the United States for stealing more than $1.5 million from the UAW from 2010 to about September 2019, according to documents filed in the U.S. District Court in Detroit.
An attorney for Jones, who has not been charged with any wrongdoing, could not immediately be reached. Robinson could not immediately be reached for comment.
""We take any allegation or claim about the misuse of union resources very seriously. The UAW is grounded in the principle of putting our members first, and that belief has never wavered,"" the UAW said in a statement.
""The UAW remains focused on negotiating and finalizing strong contracts for our members, especially during this round of auto negotiations.""
The charges for Robinson come at a delicate time for the UAW. The union has just negotiated a tentative four-year labor agreement with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co that still needs to be ratified by 55,000 UAW members at Ford.
But this latest development in a mushrooming scandal threatens to overshadow that process and ongoing contract talks with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) NV. The UAW previously ratified a new contract with General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). 
Involved in the fraud were several unnamed UAW officials, one of whom was identified as ""UAW Official A,"" according to the complaint. Official A is Jones, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing the ongoing investigation.
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit declined to comment on the identities of the unnamed officials.
The FBI has been conducting a wide-ranging investigation into illegal payoffs to UAW officials by FCA and the union had hoped to put the federal probe behind it by electing Jones, a former regional director for the union, as president in 2018. 
Jones was chosen as he seemed far removed from the scandal, but in late August the FBI conducted searches at Jones’ suburban Detroit home and other locations.
The complaint against Robinson and the unnamed officials described a ""multifaceted scheme to embezzle funds from the UAW ... to further fuel the lavish lifestyles to which these officials had become accustomed."" 
The accused UAW officials used fraudulent vouchers to fund personal expenses, including ""cigars, private villas, high-end liquor and meal expenses, golfing apparel, golf clubs and green fees,"" according to the complaint.
In one instance, the complaint said Robinson managed to cash up to $700,000 in unauthorized checks and then split those funds with Official A. 

Also named in Thursday's complaint was Vance Pearson, who was charged last month by federal officials. Pearson served as Jones' second in command from 2016 to 2018 and replaced him last year as director of the UAW's so-called Region 5, which covers 17 western and southwestern U.S. states.

(Reuters) - The Canadian attorney general has filed affidavits asserting that information identifying Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's electronic devices was not shared with the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) during her December 2018 arrest in Vancouver, court documents showed on Thursday.
Meng, 47, is charged in the United States with bank fraud and she is accused of misleading  HSBC Holdings  PLC (L:HSBA) about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's business in Iran, which is under U.S. sanctions. Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.
In early October Meng and her lawyers asserted that members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) had illegally shared sensitive identifying information about her electronic devices with the FBI.
""The applicant's allegation that the information was shared by the RCMP with the FBI is unfounded,"" lawyers for Canada's attorney general said in court documents released to media on Thursday.
Huawei was not available for an immediate comment.
Canada's attorney general filed eight affidavits this month stating that members of the FBI and RCMP were discussing what information would be necessary in the case of a mutual legal assistance treaty request is made by the United States, which is made by one country to another when requiring the exchange of information to enforce laws.
The RCMP did not share the information, the affidavits written by past and present members of the police force stated.
The lawyers for Canada's attorney general added in their letter that the information being gathered but not shared showed a ""good faith attempt"" by the RCMP ""to ensure that any sharing would be done in accordance with the law.""
Meng and her lawyers returned to a British Columbia court this month, requesting additional documents pertaining to Meng's arrest at the Vancouver International Airport at the request of the United States on Dec. 1, 2018.
Meng's argument is part of a broader strategy to prove that her arrest was illegal and violated her rights according to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
If Canadian officials abused their authority, her lawyers say, the extradition proceedings should be halted. The official extradition trial will begin in January 2020.

""In any event, the allegations could not result in the most drastic of remedies, a stay of proceedings,"" the lawyers for Canadian attorney general said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A mandatory 24-hour delay on all first-time payments from one bank account to another would cut mounting fraud in finance, UK lawmakers said in a report on Friday.
Parliament's Treasury Select Committee said fraudsters stole over 600 million pounds ($777 million) from consumers in the first half of 2019 and regulators must crack down harder on scammers.
With money transfers between accounts taking just seconds, customers or their bank have little time to be aware that a fraud has taken place, the report said.
It recommended a mandatory 24-hour delay on all initial or first-time payments, while all future payments to that same account would be at normal speed.
""If a situation arose whereby an initial payment was needed instantly, a customer could ring their bank and additional checks could be carried out for the funds to be released,"" the report said.
Some reforms to cut fraud are already in the pipeline.
To transfer money at Britain's major lenders, the name of the recipient account holder must be confirmed by the receiving bank to stop fraudsters from diverting money.
Banks have said the deadline presents IT challenges and that smaller banks won't be included until later on, but lawmakers said the change should be introduced as a matter of urgency.
""If the implementation date of March 2020 begins to look in doubt, regulators should consider introducing sanctions, such as fines, to firms who have not met the deadline,"" it said.
Banks and card companies prevented 820 million pounds in fraud in the first half of 2019, according to UK Finance, a banking trade body.
But lawmakers want the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to set a ""challenging"" timeframe for banks to freeze accounts when there is evidence that money has been received fraudulently.
Banks use a voluntary industry code to determine when a customer should be reimbursed for unwittingly sending money to a scammer.
Lawmakers said the code should be made compulsory through legislation and the FCA should introduce a common definition for what constitutes gross negligence on the part of customers, which limits compensation.
The FCA should also take timely and appropriate action to stop ""blanket de-risking"", the report said in a reference to banks cutting off relations with customers deemed to be too risky."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - American Airlines' flight attendants union still has safety concerns about the Boeing 737 MAX and is demanding an active role in the relaunch of the grounded aircraft, its president told Boeing Co's (N:BA) chief executive in a letter seen by Reuters.
""The 28,000 flight attendants working for American Airlines refuse to walk onto a plane that may not be safe and are calling for the highest possible safety standards to avoid another tragedy,"" Association of Professional Flight Attendants President Lori Bassani said in the letter.
The letter, dated Oct. 30, followed two days of congressional hearings in Washington during which lawmakers grilled Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg about the development of the 737 MAX following two crashes that killed 346 people and led to the aircraft's worldwide grounding in March.
 American Airlines Group  (O:AAL) is the second largest U.S. operator of the 737 MAX, with 24 jets in its fleet at the time of the grounding and dozens more on order.
Bassani told Muilenburg that the hearings show breakdowns in supervision of the 737 MAX and raise questions about the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) resources for oversight.
Bassani was in Washington on Wednesday meeting with dozens of elected officials.
According to the letter, she wants to make sure her group has all the information needed to assess the safety of sending her crews back to work once the aircraft receives FAA approval.
Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe in an emailed statement said Muilenburg had received the letter and will be responding soon.
""We are committed to providing flight attendants, pilots and our airline customers the information they need so we can re-earn their trust and that of the traveling public that counts on them,"" Johndroe said.
Pilot and flight attendant unions are expected to play a role in airlines' efforts to win over public sentiment on the aircraft.
Boeing has said it expects a 737 MAX return to service in the current quarter. American Airlines has removed the 737 MAX from its flying schedule until Jan. 16.

The cracks are on what is known as the ""pickle fork"" – a part that attaches the plane's fuselage, or body, to the wing structure.
The three Qantas jets, all of which had around 27,000 take-off and landing cycles, rather than the 30,000 that had required immediate checks, have been removed from service for repair, the airline said in a statement.
""Qantas will minimize any customer impact from having these aircraft temporarily out of service,"" the carrier said. ""All three aircraft are expected to return to service before the end of the year."" 
Qantas on Wednesday said it had discovered cracks in a jet with just under 27,000 cycles undergoing heavy maintenance.
Airlines had been given a matter of months to check planes with more than 22,600 cycles but fewer than 30,000 as part of a directive from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issued last month.
Qantas stepped up checks on 33 of its planes with more than 22,600 cycles, finding cracks in another two.
Repairing the cracks requires grounding the airplane, with remedial work costing an estimated $275,000 per aircraft, according to aviation consultancy IBA.
Other carriers that have discovered pickle fork cracks include Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), Brazil's Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (SA:GOLL4),  Korean Air Lines Co  (KS:003490) and Indonesia's Sriwijaya Air. 

Boeing said on Thursday of the slightly more than 1,000 planes that had required checks to date, cracks were found in fewer than 5%.

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co’s (N:WFC) new chief executive, Charlie Scharf, told employees this week he is more hands-on in his early days than at his previous CEO roles in order to tackle the bank’s regulatory and operational problems as staff grilled him about everything from growth targets to his family dog.
When he started as CEO jobs in that past, Scharf focused on learning about the companies but at Wells Fargo, the need to develop controls has brought a sense of urgency, he told employees on Tuesday at Wells Fargo’s campus in Charlotte, North Carolina. A source provided Reuters a recording of the event.
“If I've got a point of view and think I can be helpful where I think we can help bring resources to bear, I'm not going to sit there like a wallflower,” he said at the town hall.
Scharf, 54, took over the CEO role on Oct. 21, as the bank entered its fourth year of a wide-ranging sales practices scandal.
Approved by regulators and cheered by investors as an outsider who could bring fresh perspective to Wells Fargo’s C-suite, he must now try to settle outstanding regulatory probes, repair the bank’s image and improve morale among staff.
Scharf said he is up to the task.
“We all have to act a little bit more impatient for some of these things, and demand more of each other,” he said. “I'm going to constantly ask the question, 'Can we do a better job? Can we do something faster?'”
Scharf came to Wells Fargo after CEO stints at Visa (N:V) and Bank of New York Mellon (N:BK) and several years working in the top ranks at JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM). His first days on the job were spent at board meetings in St. Louis and then with regulators and senior management at the bank’s headquarters in San Francisco, he said.
This week, he met with regulators and politicians in Washington and with other key executives including Chief Risk Officer Mandy Norton in Charlotte.
In the town hall meeting, Scharf said he is trying to bring a fresh sense of urgency to solving Wells Fargo’s regulatory woes. The bank has already paid billions of dollars in fines and legal settlements, faced 14 consent orders with government agencies and remains under an unprecedented growth restriction on its balance sheet by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Other strategy decisions like growth targets are secondary.
Sources who have worked with Scharf described him has a detail-oriented leader who is more at home with numbers than people. However, during he town hall, his first event with the company, Scharf framed himself as a family man who places a lot of value on relationships, especially with his yellow Labrador, Bebe.
Winning over employees is also key for Scharf to achieve operational targets while those matters move toward resolution. Wells Fargo has posted sluggish revenue growth and had trouble cutting expenses since the scandal erupted in September 2016.
Initially, the sales abuses centered around millions of phony customer accounts but eventually revealed overcharges on auto and home loans and other improper practices. In an internal survey this year, just 38% of employees said they felt senior management understood obstacles faced by workers. With roughly 262,000 employees, Wells Fargo has the largest employee base of the major U.S. banks."
685,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 05:31PM ET</span>","Even after Lyft beat, Wall Street pummels former unicorns","By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Wall Street pummeled shares of companies including Pinterest (N:PINS),  Lyft  (O:LYFT), Uber Technologies (N:UBER) and SmileDirectClub (O:SDC) on Thursday as investors grew more sour on money-losing former startups that went public this year.
Pinterest slumped 20% in extended trade after its quarterly revenue and forecast slightly missed analysts' expectations. Earlier, Lyft tumbled 6% after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results. 
Uber slumped nearly 7%, bringing its decline since its May initial public offer to 30%. SmileDirectClub also fell 4.1%, extending the loss since its initial public offering last month to 49%, despite a recent wave of ""buy"" ratings from investment banks involved in listing the direct seller of plastic teeth aligners that compete with traditional braces.
Crowdstrike Holdings (O:CRWD) fell 3%, while Beyond Meat (O:BYND) and Slack lost more than 5%. Instead of an IPO, Slack listed its shares directly on the stock market in June, and they have fallen 15% since then.
The day's selling in those stocks reflects investors' growing distaste for a wave of high-profile companies that went public this year, many of them cloaked in the trappings of technology companies worthy of the highest valuations, despite being unprofitable.
""There's an utter lack of appetite for unprofitable tech companies,"" said Joel Kulina, senior vice president of institutional cash equities at Wedbush Securities. ""People just want the year to end, and protect any profits they have, and not try to catch any falling knives."" 
Underscoring Wall Street's increasing selectiveness, Lyft's stock fell after it said higher-than-expected third-quarter revenues and an improved outlook showed it was well on its way to profitability by the end of 2021.
Uber, Lyft's larger rival, is expected to post a 25% increase in revenue to $3.69 billion and a loss of $1.45 billion when it reports on Monday. For full-year 2019, analysts expect revenue growth of 24%, down from 42% growth in 2018.
Pinterest's quarterly net loss widened to $124.7 million, while - excluding certain items - it earned a cent per share, better than analysts' estimates. With Thursday's steep decline after the bell, Pinterest's stock remains up just 6% from the price in its April IPO. It had been among the more successful of this year's series of IPOs from ""unicorns,"" or rare startups valued at over $1 billion. 
Plant burger seller Beyond Meat last Monday reported its first-ever net profit and raised its full-year sales forecast, but its shares have fallen 20% since then. The stock has been hurt in part by the lifting of a restriction on insiders and employees selling their shares, which are still up 238% since Beyond Meat's May IPO. Analysts on average expect Beyond Meat to lose more money over the next two quarters.

Unprofitable U.S. companies holding IPOs this year have had a median stock loss of 2%, compared to a median increase of 4% for profitable companies that held IPOs, according to a Reuters analysis. The S&P 500 (SPX) has risen 21% in 2019.

687,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 05:25PM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P Falls Back on Economic and Trade Worries,"Investing.com - Stocks sold off Thursday as trade and economic worries took over markets a day after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell painted a rosy picture on the domestic economy. 
The Dow Jones industrials were off 0.52%. The S&P 500 was down 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.14%.
The Dow was pulled down by weakness in Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM),   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA). Boeing was off 1.8% on continued controversy over the 737 Max airliner's developement and subtracted 40 points from the Dow by itself.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was up 2.3% after reporting better-than-expected fiscal-fourth-quarter results, was the Dow leader, adding more than 33 points. Apple also contributed 21 points to the Nasdaq 100 index. That index had a better day than either the Dow or S&P 500, finishing the day basically flat.
The slump was set off by a Bloomberg News report suggesting China may well resist signing a comprehensive trade deal, in part because its leaders don't trust President Donald Trumps's impulsive nature. The Dow was down as many as 268 points before bargain hunting set in and cut the Dow's loss nearly in half.
In economic news, the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index fell 43.2 for October, its lowest level since Dec. 2015.
The news was a reversal of what Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell described at his news conference on Wednesday after the Fed cut its key interest for the third time this year. 
The economy was growing steadily, Powell said, powered by strong consumer spending and job growth. But business investment was weak and trade worries are stressing businesses, especially those that depend on export markets.
But the Fed was probably going to hold off on moving interest rates lower unless something awful happens. 
Only two of the 11 S&P 500 sectors were higher -- utilities and communications services, which includes Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The weakest sectors were industrial, materials, financial and energy stocks. 
 
The S&P 500 reached new highs during the month and ended October up 2.04%. The Dow had a more modest 0.48% gain. The Nasdaq jumped 3.66%, thanks to big gains in tech stocks, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and a host of chip stocks.
For the year, the S&P 500 is up 21.17% with the Dow up 15.9%. The Nasdaq is up nearly 25% with the Nasdaq 100 up 27.7%. The results, if sustained for the year, would be the best since 2013, although the performance is due in large part to the fourth-quarter slump last year.
Crude oil finished lower, mostly because of the trade worries. Gold futures jumped $18.10 to $1514.80 an ounce as investors sought safety from the stock pullback.
Interest rates moved lower with the 10-Year Treasury yield falling to 1.686% from Wednesday's 1.796%.
Heart-value maker Abiomed (NASDAQ:ABMD), food company Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), auto parts distributor   LKQ   Corporation (NASDAQ:LKQ) (best known for its Keystone Automotive business) and auto parts maker BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) were the top S&P 500 performers on the day. 
Chip maker   Western Digital   (NASDAQ:WDC), water-treatment company   Xylem   (NYSE:XYL), insurance company Lincoln National (NYSE:LNC) and household-products company Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD) were the weakest S&P 500 performers. "

689,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 04:59PM ET</span>",Day Ahead : Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow. 
1. It's Jobs Friday!
Jobs, Jobs, Jobs. All eyes turn to the Labor Department for its update on the how many jobs the U.S. economy produced last month.
The labor market suffered a rough ride in October, largely driven by the strike at General Motors (NYSE:GM), and there are few betting on an upside surprise.
Economists forecast that the U.S. economy created about 89,000 jobs in October, down from 136,000 a month earlier, while the unemployment rate is expected to have inched up to 3.6% from 3.5% in September.
Wage growth is expected to slow to 0.3% in October from a month earlier, but pick up the pace slightly to 3% year-on-year.
At 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT), meanwhile, the Institute of Supply Management will release its measure of manufacturing activity for October.
The ISM manufacturing purchasing manager’s index (PMI)  is predicted to have increased to a reading of 48.9.
Construction spending data will follow on the heels of the manufacturing data, with economists forecasting spending growth of 0.2% in September from the prior month. 
2. Oil Majors Earnings Due 
Oil majors   Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) and   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX) will report third-quarter earnings before the opening bell.
Sentiment on Exxon ahead of the earnings is hardly optimistic amid a challenging backdrop of weaker oil and gas prices.
Earlier this month, the oil giant provided investors with a peek into Q3, but that did little to turn sentiment around, with the company estimating a fall in quarterly earnings.
Exxon Mobil is expected to report earnings of 67 cents per share on revenue of $62.31 billion. That would be down from earnings of $1.46 a share and revenue of $76.6 billion a year ago.
Beyond its earnings, Exxon's free cash flow will also attract attention as the company has ramped up spending to bolster production.
Unlike Exxon,  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) boasts a healthier balance sheet with plenty of room to weather the impact of falling oil prices. 
 Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) is expected to report earnings of $1.49 a share on revenue of $38.84 billion. That would be down from $2.39 a share and revenue of $44 billion a year ago.
Chevron's levered free cash flow, a key metric to gauge oil and gas companies, at about $14 billion, is nearly double Exxon's.
3.  Alibaba, Berkshire Report Results
Chinese e-commerce behemoth   Alibaba   (NYSE:BABA) reports results before the opening bell.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) is expected to report earnings of RMB 10.76 a share on revenue of RMB $116.97 billion.
Its e-commerce business, which makes up the bulk of revenue, will be a key driver in determining performance during the quarter, at a time when competition from the likes of JD.com continues to heat up.
Warren Buffet's   Berkshire Hathaway   (NYSE:BRKb) also steps up to the earnings stage, with investors keen for an update on how the company will deploy its massive cash pile. 
The conglomerate is expected to report earnings of $2.87 per share for its Class B shares on revenue of $66.47 billion. "
690,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 04:55PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Sachem Head bets on Instructure, plans to call for review","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund Sachem Head Capital Management has built a new stake in  Instructure Inc  (N:INST) and plans to push the educational software company to explore alternatives, including selling itself, two people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
New York-based Sachem Head, which has been buying the company's shares over time, wants the Salt Lake City-based company, which has a market capitalization of $1.6 billion, to pursue a full sale process, the sources said. The exact size of Sachem Head's position could not be determined.
Sachem Head, which is run by Scott Ferguson and invests $3.2 billion on behalf of clients, according to a recent regulatory filing, is one of a handful of activist investors that have successfully pushed companies to break apart or sell themselves. 
A spokesman for Sachem Head declined to comment.
Instructure's stock price jumped as much as 6% on the news of Sachem Head's stake.
The hedge fund believes Instructure, which has been a publicly-traded company since 2015, can generate interest among private equity investors as well as publicly-traded companies that want its education product, according to the sources, who asked not to be named because the matter is private. 
Since January, Instructure's share price has gained 16% but it lags the Standard & Poor's 500 20.6% gain, in part because its employee development software product Bridge has failed to generate considerable market share, sources said.
Instructure's flagship learning management system, Canvas, is a market leader in the higher educational space, where it enjoys strong customer support and has recently begun to move into international markets.
Instructure has a number of hedge fund owners and in the last months a handful of investors have privately complained to management about the company's direction, taking particular aim at the Bridge product, sources said.
One investor is hedge fund Praesidium Investment Management Company whose portfolio manager Kevin Oram presented the company as one of his best ideas at the recent Sohn San Francisco Investment Conference, citing Canvas' success and Bridge's failures.
Having Sachem Head as a new investor in the stock could add considerable momentum to changes the company may already be thinking about, sources said.
Instructure has announced plans to hold an analyst day on Dec. 3, and may lay out potential changes at that time.
Sachem Head recently called on  Whitbread  PLC (L:WTB) to sell its Costa Coffee business before it was spun off to  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO). It also helped persuade Eagle Materials to split its core businesses before the company's board agreed to spin off its heavy materials and light materials businesses into two publicly traded entities.
The hedge fund prefers to stay out of the limelight and tends to settle with companies instead of waging expensive and time consuming proxy contests. Market speculation began mounting about Sachem Head's new position after Ferguson teased a new idea, without naming it, at a recent industry conference.

Demand to buy the company outright could be high among private equity investors ranging from Vista Equity Partners to Providence Equity Partners to Silver Lake Partners. At the same time companies like  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google, which owns Google Classroom, and publishers like  Pearson  PLC (L:PSON) McGraw Hill Education Holdings might be interested, sources said.

691,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 04:21PM ET</span>",Wall Street retreats from record on trade cloudiness,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday as conflicting tones surrounding a possible trade deal between the United States and China eclipsed strong earnings reports from Apple and Facebook.
Mixed signals around trade gave investors reason for caution after a Bloomberg report said Chinese officials have doubts about whether it is possible to reach a comprehensive long-term trade deal with Washington and U.S. President Donald Trump.
But Trump later said the two countries would soon announce a site where a ""Phase One"" trade deal will be signed after Chile canceled a planned summit set for mid-November that was to be the venue for a signing.
The decline was the second for the S&P 500 in the past seven days, after the benchmark index notched intraday record highs in the past three sessions and a closing record in two of the past three days.
""They rallied this market so much in anticipation of not only the trade deal - but interest rates and everything else - this market would come in very quickly if in fact, word got out the Chinese are completely walking away,"" said Ken Polcari, senior market strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in Jupiter, Florida.
""Today’s action, with the market down, is absolutely nothing for anyone to get super concerned about because after the rally we have had for two weeks, you have to suspect at some point the market has to back off a little bit."" 
The trade-sensitive industrials sector (SPLRCI) lost 1.14%, while China-exposed chipmakers also fell, sending the Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX) down 0.62%.
However, corporate earnings were a bright spot. Apple Inc (O:AAPL) rose 2.26% after the iPhone maker forecast sales for the holiday shopping quarter ahead of expectations.
 Facebook Inc  (O:FB) gained 1.81% after reporting an uptick in users in lucrative markets and its third straight rise in quarterly sales growth..
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 140.46 points, or 0.52%, to 27,046.23, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 9.21 points, or 0.30%, to 3,037.56 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 11.62 points, or 0.14%, to 8,292.36.
Earnings for the quarter are now expected to decline 0.8%, according to Refinitiv data, an improvement from the 2.2% decline expected at the start of the month. 
Data on Thursday showed a marginal rise in consumer spending in September, casting doubts on consumers' ability to continue driving the economy, a key pillar of the current economic environment.
The Labor Department's October jobs data on Friday will be closely watched after the Fed signaled on Wednesday there would be no further cuts unless the economy takes a negative turn.
Among other stocks,  Estee Lauder  Cos Inc (N:EL) fell 3.62% after the cosmetics maker cut its forecast for full-year profit. 
Kraft Heinz Co (O:KHC) jumped 13.44% as the packaged foods company said it was spending more on marketing key brands next year, after reporting a better-than-expected third-quarter profit.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.66-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.67-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 26 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 71 new highs and 83 new lows.

692,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 04:14PM ET</span>","Ford Avoids a Strike, While GM’s Suppliers Are Still Reeling","(Bloomberg) -- Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. managed to avoid a strike when it reached a tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers on a U.S. labor contract Wednesday, but suppliers to General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). are still suffering from the six-week walkout that halted production at more than 30 American factories.
Auto-parts makers’ shares are sliding after reporting lower sales and cutting profit forecasts following the strike at GM that ended Oct. 25 when more than 48,000 workers ratified a new four-year contract.
While Ford’s new UAW pact came together after just three days of talks on economics, the negotiations will be more fraught at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV after it agreed to merge with Peugeot-maker PSA Group, creating the world’s fourth largest automaker. Talks were already viewed as more tricky with Fiat Chrysler because it has more younger and temporary workers, whose improved compensation from the GM deal will be costly.
At Ford, the accord includes $6 billion of product investment in U.S. facilities and the creation or retention of more than 8,500 jobs, according to a statement released late Wednesday. The union will meet in Detroit on Friday with hundreds of local leaders to go over the details of the deal. If they approve it, the deal will be put to a vote of Ford’s 55,000 U.S. workers.
The Ford package is expected to follow the basic pattern set in the GM contract, which included lump-sum payments and annual pay increases that lift production wages to $32.32 an hour by 2023.
Supplier Impact
The longest national strike in nearly a half century at GM will lower the automaker’s earnings this year by about $2.9 billion. Its suppliers are feeling the pain as well.
Auto-parts maker Aptiv Plc on Wednesday reported a $30 million hit to operating income in the third quarter from the GM strike and said it expects to shave $135 million off earnings this year. AK Steel Holding Corp. also cut its profit forecast due in part to the walkout, sending its stock plunging as much as 10% Thursday.
Supplier Delphi Technologies Plc announced an “aggressive four-year cost restructuring program” after reporting “pretty rough numbers” for the third quarter due in part to the strike, Chris McNally, an analyst with Evercore ISI, wrote in a Thursday note to investors.
For ratifying the contract, GM workers are receiving a record $11,000 signing bonus. Ford workers, who didn’t lose wages to a walkout, may not receive as large a payout, analysts say. Four years ago, Ford staff received $10,000 when they ratified the deal. That payment included $1,500 that was pulled forward in profit sharing.
“This was an expensive deal at GM and it’s going to be even more expensive at Ford, depending on what offsets Ford was able to get to tailor it to their needs,” said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of the labor and economics group at the Center for Automotive Research.
Ford shares were little changed at 12:54 p.m. in New York. The stock is down about 7.3% since Oct. 23, when it cut its profit forecast for the year by $500 million.
The new product commitments might include the Bronco sport-utility vehicle that’s scheduled to go into production at a Michigan factory next year. Ford is overhauling its aging lineup with new and redesigned models such as the Explorer SUV and the Lincoln Aviator.
Ford also has said it will spend $11 billion to bring electric vehicles to market, but the union has been concerned that will result in fewer jobs because battery-powered cars are less labor-intensive.
“Pure electric vehicles require 40% fewer hours to assemble the powertrain than internal combustion vehicles,” said Mark Wakefield, head of the automotive practice at consultant AlixPartners. “The automakers and their workers have some difficult EV realities to tackle over the next few years.”
Ford Ratings
Ford can ill afford a strike. After the company pared its profit forecast, S&P Global Ratings became the second credit grader to cut its rating on the carmaker in as many months. S&P called Ford’s performance “subpar” and outlined risks to Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett’s $11 billion turnaround plan, including sluggish industry sales and costly emissions standards.
The UAW also had less reason to take a hard-line approach with Ford. Whereas GM was seeking to close several U.S. plants, Ford entered talks having made commitments to invest in electric and self-driving car facilities in Michigan. The company also employs more UAW members than GM or Fiat Chrysler, known as FCA.
“Given Ford did not have plans for U.S. plant closures, the deal was expected to go through quicker,” Arndt Ellinghorst, auto analyst for Evercore ISI, wrote in a note Thursday. “FCA is next in line with a comparatively greater younger/temporary workers than GM or Ford.”
Fiat Chrysler CEO Mike Manley said Thursday that 59% of Chrysler’s U.S. workforce is “in progression,” meaning they are newer workers who are still climbing the wage scale. He said 13% of the company’s American workers are temporary."
693,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 04:13PM ET</span>",Ford plans to close engine plant in Michigan as part of UAW deal,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) plans to close an engine plant in Romeo, Michigan, as part of a tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers union for a new four-year contract, a source told Reuters on Thursday.
The 600 hourly workers at the plant will be offered jobs at a nearby transmission plant or buyouts, a source said. The UAW said Wednesday the Ford deal ""secured over $6 billion in major product investments in American facilities, creating and retaining over 8,500 jobs for our communities.""
Ford will close the plant in the future under the UAW agreement. Ford and the UAW declined to comment.
In March 2017, Ford said it was investing $150 million in the Romeo Engine Plant to boost capacity for engines and new tooling for components, one of three Michigan plants at the time it said were getting new investments. Ford said the investment was to boost the plant building engines for vehicles that include Ford Super Duty, E-Series, Ford Shelby GT 350 Mustang and Shelby GT350R Mustang, along with components for F-Series, Mustang, Explorer and Edge.
In 2017 U.S. President Donald Trump praised Ford's decision to invest in Romeo and two other Michigan plants. ""Major investment to be made in three Michigan plants,"" Trump posted on Twitter at the time. ""Car companies coming back to U.S. JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!""
In contrast to Ford, General Motors Co (N:GM) endured a 40-day-strike by its U.S. hourly workforce that cost it about $3 billion before winning approval for a new labor deal earlier this month.
Detailed terms of the Ford deal were not released, but they are expected to echo those agreed to with GM, as the union typically uses the first deal as a pattern for those that follow. 
The deal includes a signing bonus of $9,000 per person, according to a person familiar with the deal who asked not to be identified. Union members at GM received $11,000 per person. 

UAW leaders from the various U.S. plants will meet on Friday to potentially approve the deal, which then would be sent to the 55,000 members at Ford for final approval, a union spokesman said.

694,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 04:09PM ET</span>","Business forum boosts Saudi image, but some say more rehab needed","By Stephen Kalin, David Lawder and Davide Barbuscia
RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's crown prince showed up only briefly this week at the kingdom's flagship investment forum, which largely drew leaders and firms with strategic interest in the Gulf state and wrapped up with relatively meagre deals and an anticlimactic finale.
It was a far cry from the inaugural Future Investment Initiative (FII) in 2017 when Mohammed bin Salman, embraced then by the West as a bold reformer, shared his vision of a modern, tolerant kingdom that would build futuristic cities.
However, as Riyadh prepares to assume the Group of 20 presidency, its ability to once again draw big names after a Western boycott of last year's event showed it starting to recover from the damage to the prince's image that followed the murder of a prominent Saudi journalist.
""The staging of this edition of the FII felt as though the kingdom is about to turn a corner as investors begin to take another look at the opportunities, though many chose to keep a low-profile,"" said Neil Quilliam, senior research fellow at Britain's Chatham House think-tank, who attended.
Some participants, speaking on condition of anonymity, said unease remained about the October 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi inside the kingdom's Istanbul consulate - which Prince Mohammed admitted had taken place under his watch but denied ordering. The CIA and some Western governments believe he did.
""I don't think any of us feel that things are all back to normal. There are still a lot of unanswered questions,"" a Europe-based executive said, but added the region was important for transformative technologies.
Some said that for Riyadh to be more fully rehabilitated it would need to show it had turned the corner on foreign policy missteps like the Yemen war and domestic moves including locking up dissidents and a 2017 corruption purge that turned the Ritz-Carlton hotel -- the host venue for the conference -- into a gilded prison.
""They need to keep doing good things and not make any more mistakes. Eventually things will even out,” said a Western banker in attendance, adding that Khashoggi's murder ""is not going away for a long time"". 
FAMILIAR FACES, LITTLE BUZZ
Wall Street, lured by a planned flotation of Saudi oil giant Aramco, turned up at the four-day event. Some chief executives who stayed away last year were here this year, including those from HSBC, Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK). J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) sent senior executives.
SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) founder and CEO Masayoshi Son took the stage again after cancelling his speech last year. In 2017, seated beside Prince Mohammed, he pledged to a packed room to invest in the kingdom's then-newly announced $500 billion NEOM mega-city.
When he spoke again on Wednesday, the hall was largely empty. Prince Mohammed was absent. 
The de facto Saudi ruler, who never addressed the forum, attended remarks on Tuesday by the Jordanian and Indian leaders and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, with whom he has a close relationship.
Unlike last year, when he broke his silence onstage over Khashoggi's killing, Prince Mohammed did not linger for selfies. 
An American participant said the presence of a large U.S. delegation, including the treasury and energy secretaries, was unsurprising given President Donald Trump's support for the kingdom after the murder, but that it did not reflect broader opinion.
""The animosity in Congress is remarkable, from the interns up to the representatives,"" the participant said. ""There are fewer CEOs (than in 2017). They do not want to be seen here.""
The conference started with a buzz, as a break-dancing troupe and face-recognition screens greeted a standing-room only crowd. But by Thursday attendance had thinned -- until rumours surfaced that Prince Mohammed would speak, filling seats. He never showed.
SCANT DEALS
In a sign that a conference aimed at showcasing Saudi Arabia's future away from oil was losing lustre, only $20 billion in investment agreements were announced, compared to $56 billion at last year's event where Aramco clinched most deals. 
World leaders addressing the event, including from Jordan, Brazil, Nigeria and Kenya, pitched their own economies, while tech firms used sessions to promote their products.
""I'd liked to have seen greater emphasis on the progress of the reform plans that are integral to Vision 2030,"" said Nomura Asset Management's Tarek Fadlallah.
As the top global oil exporter and the Arab world's largest economy, Riyadh's diversification drive has drawn big interest, particularly in capital markets, said Richard Lacaille of  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
""Some of the Saudi projects they are planning are really ambitious and very big. Many of them are feasible, such as opening up Saudi Arabia’s tourism,"" he said.
Social reforms have spurred development of the entertainment and tourism industries, but mega-projects such as NEOM have seen little tangible progress.

Most investors remain focused on the long-awaited Aramco offering, which has suffered several false starts. The Saudi energy minister assured the audience on Wednesday it would ""come soon"".

695,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 03:57PM ET</span>",China Offers 5G Discounts in Race to Scale Biggest Network,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for Next China, a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it's going next.
China’s phone carriers offered discounts to subscribers after switching on the world’s largest 5G network Thursday, seeking to spur growth for an ultra-fast wireless system that’s key to technology supremacy.
The country’s three wireless operators need to attract users to help pay for infrastructure they’ve spent more than $43 billion on in this year alone. While the technology is essential for developing industrial applications expected to drive a new digital economy, its faster speeds and lower lag times may be less compelling for consumers than previous upgrades.
On the launch day of fifth-generation services in Beijing’s financial district, stores were quiet as carriers said they expect more users to sign up online.
On the Twitter-like Weibo, “5G launching in 50 cities” and “5G package prices” were among the top-20 trending topics. But some Chinese consumers are balking at the high prices for handsets and service plans.
“I don’t have money to buy a 5G phone, or to pay for a plan,” said Weibo user Yuanyao. “Too expensive. I can’t afford it,” said another named XBACK-No fear.
Smartphone Supremacy
While carriers look to lure more users to pay up for faster services, China’s handset makers also stand to benefit from fast uptake.
Huawei Technologies Co., which also supplies the biggest slice of 5G network equipment, saw its smartphone market share jump to 42% in the third quarter, up from around 25% a year ago, according to research firm Canalys. It has already introduced several 5G models, as have Chinese brands including ZTE (HK:0763), Xiaomi and Vivo.
Luring users to the world’s largest 5G networks may also help Chinese handset makers increase their global market share. Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. is the world’s top seller of smartphones, followed by Huawei. and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Huawei has already debuted models that work on the super-fast network in the U.K. and other markets in addition to China. On Wednesday, the Nikkei reported that Apple is telling suppliers that it expects to ship at least 80 million iPhones with 5G wireless modems next year.
5G Deals
As of Thursday, China Mobile Ltd. was offering discounts of as much as 30% for users that pre-registered for 5G. Consumers buying 5G handsets from the carrier will get as much as 600 yuan ($85) off and gifts worth 699 yuan, the biggest operator by users said in a statement.
China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd., the No. 3 carrier, and No. 2 China Telecom Corp. are also offering similar discounts to pre-registered users, along with other discounts and gifts via online lotteries and through their branches throughout the country.
South Korea’s wireless carriers were the first to offer commercial 5G services, with SK Telecom Co. launching its network in April and Samsung already offering a 5G-enabled smartphone. Total 5G subscribers have surpassed 3 million in the country, although consumer reaction has been mixed.
The faster network’s coverage was initially incomplete, leaving users to fall back on 4G more than some had expected, especially when using the service indoors.
South Korean carriers SK Telecom Co., KT Corp. and LG Uplus Corp., have also sought to entice new users to adopt the technology, offering trade-ins and incentives that slash the price of new 5G phones to less than $200 from sticker prices of as much as $1,000. The subsidies have declined as the rollout expanded, said Kim Hee Sup, vice president at SK Telecom.
“It’s true that the speed and coverage of 5G didn’t meet consumers’ expectations in early days,” said Kim Hee Sup, a vice president at South Korea’s largest carrier SK Telecom. “Now, the 5G service is rapidly improving as carriers are expanding the roll-out.”
T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc. earlier this week said it will flip on a nationwide 5G service by year end. Still, the carrier doesn’t offer yet offer a 5G compatible device yet and the service will be available only on one band of airwaves they are calling the “foundational layer,” with more layers of spectrum to come.
The largest U.S. wireless carrier  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ). launched 5G in April and has promised to have it available in parts of 30 cities this year. Rival AT&T Inc. has 5G in areas of 21 cities and plans to offer 5G nationwide by mid 2020.

It said all of the chief executive's powers had been transferred to the insurer's Managing Director Carlo Ferraresi.
Minali, a former CFO at bigger rival Generali (MI:GASI), had been at the helm of Cattolica since June 1, 2017. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa) has a 9% stake in Cattolica, Italy's fifth largest insurer by gross premiums, according to calculations by investment bank Mediobanca.
A source close to the matter said Minali had been at odds for some time with Cattolica's chairman, Paolo Bedoni, on a number of issues including the possibility of transforming the cooperative insurer into a joint stock company - a plan backed by Minali but opposed by Bedoni.
Minali's stance towards the board of directors had become ""neither smooth nor positive"", the company said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services Inc on Thursday sued the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over guidance aiming to clarify how investors and firms that vote on their behalf should cast their ballots in corporate elections.
The guidance, issued in August, addresses some of the grievances U.S. corporations have long had about proxy advisers, such as mistakes in reports the advisers issue on specific companies and conflicts of interest in their business models.
Proxy advisers and investors worry the regulatory guidance may diminish voting rights and constrain shareholders' ability to hold corporations accountable.
In a filing in federal district court in Washington, ISS said that the SEC's guidance is ""arbitrary and capricious,"" arguing that the it ""inappropriately altered the regulatory regime"" over proxy advice.
It criticized the SEC's decision to issue guidance as a quick attempt to circumvent the procedural rulemaking process under the Administrative Procedure Act. The act requires a methodical evaluation, assessment of risk, public notice and period of consultation before guidance can be adopted.
The SEC declined to comment.
""We believe litigation to be necessary to prevent the chill of proxy advisers’ protected speech and to ensure the timeliness and independence of the advice that shareholders rely on to make decisions with regards to the governance of their publicly traded portfolio companies,"" said ISS Chief Executive Gary Retelny in a statement.
He added that the SEC's August guidance impedes proxy advisers' ability to provide independent and timely delivery of its data, research and analyses to investors.
Proxy advisers recommend how investors should vote in corporate elections and cast ballots on behalf of some asset managers. The role of proxy advisers has gained more attention in recent years as they have grown more influential on charged corporate issues like gun rights and climate change.
ISS is the largest proxy adviser, providing recommendations to shareholders on 40,000 meetings. Its smaller competitor San Francisco-based Glass, Lewis & Co covers 20,000 meetings, according to a report from Stanford University. Together they have a 97 percent market share.
Critics of the firms say that investors have wrongly believed they must cast a vote for every share they own, leading them to rely too much on the firms.
Last week, Reuters reported that the agency is set to vote on Nov. 5 on a proposal that would require proxy adviser firms to give companies two chances to review proxy materials before they are sent to shareholders and to increase the re-submission thresholds for motions that shareholders file at companies on issues ranging from executive compensation to climate change disclosures."

700,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 02:11PM ET</span>","Global funds prefer stocks on policy easing, bond rally: Reuters poll","By Rahul Karunakar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global funds recommended an increase in equity exposure in October to obtain better returns at a time when stocks and bonds have rallied simultaneously on policy easing and monetary stimulus offered by major central banks, a Reuters poll found.
That comes after these same global fund managers have ruled stocks out of favor for six months in a row on growth concerns, intensified by the U.S.-China trade war.
While risks from the trade war and Brexit uncertainty have not completely diminished, recent optimism that Washington and Beijing will call a truce, along with expectations for further monetary policy easing, have pushed up stocks.
The S&P 500 closed at a record high for the second time in three sessions on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve, as expected, cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to range of 1.50% to 1.75%, while signaling it was done easing for now.
While the Oct. 8-29 poll of 37 asset managers was taken ahead of the Fed meeting, a rally in bond prices pushed global investors in search of better returns to increase their exposure to equities to an average 46.2% from 44.3% in September.
At the same time fund managers suggested a cut to fixed income holdings in a model global portfolio to 41.9% from 42.1% and cash levels to 5.9% from 7.6% in September.
All but one of 24 fund managers who answered an additional question said the prospect of global monetary easing was still a net positive for equities in the near-term.
The Bank of Japan and the Bank of Canada were the latest major central banks to signal the chance of a future rate cut, after the European Central Bank restarted its printing presses last month.
Still, separate Reuters polls of over 500 economists covering more than 45 major economies showed a steeper decline in global economic growth was more likely than a synchronized recovery, despite expectations for rounds of monetary easing by major central banks.
(Reuters poll graphic on 2020 economic growth outlook revisions from July survey: https://tmsnrt.rs/2qJgdkp)
That lines up with responses to a separate question put to asset managers in the latest poll that showed a majority would roughly maintain the current risk positioning, suggesting fears of a recession have not been allayed yet.
""Currently we have a cautious stance and we expect to maintain that. It is important to highlight the fear of recessionary risks could actually lead to a recession, which could be directly negative for risk assets,"" said Pascal Blanqué, chief investment officer at Europe's largest asset manager, Amundi, in Paris.
""Should central banks implement aggressive measures to avoid a recession and fiscal measures also step in we could see another leg up for risky assets.""
While a majority of funds said their strategy for the next six months would be driven by the Fed's policy path and trade war developments, debate among policymakers in the United States and Japan on further policy easing highlights the struggle many central banks are currently facing.
Even with risks aplenty, major central banks are mostly reluctant to ease policy aggressively because interest rates are already very low, or in some cases negative.
The U.S. central bank cut rates for the third time this year on Wednesday, which it sold as insurance to help the economy weather the risks from the global trade war, highlighting the importance of the trade outlook to the global economy.
But Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled additional cuts were unlikely because economic data so far has remained steady.
""The markets are questioning how much fuel is left in the monetary stimulus tank with negative interest rates a common feature of global government bond markets,"" said John Husselbee, head of multi-asset at Liontrust, in London.
While latest data showed U.S. economic growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter, the trade war with China has eroded business confidence, contributing to the second straight quarterly contraction in business investment.
The cancellation of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit scheduled for mid-November further dented hopes of a resolution to the 15-month trade war as the market has been expecting the United States and China to sign a partial trade deal there.
""We are encouraged by the progress on trade negotiations, but we will remain cautious on the equity market until we see greater clarity,"" said Alan Gayle, president at Via Nova Investment Management in Washington, D.C.
""The prolonged uncertainty has pushed many companies to delay capital investment. Until that fog of uncertainty is lifted, we will remain cautious.""

Goldman Sachs upgraded Lyft to a buy from neutral and lifted its price target on the stock to $71 From $58, indicating more than 61% of upside ahead from its closing price of $44.12. Lyft was down 4%.
The bullish call from Goldman came as the ride-hailing company drove in third-quarter results that were not as bad as many had feared and lifted its guidance.
LYFT reported a loss of 41 cents a share on revenue of $955.6 billion, beating consensus estimates from Investing.com for a loss of 77 cents a share on revenue of $915.51 billion.
During the quarter, the number of riders on its platform surged 28% to 22.3 million from a year earlier and it made more money from each rider, a sign that the company is getting costs under control.
Revenue per active rider surged 27% year over year to $42.82.
""Lyft continues to gain share and is beginning to show the operational efficiencies that we've previously noted are critical to the ride hailing industry maturing beyond its hyper-competitive, venture-funded phase,"" {{Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients.}}

Wall Street analysts gave a more mixed reception to the earnings report, with at least nine analysts raising their price targets on the stock, while at least five trimmed. 
But if the share gains hold through Thursday's session, it would translate to a nearly $26 billion gain in value for the Silicon Valley firm.

Facebook, the world's No. 2 seller of online ads, said that revenue would grow more slowly in the fourth quarter, at closer to about 20% to 25%, partly due to users choosing to limit the company's ability to target ads to them using personal details.
That did little to shake brokerages' faith in a business model that has generated stellar gains throughout the past two years, in counterpoint to growing pressure from politicians and regulators about privacy and competition.

709,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 12:04PM ET</span>",India asks WhatsApp to explain privacy breach,"By Sankalp Phartiyal and Sudarshan Varadhan
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has asked Facebook-owned (O:FB) WhatsApp to explain the nature of a privacy breach on its messaging platform that has affected some users in the country, Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Thursday. 
A WhatsApp spokesman was quoted by the Indian Express newspaper on Thursday as saying that Indian journalists and human rights activists were targets of surveillance by an Israeli spyware. The company said it was ""not an insignificant number"" of people, but did not share specifics.
WhatsApp's comments came after the messaging platform sued Israeli surveillance firm NSO Group on Tuesday, accusing it of helping government spies break into the phones of roughly 1,400 users across four continents including diplomats, political dissidents, journalists and government officials. NSO denied the allegations.
""We have asked WhatsApp to explain the kind of breach and what it is doing to safeguard the privacy of millions of Indian citizens,"" Prasad said in a tweet.
WhatsApp said it had no comment on Prasad's tweet, but referred to a previous WhatsApp statement that the company believes people have the fundamental right to privacy and no one else should have access to their private conversations.
Sidhant Sibal, a New Delhi-based journalist, told Reuters the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab - which investigates digital espionage among other research projects - called him about a month ago, informing him that his WhatsApp account was one of several under surveillance.
Earlier this week, he received a text message from WhatsApp, saying the company cared about ""your privacy and security"".
""In May we stopped an attack where an advanced cyber actor exploited our video calling to install malware on user devices,"" the company said, explaining why it was writing to Sibal and other affected users like him.
""There's a possibility this phone number was impacted, and we want to make sure you know how to keep your mobile phone secure.""
Citizen Lab in a post on its website dated Oct. 29, said it was helping WhatsApp investigate the incident and would continue to contact affected individuals to help protect their security.
India is WhatsApp's biggest market with 400 million users. Last year the Indian government began pushing the Cupertino, California-based company to trace the origin of some messages, saying the platform was being used to spread misinformation.
WhatsApp has always maintained it will not take such steps, which would require it to weaken encryption and other privacy protections.
Globally, the platform is used by some 1.5 billion people monthly and has often touted a high level of security, including end-to-end encrypted messages that cannot be deciphered by WhatsApp or other third parties.

In its lawsuit filed in a federal court in San Francisco, WhatsApp accused NSO of facilitating government hacking sprees in 20 countries, calling it ""an unmistakable pattern of abuse.""

710,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 11:57AM ET</span>",Altria writes down Juul investment by $4.5 billion amid vaping backlash,"By Manas Mishra
(Reuters) - Altria (NYSE:MO) Inc took a $4.5 billion hit from its investment in embattled electronic-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc on Thursday, the latest setback for the startup as a regulatory crackdown on vaping threatens to upend the fast-growing industry.
The writedown highlights the spectacular reversal in Juul's fortunes in the last few months, with its valuation shrinking by more than a third to roughly $24 billion since Altria bought a 35% stake in December.
With the deal, the U.S. maker of Marlboro had hoped to tap the market for vaping in the face of declining smoking rates and cigarette sales in the United States.
But increased political backlash and regulatory bans following a surge in teenage vaping have clouded Juul's future and were largely responsible for the collapse of Altria's merger talks with Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) last month.
Juul appointed a longtime Altria executive as its CEO last month in a bid to rebuild its image. The company has also cut jobs, suspended advertising in the United States and revamped its management.
""While we had a range of scenarios when we made the investment, we did not anticipate this dramatic a change in the e-vapor category,"" Altria Chief Executive Officer Howard Willard said on a conference call with analysts.
Willard said growth in e-cigarette volumes is likely to slow down in the United States compared with the company's original estimates.
Altria is not the only company taking a hit from the slump in Juul's valuation. Fidelity Investments' $26.7 billion Blue Chip Growth Fund recently cut the value of its stake in the vaping company by nearly half.
U.S. health regulators have announced plans to pull flavored e-cigarette products from the market, and several states and cities, including Juul's home territory San Francisco, have moved to ban them.
Antitrust enforcers are also probing Altria for potentially exerting influence over Juul Labs Inc in the resignation of former CEO Kevin Burns, who oversaw the San Francisco-based company's meteoric growth from a 300-person startup to an international operation employing thousands.
Altria on Thursday cited a number of reasons for the writedown, including higher chances of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration removing flavored e-vapor products from the market as well as bans in the United States.
While vaping devices, which vaporize a liquid containing nicotine, have borne the brunt of the regulatory crackdown globally, the FDA has authorized tobacco heating product iQOS, a rival non-smoking technology.
Altria holds the rights to sell iQOS in the United States.
""We believe that, with current adult smoker trends and e-vapor disruption, it's an opportune time to expand the availability of these options,"" Willard said in its earnings statement.
The company swung to a net loss of $2.60 billion in the third quarter due to the charge, and cut its profit growth forecast for the next three years.

711,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 11:56AM ET</span>",Thomson Reuters operating profit tops Wall Street estimates,"NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Thomson Reuters  Corp (N:TRI) (TO:TRI), parent of Reuters News, reported higher-than-expected quarterly operating profit on Thursday and said it would raise its dividend payout ratio and buy back more shares.
Chief Executive Jim Smith said the company had spent just over half the $2 billion it had set aside for acquisitions to expand its main divisions and would love to spend the rest.
Operating profit rose to $262 million, or 27 cents a share, in the third quarter, from $173 million or 12 cents a share a year ago. Analysts, on average, expected profit of 19 cents a share, according to Refinitiv. 
Thomson Reuters affirmed its 2019 and 2020 sales and earnings outlook. It said it intended to increase its dividend payout ratio to 50% to 60% of free cash flow, from 40% to 50% previously. 
The company, controlled by Canada's Thomson family, also said its board had approved a new buyback worth $200 million of shares both this year and next.
Revenue rose 10% to $1.41 billion in the quarter, slightly below estimates of $1.43 billion. So-called organic sales growth was 4%, matching the pace of the second quarter, driven by subscription sales to legal, corporate and other customers. 
Its Toronto- and New York-listed shares dipped about 0.9 percent. They have each gained more than 30 percent in 2019. 
The news and information provider posted single-digit sales increases in each of its three largest divisions, Legal Professionals, Corporates and Tax & Accounting Professionals. The Reuters News division saw organic revenue rise 3%. 
The increase in operating profit reflected the revaluation of warrants the company holds in Refinitiv, which the  London Stock Exchange  (LSE) (L:LSE) has agreed to buy, Thomson Reuters said in its statement.
Thomson Reuters sold a majority stake in its financial-data business last year to a consortium led by Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX). The LSE agreed on Aug. 1 to buy the financial-data business, now called Refinitiv, from Blackstone for $27 billion in an all-share deal. 
Thomson Reuters will hold a 15% stake in the LSE on completion of the Refinitiv deal, which is expected in the second half of 2020, the companies said. A Thomson Reuters representative will also sit on the LSE board.
Under the agreement, Thomson Reuters can sell a third of its shares in each of the third and fourth years after completion, and the rest thereafter. 
Thomson Reuters has set aside $2 billion of the $17 billion proceeds from the Blackstone deal for purchases to help expand its Legal, Tax & Accounting and Corporates businesses.
""We're about just over half of the $2 billion that we have set aside for acquisitions,"" CEO Smith said in an interview. ""I'd love to find a way to spend the other half.""

During the quarter, the company acquired events company FC Business Intelligence (FCBI), which hosts exhibitions and conferences in sectors including pharmaceuticals, energy and transport, to help promote its Reuters News brand.

(Reuters) -  Estee Lauder  Cos Inc (N:EL) cut its full-year profit forecast on Thursday as it expects to take a hit from the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong and a stronger dollar, taking the sheen off its better-than-expected results and sending its shares down 5%.
Luxury goods companies and retailers have felt the pinch from months of pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong that have forced some shops to close temporarily, and kept tourists away from one of the world's most vibrant shopping destinations.
The cosmetics maker said net sales from Hong Kong, which makes up just under 4% of its global business, had fallen 20% in the first quarter.
""Hong Kong has been difficult,"" said Chief Executive Officer Fabrizio Freda on an earnings call with analysts, adding that there was no sign of improvement in the business there to date.
Estee Lauder also said it was mindful of, among other risks, moderating growth in China from recent levels, where its sales have been growing in double digits on booming demand for high-end luxury products from affluent Chinese consumers.
""Given the fact that there are global macro slowdowns, even though we haven't, in fact, seen it in China and haven't seen it affect our Asia business in general ... it certainly could happen,"" Chief Financial Officer Tracey Travis said.
The company said it expects 2020 adjusted profit between $5.85 and $5.93 per share, down from a prior range of $5.90 to $5.98.
Estee Lauder, which generates 68% of revenue from Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa market, said the strong dollar would hit its earnings by 5 cents per share.
Another sore spot for the M.A.C brand owner was its Americas business, which is being pressured by weaker customer traffic at brick-and-mortar stores as customers shift to online shopping and buying at specialty beauty shops.
""U.S. performance will remain a concern and focus for investors as market has decelerated after Estee Lauder had talked of sequential improvement in Q4,"" Atlantic Equities analyst Edward Lewis said.
Sales in the U.S. market fell 6%, while operating income dropped 25%. In contrast, Asia Pacific region that accounts for a quarter of total sales rose 24% in the quarter.
Overall, net sales climbed 11% to $3.90 billion on the strength of its skin care brands like La Mer.
Excluding items, Estee Lauder earned $1.68 per share.
Analysts on average had expected revenue of $3.85 billion and adjusted profit of $1.60 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."
713,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 11:31AM ET</span>",European labor unions fret about jobs in Fiat Chrysler-PSA deal,"PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - European labor unions have called on  Peugeot  owner PSA and  Fiat  Chrysler to avoid job cuts and factory closures as the two major carmakers prepare to tie the knot, underscoring worries about the $50 billion deal as the regional economy falters.
As PSA (PA:PEUP) and Fiat Chrysler (MI:FCHA) detailed plans on Thursday to create the world's No. 4 automaker, IG Metall, Germany's largest union by members, said it would seek to preserve the autonomy of the French carmaker's German unit Opel.
The two groups have said no plants would be closed and an existing arrangement rules out forced layoffs at Opel, bought by PSA two years ago, until mid-2023.
But analysts expect the companies' factories in Europe which stretch from Portugal to Britain, to draw scrutiny because they have overlapping brands and underutilised factories.
FCA's underused plants in Italy employ some 58,000, more than a quarter of its workforce.
One of the main selling points of the deal is the projected annual cost savings of 3.7 billion euros ($4.1 billion) as the car industry struggles with rising costs from investing in electric cars and tough emissions targets while global car demand slows.
Securing support from Europe's powerful trade unions will also be critical for the merged company, which will employ more than 400,000 staff and operate hundreds of factories worldwide.
The deal has stirred concerns in Germany and Britain where plants making Opel and Vauxhall cars have seen jobs cut in recent year as part of a cost-cutting drive pushed by PSA CEO Carlos Tavares, who will also lead the merged company.
""We expect parent company PSA to preserve Opel and the development center, and to invest in Ruesselsheim,"" said Volker Bouffier, Prime Minister of the regional state of Hesse referring to Opel's headquarters.
Opel returned to profit in the first half of 2019 for the first time in 18 years.
Still lacklustre demand for Opel's Insignia sedan has forced Ruesselsheim to almost halve output to 68,000 vehicles this year, and to start shorter working hours, calling into question the need for current staff levels.
Britain's biggest trade union Unite said it wants a meeting with PSA management, saying the merger and uncertainty over Brexit are ""deeply unsettling"" for workers.
PSA runs a southern English van factory in Luton and a car plant in Ellesmere port, near Liverpool.
Highlighting particular worry in Italy, one of the country's top trade unions FIOM was the first to comment on the deal: it fears the merger could hurt factories there more than FCA's failed tie-up with  Renault  (PA:RENA).
""We are twice as worried about a potential FCA-PSA tie-up as we were about a merger with Nissan-Renault on the future of FCA's Italian factories"" Michele De Palma, head of the auto sector workers at FIOM, told Reuters on Wednesday.
Politicans also voiced concerns about jobs.
In France, where Citroen celebrates its centenary this year, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire gave his blessing to the merger, saying the deal would be good news for the country and Europe but that he would keep an eye on possible job cuts.
Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said that merger plan must keep jobs and factories at home. He said he would talk to FCA Chairman John Elkann shortly to get details about the plan."

MONTREAL (Reuters) -  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) said on Thursday it would meet a key 2019 target and announced a deal worth more than $1 billion with Spirit Aerosystems (N:SPR), sending shares up nearly 7% despite reporting it burned more cash than expected.
Montreal-based Bombardier is in the middle of a restructuring, shedding underperforming commercial plane programs to focus on more profitable business jet and rail units.
The company spent more cash than expected during the third quarter while bringing its flagship corporate jet to market and amid project delivery delays in its key rail business, the company's largest division by revenue.
Yet Bombardier said its free cash flow usage for the year would remain at around $500 million and reiterated its 2020 outlook for positive earnings growth and cash generation.
Bombardier Chief Financial Officer John Di Bert said he expects stronger revenues and better margins for Bombardier Transportation in 2020 as delayed rail projects are completed.
“We believe we have seen the low point on BT margins in 2019,” Di Bert told analysts.
The company also said it will sell two aerostructures facilities, including one in Northern Ireland, and a smaller U.S. repair plant, to Spirit for $500 million cash and $700 million in assumed liabilities. Reuters early Thursday reported the two were in advanced talks.
The Belfast plant, which produces wings for Airbus's (PA:AIR) A220 jet, is considered politically sensitive as it is the largest high-tech manufacturer in Northern Ireland with a workforce of around 3,500.
The plant “is absolutely integral to Northern Ireland,"" East Belfast member of parliament Gavin Robinson said in a statement welcoming the move.
British business minister Nadhim Zahawi on Thursday called the deal great news for workers and a welcome investment in the United Kingdom.
Airbus, which had been monitoring the sale, said in a statement the company is confident ""Spirit’s acquisition of Bombardier’s aerostructures assets will support the strong and sustainable future for the A220 program.""
Earlier in the day, Bombardier said free cash flow usage for the third quarter rose 84% from a year earlier to $682 million. Analysts on average were expecting a free cash outflow of $332.98 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Chief Executive Alain Bellemare told analysts that demand for new large-cabin business jets like its flagship Global 7500 is driving growth, while demand for medium-sized business jets remains stable.
Bombardier will need to deliver 10 to 15 Global 7500 jets, which list for $73 million each, during the last three months of 2019 to meet its target of 15 to 20 deliveries this year. The company has delivered five Global 7500 jets to date."

(Reuters) - Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (O:DNKN) reported better-than-expected quarterly profit amid lower costs on Thursday and raised its forecast for 2019, betting on investments to improve delivery and new menu items to boost growth.
The company, which also owns ice-cream chain Baskin Robbins, now expects adjusted earnings of $3.10 per share to $3.12 per share for 2019, exceeding its prior estimate of $3.02 to $3.05.
Shares of the company, whose brand has been built around donuts and coffee, climbed 6% to $78.43 in morning trading.
Besides pushing for speedy delivery and introducing new menu items, the company has also latched on to the plant-based meat trend that has taken over the restaurant industry, by rolling out Beyond Meat (O:BYND) breakfast sandwiches.
""We believe it's a trend and not a fad,"" Chief Executive David Hoffmann told Reuters in a phone interview, adding that the chain put its unique ""Dunkin' spin on it.""
It will be the first breakfast restaurant to launch a plant-based protein nationwide when it rolls out its Beyond Sausage Sandwich on Nov. 5 after successful tests in Manhattan and a few other areas.
But Dunkin' is also playing defence in an extremely competitive breakfast and coffee markets, pushing into premium coffees sold at affordable prices compared with rival  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX).
Sales at its U.S. Dunkin' stores open more than an year rose at a slower-than-expected pace, growing 1.5% in the third-quarter ended Sept. 28, below 1.7% estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
It also saw a decline in traffic versus Starbucks' 3% gain. Dunkin' didn't provide details on the drop in traffic.
""Although we believe espresso, along with targeted $2 afternoon beverage promotions, helped deliver afternoon traffic, it likely was not enough to offset the traffic decline"" in the core morning part of the day, Maxim (NASDAQ:MXIM) analyst Stephen Anderson wrote in a note about Dunkin'.
""We know there is more to be done. The consumer, we think, is strong. We are seeing a really good, healthy consumer,"" Hoffmann told Reuters.
Burger chain The Wendy's Co (O:WEN) also plans to launch into breakfast next year.
Dunkin's DD Perks loyalty programme had 12 million members at the end of the third quarter as it continued to boost its digital programs.
""We know we've got some gaps to close in terms of our loyalty and also mobile order and pay,"" Hoffmann told investors during an earlier call.
General and administrative expenses fell nearly 6% in the quarter.
Net income rose to $72.4 million (£56 million), or 86 cents per share, from $66.1 million, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier.

718,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 10:55AM ET</span>","The Bond Trade of the Year May Be Back, All Thanks to the Fed","(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve decision to halt interest-rate cuts amid lingering global economic gloom may have given bond traders just the thing to reboot this year’s best trade -- buying long-dated government debt.
Top-rated markets from the U.S. to Germany saw securities due in 10 years or more rally Thursday, outpacing short-dated ones, dragging yield curves down from the steepest levels in about three months. Mizuho International Plc suggests that investors position for an extension of the move with so-called flattener trades, which profit when longer-term yields fall faster than near-maturity ones.
The latest bond gains signal a return, after a two-month letup, to the bullish tone that fueled a stellar rally earlier this year. Bonds due in 10 years and longer returned 14% since Dec. 31 as growth pessimism fueled a flight into the safest assets. That compares with 5% for debt of maturities up to five years.
While demand for far-maturity sovereign debt should continue amid unresolved global trade tensions, a Fed policy pause means less downward pressure on short-term yields -- and that points to a flatter yield curve.
“There is a pretty clear return in demand for global rates duration,” said Peter Chatwell, head of European rates strategy at Mizuho. “The Fed’s pause is not an end to its easing cycle, but for now it means U.S. curves can bull-flatten rather than steepen.”
Thursday’s bond rally suggested some amount of market skepticism over Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s remark that U.S. monetary policy is now in a “good place” -- an assurance that may have been partly overshadowed by China casting doubts about the possibility of a comprehensive long-term trade deal with the U.S.
The yield premium on 10-year Treasuries over two-year notes fell two basis points Thursday to 15 basis points, extending a pullback from an Oct. 29 high of 20 basis points, which was the highest since July. A similar spread in Germany declined two basis points to 25, compared with an Oct. 22 high of 32 basis points that was the most since Aug. 1. The yield on U.S. bonds due in a decade slumped seven basis points Thursday to 1.70%, the biggest decline since Sept. 24.
Mizuho recommends buying 30-year Dutch bonds versus selling French 10-year debt. That’s in addition to outstanding flattener recommendations in the U.S. and Australia."

Ride-hailing apps have drawn the ire of authorities in Colombia, where their use is widespread but illegal. The country has not specifically regulated the apps, but has fined Uber hundreds of thousands of dollars for obstructing a 2017 regulatory visit.
The center, which had been set to be the company's third in Latin America, was meant to begin operation in 2020 and would have provided 600 jobs, the company said in a statement.
""After six years looking for avenues for dialogue and in the absence of a roadmap to advance regulatory stability and legal security, we regret that we will need to relocate the destination of the investment,"" Uber's general manager for Colombia Nicolas Pardo said.
Uber says it is regulated in 80 jurisdictions in Latin America. In Colombia it claims 2 million clients and 88,000 drivers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) is recalling 638,000 U.S. sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks because a wheel-speed sensor could fail and cause unintended braking, it said Thursday. 
The recall covers 2015-2020 Chevrolet Suburban, Tahoe, and Yukon and 2014-2018 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 vehicles equipped with a 5.3-liter engine, a 3.08-ratio rear axle and four-wheel drive.
The sensor failure could result in unintended activation of the driveline protection system, and cause unintended braking of the wheel on the opposite side of the failed sensor. That could cause the vehicle to pull to one side unexpectedly, increasing the risk of a crash, the Detroit automaker said. 
GM said it was not aware of any crashes relating to the issue but found 150 field claims alleging the condition caused unintended braking or lateral-vehicle motion.

A GM dealer in May submitted a warranty report relating to the issue in a 2018 GMC Yukon, and two day later, a GM brand quality manager submitted the report to GM’s Speak Up For Safety program that tracks potential safety issues, which prompted a GM investigation and testing.

Saudi Arabia is considering increasing how much the kingdom’s banks can lend to local investors who want to buy shares in Aramco’s initial public offering, people with knowledge of the matter said.
The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority met banks this week to discuss how much they can lend to domestic stock buyers who want to invest in the oil giant’s IPO, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Some lenders are seeking permission to offer greater leverage than what the central bank normally allows, they said.
The regulator wants to ensure that they are able to maintain enough liquidity in the local financial system, while still ensuring enough loans are available to support investors in the IPO, the people said. The final amount lenders are willing to provide will depend on the valuation Aramco seeks, with banks likely to be more conservative at higher valuations, they said.
Loyal Investors
Saudi banks are gearing up for what’s set to be the world’s biggest share sale after years of falling loan growth and a decline in the pace of economic expansion. Many Saudis are expected to buy into the offering -- only the kingdom’s sixth in two years -- as a demonstration of loyalty to the country, allowing institutions to cash in on revenue generated from margin loans and brokerage.
SAMA’s meeting with banks Tuesday was part of the periodic meetings the central bank holds with lenders, a representative for SAMA said in an emailed statement. Aramco, officially known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., declined to comment.
The sale could add as much as $12 billion in bank deposits as foreign funds buy up as much as 30% of stock being offered, according to Arqaam Capital Ltd. It’s also set to provide a much-welcome boost to lenders as Saudi citizens borrow to sign up to the sale. But any jump in lending could be brief -- as investors receive only a portion of the shares they bid for -- and borrowers are at risk of defaulting if the deal turns sour."

1. Tech in Focus as Apple, Facebook Beat
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) climbed in postmarket trading on Wednesday after the social media giant topped earnings and revenue estimates, led by a rise in advertising growth.
The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.12 on revenue of $17.65 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com expected EPS of $1.90 on revenue of $17.36 billion. That compared to EPS of $1.76 on revenue of $13.73 billion in the same period a year earlier.
Advertising revenue rose 28% to $17.38 billion in the third quarter from a year earlier.
Shares were up about 4.6% after hours.
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) were up about 2% after the company delivered pretty much everything investors were looking for.
In addition to beating earnings and revenue expecations, the company guided sales in line with expectations for its fiscal first quarter, the all-important holiday shopping period and the first full quarter for sales of the iPhone 11, which has helped rejuvenate interest in its handsets.
It guided fiscal first-quarter sales of $85.5 billion to $89.5 billion, compared with the consensus forecast of $86.2 billion from S&P Capital IQ. The midpoint of the guidance was slightly above expectations at $87.5 billion.
2. Consumer, Jobs and Inflation in Focus
Inflation, jobless claims numbers and consumer data are on the economic agenda for tomorrow.
The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the core PCE index, which calculates spending minus volatile food and energy costs, arrives along with personal spending and income numbers from Commerce Department at 8.30 AM ET (12:30 PM GMT).
The September core PCE is expected remain unchanged at 0.1% for September, but slow to 1.7% from 1.8% a year earlier.
The inflation data comes just a day after the Fed singled out “muted inflation pressures” as one of its primary reasons for cutting rates for the third time this year.
Ahead of Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report, meanwhile, the Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of new individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended Oct. 26.
Economists forecast that initial jobless claims increased 215,000, up from the 212,000 rise seen the previous week.
The consumer, the backbone of the economy (as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noted Wednesday), is also in focus with personal spending and income data due.
Personal income for September is forecast to have slowed to 0.3% from 0.4% in the prior month while personal spending is expected to have risen 0.2%.
3. Kraft Heinz in Focus as Earnings Show Continues
Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) has had it tough so far, with its shares down by about a third so far this year as rising costs and weaker sales have kept a lid on financial performance.
The packaged food and beverage giant reports earnings before the bell. But there appear few willing to bet the company will deliver a good third quarter, with many keen for an update on the company’s plans to turn around performance.
Kraft Heinz is expected to report earnings of 54 cents per share on revenue of $6.13 billion, down from 78 cents a share in earnings on revenue of $6.38 billion a year ago.
Other notable companies reporting earnings tomorrow include Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDSa), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), Clorox (NYSE:CLX),   Dunkin Brands Group   (NASDAQ:DNKN) and Altria (NYSE:MO).
Moves in tech stocks will likely be dominated by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). "
724,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 09:52AM ET</span>",Stronger together: Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot plan world's No.4 carmaker,"By Giulio Piovaccari and Geert De Clercq
MILAN/PARIS (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and  Peugeot  owner PSA (PA:PEUP) plan to join forces in a 50-50 share merger to create the world's fourth-largest automaker, seeking scale to cope with costly new technologies and slowing global demand.
Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and PSA said on Thursday they aimed to reach a binding deal in the coming weeks to create a $50 billion group with listings in Paris, Milan and New York, and with PSA's Carlos Tavares as chief executive and FCA's John Elkann as chairman. 
It was less than five months ago that FCA abandoned merger talks with PSA's French rival  Renault  (PA:RENA) and the move comes as carmakers grapple with a downturn in their markets as well as hefty investments in electric and self-driving vehicles.
FCA would get access to PSA's more modern vehicle platforms, helping it to meet tough new emissions rules, while Europe-focused PSA would benefit from FCA's profitable U.S. business featuring brands such as Ram and Jeep. 
However, the PSA-FCA deal could still face close regulatory scrutiny, while governments in Rome, Paris and unions are all likely to be wary about potential job losses from a combined workforce of around 400,000.
Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois said that, adjusting for the differences in market value and planned dividend payments, achieving the 50-50 split would effectively see PSA paying a 32% premium to take control of FCA.
FCA shares jumped as much as 11% to a one-year high of 14.248 euros. PSA shares fell as much as 14% to a two-week low of 22.33 euros. 
""PSA shareholders are assuming more market risk than FCA's,"" Houchois said, adding a PSA-FCA deal was still the most logical and attractive combination in the industry. 
SAVINGS 
The companies said they would seek to finalize a deal to create a group with 8.7 million in annual vehicle sales, putting it fourth globally behind Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Toyota and the Renault-Nissan alliance. 
They aim to make 3.7 billion euros ($4.1 billion) of savings without plant closures, and achieve around 80% within four years, at a one-off cost of 2.8 billion euros.
The group will include the Fiat, Jeep, Dodge, Ram, Chrysler, Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Peugeot, DS, Opel and Vauxhall brands, serving mass and premium passenger car markets as well as trucks and light commercial vehicles markets. 
The plan comes at a difficult time for automakers. Manufacturers Ford, Daimler and Volkswagen and supplier Continental have in the past months lowered their forecasts citing a steeper-than-expected drop in demand.
However, FCA bucked the trend on Thursday, beating third-quarter earnings forecasts thanks to record profitability in its North American business.
JOB FEARS
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire welcomed tie-up plan, which would give Paris a say in two of the world's top four carmakers. That contrasts with a FCA-Renault merger, which risked leaving PSA behind. 
""It gives us critical size to face the dual challenges of autonomous vehicles and electric cars,"" Le Maire told reporters.
Paris, which has a 12% stake in PSA, was blamed for the collapse of the FCA-Renault talks by urging Renault to focus on its existing alliance with Japan's Nissan. The French government also owns 15% of Renault.
Italian industry minister Stefano Patuanelli said the deal was good news provided it didn't affect jobs in Italy.
The combined group will be domiciled in the Netherlands, but have operating centres in France, Italy and the United States, and will have an 11-person board, with six members coming from PSA including Tavares, and five from FCA including Elkann.
Analysts, who questioned whether FCA and Renault had the management expertise to deliver a mega-merger, said Tavares was the right man for the job, having returned Opel to profit after buying it from General Motors (NYSE:GM) in 2017. 
The former Renault executive has emerged as one of the leading figures in the auto industry following the death last year of FCA's former CEO Sergio Marchionne and the arrest of former Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn.
Marchionne long championed a merger for FCA, a cause that has been taken up by Elkann, a scion of the Agnelli family that owns a 29.2% stake in FCA and will be the largest shareholder in a combined PSA-FCA, with a 14.5% stake. 
One industry source said Tavares had made savings at Opel by cutting engineering centres in Germany and consolidating activity in France. A similar move with FCA could fuel opposition in Italy. 
As part of the deal, FCA will pay its shareholders a 5.5 billion euro special dividend and hand them shares in its robot-making unit Comau. PSA, meanwhile, will distribute to its investors its 46% stake in supplier Faurecia.
Citi analysts said the cash payout for FCA shareholders contrasted with the Faurecia shares, worth about 2.7 billion euros at Wednesday's close, being offered to PSA shareholders, saying the latter were ""being asked to remain patient.""
China's Dongfeng Motor has a 12.2% equity stake and 19.5% voting stake in PSA, and there has been speculation it might use the tie-up to sell its holdings. 
One banking source told Reuters Dongfeng would be able to sell its stakes, which could help ease the deal's passage through U.S. regulators, given U.S.-Chinese trade tensions.
BENEFITS
Stricter anti-pollution rules from 2021 have triggered heavy investments into electric and hybrid vehicles as European lawmakers force a further reduction in vehicle C02 emissions.
A combination with PSA would give FCA access to the French group's CMP modular platform, which was launched in 2019 for Peugeot's e-208 compact city car, and donated for Opel to build the Corsa-e mini.
The CMP platform was jointly developed by Dongfeng and PSA.
Strategy firm PA Consulting has forecast FCA faces 700 million euros ($777 million) in emissions fines unless it radically shifts to selling more electric and hybrid cars.
PSA has moved Opel and Vauxhall from nine GM platforms to just two, helping Opel to return to profit after more than a decade of losses. 
FCA is being advised by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and D'Angelin; PSA is working with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Mediobanca's Messier Maris & Associes unit and Perella; and Lazard is advising Exor, the Agnelli's holding company, sources close to the deal said.

725,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 09:41AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Mixed as Trade Uncertainty Outweighs Strong Tech Earnings ,"Investing.com – Wall Street was mixed on Thursday as U.S-China trade doubts resurfaced, outweighing strong earnings from some of the biggest names in the technology sector. 
The Dow was down 43 points or 0.2% by 9:39 AM ET (13:39 GMT), while the S&P 500 fell 3 points or 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite rose 14 points or 0.2%. 
A report by Bloomberg cast doubt over the course of the U.S.-China trade dispute, alleging that Chinese officials are reluctant to commit to any long-term deal with President Donald Trump, whom they see as unreliable. That's despite both countries saying they had made substantial progress to a preliminary deal in the coming weeks. The report repeated familiar grumbles by Chinese officials resisting the structural reforms demanded by the U.S., which include state subsidies and protection for intellectual property rights.
The news overshadowed upbeat results from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), and others in the three months through September.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 1.8% as iPad and AirPod sales cushioned a drop in iPhone sales in the final quarter of its fiscal year, while upbeat earnings from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) helped their stocks rise 5.2% and 0.9% respectively.   Lyft   (NASDAQ:LYFT) gained 4% as its earnings came in better than expected, with the ride-sharing company losing less money than forecast in the last quarter.
Elsewhere, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) fell 1.7%, while   Western Digital   (NASDAQ:WDC) tumbled 11% on news that its CEO Steve Milligan plans to retire.
Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) added another 4.0% to Wednesday's gains after the terms of its agreed merger with Peugeot were published, envisaging a special dividend for Fiat shareholders of over $6 billion and ascribing more value than expected to its Alfa Romeo and Maserati brands.
In commodities, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.3% to 97.180 and gold futures jumped 0.9% to $1,510.10 a troy ounce. Crude oil futures fell 0.9% to $54.58 a barrel. "

727,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 08:43AM ET</span>","World stocks touch 20-month high, bond yields drop after Fed cuts","By Tom Wilson
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks edged to their highest in over 20 months on Thursday after the Federal Reserve cut rates even as it signaled it would hold back from further reductions, sending bond yields and the dollar down. 
MSCI's world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 0.1% to its highest since early February last year, with many investors remaining expectant of further easing in spite of the Fed's slightly hawkish tone. 
The U.S. central bank on Wednesday cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point, its third reduction this year, to help sustain U.S. growth in the face of slowdowns elsewhere in the world. Yet it signaled there would be no further reductions, barring economic shocks.
Asian stocks outside Japan had earlier forged ahead on the cuts, following Wall Street's advance to fresh record highs, climbing 0.3% to touch their highest since Jul. 30.
But the positive mood was tempered in Europe after a Bloomberg report that Chinese officials doubt a long-term trade deal with the United States was possible, which sent shares into negative territory.
The broad Euro STOXX 600 fell 0.4%, wiping out earlier gains, with auto and energy stocks slumping. German stocks, seen as heavily exposed to international trade, fell 0.7%.
A deal between Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot owner PSA to create the world's fourth-biggest automaker lifted Fiat Chrysler shares by 8.5%.
Wall Street futures were down around 0.3%.
Jerome Powell, the Fed's chair, had on Wednesday given an upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy and geopolitical risks from Washington's trade war with China to Brexit had eased. 
Yet many investors held on to expectations that further rate cuts could come should the U.S. economy turn sour next year, and on Thursday money moved to riskier assets. 
""Markets are discounting some more easing, but not very aggressively at this stage,"" said Klaus Baader, chief global economist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
""We think the U.S. is going slide into recession, and that is likely some time around the middle of 2020. If the economy slides into recession, we think the Fed will continue to cut interest rates aggressively - even though this isn't mainstream thinking."" 
The dollar against a basket of six major currencies slipped 0.4% to 97.28, its lowest in a week, after rising a day earlier.
Bond yields also fell. German Bund yields, seen as a benchmark for euro zone government debt, were set for their biggest fall this month. U.S Treasury yields also dropped, extending a fall from Wednesday, and were last down around 5 basis points on the day.
Emerging stocks rose 0.3% to their highest in three months, and were on course for a second straight month of healthy gains. 
The U.S. central bank had dropped a previous reference in its policy statement that it ""will act as appropriate"" to sustain the economic expansion - language that was considered a sign for future cuts. 
Even so, market players said they thought the Fed could act should geopolitical risks flare up. 
""I think the Fed is likely to remain in a wait-and-see position in the short term,"" said Christophe Barraud, chief economist at Market Securities in Paris. 
""If there is a big disappointment on the trade front, that would likely to lead to another wave of tariffs and a major risk for the U.S. economy."" 
POLICY TOOL BOX
After the Fed cuts, the S&P 500 index closed at another record high on Wednesday, though some in the market voiced concern that central banks across the world lack room to respond to any economic downturn. 
""I'd be worried that there isn't enough in the tool box,"" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com. ""The Fed is in a better state than most, but I'm not sure what Europe and Japan can do."" 
The Bank of Japan kept policy steady on Thursday, but introduced new forward guidance - a pledge central banks make on future policy - that commits more strongly to perpetuating ultra-low interest rates.
The Japanese yen rose 0.6% to 108.19 per dollar, its highest in two weeks, holding onto gains after the BOJ's move and boosted further after the Bloomberg report.
In commodity markets, oil prices were steady despite bearish signals from rising U.S. crude oil stocks and weak factory activity in China.

Brent crude futures were last down 0.2%, or 18 cents, at $60.43 a barrel.

(Reuters) - European shares reversed course to trade lower on Thursday after China said it doubts a long-term trade deal is possible with the United States, tempering gains that came earlier in the day after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates.
A Bloomberg report said that China is doubtful of a long-term trade deal with U.S. President Donald Trump, raising fresh uncertainty about trade progress between the two countries after an interim trade deal was almost finalized.
By 0950 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) moved 0.5% lower, but was on track to end higher in a busy month of earnings peppered with some Brexit and trade twists.
""In terms of a long term deal, the relationship between China and the United States is fundamentally problematic,"" Teeuwe Mevissen, senior market economist at Rabobank, said. ""The trade war is here to stay.""
Twists in the tit-for-tat trade war between the world's two largest economies have kept financial markets on edge with global growth taking a toll.
Apart from the trade drama, there was plenty of action in earnings with energy heavyweight Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) down 2.5%, after warning that uncertain economic conditions could slow its $25 billion share buyback plan.
That followed fellow British firm  BP  (L:BP) France's  Total  (PA:TOTF) warning earlier this week about lower oil and gas prices hitting margins.
Another set of disappointing numbers came from carriers with Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) down 5%, after it said slowing travel demand is likely to hurt ticket sales in the remainder of 2019.
British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) said industrial action from pilots at the airline had knocked down its third-quarter profits.
In the auto sector, a deal between  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and  Peugeot  owner PSA (PA:PEUP) to create the world's fourth-largest automaker lifted the shares of Fiat Chrysler 10%.
However, Peugeot owner PSA (PA:PEUP) fell 9%, after having risen nearly 5% in the last three sessions in the run-up to the deal.
Among positive movers in a gloomy market, shares of Dutch semiconductor supplier ASM International (AS:ASMI) rose 8% to top the STOXX 600 index after it forecast a rise in sales for the fourth quarter."

732,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 07:34AM ET</span>","Price cuts, iPhone 11 timing drive Apple's uncertain China rebound: analysts","By Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) managed to largely stem a fall in China revenue in the September quarter thanks to the release-timing of the iPhone 11, a cheaper variant, and a bit of good luck, but analysts said the company's good fortunes might be shortlived.
Apple said sales in greater China fell 2.4% in its fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, a far cry from the 27% drop it saw in the first quarter this year - a fact that Chief Executive Tim Cook played up on the company's post-earnings call on Wednesday.
A confluence of things helped.
The company priced the cheapest variant of its iPhone 11 at $50 less than the last generation model, even as it pulled in the launch of the new models by a month versus last year, which helped sales in the September quarter.
This followed a year of heavy discounting on older iPhone models as Apple gave resellers flexibility to cut prices, contrary to past practice. As well, the company recently introduced installment-based payment plans to push sales in a weaker economy and a contracting smartphone market.
""Apple's new low-price strategy in China had an extremely large impact,"" said James Yan, who tracks China's smartphone market at Counterpoint Research.
But the company is expected to launch a 5G-enabled smartphone only next year, which analysts say is a problem when Huawei, China's top smartphone maker, launched its first 5G phone in June - the Mate 20 X, priced at 6,199 yuan ($901).
Smaller phonemakers including Xiaomi have quickly followed suit as China's state-owned carriers are set to launch 5G services on Friday, effectively bringing ultra-fast web connectivity to the masses.
Yan expects cheaper 5G devices from these companies to flood the market in China next year, pushing down Apple's sales.
Huawei cornered the lion's share of the China market in the July-September period, according to market research firm Canalys, leaving Apple toward the bottom of the pile.
TIMING MATTERS
The September quarter was indeed an improvement for Apple in China.
Services revenue - which the company has been touting as a growth driver as iPhone volumes plateau - rose by double digits in China as more iPhone users downloaded games on the App store, after regulators continued to approve games following a months-long ban.
Chinese authorities approved 291 domestic and imported titles for in-app purchases in July-September, pushing up downloads of popular titles including Tencent's Battle Through The Heavens and NetEase's Pro Evolution Soccer.
Nicole Peng, who tracks China's smartphone industry at Canalys, said the rise in Apple's services revenue is also testament to the fact that Chinese consumers are getting more used to paying for online content.
""Even on Android and WeChat, a lot more content requires users to pay membership or subscription fees,"" she said.
Peng also noted that an option to trade-in older models was featured more prominently on Apple's China website this year and retail staff have been pushing the service to customers.
In the past, faced with a trade-in choice, ""Chinese consumers would ask, 'Why would I want to trade in my phone? Are you saying I don't have enough money to buy it?'"" she said.
But domestic resellers such as Aihuishou, Huishoubao and Alibaba's used-goods site Xianyu, have helped consumers who might have switched to cheaper Android phones understand that the cost of an iPhone can be offset.
""For Apple, it was the right time to get these better-educated customers to use their trade-in services."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (N:BMY) reported higher-than-expected third-quarter profit on Thursday, helped by strong sales of blood thinner Eliquis, even as growth of its blockbuster cancer treatment Opdivo slowed.
Bristol-Myers, which is set to buy biotechnology company  Celgene Corp  (O:CELG) for $74 billion later this year, posted net earnings of $1.35 billion, or 83 cents a share, in the quarter, down from $1.9 billion, or $1.16 a share, last year.
Excluding one-time items, the company said it earned $1.17 a share, exceeding analysts' expectations of $1.07 a share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company raised both ends of its full-year adjusted earnings forecast range by 5 cents and now expects a profit of $4.25 to $4.35 per share. Analysts had been estimating the company will earn $4.28 a share in 2019.
Sales of cancer immunotherapy Opdivo rose only 1% from a year ago to $1.82 billion, roughly in-line with Wall Street expectations. Once viewed as the company's most important growth driver, Opdivo sales have hovered around $1.8 billion a quarter for the past four quarters.
Meanwhile, Merck & Co's (N:MRK) rival drug Keytruda brought in nearly $3.2 billion in the third quarter, up 67% from the previous year.
There has been widespread investor concern over the dominance of Keytruda, as it has become the go to treatment for newly diagnosed advanced lung cancer, the most lucrative oncology market. Bristol-Myers is hoping recent positive results in two clinical trials will help improve Opdivo's position in lung cancer.
Eliquis, which Bristol shares with  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE), continues to be a bright spot. Its sales rose 22% to $1.93 billion, while analysts were estimating $1.85 billion.
Sales of rheumatoid arthritis drug Orencia and leukemia treatment Sprycel also were stronger than analysts had forecast.
Revenue in the quarter rose 6% from a year ago to $6 billion, also topping Wall Street expectations of $5.89 billion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) will ban political advertising on its platform next month, the company's chief executive said on Wednesday, a move that won praise from Democrats and scorn from Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
""We've made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally,"" said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in a statement https://twitter.com/jack/status/1189634360472829952. ""We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought.""
Analysts do not expect the ban, which takes effect on Nov. 22, to significantly reduce Twitter's business. Its shares fell 1.9% in after-hours trading.
Social media companies, including Twitter rival  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) face growing pressure to stop carrying ads that spread false information that could steer elections.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg opened his earnings conference call on Wednesday by defending the company's policy to run ads from politicians containing false or misleading claims, saying that Facebook did not want to stifle political speech.
The company confirmed to Reuters on Monday that some employees had criticized its policy in an internal letter. Zuckerberg estimated ads from politicians would account for under 0.5% of Facebook's revenue next year.
""I expect that this is going to be a very tough year,"" he said, adding that controversies over political content could lead to investigations. Facebook reported its third straight rise in quarterly sales growth on Wednesday, beating analysts' average estimate.
Facebook has pledged efforts to deal with misinformation after Russian propaganda on the platform was seen to affect the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, which was won by Trump, a Republican.
But the social media giant made a decision to not fact-check ads run by politicians, drawing ire from Democratic candidates running in the 2020 presidential election such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren.
""We appreciate that Twitter recognizes that they should not permit disproven smears, like those from the Trump campaign, to appear in advertisements on their platform,"" said Bill Russo, deputy communications director for the Biden campaign, in an emailed statement.
""SIGNIFICANT RISKS""
Biden has faced attacks from Trump, offered without evidence, about the foreign business dealings of his son Hunter.
""It would be unfortunate to suggest that the only option available to social media companies to do so is the full withdrawal of political advertising, but when faced with a choice between ad dollars and the integrity of our democracy, it is encouraging that, for once, revenue did not win out,"" said Russo.
Brad Parscale, who is running Trump's re-election campaign, described Twitter's move as an ""attempt to silence conservatives"" and ""a very dumb decision"" for the company's shareholders.
""Will Twitter also be stopping ads from biased liberal media outlets who will now run unchecked as they buy obvious political content meant to attack Republicans,"" Parscale said in a statement. ""This is yet another attempt to silence conservatives, since Twitter knows President Trump has the most sophisticated online program ever known.""
A Twitter spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Dorsey wrote on Twitter that paying for ads forces ""targeted political messages on people"" with a power that ""brings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions.""
He added that it was not credible for Twitter to say it was trying to stop the spread of misleading information ""buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad...well...they can say whatever they want!""
David Herrmann, president of Hermann Digital LLC, a Los Angeles-based independent media buyer who works with direct-to-consumer brands, said he disagreed with the notion of banning political ads on any network, including Twitter.
""Banning political ads doesn't hurt presidential campaigns, it hurts local politics that are dependent on reach from paid"" ads, he tweeted."

740,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 06:43AM ET</span>",Carlyle's third-quarter earnings drop by a quarter as asset sales slow,"By Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) - U.S. buyout firm  Carlyle Group  LP (O:CG) reported a 25% year-on-year drop in its third-quarter earnings on Thursday, driven by lower proceeds from asset sales in its private equity portfolio.
The Washington, D.C.-based firm said a slower pace of exit activity in some of its large buyout funds weighed on the revenue it generated from performance fees. It gets paid such fees when a minimum return for its investors, typically 8%, is generated by its portfolio companies paying dividends or being divested.
Carlyle said its after-tax distributable earnings - the cash available for paying dividends - totaled $146.1 million, down from $194.7 million a year earlier.
However, Carlyle's after-tax distributable earnings per share of 41 cents came in slightly higher than the average analyst forecast of 40 cents per share, according to Refinitiv.
""While the investment environment remains challenging, our global platform and industry sector-driven driven approach positions us well to drive performance,"" Carlyle Co-CEOs Kewsong Lee and Glenn Youngkin said in a statement.
Carlyle's third-quarter results are in line with its peers. Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) and KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) both reported declines in their distributable earnings, owing to fewer sales of assets from their private equity funds.
Carlyle's private equity funds appreciated by 1% in the quarter, while its real estate funds appreciated by 3%. By comparison, Blackstone's private equity and opportunistic real estate funds appreciated by 2.6% and 3.8%, respectively.
Carlyle's total assets under management stood at $222 billion as of the end of June, down slightly from the $223 billion reported in the previous quarter. Its third-quarter management fees came in at $385 million, up 8% year-on-year.
In July, Carlyle became the first U.S. private equity firm to announce that it will hold shareholder votes and adopt a single-class share structure, as it coverts from a partnership to a corporation effective Jan. 1.
The move was aimed at boosting Carlyle's stock performance, because it allows the buyout firm to be included in indices that make it more popular with investors. The stock has risen by about 15% since the announcement."

TOKYO/OSAKA (Reuters) - Nintendo Co Ltd's (T:7974) second-quarter operating profit more than doubled, blowing past analyst estimates, on strong demand for its Switch console.
Nintendo sold 4.98 million units of its hybrid home-portable Switch device in the six months to September and 1.95 million handheld-only Switch Lite units that went on sale in September.
It would be ""premature"" to raise Nintendo's full-year hardware sales forecast for Switch from 18 million units, CEO Shuntaro Furukawa told reporters in Osaka.
The Switch Lite launch is part of the Kyoto-based firm's drive to expand the device's appeal beyond hardcore gamers, with the arrival of two Pokemon titles next month expected to drive demand for the low-cost version of the device.
Nintendo, which drew in millions of casual players with the its Wii Fit game and balance board gadget 12 years ago, faces ever more competition from smartphone apps to video streaming.
This month, Nintendo launched Ring Fit Adventure, a title which, using the Switch's sensor-packed controllers and the bundled springy plastic Ring-Con, allows players to explore a fantasy world through actions like jogging and jumping.
Nintendo brought one of its marquee franchises, Mario Kart, to mobile in September, with the title downloaded over 120 million times in its first month, outstripping other mobile releases from the gaming company over a comparable period.
With revenue at $0.26 per player for the Mario Kart title, according to data from Sensor Tower, far behind Dragalia Lost's $16.50 per player, Nintendo is yet to demonstrate the saturated mobile market can become a substantial revenue driver.
Furukawa declined to say when the game's multiplayer option, which is currently greyed-out in-game and has been a focus for player complaints, would be activated.
Nintendo's operating profit for the July-September quarter was 66.8 billion yen ($615 million) versus 30.9 billion yen a year earlier. That was well above an average forecast of 50 billion yen from 10 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
The company's shares closed up 0.3% on Thursday ahead of earnings. The stock has risen 32% this year although that upwards trajectory has stalled in recent months.
Nintendo has struggled to replicate the runaway success of mobile title Pokemon Go, developed by San Francisco-based Niantic, which has, three years after it launched, generated more than $3 billion in revenues, according to Sensor Tower.
The commercialization of Pokemon, which spans games, toys, and TV, contrasts with Nintendo's often conservative use of characters like Mario.
However, the gaming company is taking inspiration from the string of Pokemon Center retail stores with the launch of a Nintendo-themed store in Tokyo's Shibuya district next month."
746,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 05:05AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Peugeot Slumps, FCA Surges on Deal Terms","Investing.com -- They loved it yesterday, but  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) shareholders are revolting at the thought of the merger with   Fiat   Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) now that the terms have been announced.
Shares in the French auto group fell over 10% in early trading Thursday after the two companies announced what they called a merger of equals which would create the world's fourth-largest automotive group with annual revenues of around 170 billion euros ($190 billion). It would see Peugeot boss Carlos Tavares installed as chief executive, with FCA's John Elkann as chairman of a board that would have six directors nominated by the French group and five by the Italian one.
The reaction suggests that shareholders were unprepared for an assessment that ascribes relatively more value to FCA's Jeep, Maseratis and Alfa Romeo brands than to the French group's dowdier Peugeot and Citroen marques (even after a 5.5 billion euro special dividend paid out to FCA shareholders).
The group estimates it could squeeze out 3.7 billion euros a year in annual synergies, thanks to ""more efficient allocation of resources for large-scale investments in vehicle platforms, powertrain and technology and from the enhanced purchasing capability inherent in the combined group’s new scale."" Four-fifths of those extra efficiencies would be realized within four years, it said.
The most intriguing line of the release then followed: ""These synergy estimates are not based on any plant closures.""
The two companies are making no promises as regards the one measure that would really enhance profitability, expecting fierce pushback from both the French and Italian governments if they try to close any plants. That's despite the fact that the global car market - and the European one in particular - has been dogged by overcapacity all through a boom that ended years ago. EU car sales peaked in 2000.
There's also some intriguing knock-on effects. Fiat Chrysler will hand over to shareholders its shares in its robot-making unit Comau, while Peugeot will distribute to its shareholders its 46% stake in auto-part maker   Faurecia   (PA:EPED). Faurecia shareholders didn't take kindly to the idea of a big strategic stake suddenly being dumped in the open market in dribs and drabs, and pushed the stock down 4.0%.
Elsewhere on Thursday, stocks were broadly lower after the Federal Reserve signaled there would probably be no more interest rate cuts this year, after cutting the target range for Fed funds by 25 basis points, as expected. 
The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 fell 0.4%, while the German DAX was down 0.5% while the U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.7%, hit by heavyweights Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa). Lloyds swung to a third-quarter loss after a massive final charge for PPI mis-selling, while Shell warned that the weak economy could hit the timeline for its planned debt reduction and the pace of share buybacks.

747,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 04:11AM ET</span>",China's auto market could shrink about 8% this year: industry official,"By Yilei Sun and Keith Zhai
BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Auto sales in China may skid to 26 million this year, a drop of around 8%, a senior industry executive warned, as the world's largest auto market braces for a second year of contraction amid slowing economic growth and tighter vehicle emissions standards.
The latest prediction, by Fu Bingfeng, executive vice chairman of the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), is lower than the group's previous forecast for a 5% drop, issued in July. 
Amid gathering gloom over the global auto industry's biggest growth story of the last 20 years, carmakers like General Motors (N:GM), Ford (N:F) and  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) have all reported double-digit percentage sales declines. Some smaller firms have even started to shut down capacity and seek consolidation. 
""For this year, we now expect to see if we can hold on to (sales of) 26 million vehicles,"" Fu told Reuters, speaking on the sidelines of a Singapore forum led by China Center for International Economic Exchange late on Wednesday. 
Fu said sales declines should be viewed as part of the industry's transformation towards higher production standards, lower-emission cars and new energy vehicles (NEVs), adding the association was still ultimately bullish about the future prospects of the market.
Around 28 million cars were sold in China in 2018, down 3% from a year earlier, the first sales drop since 1990s. Monthly sales dropped in September to mark the 15th consecutive month of decline.
A spokesman for CAAM in Beijing confirmed on Thursday the industry group expects an 8% decline in sales from the previous year, without disclosing further details.
Fu said China annual auto sales were ultimately still on track to hit 30 million by 2023 with further headroom, he said. 
""40 million units a year cannot be the rooftop of China's car market,"" Fu said. 
Still, amid the current sales downturn, Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp (T:7269) became the first big foreign car manufacturer to shut up shop in the country.
The sales slump has even extended to the NEV sector, due to subsidy cuts. NEV sales skidded 34% in September year-on-year following a 16% decline in August.
""The development of new energy vehicles is still at early stage, so talking about its growth now is not very meaningful,"" Fu said.

748,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 04:06AM ET</span>","Shell Beats Profit Estimates, Warns of Slower Share Buyback","(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc (NYSE:RDSa) continued the industry trend of comfortably beating profit estimates, while also warning investors that returns might be less generous than they had hoped.
Shell’s adjusted net income for the third quarter was well above even the highest analyst estimate as its integrated gas and oil trading churned out cash. However, the energy giant warned that the pace of share buybacks could slow due to “prevailing weak macroeconomic conditions.”
It’s a performance that echoes Shell’s closest rival  BP  (LON:BP) Plc, which also posted better-than-expected earnings but disappointed shareholders hoping for a dividend increase. The third quarter was a difficult period for energy producers, with crude prices sinking over worries about the economic impact of the U.S.-China trade war while natural gas markets are enduring a long stretch of oversupply.
“Our earnings reflect the resilience of our market-facing businesses and their ability to capitalize on market conditions, including very strong trading and optimization results this quarter,” Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said in a statement. “Our intention to buy back $25 billion in shares and reduce net debt remains unchanged,” but there’s some uncertainty over whether it will be completed within the 2020 timeframe, he said.
Shell said adjusted net income was $4.77 billion in the quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of $3.92 billion. That compares to profit of $5.62 billion in the same period last year, and improves on a surprisingly weak second quarter.
Cash flow from operations including working capital, perhaps the single most important measure for Shell as it aims to distribute $125 billion to shareholders between 2021 and 2025, was $12.25 billion, little changed from a year earlier and beating analyst estimates gathered by Shell of $11.5 billion.
Shell had warned in its first ever pre-earnings “quarterly update” that upstream production would probably dip slightly from a year earlier, though the impact of the decline may be offset by a strong performance in its market-leading liquefied natural gas trading business.
The company decided to disclose more information before publishing its results following complaints its earnings were too volatile to predict. In the first quarter of 2019, it beat analyst estimates by 14%, then missed them by 28% the following quarter.
Shell’s peers also made one-time disclosures this quarter to flag bearish news. BP Plc beat estimates on Tuesday but only after analysts downgraded them by about 35% after the company flagged a $2.61 billion impairment charge.  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)., which reports earnings on Friday, said it will take a $400 million to $700 million hit from lower oil prices."
749,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 04:05AM ET</span>",BNP Paribas Fixed-Income Trading Outperforms European Rivals,"(Bloomberg) --   BNP Paribas   SA (PA:BNPP) posted a third straight gain at its fixed-income trading business, outshining its Wall Street and European peers while keeping costs under control.
Fixed income, currency and commodity trading revenue surged 35% to 915 million euros ($1 billion) in the three months through September, according to a statement on Thursday. That surpassed the performance of competitors including  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), and beat the 9% gain in the second quarter and a 29% rally in the previous three months.
Chief Executive Officer Jean-Laurent Bonnafe is slashing costs after tough market conditions complicated his plans to take on the trading might of U.S. banks. BNP has shut a proprietary trading unit and exited U.S. commodity derivatives to curb risk, while seeking to take advantage of Deutsche Bank’s retreat through the acquisition of the German lender’s hedge fund business.
“What is important is that we continue to serve clients and, therefore, grabbing market share,” Chief Financial Officer Lars Machenil said in a Bloomberg Television interview when asked if growth in FICC will continue.
FICC benefited from “a sharp rise in credit and primary issues, a rebound in forex and emerging markets, and a good performance of rates,” BNP said. That helped BNP’s global markets unit -- its key trading division -- post a 15% increase in revenue. Equity and prime services income fell though by the same amount, with the bank blaming a “lackluster market on flow activities,” countered somewhat by structured products.
Revenue grew 5.3% in the quarter, outpacing a 2% increase in costs. The bank’s common equity Tier 1 ratio, a measure of financial strength, rose 10 basis points to 12%.
“Strongest Beat”
“By division, the strongest beat came from global markets, mostly thanks to strong FICC,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts wrote in a note to clients. “Capital is in line with consensus at 12%, which corresponds to BNP 2020 capital target.”
Like many other European lenders, the bank cautioned that the European Central Bank’s move to push interest rates deeper into negative territory will have an impact. “The new monetary policy measures occurred at the end of the quarter, and they will produce their full effect only in 2020,” BNP said.
Bonnafe cut 2020 earnings targets in February and announced an additional 600 million euros in cost cuts to weather a trading slump. The bank is targeting about 3.3 billion euros of expense reductions by 2020. That followed a particularly difficult end to the year, when it lost about $80 million on derivatives trades linked to the U.S. stock market. Last year, BNP was also caught on the wrong side of a selloff in developing-market assets and blindsided by the Turkish currency crisis.
The French bank is about halfway through its 2020 cost plan, but has so far stayed clear of suggesting any big job-cutting plans like those at Parisian rival  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA or the thousands of planned reductions at Deutsche Bank. Instead, BNP’s moves have included outsourcing equity research in Asia to Morningstar Inc.
So far, about 1.7 billion euros in costs have been saved since the program began in 2017, BNP said. One-time charges related to the cost-cutting plan fell to 178 million euros from 248 million euros in the same quarter of 2018.
Machenil also indicated BNP isn’t interested in bidding for  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) Plc’s French retail lender or Poland’s MBank, which is up for sale by  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG).
“We’re investing in digital channels,” the CFO said. “Buying a branch network is not something we are looking at.” The lender has shut 356 branches in France, Belgium and Italy since the end of 2016.
BNP Paribas is targeting its spending to win clients in countries such as the U.S., the U.K. and especially Deutsche Bank’s backyard, Germany, where the mass of small and medium-sized companies have traditionally been the backbone of its export-oriented powerhouse economy.

750,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 04:03AM ET</span>",Nintendo Beats Profit Estimates as Switch Lite Boosts Game Sales,"(Bloomberg) -- Nintendo Co. (T:7974) reported fiscal second-quarter profit that beat analyst estimates helped by the boost to software sales from the introduction of the Switch Lite model.
Operating income rose to 66.8 billion yen ($615 million) in the three months ended September, the Kyoto-based company said in a statement on Thursday. That’s more than the 50.5 billion yen average of analyst projections compiled by Bloomberg. Sales were 271.9 billion yen, compared with estimates of 250.8 billion yen. Nintendo left its full-year profit and revenue outlooks unchanged.
Nintendo has stuck with earnings projections that are far below analyst estimates despite a strong lineup of games for later this year and expectations for stronger hardware growth. The launch slate includes a new installment in the Zelda saga, Luigi’s Mansion and two Pokemon games. Nintendo can already claim its first mega-hit smartphone game with Mario Kart Tour, which was downloaded about 124 million times in the first month after launch. Its full profit potential is probably still ahead, when the app allows users to race against each other online.
“The biggest question for Nintendo is why they still haven’t enabled a multiplayer mode in Mario Kart Tour,” Jefferies Group senior analyst Atul Goyal said ahead of the earnings release. “This game already has a massive following and people have been clamoring for multiplayer. But more than a month since launch it still says ‘coming soon.’ It makes you wonder whether this says something about the speed of decision-making at Nintendo.”
The company kept its conservative forecast for operating profit of 260 billion yen on 1.25 trillion yen in revenue for the year ending March 2020. That’s short of analysts’ expectations of 308.1 billion yen and 1.29 trillion yen respectively. The company expects to sell 18 million Switch units and 125 million new software titles this fiscal year."

The lender, which depends on its loan book for about 80% of its income, on Thursday reported a slight increase in net interest income and 3.8% higher fees and commission, with both figures beating the bank’s own survey of analysts. Revenue declined as the investment bank made less money from trading.
“Even with the ongoing negative interest rate environment, our net interest income has remained resilient,” Hamers said in the statement.
The largest Dutch bank has aggressively added clients, but the traditional banking business is being squeezed as the European Central Bank’s negative interest rate policy erodes income from lending. Compliance costs, meanwhile, have increased following a record fine last year. On Wednesday,  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) suffered its worst share price drop in three years after lower interest rates weighed on revenue in all but one of its main businesses.
ING added 165,000 primary retail customers in the quarter, helping push income from lending and fees higher. But a lower valuation result and a decline in trading revenue weighed on revenue. Hamers said in an interview last month that more adjustments to the investment bank may be needed.
“If the environment prolongs, and the markets stay as they are, I think further need for restructurings” at the unit could materialize, he told Bloomberg Television.
ING has been struggling for some time to make its markets division -- a relatively small business with just a few hundred employees -- more profitable. It centralized trading in London a few years ago, slashing jobs in Brussels and Amsterdam in the process.
Underlying profit at the group fell 11% as operating expenses rose. ING has increased its spending on anti money laundering checks in previous quarters after it paid a record fine to settle a criminal investigation in the Netherlands a year ago. In Italy, the central bank in March ordered ING to stop taking on new clients in the country after finding shortcomings in its screening of clients.
ING’s results on net interest income and fees are encouraging, according to Mediobanca analyst Robin van den Broek. “Costs remain somewhat of a headwind but as of next year the effect of the restructuring program should start to kick in,” he wrote in a note.
Adding to higher compliance costs are worries that years of low interest rates may increase risks in banks’ loan books. Dutch banks must increase their capital buffers to safeguard against mortgage writedowns, the country’s central bank said in a recent report that highlighted prolonged low rates are the main risk to financial stability."

Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) swung to a net loss of 238 million pounds ($305 million) after taking a 1.8 billion charge for PPI mis-selling, at the top of the likely range it announced earlier. As with its major rivals, the charge ought to draw a line under a decade-long problem. 

Revenue fell 2% on the year against a backdrop of lower interest rates but costs fell 5%, and it now expects its cost-income ratio to fall from last year’s level.
The bank warned that continued economic uncertainty could further hurt the outlook, but pointed to the fact that even in the current weak conditions, it had generated 75 basis points of capital in the quarter before the PPI hit.
Separately, it announced that chief operating officer Juan Colombas will retire in July 2020.


Royal Dutch Shell (AS:RDSa) said earnings on a current cost of supplies basis, its preferred measure of profit, rose 9% on the year in the third quarter to $6.08 billion, thanks to ""very strong trading and optimization results."" 
Underlying CCS earnings fell 15% on the year to $4.77 billion.

It kept its quarterly dividend unchanged at 47 cents and upheld its intention to buy back $25 billion in shares, but CEO Ben van Beurden admitted that the timeframe for meeting its gearing target may slip due to the weak global economy. 
""The prevailing weak macroeconomic conditions and challenging outlook inevitably create uncertainty about the pace of reducing gearing to 25% and completing the share buyback programme within the 2020 timeframe,"" van Beurden said. Shell (LON:RDSa) follows   BP   (LON:BP) in warning that the economic slowdown could stop its cutting debt as planned.

BT Group (LON:BT) said revenue fell 1% in the first half of its fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, “mainly reflecting the impact of regulation, declines in legacy products, and strategically reducing low margin business.” Regulation contributed to a 5.5% drop in average revenue per customer on postpaid plans, as did the general trend to customers seeking SIM-only deals.
Profit before tax was flat at 1.33 billion pounds, while underlying EBITDA fell 3% to 3.92 billion.
The rollout of 5G services continues as scheduled and has now reached over 20 cities and large towns.
The interim dividend was unchanged at 4.62 pence a share and the company maintained its previous outlook.

Medical device group Smith & Nephew (LON:SN) raised its revenue guidance for the year after posting 4% organic revenue growth in the third quarter.
However, it indicated full-year profit margins would be at, or even below, the low end of the announced range. It cut margin guidance to “around 22.8%” from a range of 22.8% to 23.2%.
Overall revenue grew 6.5% as 390 basis points benefit of acquisitions outweighed 140 basis points of currency headwind. Recently acquired Osiris posted another quarter of growth over 10%, while emerging market revenues grew “in the mid-teens” thanks to strong sales in China.

Packaging group DS Smith (LON:SMDS) upheld its guidance for the full year in a pre-closing statement for the first half of its 2020 fiscal year that didn't include hard figures.

China’s largest company is weighing its options for the city’s biggest first-time sale of stock since 2010, but the window for pulling off its mega deal in 2019 is closing fast. It must proceed with a required listing hearing -- either after its Nov. 1 earnings or Nov. 11 Singles’ Day shopping gala -- or risk postponing a deal altogether till 2020, people familiar with the matter say. Alibaba is reluctant to drag things out as uncertainty mounts around U.S.-Chinese tensions and the global macroeconomic outlook, they added, asking not to be identified talking about a sensitive matter.
Alibaba’s listing was to be the crowning achievement of a Hong Kong stock exchange that lost many of China’s brightest technology stars to U.S. rivals. Instead, pro-democracy and anti-China protests erupted over the summer, rattling the financial hub and hammering mainland-related stocks. Billionaire Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma’s dream of listing closer to home -- a move that would have curried favor with Beijing and hedged against trade war risks -- risks back-firing without an offering.
The company is now considering the week after its quarterly earnings release or the country’s largest online retail bonanza as the most likely openings, the people said. Alibaba’s looking to raising closer to $10 billion, about half of an original target, the people said. The company can capitalize on the strong recent reception for Hong Kong IPOs, with several companies including Anheuser-Busch InBev NV’s Asian unit raising $1 billion or more. Alibaba declined to comment in an email.
Read more: Pitting Tencent Against Alibaba Could’ve Made 29% This Year
Any decision however will hinge on investors’ reaction to its results, which are expected to underscore the e-commerce juggernaut’s slowest pace of revenue growth in about three years.
Alibaba has already handed in all its documents and made a confidential filing. Informal feedback from investors show there’s keen interest, but Alibaba is in no rush to kick off the offering, as political considerations take the upper hand now, the people said. One wrinkle: the local exchange requires companies to list within six months of filing, or reapply. The online emporium is said to have picked China International Capital Corp. and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG as lead banks.
A successful Hong Kong share sale could help finance a costly war of subsidies with Meituan Dianping in food delivery and travel, and divert investor cash from rivals like Meituan and WeChat-operator Tencent. Courting investors closer to home also serves as a buffer of sorts should U.S.-Chinese tensions worsen. Already, U.S. lawmakers such as Senator Marco Rubio are agitating for measures to curb investment flows to Chinese companies, including the extreme option of tossing U.S.-listed firms off American bourses.

But should the company decide to plough ahead, it will likely have to contend with difficult questions from would-be investors.
Alibaba -- which had roughly $57 billion of cash and equivalents as of June -- rode a national e-commerce boom that stemmed from an increasingly affluent middle class. But like arch-foe Tencent Holdings Ltd., it’s struggling to sustain growth as the world’s No. 2 economy slows, and China clashes with the U.S. over everything from trade and technology to investment.
At home, signs of strain are growing. China’s gross domestic product growth is expected to slump below 6%, which would be the economy’s slowest pace of expansion in three decades. Alibaba is projected to post revenue growth of 37% in the September quarter."

MONTREAL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Canada's Bombardier (TO:BBDb) is in advanced talks to sell three facilities, including its Belfast wing-making plant, to Spirit AeroSystems (N:SPR) for more than $1 billion in cash and assumed liabilities, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
The two companies are nearing a deal, which could be announced as early as Thursday, the sources added, but they cautioned that talks could still fall apart. Both companies are scheduled to report third quarter earnings on Thursday.
Bombardier's plan to sell two aerostructure facilities - the Belfast plant and another in Morocco - along with a smaller repair plant in Dallas comes as the Canadian company sheds its commercial aviation business to focus on its higher-margin business jets and rail divisions.
Analysts have previously said a deal would be strategic for Spirit, an aerospace components maker, as it diversifies its customer base away from  Boeing Co  (N:BA). Spirit is Boeing's largest supplier, but the company has plans to grow its business with Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR).
Reuters previously reported that Wichita-based Spirit had emerged as the front-runner to acquire the facilities.
Bombardier declined to comment. Spirit did not immediately respond to a request for comment out of business hours. The sources declined to be identified as the discussions are confidential.
The Belfast plant, which produces wings for Airbus's A220 jet, is considered politically sensitive as it is the largest high-tech manufacturer in Northern Ireland with a workforce of around 3,500. The A220 program is growing with Airbus recording a backlog of 435 of the 110 to 130 seat jets as of Sept. 30.
The deal would include the assumption of liabilities, including pension obligations."

The accord, which includes $6 billion of product investment in U.S. facilities and creating and retaining more than 8,500 jobs, will be subject to review by the UAW’s Ford council, and then a ratification vote, according to a statement.
The union turned its attention to bargaining with Ford on Oct. 25 after ending a 40-day strike against GM that the company estimates will lower earnings this year by about $2.9 billion.
“This was an expensive deal at GM and it’s going to be ever more expensive at Ford, depending on what offsets Ford was able to get to tailor it to their needs,” said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of the labor and economics group at the Center for Automotive Research.
Ford can ill afford a strike. After paring back its profit forecast for the year last week, S&P Global Ratings became the second credit grader to cut its rating on the carmaker in as many months. S&P called Ford’s performance subpar and outlined risks to Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett’s $11 billion turnaround plan, including sluggish industry sales and costly emissions standards.
The UAW also had less reason to take a hard-line approach to negotiating with Ford. Whereas GM was seeking to close several U.S. plants, Ford entered talks having made commitments to invest in electric and self-driving car facilities in Michigan. The company also employs more UAW members than GM or Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV."

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (N:F) and the United Auto Workers union on Wednesday announced a tentative agreement for a new labor deal, allowing the No. 2 U.S. automaker to avoid a strike like the one that cost its larger rival General Motors (N:GM) about $3 billion.
The union turned to Ford to negotiate a new four-year agreement after ratifying a contract last week with GM following a 40-day U.S. strike that shut down almost all of GM's North American operations.
Detailed terms of the deal were not released, but they are expected to echo those agreed to with GM, as the union typically uses the first deal as a pattern for those that follow.
""The pattern bargaining strategy has been a very effective approach for UAW and its members to secure economic gains around salary, benefits and secured over $6 billion in major product investments in American facilities, creating and retaining over 8,500 jobs for our communities,"" UAW Vice President Rory Gamble, head of the union's Ford department, said in a statement.
Ford confirmed the deal in a statement, but declined further comment.
UAW leaders from the various U.S. plants will meet on Friday to approve the deal, which will then be sent to the 55,000 members at Ford for final approval, a union spokesman said.
Ratification is not a sure thing, as union members at  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) in 2015 rejected the first version of a contract. 
Ford and the UAW began talks on Monday covering larger issues such as pay raises, the use of temporary workers and healthcare insurance coverage, but the union previously said the sides had made ""significant progress"" addressing smaller issues.
Ford historically has had an easier relationship with the union than its Detroit rivals. Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford has described the UAW as ""family"" in the past and in September 2018 hailed the Dearborn, Michigan, company's relationship with its hourly workers.
""The UAW doesn't just make our workers better, it makes Ford better and stronger,"" Bill Ford told UAW workers last year. 
Under the deal with GM, that automaker agreed to invest $9 billion in the United States, including $7.7 billion directly in its plants, with the rest going to joint ventures. It also said it would create or retain 9,000 UAW jobs. The GM contract also will provide $11,000 signing bonuses to members, and pay raises.
Under its deal, GM also will close three plants, but it left the UAW members' healthcare insurance coverage unchanged.

Once the Ford deal is ratified, the UAW will turn to Fiat Chrysler to complete its quadrennial talks with the Detroit automakers.

High-level officials of 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and associates including Low had siphoned over $4.5 billion belonging to the state-owned wealth fund from 2009 to 2015, the Justice Department said. 
Officials in Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates, Wall Street bank  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) have all been caught up in probes into multi-year conspiracy. 
Low faced charges in both United States and Malaysia over his central role in the scandal at 1MDB, which was founded by former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. 
Low agreed to give up high-end real estate in Beverly Hills, New York and London and other business investments totaling $700 million, the Justice Department said in a statement and court document filed on Wednesday. The settlement also included assets in the United Kingdom and Switzerland. 
That's on top of a $120-million yacht and $140 million in other assets previously forfeited. If approved, the settlement will mark the largest civil forfeiture ever concluded by the Justice Department, it said. 
“The message in this case is simple: the United States is not a safe haven for pilfered funds,"" said U.S. Attorney Nicola T. Hanna of the Central District of California. 
The deal does not include an admission of guilt or wrongdoing and is not tied to the criminal action against Low. 
""I am very pleased to confirm that a landmark comprehensive, global settlement has been reached with the United States government,"" Low said in an emailed statement. 
Goldman said earlier this month it was cooperating with the Justice Department and other government and regulatory investigations. 
""The firm is also engaged in discussions with certain government and regulatory authorities with respect to potential resolution of their investigations,"" the bank said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Oct. 15. 
Last year, Malaysia filed criminal charges against Goldman over its role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB. Prosecutors in August filed criminal charges against 17 current and former directors at Goldman units. 

The proposed settlement was filed in a California court on Wednesday and needs to be approved by a judge.

(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) reported an uptick in users in lucrative markets and its third straight rise in quarterly sales growth on Wednesday, but the company's controversial political ads stole the limelight when CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke to analysts.
Shares rose about 4.5% after hours to $196.64. That put the shares on track to eclipse their record closing high of $194.32 in June 2018, just before a dramatic drop that summer amid escalating costs. 
Over the last three years, Facebook, the world's largest social media company, has faced rising hostility from both users and lawmakers over its handling of user data and its inability to ensure the integrity of its popular news feeds. 
Zuckerberg opened his earnings conference call on Wednesday by defending the company's policy to run ads from politicians containing false or misleading claims, saying that Facebook did not want to stifle political speech, even as rival  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) said earlier in the day that it was banning political ads around the globe.
Facebook on Monday confirmed to Reuters that some employees had criticized its policy in an internal letter. Zuckerberg estimated ads from politicians would account for under 0.5% of Facebook's revenue next year.
""I expect that this is going to be a very tough year,"" he said, adding that controversies over political content could lead to investigations.
Zuckerberg last week was barraged with aggressive questions by lawmakers over Facebook's steps to combat misinformation ahead of next year's presidential election when he appeared at a Congressional hearing. 
Facebook's competitive practices currently are under investigation separately by the U.S. Congress, Department of Justice, FTC and 47 state attorneys general.
Zuckerberg said that much of the scrutiny would be around the company's acquisition of Instagram in 2012, but he said that though Facebook took out a competitor, its eventual success was not guaranteed at the time.
Facebook executives, whom analysts say typically offer conservative guidance, continued to warn that the company's revenue could be hurt by external challenges including new features on Facebook and internet browsers enabling people to block the type of online tracking that has been essential to Facebook's algorithms for targeting ads. 
But financial analysts said Facebook remains too popular among users for advertisers to ignore.
""Yes, Facebook has a lot of challenges it must deal with, but increasing its revenue and user count isn’t one of them,"" Debra Aho, eMarketer principal analyst, said in an email.

Facebook's total expenses in the third quarter were $10.5 billion, up 32% compared with a year ago. The third-quarter operating margin was 41%, compared with 42% a year ago. 
Facebook forecast 2019 total expenses at approximately $46 billion to $48 billion, or an increase of 55% at the high end of the range compared with 2018. It estimated 2020 total expenses in the range of $54 billion to $59 billion, up 23% over this year's estimate at the high end.
Concerns over privacy have fueled an acceleration in costs for privacy staff and other roles. Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet Inc’s (O:GOOGL) Google also have been under pressure to police their platforms after facing criticism for failing to counter alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Third-quarter revenue rose 29% compared with a year ago to $17.65 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $17.37 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Facebook, the world's No. 2 seller of online ads, said revenue would grow more slowly in the fourth quarter, at closer to about 20% to 25%, partly due to users choosing to limit the company's ability to target ads to them using personal details.
Facebook reported $6.09 billion in profit, or $2.12 per share. Analysts expected $5.47 billion in profit, or $1.91 per share. 
For the quarter, the company reported 2.8 billion monthly users and 2.2 billion daily users across Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, both slightly higher than the prior quarter.
Facebook itself had 1.62 billion daily users, versus estimates of 1.61 billion. After experiencing stagnant user growth in Europe and the United States in previous quarters, Facebook added daily users compared to the previous quarter in all four of its regions for the first time this year.
Facebook shares have gained about 43.6% this year through Wednesday's close, thanks to above-expectations revenue in the first half of the year. The company reached a $5 billion settlement in a U.S. Federal Trade Commission probe, which started after its Cambridge Analytica data misuse scandal and threatened to cost the company several more billions.
Facebook's existing businesses continue to grow at a fast pace. But whether it can maintain the momentum has been unclear with newer ventures including privacy-focused messaging services, its expansion into online dating or its burgeoning features for group discussions and eBay-like shopping center.
Last week, Facebook also started to test Facebook News, a new section of its mobile app dedicated to ""high-quality news,"" which will see some publishers paid for access to their content.
But the company came under fire from some political activists over its decision to include right-wing news website Breitbart News as one of its publishers. Facebook said Breitbart will be an unpaid publisher.

Facebook on Wednesday also said one of its board directors, Susan Desmond-Hellmann, chief executive of The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, would be stepping down and that a replacement would be named in the coming months. Zuckerberg said she is leaving for health and other commitments.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Peruvian Airlines and Star Perú are set to merge after both were purchased by investment fund Global Investment Platform, the fund said on Wednesday.
The merger would give Global Investment Platform just under one-fifth of the local market, which is currently dominated by LATAM airlines, the region´s largest carrier, the fund said in a statement.
The fund announced late Wednesday it had purchased Star Peru. It had acquired Peruvian Airlines several weeks ago, though Peruvian authorities required that the airline suspend flights amid a dispute over unpaid taxes.

Production stood at 122,256 vehicles, with volumes in the first nine months of the year down 15.6% to just under 1 million cars according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).
The global automotive industry has undergone a torrid year, hit by declining sales in China, trade-war worries between the world's two biggest economies, a slump in diesel sales in Europe and the need to invest heavily in electrification.
""Another bitterly disappointing month reflects domestic and international market contraction,"" said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.
""Most worrying of all though is the continued threat of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, something which has caused international investment to stall and cost UK operations hundreds of millions of pounds.""
Brexit has been delayed for a third time, now until the end of January, and Britons will head to the polls in December for a snap election designed to break the impasse."

(Reuters) - Ride-hailing company  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) on Wednesday said higher-than-expected third-quarter revenues and an improved outlook showed it was well on its way to profitability by the end of 2021.
As pressure to become profitable mounts in the ride-hailing industry, Lyft executives said a growing number of customers were now paying full price for their rides, with discounts and promotional incentives decreasing.
Lyft, which operates in 300 cities in the United States and Canada, said its active rider customer base grew to 22.3 million, up 28% from a year ago. Its revenue surged about 63% to $955.6 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, beating analyst expectations.
The loss-making company and its larger rival  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) have historically relied on heavy subsidies to attract riders. But both companies are also spending to expand into other areas.
Lyft, in which Japanese internet firm  Rakuten Inc  (T:4755) is a significant shareholder, on average earned $42.82 in third-quarter revenue from each rider. Its sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 16%, down from 41% last year.
""We expect that these market conditions will continue as the industry focuses on achieving profitability,"" Chief Financial Officer Brian Roberts said during a Wednesday call with analyst.
Lyft Chief Executive Logan Green earlier this month said the company expected to be profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis in the fourth quarter of 2021, one year ahead of market expectations.
Analysts welcomed the guidance. James Cordwell at Atlantic Equities said the Lyft news increases confidence that profitability for Uber's ridesharing business is also ""a very imminent prospect.""
Nevertheless, third-quarter costs increased by 70% year-over-year, as Lyft reported a $463.5 million net loss, or a $1.57 per share.
Shares of Lyft were up about 1% at $44.90 in after-hours trading. Investors overall have become more picky in recent months, as Wall Street shows waning patience for money-losing former unicorn startups.
Lyft has launched new initiatives and partnered with several companies as it battles Uber for a bigger share of the ride-hailing market.

The company hopes to become a one-stop mobility shop for passengers seeking to commute via ride-hailing, public transport, bike and electric scooter sharing, recently announcing changes to its app that display all transportation methods. 
CEO Green during Wednesday's call repeatedly said his company remained focused on transportation alone.
""We’re not doing food, we’re not doing trucking, we’re 100% focused on mobility,"" Green said in an apparent dig at o rival Uber, which is expanding in food delivery and autonomous trucking development.
Lyft instead hopes to generate more revenue through its electric scooter and bike shares, available in 20 and eight U.S. cities, respectively. CFO Roberts on Wednesday said winter weather would lead to a $10 million fourth-quarter revenue reduction in those segments, however.
The company also plans to expand its partnership with corporations whose employees use Lyft as their primary transportation platform and with medical services that transport patients for non-emergency appointments.
Lyft said it expects revenue in the range of $975 million to $985 million for the fourth quarter, ahead of average analyst expectations for $942.6 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
But it had also warned that as a company it might continue posting losses as it invests heavily in self-driving cars, renting scooters and other ventures.

Analysts estimate insurance expenses account for roughly half of Lyft's costs and company executives on Wednesday were quick to point out that those items were decreasing.
Lyft has shifted some $87 million in insurance claims to Travelers Companies Inc (N:TRV), which administers the liabilities on behalf of the ride-hailing company. Lyft is exploring additional sales of older insurance claims to third-parties, it said on Wednesday.

Roberts said the cost of ride-hailing insurance as a percentage of revenue was lower in the third quarter than in the previous three months, without providing details. But he said partnerships with established insurance giants Progressive Corp (N:PGR) and State Farm will help the company further reduce cost, risk exposure and volatility.

Cicely Leemhuis, the deputy head of the legal department at VTB Capital, told the U.S. federal court in Brooklyn, New York, that the loans “are considered to be significant exposure” for the investment bank. The loans, made to three state-owned companies in Mozambique, were guaranteed by the government of Mozambique and VTB has a contractual option of suing to recover its losses, she said.
The loans are being restructured and VTB Capital still expects to be repaid, she added.
Between 2013 and 2014, the three state-owned Mozambique companies awarded Abu Dhabi-based Privinvest Group contracts to build a coastal defense system, a tuna fishing fleet and a shipyard in the country. The projects were financed by nearly $2 billion worth of loans issued by  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and VTB Capital.
U.S. prosecutors have alleged that executives from the two banks and Privinvest, however, got involved in a $200 million scheme to pay bribes and kickbacks to government officials and themselves to secure the contracts and loans.
Prosecutors have argued that Credit Suisse went on to sell parts of those loans to investors, including some in the United States, who were falsely told that all the money was being used for legitimate government projects.
Three former Credit Suisse bankers and Mozambique former finance minister Manuel Chang have been charged in the case.
VTB’s Leemhuis told the court that the bank would not have issued the loans had it known that Privinvest was bribing officials. “It would have been illegal for VTB to do so,” she said.
Mozambique -- one of the world's most indebted countries -- admitted in 2016 to undisclosed lending, prompting the International Monetary Fund and foreign donors to cut off support, triggering a currency collapse and a default on its sovereign debt.
One of the world's poorest countries, Mozambique's economy was worth $14.5 billion in 2018, according to World Bank data, and has seen its debt-to-gross-domestic-product ratio hit 113%, data from the IMF shows.
Leemhuis told the court VTB had hoped in part that Mozambique's natural gas reserves could be sold to generate income and repay its debts."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lack of transparency in the Commerce Department's handling of steel and aluminum tariffs raised the appearance that certain companies may have had ""improper influence"" in the process, its internal watchdog said in a document made public on Wednesday.
The Commerce Department's inspector general (IG) said it uncovered multiple risks during an audit of processes used by two agencies within the department - the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) and the International Trade Administration (ITA).
The audit related to the way companies were able to request that they be exempted from having to pay 25% tariffs on imported steel and 10% tariffs on imported aluminum, that were imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump in March 2018, under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act. 
It found evidence that the department had an unofficial appeals process; changed its internal review criteria after communicating with a company that objected to an earlier decision; and failed to fully document more than 100 meetings and phone calls with interested parties.
""We believe that these issues give the perception that the Section 232 exclusion request review process is neither transparent nor objective,"" the IG's office said in a management alert dated Oct. 28 and made public Wednesday. It said the findings contributed to ""the appearance of improper influence in decision-making for tariff exclusion requests.""
Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, who had asked the IG to review the exclusion review process, hailed the report as evidence ""that the Trump administration's tariff exclusion process was rigged from the start to benefit big, well-connected, and in many cases, foreign-owned companies.""
Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, requested the IG review in August 2018 after discovering that Rusal, a subsidiary of a sanctioned Russian company, had received an exemption. Her office said it found that the overwhelming majority of exemptions from the tariffs had gone to the U.S. subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies rather than U.S.-headquartered firms.
Representative Jackie Walorski, a Republican from Indiana and fierce critic of the department's handling of the exclusions process, said the IG's findings showed the administration had ""a thumb on the scale favoring objectors.""
""There is no excuse for allowing an opaque, inconsistent, and unfair process to continue harming American manufacturers,"" she said in a statement.
Companies can request exemptions from the Section 232 tariffs for certain products if they are not available domestically. The exclusions are made on a case-by-case basis, but other companies can object to the exclusions being granted.
The Commerce Department has received over 135,000 exclusion requests and 43,000 objections, according to a letter from the department to Walorski that was seen by Reuters. 
The IG's office said Commerce should make the process more transparent by setting up a formal appeals process, creating a process for modifying internal criteria for judging exclusion requests, and documenting discussions with interested parties.

The Commerce Department said it had already taken key steps to ""safeguard"" the system, including hiring dozens of contractors, an online portal for requests, a ""robust rebuttal process"" and guidance for communications with stakeholders.

775,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 07:15PM ET</span>","Apple tunes out trade war as new AirPods, services lift holiday outlook","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) on Wednesday forecast sales for the crucial holiday shopping quarter ahead of Wall Street expectations, with Chief Executive Tim Cook seeing strong sales of the wearables such as the noise-cancelling AirPods Pro and hoping for a U.S.-China trade deal by year-end. 
Cook wants to wean Apple off stagnating iPhone sales that make up over half its revenue and switch to generating income from services and wearables. Cook is implementing the strategy while also shepherding Apple through a trade dispute between two of its most important markets, the United States and China. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/34qdgDV)
Apple said it expects $85.5 billion to $89.5 billion in sales for its fiscal first quarter that ends in December, with a midpoint of $87.5 billion that is above analyst expectations of $86.9 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Apple shares rose about 2% to $247.50 in after-hours trading on the news.
In an interview with Reuters, Cook said he anticipated strong sales of services and wearables, as well “a very, very good start” for sales of the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max released last month. Cook said the forecast also reflects the company's belief that the United States and China will resolve their trade dispute.
""I don't know every chapter of the book, but I think that will eventually happen,"" Cook told Reuters. ""I certainly hope it happens during the quarter, but we'll see about that.""
The forecast comes as the Cupertino, California-based company said it generated $33.36 billion in iPhone sales for its fiscal fourth quarter ended in September, which compares with analyst expectations of $32.42 billion, according to Refinitiv data. 
The results mark the fourth straight quarter of year-over-year declining iPhone sales. At the same time, hardware is getting less profitable on a gross margin basis, with Apple's net product sales falling while the cost of sales rose slightly.
But Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said part of Apple's rising stock price came from interest rate cuts by U.S. officials and other indicators of slowing economic growth. ""Investors feel emboldened to pay up for what they feel is 'guaranteed growth' with big tech,"" Eddins said.
In September, Apple unveiled a lineup that included the new iPhone 11 priced at $699, $50 lower than the debut price of its predecessor, the iPhone XR. 
""The starting price of $699 is a factor in bringing more people into the market and giving people just another reason to upgrade,"" Cook told Reuters. ""In China specifically ... we picked locally relevant price points that were more similar to the price points that had great success with earlier."" 
Apple's revenue is increasingly coming from accessories such as the Apple Watch and AirPods as well as new services such as its Apple Card credit card and a streaming television service set to begin on Friday. Customers will be able to buy iPhones using the Apple Card with no interest for 24 months, Cook said on the conference call. 
Apple said its services and accessories segments generated $12.51 billion and $6.52 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, respectively, topping analyst estimates of $12.15 billion and $6 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Apple now has 450 million subscribers to its own or third-party services on its devices, and sales of wearables were up 54% versus the previous year.
""It was an incredible quarter for wearables,"" Cook said. ""It was a very broad range of services that set new all-time records, from our payment services to the search ad business to Apple Music, Apple Care, the App Store and cloud services - almost every kind of service we're in.""
Apple sales for its Greater China region dropped a relatively modest 2.4% to $11.13 billion in Apple's fiscal fourth quarter ended in September. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2N20i9w)
""The China growth being down only 2% in this environment is a win,"" said John Ham of Apple investor New England Investment and Retirement Group. ""The Chinese consumer isn’t punishing Apple as the American face of the trade war.""
Apple's Cook said that iPhone sales in China ticked up toward the end of the quarter, which includes several days of sales of the new iPhone 11 models. Cook also said the company saw double-digit services revenue growth in China and wearables revenue in China grew at a higher rate than the companywide figure.
""IPhone had a remarkable comeback from the way we performed earlier in the year,"" Cook said. 
Apple's holiday-quarter forecast comes amid a trade conflict between the United States and China, where Apple assembles most of its products and where many of its suppliers are located. Tariffs on imports that would include Apple accessories took effect in September.
Tariffs might hit more categories of goods including Apple's iPhone on Dec. 15, though U.S. and Chinese negotiators were working on a deal. 

Apple said its revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter was $64.04 billion, compared with analyst expectations of $62.99 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Earnings per share were $3.03 versus expectations of $2.84. On an absolute basis, earnings dropped from $14.13 billion to $13.69 billion, with the per-share results driven by a smaller base of outstanding shares due to repurchases.

GE and French partner  Safran  SA (PA:SAF) make engines for the jet.
“As we think about 2020, I think we’re going to try to follow Boeing’s lead here,” Culp said, responding to an analyst question.
“When we talk about the full-year cash headwinds this year due to MAX, that, obviously, assumes that we don’t see a return to service this year,” he said. He added the forecast is conservative.
GE’s chief financial officer, Jamie Miller, said GE still expects “the year to be impacted to the tune of about negative $1.4 billion.” She said it was “difficult to predict” the financial impact on GE in 2020 and beyond.

Boeing has said it expects the jet to clear approval by U.S. regulators by year-end. Global aviation regulators grounded the jet after a second fatal crash last March.

777,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 06:40PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Alibaba to resume Hong Kong listing plans as soon as November - sources,"By Julie Zhu and Joshua Franklin
HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) is eyeing a listing in Hong Kong as early as November to raise up to $15 billion, after political unrest put the move on ice earlier this year, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
Alibaba's listing would boost Hong Kong's status as a major capital markets hub. After topping global rankings in 2018 for funds raised through IPOs, the city's bourse fell behind the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq this year as a string of pro-democracy demonstrations led to clashes with authorities.
Alibaba plans to seek listing approval from Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HK:0388) shortly after the Chinese e-commerce giant's online retail frenzy Singles Day on Nov. 11, and may list its shares towards the end of November or in early December, the sources said.
The company expects to be in a position to forgo so-called pre-marketing meetings where it meets with institutional investors before a deal launch given its size and that many investors are already familiar with the company, the sources added. It is hoping to raise between $10 billion and $15 billion through the listing, Reuters has reported.
The sources cautioned that the plans are still subject to market conditions and requested anonymity as the matter is private.
Alibaba, which is already listed in New York, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company had been preparing to launch the listing in late August, but delayed it because of the political unrest. 
Such a large offering from Alibaba could also have implications on liquidity in Hong Kong's financial system and the closely watched Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR), given that investors in the Hong Kong market often borrow funds in anticipation of large share sales. 
A rise in HIBOR can in turn lift the Hong Kong dollar , which is pegged to the U.S. dollar at a tight range of 7.75 to 7.85. To defend the peg, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the city's de-facto central bank, buys local dollars if it gets too weak and sells to curb excessive strength.
Alibaba follows in the footsteps of brewer AB InBev (BR:ABI), which also chose to defy the political turmoil with a listing. In September, it raised about $5 billion by listing its Asia-Pacific unit in Hong Kong. It was the bourse's biggest and the world's second-largest IPO so far this year.
HOMECOMING
Alibaba holds the record for the world's largest initial public offering with its $25 billion float in New York in 2014.
At that time, the company had initially hoped to float in Hong Kong, but the company's dual-class share structure clashed with the city's listing rules. Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing changed its listing rules last year, primarily with the aim of attracting Chinese technology groups.
Since going public in New York, Alibaba's shares have more than doubled in value, giving it a market capitalization of around $460 billion.

In August, Alibaba reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit, aided by growth in its e-commerce and cloud computing businesses.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday said it was seeking feedback on whether disclosure rules were discouraging firms from issuing SEC-registered residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) as the Trump administration seeks to overhaul the U.S. housing finance market.
The move, which follows five years of limited activity in the SEC-registered RMBS market, could result in the SEC loosening disclosure requirements introduced in the wake of the 2007-2009 subprime mortgage crisis.
SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said that he had asked agency officials to review SEC disclosure requirements for RMBS introduced in 2014 in a bid to revitalize offerings for these products and help boost capital formation in the housing market.
With the future privatization of Frannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the RMBS market will likely shrink and decrease funding available for home loans without changes.
""Potential issuers of SEC-registered RMBS have expressed concerns regarding the scope and interpretation of disclosure requirements,"" Clayton said in a statement. ""In light of the absence of SEC-registered RMBS offerings, I have asked SEC staff to review our RMBS asset-level disclosure requirements with an eye toward facilitating SEC-registered offerings.""
The review was recommended by the U.S. Treasury Department in its blueprint published last month for removing mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from government control. The pair, which guarantee over half the nation's mortgages, were put into conservatorship in 2008 as losses mounted on their subprime mortgage portfolios
RMBS are a type of asset-backed security comprised of bundled loans, such as mortgages, student loans or auto loans. The loans are typically packaged in risk tranches, with holders of low-risk loans like 30-year-fixed mortgages paid first, and investors in high-risk assets such as subprime mortgages paid afterward. Many crisis-era RMBS investors did not fully appreciate their level of risk exposure to the subprime tranche.
Following the crisis, the agency introduced rules requiring SEC-registered RMBS issuers to provide greater information, including 270 different data points, about the quality of underlying loans. These requirements can be difficult to satisfy and may have stymied private-label securitization, the Treasury said last month.
By contrast, Fannie and Freddie RMBS offerings require only 100 data points. The pair have issued nearly $4.5 trillion of RMBS since 2014.
The SEC said it was seeking comment on, among other issues, whether the SEC should implement a ""provide-or-explain regime,"" which would allow an issuer to omit any asset-level data point, as long as the issuer identifies the omitted field and explains why it cannot provide the information."

MILAN/PARIS (Reuters) - The boards of French automaker  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) on Wednesday agreed to pursue a $50 billion merger, sources familiar with the matter said, a deal that could transform the global auto industry.
The two companies have yet to announce a formal agreement, and a deal could collapse as executives dig into the details of a merger. But as of late Wednesday, the companies were progressing quickly toward an announcement as early as Thursday morning, the people said. 
Among the potential selling points to investors: Projected annual cost savings of 4 billion euros, people familiar with the discussions said.
The directors of Exor NV (MI:EXOR), the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family which effectively controls Fiat Chrysler, also approved moving forward with talks, the people with knowledge of the situation said.
Spokesmen for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and PSA declined to comment on a timeline. 
A combination of Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler would create the world's fourth largest auto manufacturing group from two mid-sized players threatened by technological and regulatory challenges.
Peugeot Chief Executive Carlos Tavares would run the company, while Fiat Chrysler chairman John Elkann would become chairman of the new company's board, people familiar with the discussions said.
Under the proposed deal, they said the companies would combine through a 50-50 share swap, creating a new company formally based in the Netherlands.
Fiat Chrysler, with a $22.4 billion market capitalization, would pay shareholders a 5.5 billion euro special dividend, the sources said. Fiat Chrysler could distribute to shareholders its stake in robot maker Comau valued at about 250 million euros, the sources said. 
Peugeot, with a market value of 23.3 billion euros, would spin off its stake in auto parts maker Faurecia valued at around 3 billion euros. 
Final terms of the agreement could change and have not been formally disclosed, according to the sources, who asked not to be named because the deal talks are private.
The combined company's board of directors would have 11 members - six from Peugeot's side, including Tavares, and five from Fiat Chrysler's, including Elkann, the sources told Reuters.
Tavares was the driver of the approach to FCA, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The Peugeot chief executive has moved aggressively to bulk up the French automaker. He acquired General Motors Co's (N:GM) European units, Opel and Vauxhall, in 2017 and has led a rapid turnaround in their profitability. 
For Elkann, a deal with Peugeot would achieve a long-sought goal of finding a merger partner to provide sustainable scale for the company his great-grandfather and grandfather built into one of Italy's largest businesses. 
Elkann had sought in May to combine Fiat Chrysler with French rival  Renault  (PA:RENA). But that deal fell apart in June amid objections from the French government and tension between Renault and its Japanese partner, Nissan Motor Co (T:7201).
Milan-listed shares in FCA closed up 9.5% on Wednesday, after ending up more than 7.5% on Tuesday in New York. Peugeot shares rose as much as 6% during trading Wednesday to hit their highest level in more than 11 years.
The merged entity would face substantial challenges. Auto manufacturers are grappling with a global downturn in demand while trying to develop costly, cleaner car models as deadlines to meet ever more stringent anti-pollution rules loom. 
Tavares said last month the industry faces ""ten years of chaos."" 
A combination of PSA and FCA would have to overcome a series of political, financial and governance hurdles. The future of jobs in Europe, where the companies would have overlapping brands and under-utilized factories, prompted concern among labor and political leaders on Wednesday. 
JOBS FEARS
Italy's industry minister, Stefano Patuanelli, said on Wednesday that Rome - which has no stake in FCA - was following talks between the two groups, but declined to comment further on a ""market operation"".
French government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye said Paris was following the PSA-FCA talks closely with an eye on the fallout for jobs, but said an enlarged group was ultimately ""the best path to protecting employment.""
Rome is keen to avoid major job losses in Italy, where FCA employs 58,000 workers. With most of FCA's Italian plants heavily underused, Italian trade union FIOM has said it was concerned a tie-up with PSA could hit employment in the country even more than a Renault merger.
In Britain, unions flagged their worries for PSA plants there, which make vehicles under the Vauxhall and Opel brands.
In addition to the French government's 12% shareholding in PSA, held via state bank BPI, the Peugeot family and the Chinese government, through Dongfeng Group, each have a similar holding. 
Dongfeng declined to comment. People familiar with the process said the French government and Dongfeng were likely to remain shareholders, though with reduced stakes in the combined enterprise because of the merger.
EMISSIONS CRUNCH
The talks come as European carmakers struggle to meet tough carbon dioxide emissions targets.
Strategy firm PA Consulting has forecast FCA faces a fine of 700 million euros ($777 million) unless it radically changes its emissions profile to sell more electric and hybrid cars.
A combination with Peugeot would give FCA access to PSA's CMP modular platform, which has already spawned the electric Peugeot e-208 and Opel Corsa-e mini. 
Investors have speculated for years that FCA, itself the product of an Italian-U.S. merger, was hunting for a partner, encouraged by the rhetoric of the company's late Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne who railed against the auto industry's ""value-destroying addiction to capital"" to develop often-indistinguishable products. 
Lazard is advising Exor, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is advising FCA, and Mediobanca is advising PSA through its Messier Maris & Associés unit, sources said.

The plant, located in the industrial suburb of Sao Bernardo do Campo, produced buses and the Fiesta compact car, which sold poorly. It employed up to 2,800 people earlier this year, although it is unclear how many were still working there as of October.
Ford first announced it would shut down the plant in February, and said it had failed to find a buyer. But then the Sao Paulo government intervened and a local automaker, CAOA, expressed interest.
CAOA, Ford and the Sao Paulo state government announced in September that they had reached a preliminary deal, but needed 45 days to carry out due diligence. That time period has already expired, and neither side has provided an explanation. CAOA declined to comment.
CAOA got its start as a Ford dealership, but expanded into manufacturing with a contract with Hyundai and later bought 50% of Chinese automaker Chery's [CHERY.UL] operation in Brazil. While Brazil is a base for many multinational automakers, CAOA is the rare manufacturer to be locally owned."

Shares rose 3% in extended trading after the Seattle-based company also forecast 2020 comparable restaurant sales largely above estimates.
Starbucks has beefed up its ""Rewards"" program with perks including access to Happy Hours events and the ability to skip lines with a mobile payment option as it battles rising competition from niche independent coffee shops in the United States, as well as startups such as  Luckin Coffee  (N:LK) in China.
The program's active U.S. membership jumped 15% to 17.6 million in the fourth quarter, and sales at locations open for at least 13 months rose 5% in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 29, beating analysts' average forecast of 3.95%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Total net revenue rose 7% to $6.75 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $6.68 billion.
Net earnings attributable to the company rose to $802.9 million, or 67 cents per share, from $755.8 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 70 cents per share, matching Wall Street estimates.
Starbucks estimated fiscal 2020 global comparable restaurant sales would rise 3% to 4%, while analysts had expected a 3.3% increase.
About this time last year, the coffee giant had just announced an organizational restructuring with corporate job losses and leadership changes.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has faced questioning by U.S. and EU lawmakers over how the political consultancy obtained the personal data of 87 million Facebook users from a researcher.
The fine may be small for a company worth $540 billion, but it is the maximum the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) could issue and represents the first move by a regulator to punish Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica scandal.
The ICO issued the fine last year after it said data from at least 1 million British users had been among the information harvested by the researcher and used for political purposes. 
On Wednesday the ICO said that in dropping its appeal and agreeing to pay the fine, Facebook had not made an admission of liability.
""The ICO’s main concern was that UK citizen data was exposed to a serious risk of harm. Protection of personal information and personal privacy is of fundamental importance,"" said ICO Deputy Commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone.
""We are pleased to hear that Facebook has taken, and will continue to take, significant steps to comply with the fundamental principles of data protection.""

791,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 04:19PM ET</span>","Exclusive: J&J's own expert, working for FDA, found asbestos in Baby Powder","By Chad Terhune and Lisa Girion
(Reuters) - Ever since Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) disclosed this month that a government test had turned up asbestos in its Baby Powder, the company has attacked the validity of the result.
On Tuesday, for example, J&J announced that other labs it hired ultimately found no asbestos in samples from the bottle tested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or from the same production lot.
In challenging the FDA’s finding, however, the healthcare giant is casting doubt on one of its own experts.
The private Maryland lab that found asbestos in Baby Powder under a contract with the FDA is run by a paid expert witness for J&J.
Andreas Saldivar, laboratory director of AMA Analytical Services Inc, has served as a litigation expert on several occasions for J&J since 2017 in its defense against plaintiffs’ claims that asbestos in talc caused their cancers.
He testified in a May 2018 deposition that testing he did in 2010 for the FDA showed no evidence of asbestos in Johnson's Baby Powder, helping to bolster the company’s argument that its iconic brand is safe.
Saldivar’s lab began testing cosmetic talc products for the FDA again this year, and in September it found asbestos in an unmarked sample that the FDA later identified as Johnson’s Baby Powder.
“I have never heard of anything like this,” said Richard Ausness, a University of Kentucky law professor who specializes in product liability, referring to Saldivar’s dual roles. “This is bad news for J&J. The plaintiffs are clearly going to say this lab director worked for J&J for years, and he found asbestos so there must be asbestos there.”
J&J’s challenge now is to discredit the single test result as erroneous without undermining the reputation and track record of its expert witness, Ausness said.
“J&J could try to frame it as not so much this lab director is unreliable or incompetent, but false positives do happen and additional tests are called for,” Ausness said.
The company appeared to do just that on Tuesday, saying testing done by other laboratories J&J hired had found no asbestos in the same bottle of Baby Powder tested by Saldivar for the FDA, nor in the lot of Baby Powder recalled as a result of Saldivar’s finding.
In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, FDA officials said they stood by the AMA lab and its results. They also said they were not surprised by J&J’s findings because contaminants are not uniformly dispersed throughout talc and different testing methods can yield varying results.
The company “would say the product is free of asbestos based on their testing, and we would say the opposite for that sample,” said Steve Musser, deputy director for scientific operations in FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.
Plaintiffs’ attorneys said Saldivar’s finding for the FDA could be detrimental to J&J’s defense in court. The company faces lawsuits from more than 16,000 people alleging that asbestos in its powders caused cancer.
The impact was immediate in one courtroom.
Hours after J&J disclosed the FDA’s asbestos finding on Oct. 18, a plaintiff’s lawyer, Nate Finch, asked an Indianapolis judge to let him tell the jury about it in a trial involving a 71-year-old woman who alleged that Baby Powder contributed to her cancer.
J&J’s lawyers opposed the request, arguing that the information could prejudice the jury against the company, but the judge granted Finch’s request. Days later, Finch told the judge his client had come to a confidential resolution with J&J, a trial transcript shows. Finch told Reuters he could not comment on the resolution.
J&J did not respond to questions about the Indianapolis case. The company declined to comment on Saldivar’s role in the FDA testing, or on how it might affect the company’s legal strategy going forward. 
Saldivar declined to comment.
NO SAFE LEVELS
In a June deposition, Saldivar said J&J lawyers had retained him in 2017 as a company expert in “maybe 20 or 30” cases. His firm bills $200 to $350 an hour for his services, he testified.
Under the FDA contract, his lab found asbestos fibers in the Baby Powder sample on Sept. 7, according to the lab’s report. J&J said it was notified of the finding by FDA officials on Oct. 16, prompting the company to recall 33,000 bottles “out of an abundance of caution.”
In response, some major U.S. retailers have said they are removing all 22-ounce bottles of Johnson’s baby powder from their shelves. 
At the same time, the company has expressed suspicions about the finding, saying it had launched its own investigation “to determine the integrity of the tested sample, and the validity of the test results.”
On Friday, the FDA posted online Saldivar’s 16-page report to the agency on the analysis of J&J Baby Powder. In samples weighing less than a gram, the lab said it found six chrysotile asbestos fibers. Given that the samples were extremely small, the asbestos could amount to millions of fibers per gram, testing experts told Reuters.
While most people exposed to asbestos never develop cancer, for some, even small amounts are enough to trigger the disease years later. Just how small hasn’t been established. The World Health Organization and other health authorities recognize no safe level of exposure to asbestos, a known carcinogen.
“Since there are no known safe levels of asbestos, the FDA has asked manufacturers to voluntarily recall their products when fibers consistent with asbestos are found in them,” the agency said this month.
Several juries over the past two years have concluded that Baby Powder exposures caused cancer and have awarded plaintiffs more than $5 billion. Other juries have sided with J&J, and some cases have settled.
‘JUST NOT CORRECT’
The FDA has never before announced that government testing found asbestos in J&J’s Baby Powder. Since the early 1970s, J&J has pushed back hard on reports of asbestos in its talc by outside scientists, plaintiffs’ experts and, on several occasions, by its own testing labs.
In an Oct. 3 deposition in a New York lawsuit, J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky dismissed the findings of asbestos over the years, saying “they were later shown to be inaccurate, incomplete and just not correct.”
Attacking Saldivar’s finding, some legal experts told Reuters, could hurt the company’s ability to use him as a witness in lawsuits and undercut its broader message to jurors and consumers. That message boils down to: Trust our experts.
But a product liability defense lawyer who helped organize a recent talc litigation symposium said the impact on pending cases could be limited because asbestos-related cancers are known to take decades to develop. The FDA’s new finding “would be difficult to tie” to cancers allegedly caused by long-ago exposures, said Edward Ulloa, a Los Angeles-based lawyer who does not represent J&J.
The FDA findings are “essentially anecdotal,” Ulloa said, “specific to that product and that particular sample.”
In its Tuesday announcement, J&J said that one of the labs it hired initially found asbestos in three samples of Baby Powder, but the lab determined that a portable air conditioner running when the samples were prepared was contaminated with asbestos. Subsequent tests in a different room found no asbestos, the company said.
NO EXPERIENCE, NO ASBESTOS
In 2010, when the AMA lab tested 34 talc products for the FDA, including Johnson’s Baby Powder, the lab had no experience looking for asbestos fibers in talc milled for powders and cosmetics.
Saldivar testified in several depositions that the lab’s work had previously focused on determining the amount of asbestos in old building products, such as vinyl flooring.
AMA made fast work of the 2010 FDA job, lab records reviewed by Reuters show. His lab examined 102 samples, three from each product, in a single day, using a method called transmission electron microscopy (TEM). That works out to less than five minutes per sample, assuming an eight-hour shift with no breaks.
Experts who have found asbestos in milled talc powders told Reuters they require anywhere from a half hour to a day per sample using TEM, and litigation records show they often look at more talc per sample than Saldivar has testified is the practice at AMA.
In a deposition earlier this year, Saldivar acknowledged that he looked at less talc per sample than others in the field and that looking at more talc ""would raise your analytical sensitivity"" - the ability to find any contamination. But he said he believed that his methods were sufficient.
After the AMA lab found no asbestos in 2010, the FDA cautioned against reading too much into the results - not because of the sensitivity of the test but because so few products were tested.
Though the agency has described the testing as using the “most sensitive techniques available,” it said the results “do not prove that most or all talc or talc-containing cosmetic products currently marketed in the United States are likely to be free of asbestos contamination.”
When J&J’s lawyers approached Saldivar a few years ago about serving as an expert and testing Baby Powder, they “wanted me to follow my protocols that I used on my FDA testing” in 2010, Saldivar testified in May 2018. In June, he testified that his lab had never found any asbestos in talc samples, including Baby Powder, that it had tested for J&J and other manufacturer defendants.
The testing by Saldivar’s lab for the FDA this year was a different story.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 closing at a record for the second time in three sessions, after a policy statement by the U.S. Federal Reserve that cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point. 
The Fed lowered its policy rate to a target range between 1.50% and 1.75%, but dropped a previous reference in its statement to ""act as appropriate"" to sustain the economic expansion, which could signal the Fed may hold off on future rate cuts. 
Chair Powell said ""we believe that monetary policy is in a good place,"" in a press conference following the announcement, indicating the central bank was likely to keep rates on hold absent a major change in the economic outlook, helping stocks move higher in the latter stages of trading.
""The only concern in this market was that they'd make some statement saying this is it,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, New Vernon, New Jersey. ""They said they remain open to what the data shows them. Flexibility is what the market wants to see.""
The S&P 500 and Fed interest rate decisions: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7991/7922/Pasted%20Image.jpg
Hopes of a rate cut and recent optimism around the trade talks had helped lift the benchmark S&P 500 to record intraday highs for three straight sessions.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 115.54 points, or 0.43%, to 27,186.96, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 9.92 points, or 0.33%, to 3,046.81 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 27.12 points, or 0.33%, to 8,303.98.
The interest-rate sensitive banking sub-sector <.SPXBK> pared losses after the statement, but was still down 0.69%. Utilities (SPLRCU), up 0.86%, was the best performing while the energy sector (SPNY) lagged, down 2.12%.
Investors also dealt with the latest round of corporate earnings. Shares of  General Electric  Co (N:GE) jumped 11.47% after the industrial conglomerate beat quarterly profit estimates and raised its cash forecast for the year.
Yum Brands Inc (N:YUM) shed 6.22% and was among the top decliners on the benchmark index as the KFC owner missed quarterly profit expectations. 
U.S. economic growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter, a Commerce Department report showed, as declining business investment was offset by resilient consumer spending and a rebound in exports, further allaying financial market fears of a recession.
Other data showed a modest acceleration in private sector job growth, boosted by gains in the service sector, according to the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report. The data comes ahead of Friday's payrolls report. 
About 74.1% of the 278 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. 
However, profit growth forecasts for the next four quarters have been revised lower, even as expectations for the decline in third quarter earnings has shrunk to 1.6%, compared with a 2.2% fall at the start of the month.
Buoying the Dow was a 2.88% rise in shares of Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ). The company said 15 new tests found no asbestos in a bottle of baby powder that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says tested positive for trace amounts of asbestos. The FDA said it stands by its finding.
 Mattel Inc  (O:MAT) surged nearly 13.78% after the U.S. toymaker reported a surprise jump in quarterly revenue.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.15-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 21 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 72 new lows.

The S&P 500 was up 0.25% at 3:12 PM ET (19:12 GMT), with the {{169|Dow Jones industrials} up 0.32%. The NASDAQ Composite was up 0.26%, while the Nasdaq 100 Index, dominated by big technology stocks, was up 0.38%. Utilities, health and technology stocks were the market leaders.
The move higher seemed triggered by Powell's comment that, while the central bank looks content to leave rates alone for now, ""We're not thinking about raising rates right now"" and also his benign comments on inflation.


The Fed cut its federal funds rate to 1.5% to 1.75%. It was the Fed's third rate cut in as many meetings and came on worries about global economic growth issues and low inflation. Its description of the domestic economy indicated steady growth in consumer spending and jobs, with low interest rates convincing consumers to accelerate home-buying plans. Weak business investment spending and exports remain a concern. A resolution to trade disputes would help business confidence, Powell said. 

The Fed did not indicate if it will cut rates again at, say, its December meeting. Rather it wants to see what the economic data show. Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool puts the odds of no cut at 80%.
The U.S. dollar was down, unsurprisingly. The dollar index was down 0.2% and EUR/USD climbed 0.3%.

799,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 03:21PM ET</span>",Italian road operators express concern about proposed tax measure,"ROME (Reuters) - Italian toll road operators have warned that a measure in this year's budget that would limit tax deductions that can be claimed against amortization costs for infrastructure assets could slow investment and lead to a possible legal challenge.
Under the new rule, motorway operators would only be able to deduct up to 1% of the value of investments on infrastructure projects like new toll roads booked on their balance sheets. At present, each year they can deduct the full amount of the value of the depreciation booked on the balance sheet.
""If the new rule in the budget law is approved, it would be impossible over the term of the concession period for motorway concession holders to deduct the costs sustained in developing infrastructure that will be handed over to the state for free at the end of the concession period,"" the operators lobby AISCAT said in a statement.
The measure is included in the 2020 budget law which has been passed by the government but which still needs parliamentary approval.
The industry lobby said it considers the new rule could breach the Italian constitution, paving the way for future legal actions against the government.
Finance Minister Roberto Gualtieri denied the measure was aimed at punishing operators, who have been under increased scrutiny since the deadly collapse last year of a bridge managed by  Atlantia  (MI:ATL). ""It's an absolutely sustainable adjustment, this isn't a dramatic issue,"" he said."
800,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 03:11PM ET</span>",Air Premia braces for long-haul battle with new Boeing 787s,"HONG KONG/SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean carrier Air Premia announced on Wednesday a provisional deal to buy five Boeing (N:BA) 787-9 Dreamliner jets worth $1.4 billion at list prices, becoming the latest new airline to enter the highly competitive low-cost, long-haul market.
The deal follows an agreement to lease three 787-9 jets from  Air Lease Corp  (N:AL) as Air Premia prepares to start flying in September 2020. It will seek another two 787-9s by 2024.
Planned destinations include Vietnam and Hong Kong next year and Los Angeles, which has a large American Korean community and business ties, in 2021. It is one of several emerging players in South Korea's expanding but highly competitive low-cost market.
Chief Executive Peter Sim described Air Premia as a ""hybrid"" airline offering greater comfort than low-cost rivals but lower fares than domestic giants Korean Air (KS:003490) and Asiana (KS:020560).
It will offer two classes including Premium Economy and a coach class still with extra legroom, called Economy Plus.
""We are going to offer a slightly lower price than full-service carriers with a better product,"" Sim said in an interview in Hong Kong, where he was attending the Airfinance Journal Asia Pacific conference to drum up aircraft funding.The airline is targeting customers such as empty-nesters in their 50s or 60s with an appetite for long trips in some comfort but unable to afford traditional premium fares.
Sim, former head of a biotech company who invested in the startup along with a group of tech entrepreneurs, said Air Premia would also target a young, connected audience with its own onboard streaming product.
But he acknowledged it would be tough to woo premium passengers from the two main South Korean rivals.
Analysts say airlines with novel business models or those participating in the volatile long-haul, low-cost market face risks including technical outages away from base and higher crewing costs compared to short-haul budget carriers.
Sim said Air Premia had signed up for long-term servicing agreements with Boeing.
Asked how he would avoid financial strains like those at Norwegian Air (OL:NWC), which also invested in a new fleet of 787s only to rack up debt, Sim said the ""fan base"" of the two airlines was different. Separated from key destinations by the Pacific, Koreans are ready to travel at a ""proper price,"" he said.
Analysts say South Korea's budget carriers are grappling with rising competition and a slump in travel demand to its neighbouring country, Japan, as a result of a diplomatic row.
Seouleaguer Co. Ltd. (KQ:043710), a distributor of Botox and fillers, holds a 9.53% stake in the unlisted Air Premia.
The 787s will be powered by engines from Britain's Rolls-Royce (L:RR), which has had a series of technical problems.
Rolls, which competes with  General Electric  (N:GE) on the 787, offered Air Premia a ""cutting edge"" financial deal, Sim said, adding he was confident it would overcome recent snags."
801,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 02:58PM ET</span>","Trump thanks GM, Fiat Chrysler and Toyota on California emissions fight","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday thanked General Motors Co (N:GM), Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203),  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) and other major automakers for ""standing with"" his efforts to bar California from setting its own vehicle emissions rules for cars and trucks.
""California has treated the Auto Industry very poorly for many years, harming Workers and Consumers,"" Trump wrote on Twitter.
The automakers' decision to side with the Trump administration follows legal challenges by California and 22 states and environmental groups in September.
Those challenges aim to undo the administration's determination that federal law bars California from setting its own rigorous tailpipe emission standards and zero-emission vehicle mandates.
The decision to back Trump, disclosed in a filing with a U.S. appeals court late on Monday, has prompted a furious backlash from Democrats and environmentalists.
It also poses a risk for the automakers if a Democrat wins the White House in November 2020 and reverses Trump’s actions, allowing California to set its own rules and revert to the tougher national emissions standards of the Obama era.
The automakers did not immediately comment.
California Air Resource Board chief Mary Nichols on Tuesday criticized automakers after noting they tried a similar tactic previously. ""GM, Toyota and Chrysler are repeating the same legal arguments they lost back in 2004, hoping for a different result. Definition of insanity?"" she wrote on Twitter.
U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said on Twitter automakers ""caving"" to Trump's ""intimidation campaign won't save these automakers"" and added the decision to align with Trump's ""anti-climate agenda for the sake of a little short-term profit and reprieve from @POTUS’ Twitter tirades will do long-term damage, both to the automotive industry and to our country.""
Other automakers, such as  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), Honda Motor Co (T:7267) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), which announced a voluntary deal with California in July on emissions rules, are not joining the bid to intervene on the administration's side.
The group backing Trump also includes Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261), Nissan Motor Co (T:7201), Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270) and Subaru Co (T:9778).
In August 2018, the Trump administration proposed freezing fuel efficiency requirements at 2020 levels through 2026, reversing planned 5% annual increases.

The Obama-era rules called for a fleetwide fuel-efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2026 compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration’s preferred option. The final requirements are expected to be ready by the end of the year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - CME Group Inc (O:CME) has expressed concerns to regulators over a recent paper by several financial institutions calling for clearinghouses to put up more of their own capital to protect against losses that could disrupt the financial system, the head of the company said on Wednesday.
""We believe that people who introduce risk to the system should be putting in the money for the system,"" CME Chief Executive Officer Terry Duffy said on a call with analysts following the exchange operator's quarterly earnings. ""We are here to manage the risk. We don't introduce the risk. ""So those that are bringing the most risk, you know, should be putting in money for the default fund.""
Clearinghouses stand between both sides of trades to ensure their completion even if one side goes bust. They were given a bigger role following the 2008 financial crisis, when regulators forced the majority of over-the-counter derivatives trades to be centrally cleared through them.
But there are still no detailed protocols for safely winding down a clearinghouse if a large customer defaults, creating a too-big-to-fail scenario similar to that at their big bank members.
The financial institutions, which include  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), last Thursday published their views to try to shift in their favor prolonged policy debates over how clearinghouses, such as the one run by CME, should be fortified.
""We believe current capital requirements are insufficient,"" the group said.
The banks and fund managers said the clearinghouses do not have enough of their own money at risk, giving them little incentive to ensure effective risk management against defaults, operational failures and cyberattacks.
They also called for changes in governance rules to give clearing members more say in risks the clearinghouses take on.
Duffy said CME has plenty of ""skin in the game,"" with the clearinghouse's own capital in its default fund the first to be tapped if one of its members goes bust, followed by the capital its members contribute. If the clearinghouse added more of its own capital, it might reduce the incentive for members to guard against their own risky behavior, he said.
""We don't think that is good for risk management practices, so we don't subscribe to that,"" he said.
Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS),  Societe Generale  SA (PA:SOGN), State Street Global Markets, T. Rowe Price Group Inc (O:TROW) and The Vanguard Group also signed the paper."

AMD reported third-quarter earnings of 18 cents a share, in line with consensus estimates from Investing.com. But its revenue of $1.8 billion just missed estimates of $1.81 billion. Earnings were up 38.4% from a year earlier. Revenue was up 9.1%.
The slight miss on the top line was driven by a fall in demand for gaming consoles, pressuring sales of the company's gaming CPUs.
But the headwinds from gaming may fade ahead of the new game console cycle, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and   Sony   (NYSE:SNE) expected to launch new consoles late next year.
Looking ahead, AMD will likely benefit from continuing notebook traction and a ramp-up in demand for desktop and server equipment in 2020, Rosenblatt suggested.
AMD is up about 77% for the year so far despite Wednesday's decline. It has an average price target of $33.54, according to consensus estimates from Investing.com."
807,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 01:36PM ET</span>","With eye to China, Israel forms panel to vet foreign investments","By Steven Scheer
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel decided on Wednesday to form an advisory committee to weigh national security aspects of prospective foreign investments in Israeli companies after coming under U.S. pressure over business deals with China.
The Israeli security cabinet's move to set up the panel followed a visit to Israel this week by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, although discussions on the issue have been going on for the past three years.
With many Israelis alarmed by President Donald Trump's withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria, Washington's warnings about the security aspects of Chinese investment in Israel had threatened to widen a schism with its closest ally.
A statement issued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the committee would be comprised of officials from the finance and defense ministries who would consult with the foreign ministry and various security agencies.
The panel, it said, would begin work early next year and aim to find ""the appropriate balance"" between national security considerations and ""the need to encourage foreign investments in Israel and ensure continued economic prosperity"".
The statement did not mention any potential investor by name, an apparent attempt to avoid alienating China, which has stepped up its investments in the country in recent years.
Regulators would approach the committee on a voluntary basis and the panel would act in an advisory capacity, dealing only with investments that required Israeli government approval, such as telecommunications, energy and transportation projects.
In January, a U.S. official cautioned Israel over investments from China, citing cyber-security concerns and the prospect of Israel’s allies limiting intelligence-sharing with it.
Chinese investment in Israel's tech sector reached more than $325 million in 2018, an Israeli venture capital research group said.
In a deal that drew U.S. concern, China won Israeli approval to build a private seaport near Haifa, a berth for the U.S. Mediterranean fleet.
In what was widely seen in Israel as a sign of U.S. displeasure at the Chinese involvement in Haifa, one of the Sixth Fleet’s warships a year ago docked in Israel’s second-tier Mediterranean port of Ashdod, the fleet’s first such visit in almost 20 years.
Interest by Huwaei Technologies Cos Ltd and ZTE Corp (HK:0763), two of China’s biggest network equipment makers, has also worried Washington, as has the green light granted to China’s Shanghai International Port Group in 2013 to build the Haifa seaport.
The Trump administration has taken steps to curb market penetration by Huwaei and ZTE, seeing them as spying threats."

810,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 01:16PM ET</span>",Breaking Lebanon's FX peg could be ruinous for hugely indebted country,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Lebanon's political and banking crisis has put growing pressure on its 22-year-old currency peg to the U.S. dollar and foreign funds fear a devaluation now could be disastrous for a country with one of the world's biggest foreign debt burdens.
The risk of devaluation has risen as Lebanon grapples with its most severe economic pressures since the 1975-90 civil war, with widespread protests that have toppled the coalition government of Saad al-Hariri.
Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh governor once again ruled out a break in the long-standing peg on Monday, saying the government had the means to maintain it.
But with the black market exchange rate indicating a discount to the peg of more than 20%, observers say a double-digit devaluation has become increasingly likely, especially in the wake of Hariri's resignation on Tuesday.
Unlike many other economies with such currency pegs, Lebanon has huge overseas liabilities, burdened by a debt to GDP ratio of around 150%, the third highest in the world.
That ratio would soar further under a devaluation, making Beirut's ability to repay its debt tougher still.
""The fixed exchange rate and banking sector model have simply not been working for the wider economy,"" said Timothy Ash, senior emerging markets strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, which was underweight heading into the crisis.
""Some combination of debt restructuring and a more flexible and competitive exchange rate seems likely.""
Lebanon has long been a comfortable part of many foreign funds' portfolios and despite bouts of volatility, such as in 2008, when Hezbollah fighters briefly seized control of the capital, it has never defaulted on its external debt.
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Amundi,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Invesco are among the world's big international players holding Lebanese debt as of Sept. 30, according to Morningstar and EPFR Global data.
But the latest crisis threatens that dynamic - and the peg, which has helped provide an anchor of stability since its introduction in 1997. The peg has remained fixed at 1,507.5 pounds per dollar.
High levels of U.S. dollar denominated debt, which makes up nearly half of Lebanon's total liabilities, is one reason why a devaluation could be more painful than those experienced by other emerging markets, including Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea during the Asia financial crisis in 1997.
""Having such large FX liabilities is the original sin of emerging markets,"" said Brett Diment, head of global emerging market debt at Aberdeen Standard Investments, which sold all its Lebanon positions over a month ago.
""During the 1997-98 Asia crisis most of the debt was local currency debt, not dollar debt. Most other emerging markets have most of their debt as local so it doesn't cause so many problems in a situation like Lebanon is in.""
MIDDLE EAST MODELS
Unlike Gulf states, which have in the past provided financial support for Beirut, Lebanon does not have the enormous riches from oil revenues to help prop up its peg.
Instead, it has relied on huge inflows from its sizeable diaspora to fill the deposits in its banks, which in turn helped finance its deficit and towering debt burden. But as those flows have faltered recently, the problems for Lebanon's economy have mounted.
Even so, Lebanon had ""comfortable"" levels of gross official reserves of around $38 billion as of mid October - on the face of it equivalent to about 12 months of imports, estimated Garbis Iradian, chief economist for Middle East and North Africa at Institute of International Finance.
He put the risk of a devaluation at less than 50% in the short-term, but admitted a protracted political hiatus could yet see a devaluation of more than 10%.
The question is how much of those reserves are available - some estimate usable reserves could be as little as a quarter of that - and how much of those have been used up in the past few weeks of turmoil, during which the country's banks have been closed for 11 straight days. The banks partly reopen on Thursday to assess the damage to their deposit bases and aim to fully reopen on Friday.
Those reserves are measured against a heavy redemption schedule, starting with a $1.5 billion dollar bond due at the end of November, and secondary market bond yields indicating a two-year cost of borrowing in excess of 30%.
Another Middle East neighbor, Egypt, was among the latest to devalue its currency when it cut the value of its pound by about half in late 2016 in return for a $12 billion loan program from the IMF.
Despite initial pain caused by a spike in inflation, which analysts say would happen in Lebanon too, Egypt netted hefty inflows of foreign investment in subsequent years.
Lebanon is badly in need of such flows to help build its tiny industrial sector and bolster tourism, which had been on course for its best season since 2010 until protests hit two weeks ago.
Lebanon has so far not asked for support from the IMF and Hariri has previously expressed reservations about IMF proposals which he said included floating the pound.
But with Hariri gone, investors are still waiting to see if any new government might take a different view on the peg and IMF support.
""If uncertainty prevails for a long time a devaluation becomes more likely and that could exceed 15%,"" said Iradian."
811,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 01:15PM ET</span>","Apple CEO's handling of trade war has helped buoy shares, investors say","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - When Apple Inc (O:AAPL) reports results on Wednesday, Wall Street expects flat fiscal fourth-quarter sales and lower full-year revenue compared with the prior year, mostly because of declining iPhone sales. Yet Apple's stock price has hit all-time highs in recent weeks, and its price-to-forward-earnings valuation is higher than it has been since 2010.
Investors and analysts told Reuters that much of the explanation lies in Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook's skillful management of relationships in Washington, Beijing and Wall Street.
Cook has fostered a relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, dining with him and conveying Apple's views on tariffs and U.S. manufacturing. He has also kept strong enough relations with Chinese officials to avoid Apple becoming a target of explicit retaliation after the U.S. government moved to cut off Huawei Technologies Co Ltd - Apple's arch rival in the premium smartphone market in China - from American technology.
Along the way, Cook has persuaded Wall Street that Apple can transition from the iPhone to a broader constellation of products that includes streaming video and even a credit card, along with accessories like AirPods and the Apple Watch.
Even investors who were already impressed by Cook's business acumen - he masterminded Apple's supply chain and operations under the late CEO Steve Jobs - have been pleasantly surprised by Cook's ability to avoid taking fatal arrows from either side in the U.S.-China trade war.
""Who would have thought he would have been able to thread that needle and deal with the president? It's a show of an incredible amount of nuance and emotional intelligence to do what's best for the company,"" said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Capital Investment Cos, an Apple shareholder.
China remains a challenge for Apple. Sales there fell sharply early in the current fiscal year when currency fluctuations put iPhones out of reach for many Chinese consumers. Apple cut prices, which helped, but rival Huawei has gained share.
Apple's share of the Chinese market fell to 5.2% in the calendar third quarter versus 7% a year ago, while Huawei, which sells many more low-cost models than Apple does, saw its market share surge to 42.4% from 24.9% the year before, Canalys data showed.
""A year ago, we were talking about the price pushback in China, and (Apple) contended they were overcoming that,"" said Tom Plumb, founder of Wisconsin Capital Management, an Apple shareholder. ""Now the real question is whether you're seeing a cultural shift that would bode poorly for Apple.""
But many Apple investors have likely already priced in a loss of China market share to domestic rivals in the long term. 
""If the industry is worth being in, you should assume that over the course of time it's going to be dominated by Chinese national champions,"" said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan.
Apple shares were down 0.5% to $242 at midday on Wednesday after reports that Chilean officials had canceled a summit at which the United States and China were expected to take major steps toward a trade deal.
Cook has also persuaded investors that services such as Apple TV+, coming next month, will boost sales. Investors are optimistic, but worry that Apple could be drawn into spending battles over Hollywood talent against entrenched rivals such as Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS).

""We're not huge advocates of them spending huge amounts of cash reserves on content generation,"" said John Ham of New England Investment & Retirement Group Inc, which holds Apple shares. ""But as long as they don't get carried away and start making outsized, egregious deals, then we would support them dabbling in this area.""

812,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 12:32PM ET</span>",Trump Still Plans on China Deal After Chile Cancels APEC Summit,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump still hopes to ink a trade accord with Xi Jinping next month, even after plans were thrown into question Wednesday when Chile canceled an upcoming summit where the two leaders planned to meet.
The cancellation -- announced earlier Wednesday by Chile as social unrest continued to rock Santiago -- appeared to catch the White House off guard. White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in an e-mail that Trump still intends to sign a partial trade deal with Xi at about the same time in November as the planned Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.
“We look forward to finalizing Phase One of the historic trade deal with China within the same time frame, and when we have an announcement, we’ll let you know,” Gidley said.
“As of now, it appears APEC will not occur in Chile, and it’s our understanding the organization does not currently have a secondary site prepared,” he said.
The possibility of a Trump-Xi meeting in Santiago next month has buoyed markets as investors look for signs that an end to the multi-year trade war between the two nations is in sight. The White House was working as recently as Tuesday to finish a “phase one” agreement with an eye toward the leaders signing it in Chile, according to a statement from White House spokesman Judd Deere.
The S&P 500 briefly fell to a session low after news of the meeting’s cancellation.
“The risk here is that if the summit now is postponed then that at least suggests that the trade war uncertainty might be hanging over us for longer,” Torsten Slok, chief economist at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), said in an interview on Bloomberg Television Wednesday. “It raises the risk that we could never see a phase two or phase three and therefore the uncertainty would basically not be going away.”
Both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence said last week they were optimistic the deal would be finalized at the summit.
Trump has previously hosted Xi at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida."
813,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 12:26PM ET</span>",New high-water mark for global foreign currency debt,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Global foreign currency debt - where the rest of world borrows in dollars, euros or Japanese yen - has hit a record high of over $16 trillion, data from the Bank for International Settlements showed on Thursday.
The figures from the Swiss-based central bank umbrella group showed U.S. dollar credit to ""non-bank"" borrowers outside the United States grew by 4% year-on-year at end-June 2019 to reach $11.9 trillion.
Foreign currency credit denominated in euros and Japanese yen expanded at a faster pace, growing at annual rates of 9% and 8% and taking their respective totals to 3.4 trillion euros ($3.78 trillion) and 49.4 trillion yen ($453.88 billion).
That marks a new record for euro-denominated borrowing following 20 years of broadly steady growth, but yen borrowing has been more variable and remains comfortably below 2007-09 and 2000-02 levels.
(For an interactive version of the below chart, click here https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/GLOBAL-MARKETS-DEBT/0H001QXG796N/index.html)
Foreign currency borrowing is particularly common in emerging markets as it can work out cheaper and is a way of attracting investors who do not want the risk of a potentially volatile local currency.
The downside for the governments or firms that issue the debt though is that it can become painfully expensive to service if their own currency falls, as various crises from Argentina to Mozambique have shown over the years.
Emerging economies now have a record $3.74 trillion in dollar debt, the BIS data showed, despite the annual growth rate slowing to 2% from its recent peak of 8%.
Africa and the Middle East continued to expand at a rapid annual pace of 11% though, Latin America expanded by 3% year-on-year including 9% in Mexico and 8% in Chile, which more than offset the 4% and 1% contractions in Argentina and Brazil.
Record low euro borrowing costs saw emerging Europe's dollar borrowing also shrink by 9% year-on-year to $400 billion, extending a regional contraction that started in 2014.
The latest decline was led by a 14% drop in lending to borrowers in Russia. Credit to Asia-Pacific also contracted, albeit at a slower annual rate of 1%. That was mainly driven by a 6% decline to non-bank borrowers in China which compared with an 8% rise at end-2017.
The growth rates of the two main components of foreign currency U.S. dollar credit - bank loans and debt securities such as bonds - continued to move in opposite directions.
For most of the post-Financial Crisis period, growth in U.S. dollar-denominated debt securities was higher than that of bank loans.
However, recently the trend has reversed: the annual growth rate of U.S. dollar bank loans outpaced that of securities for a second quarter in a row, 5% for loans versus 3% for debt securities at the end of June.

814,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 12:08PM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank shares sink 8% after third-quarter loss,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) shares fell more than 8% on Wednesday after the bank reported an 832 million euro ($924 million) third-quarter loss hurt by restructuring costs and weakness in fixed-income trading.
The bank had flagged in July it would make a loss this year and announced restructuring plans worth $7.4 billion including the elimination of 18,000 jobs. 
Deutsche's new leadership, with CEO Christian Sewing at the helm, has tried to revive Deutsche's fortunes, but problems have persisted.
In April it called off nearly six weeks of merger talks with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 
The third-quarter loss compares with a 3.15 billion euro loss in the second quarter and a 229 million euro net profit a year earlier. The bank is aiming to break even in 2020, but analysts are concerned about its ability to generate revenue.
CEO Sewing said the bank's four core divisions made a pretax profit. ""These quarterly results are just an interim assessment, but they are encouraging,"" Sewing wrote to staff.
Analysts, unsure of the size of restructuring costs in the quarter, had largely held back on providing estimates. 
Their initial reaction was less than favorable. 
""One has to look very hard to find anything positive in Deutsche Bank's results this quarter,"" said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of capital markets management consultancy Opimas.
The bank's shares fell nearly 9% late afternoon in Frankfurt and were heading for their biggest daily loss in almost three and a half years. 
Revenue fell 15% to 5.3 billion euros, short of a 5.6 billion euros expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. 
The bank attributed the decline to its decision to exit its equities business as well as macroeconomic uncertainty and negative interest rates. But it lagged rivals facing similar headwinds.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) on Wednesday reported a rise in third-quarter earnings buoyed by higher revenue in markets and international wealth management. Standard Chartered's profits rose 16% helped by rising income from corporate and private banking clients.
FIXED INCOME FALLRevenue at Deutsche's cash-cow bond-trading division fell 13%, highlighting continued weakness at its investment bank. 
U.S. banks' fixed income revenues rose 10% in the third quarter, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). 
 Citigroup  said that Deutsche's weak revenue in the quarter would be likely to result in a downgrade in analysts' profit forecasts.
Deutsche, founded in 1870, is considered one of the global financial system's most important banks, along with JPMorgan (N:JPM), Bank of America (N:BAC) and Citigroup (N:C). 
But after a string losses and scandals, Deutsche is going through one of the biggest overhauls to an investment bank since the aftermath of the financial crisis. 
Out of a planned 18,000 job cuts, Deutsche eliminated 1,500 in the third quarter, though the number of employees in its investment bank rose as an intake of new graduates offset staff cuts in equity trading.
The bank said revenue at its private bank, which focuses on retail clients and Germany and is the bank's largest division, would be ""slightly lower"" in 2019, due to lower interest rates. That is a downgrade from earlier expectations for little change from 2018.
Deutsche highlighted some progress in winding down 74 billion euros of risk-weighted assets, a pillar of its restructuring plan.
Deutsche financial chief James Von Moltke said the bank had auctioned off three books of less complex equities derivatives, which was ""quite successful"". 
The focus will now turn to more complex derivatives, which will take place slowly over coming years, he said.

(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) posted adjusted profits on Wednesday that beat analysts' estimates and wowed investors by promising to deliver $1 billion more cash this year than it had previously forecast, sending its shares sharply higher.
The Boston-based conglomerate made the gains despite flat revenue and a $1.3 billion net loss, when one-time charges were included. 
But improvement in its aircraft and healthcare businesses, and ""stabilization"" at its power unit signaled ""progress in the transformation of GE,"" said Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp, who has called GE's planned turnaround from a disastrous 2018 ""a game of inches.""
GE shares were up 14% at $10.34 in morning trading.
""People weren't expecting the cash-flow increase,"" said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in New York, who noted a lack of any surprises in GE's report. ""The market was braced for bad news.""
GE said it now expects full-year industrial free cash flow to be between $0 and $2 billion, up from its earlier forecast of negative $1 billion to positive $1 billion.
GE held other forecasts unchanged, though it trimmed plans for restructuring spending and noted EPS no longer reflects 5 cents a share of income from oil and gas company Baker Hughes Co (N:BKR).
""The sweet number is $650 million in industrial free cash flow"" in the quarter, said Nick Heymann, an analyst at William Baird and Co in New York, who expected $400 to $500 million.
GE now needs to generate about $2.6 billion of cash in the fourth quarter to meet the midpoint of its new forecast, said John Inch, analyst at Gordon Haskett in New York, about half what GE generated in the same quarter last year. 
""This seems plausible, but hardly robust – regardless of the company's cash guidance 'raise,'"" Inch said in a note.
While GE's adjusted results beat expectations, GE's report showed difficulty in key business lines, and Culp said the remains plenty of ""work to do.""
Orders at GE's ailing power division fell 30%, and orders for GE's gas-powered turbines fell 17%. GE said it shipped five of its newest and largest HA gas turbines in the third quarter, after shipping just one in the first half. Power revenue, which includes gas, steam and nuclear equipment and services, fell 14% in the quarter.
Jet engine orders fell 27%, while engine service orders rose 15%. GE said it took a $300-million cash hit in the quarter from the grounding of Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX jetliner, which uses engines partly made by GE. Culp said he does not expect the grounding to end this year.
The grounding, after a second fatal crash of the plane last March, means Boeing cannot deliver the jets to airlines, and GE therefore is not yet being paid for the engines it delivers, according to analysts. GE said it expects a similar hit of $400 million in the fourth quarter. Those numbers were in line with expectations GE set at the end of July.
GE took an $8.7-billion charge for reducing its stake in Baker Hughes to less than 50% in the quarter, a change that required GE to stop consolidating the oil and gas company's earnings in GE's results and to mark the remaining stake to fair value. Analysts had expected a charge up to $10 billion. 
GE took a $1 billion charge for its long-term care insurance business to account for the effect of falling interest rates on its obligations. The charge was about what analysts expected.
GE also wrote off $740 million in goodwill for its hydro power business. Together, the insurance and goodwill charges amounted to 17 cents of EPS, GE said.
On an adjusted basis, which excludes such charges, GE earned 15 cents per share, compared with 11 cents analysts expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Total revenue fell slightly to $23.36 billion from $23.39 billion.

The High Court's investigative judges said FCC paid bribes to obtain metro and hospital contracts in the central American country between 2010 and 2014.
FCC declined to comment. It now has the opportunity to defend itself or appeal against the charges, before the judges decide whether to send the case to trial. The process could take months.
FCC is now controlled by Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim, who took a 25% stake in 2014 and gained control of the board in 2016.
Documents published by the court on Wednesday show its investigation centered on allegations that FCC overcharged for steel in construction projects with a consortium including Brazilian company Odebrecht, using the funds obtained to pay bribes to officials in Panama.
The High Court said the managers who participated in the scheme were fired by FCC.
In 2016, Odebrecht agreed to the world's largest-ever corruption leniency fine with prosecutors in Brazil, the United States, and Switzerland, paying at least $3.5 billion. The scandal over bribes for public works contracts spread to other countries where Odebrecht did business, including Peru, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia.

Fidelity disclosed on Wednesday that Contrafund (O:FCNTX) held $193.1 million in Series E WeWork shares at the end of September, down from $295.1 million the previous month. The valuation cut assumes no shares were bought, sold or transferred between the two periods. 
Fidelity declined to comment.
The $100 billion-plus Contrafund is run by Will Danoff, one of the top stock pickers in the U.S. mutual fund industry over the past 25 years. Contrafund bought $179.7 million worth of WeWork's Series E shares in June 2015, according to fund disclosures. Fidelity valued those shares at $411.5 million at the end of 2018.
Fidelity and other mutual fund companies have invested in pre-IPO companies to juice their returns. WeWork looked like another promising bet before the value of its equity cratered as questions surfaced about its financial viability. 

The IPO was abandoned in September as investors balked at sky-high valuations - a deal in January had tagged its worth at $47 billion. A rescue effort by SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) now values it at just $8 billion.

""Mr. Ghosn categorically denies that there was anything improper about the payments or donations at issue, all of which were made for the benefit of Nissan,"" according to a statement issued by a spokesman.
""There is nothing new in these allegations, which arise from inquiries by the tax authorities and taxes paid by Nissan years ago,"" the statement said.
""The prosecutors' decision to leak them now, only days after Mr. Ghosn publicly released court filings detailing extensive prosecutorial misconduct and previewing his defenses for the first time, is a transparent effort to distract from the failings of their case.""
Japan's Yomiuri reported on Tuesday the country's tax authorities had determined Ghosn used money for private use, bolstering the carmaker's case that he diverted corporate funds for personal gain.
The Japanese newspaper, without citing sources, said the National Tax Agency found Ghosn used Nissan money for several years to pay consultant fees to his sister for fictitious work and to make donations to a university in Lebanon.
The former Nissan chairman holds Lebanese nationality. He is awaiting trial in Japan on charges of financial misconduct, which he denies."

Whirlpool announced on Oct. 15 that it planned to shut down and sell the site, which it said was no longer profitable, prompting union protests and disappointing the Italian government after months of talks aimed at saving the plant.
Workers had reacted fiercely to the decision and metalworkers union FIOM-CGIL had called for work stoppages and protests at the group's other plants in Italy.
On Wednesday, Whirlpool announced a change of course, saying it was ""ready to withdraw the sale procedure ... not to proceed with the layoffs in Naples and to continue the production of washing machines.""
In a video posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli said the decision would open the way to finding a long term solution for the site.
""It is a first step towards restarting the talks with the aim of definitively resolving the site's problems,"" he said.
Whirlpool, which employs around 5,500 people in Italy had said the closure was necessary because the production of high-end washing machines in Naples was no longer profitable. The factory employs 400 workers in a region with some of the highest unemployment levels in the country.
In June, the Italian government threatened to scrap all incentives it had granted to the company to keep investing in Italy, estimated at some 50 million euros since 2014."

""The Fed purchases are still in the early stages. At this point we are monitoring how the purchase program may evolve and any effects on the market,"" a Treasury official said as the agency released its latest quarterly plan to fund the federal government. ""It would be premature to draw any conclusions at this point.""
The official also said Treasury was taking a ""proactive approach"" to look at future government financing and was exploring a range of new products including one linked to the new Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) that is set to become a reference for the financial industry, as well as 20-year and 50-year bonds.
The Fed earlier this month announced that it allow its asset holdings to expand for the next few month with regular purchases of short-term Treasury securities.
Unlike earlier Fed asset purchases, officials said the aim was not to impact long-term interest rates or encourage economic activity, but to ensure financial markets had an adequate supply of reserves to function smoothly, and that the Fed could keep control of its target overnight interest rate.
The Fed's entry into the market for Treasury bills, however, could change the demand for other types of securities and potentially influence the Treasury's funding strategies.
In laying out its plans for refunding $60.5 billion in maturing debt and raising $23.5 billion in new cash, the department said in a press release there were no plans to change the supply of bills beyond what was currently expected.
The supply of bills may increase somewhat through the end of November, ""consistent with historical patterns,"" but by the end of the year and through January 2020 it ""is expected to be comparable to current levels,"" Treasury said in the statement."

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares slipped off 21-month highs on Wednesday as the prospect of a U.S. rate cut was offset by reports a Sino-U.S. trade deal may be delayed, though a possible $50 billion merger between Fiat-Chrysler and PSA capped European losses.
Sentiment has also been dented by weak earnings from a swathe of companies ranging from European banking giant Deutsche to tech titan Google, and by renewed uncertainty in Britain, which is set to hold a parliamentary election on Dec. 12.
After falls of around 0.5% on Asian bourses (MIAPJ0000PUS) (N225) (CSI300), Europe's pan-European equity benchmark (STOXX) was trading near flat%. But European auto shares (SXAP) rose 0.7% and shares in  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and French PSA (PA:PEUP) jumped 7-8% on news they were in talks for a merger valued at as much as $50 billion
Broader sentiment was undermined however by a Reuters report quoting a U.S. official as saying an interim trade agreement between Washington and Beijing might not be completed in time for signing next month.
That hit Europe's trade-sensitive tech (SX8P) and commodity shares (SXPP) and MSCI's world equity index (MIWD00000PUS) edged down after five successive sessions in the black.
Michael Hewson, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, said the deal news had not sharply lifted shares because regulatory hurdles remain, not least the French government's stake in PSA. 
""We've seen a lot of companies exploring M&A and I struggle to understand why this deal in particular is any more probable than the one with  Renault  (PA:RENA),"" he said, said referring to Fiat's failed attempt to acquire another French carmaker.
Some caution has also crept in before the U.S. Federal Reserve announcement at 1800 GMT. Fed funds rate futures <0#FF:> price a 25 basis-point cut but markets are fixated on what signal the central bank will send.
""The Fed could be quite hawkish in terms of 'this is it' and send a message markets don't really want to hear. They are pricing the Fed on a full-blown cutting path and that may not be what the Fed wants to convey,"" Hewson said, noting still-robust U.S. growth and booming stock markets.
FLOOR AND CAP
World stocks are almost 3% higher this month, pushing U.S. Treasury yields to six-week highs of 1.86% while German yields are set for their biggest monthly rise since Jan 2018 (US10YT=RR) (DE10YT=RR).
Equity futures signaled a flat to weaker open for Wall Street, after the S&P500 hit a record high (SPX), closing lower after the trade deal report (ESc1)  (NQc1).
Adding to that was a disappointing report from Google parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) while in Europe  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) fell 6% after reporting a loss for the second consecutive quarter.
Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) provided a reminder of slowing global demand, cutting its 2019 sales outlook,. Its shares initially slipped 0.7% after rebounding.
Marie Owens-Thomsen, chief economist at wealth manager Indosuez, said share prices were supported by central bank policies but ""we are clearly in a slowing world economy and in that context its hard to see how companies can sell more and enlarge their profit margins.
""So there is floor put in by central banks but from here there should also be a cap (on share prices), given the economic slowdown.""
Another source of uncertainty is Britain's Dec. 12 snap election, which could throw the future of Brexit up in the air again if no party wins a conclusive majority. 
That has dampened recent UK market cheer, with sterling losing 1.2% in the past week. On Wednesday it firmed modestly versus the dollar and euro around $1.29 and 86.3 pence respectively  (EURGBP=D3).
The dollar retreated 0.1% against other major currencies (DXY) before the Fed and an advance reading of third-quarter U.S. economic growth.
Against the yen, the greenback was steady at 108.87 yen  just off a three-month high.
Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan markets research at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) said a hawkish Fed message could send the dollar/yen above 110 yen but he added that ""if the market is going to price in two more cuts after this month's expected cut, the pair could fall to mid-107 yen level"".

831,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 07:16AM ET</span>",Carmakers and repair shops clash as automation upends aftermarket,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - The rapid rise of crash-avoidance technology has set carmakers and repair shops on course for a collision that could determine who controls the $800 billion auto aftermarket in the digital age.
Given the unprecedented sophistication of the systems, which include lane-keeping assistance, automatic braking and blind spot detection, many automakers say only parts and repairs from their authorized dealers can ensure safety.
This has drawn fire from the independent repair shops and suppliers that currently dominate the aftermarket. They say they can produce parts and fix cars at a fraction of the cost to drivers but are being locked out.
Subaru (T:7270), to take one car company, tells customers any problems caused by substitute replacement parts for its EyeSight system are not covered under its warranty: ""Protect yourself and your investment by keeping your car 100% Subaru.""
It is not alone is issuing such guidance. A Reuters review of automaker positions on advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) repair and calibration showed that Nissan (T:7201), its luxury division Infiniti and Volvo also say parts and repairs from unauthorized dealers will affect their warranties.
Some companies such as General Motors (N:GM) and Honda (T:7267), meanwhile, say original parts and authorized installation and repairs are important to ensure safety, but stop short of warranty warnings.
The aftermarket dispute is escalating in the United States. Independent repair shops and parts makers have asked the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the government agency responsible for consumer protection, and state lawmakers to intervene.
They want carmakers to be prohibited from making warranties conditional on original ADAS parts or service, bringing the new tech in line with rules on traditional auto equipment, and want access to the latest diagnostic data from vehicle software.
""The auto industry is creating the false narrative that you can either have safety or you can have repairability,"" said Paul McCarthy, president of the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA) of independent suppliers.
The car industry, however, argues the level of sophistication of the new technology changes the aftermarket game. The Auto Alliance, a U.S. trade group representing automakers, says they provide the required training and information, but that shops often lack the resources or expertise.
""Technology is allowing for great advancements in safety, so it is incumbent on technicians to stay current,"" a spokesman said.
The FTC, which is still soliciting industry views and public comments on the repair issue, declined to comment.
Regardless of the rights and wrongs, the rise of automated driving software is set to reshape the sector, and there's much to fight over: the aftermarket auto repair industry is worth $390 billion a year in the United States, and more than double that globally, according to trade groups and analysts.
Whoever wins will be in pole position to benefit from the anticipated self-driving car revolution, for which ADAS features are considered a precursor.
COMPLEX AND COSTLY
Currently only 10% of all cars on U.S. roads are equipped with ADAS, but that number is expected to grow rapidly, with carmakers pledging to outfit almost every new vehicle with forward collision warning and city-speed automatic emergency braking by 2020. See GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/31UcGMR
Cornering the aftermarket would give automakers – currently battling falling sales - a shot in the arm. But this would be potentially devastating for the network of independent ""mom and pop"" shops that carry out most U.S. repairs and employ millions of people.
The new systems contain cameras, radar and ultrasonic sensors built into bumpers, fenders, mirrors and windshields, which make fixing vehicles after even minor collisions more complicated and expensive than ever.
Edward Salamy, executive director of the Automotive Body Parts Association, said independent suppliers could produce ADAS parts for 25% to 50% of the price charged by automakers.
Aftermarket windshields, on average, are roughly $420 cheaper than original ones, according to data from the U.S. Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and Reuters interviews with 11 U.S. repair shop owners.
However some automakers warn cheaper parts could represent safety risks. They say sensors have to be calibrated, a costly process requiring space, level ground, specific lighting and manufacturer-made scanning tools to access software.
Industry experts say consumers are largely unaware of the risks from improper repairs.
A survey among 500 consumers who had their ADAS-equipped cars repaired over the past two years found that 15% concluded their advanced safety systems had not been properly repaired, with the technology not working or acting differently, according to Kyle Schmitt, managing director of insurance business intelligence at research firm J.D. Power.
The rate of perceived problems with repairs was around four times higher at independent shops versus dealers. GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/31UcGMR
In one such example, tests by the IIHS showed non-authorized aftermarket windshields could prevent sensors working properly.
DATA DISCORD
Aftermarket trade groups are also framing the issue as a matter of safety. They say drivers might put off having costly but necessary repairs, and argue dealerships lack the capacity to service the growing number of ADAS-equipped cars.
In an April letter to the FTC, the MEMA said at least 30 million cars on U.S. roads had ADAS-related repair restrictions from manufacturers preventing aftermarket players fixing them.
Without using manufacturer-made scanning tools, repair shops are unable to interpret and fix 20% to 30% of ADAS diagnostic trouble codes, often meaning they have to send cars to dealerships, according to the 11 shop owners.
However those tools and access to repair data cost up to $100,000, a prohibitive sum for many stores, the shop owners said. The figure is not disputed by the auto industry.
Allstate Corp (N:ALL), a U.S. auto insurance giant, agreed with some of these concerns.
Richard Beckwith, senior manager at Allstate's Tech-Cor research and collision repair center, said automakers did not provide sufficient data on ADAS. He called on the car industry to make information more readily available to small stores.
OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS
Four automotive lawyers told Reuters that ADAS liability is largely a gray area too, as technology overtakes legal precedent, and there has been no open litigation over malfunctioning ADAS post-repair to date.
""The theory would be that the manufacturer has a reasonable defense if it makes repair guidance clear, but it's always going to depend on the case and there are a lot of potential scenarios down the pike,"" said Washington-based Jackie Glassman, partner at King & Spalding.
Some companies spy a business opportunity.
New entrants, like Smart Express and asTech, have invested in manufacturer-approved scanning and calibration tools and are offering mobile services, dispatching workers in high tech-brimming vans to local repair shops.
Jeff Evanson, the chief operating officer of Smart Express and former vice president of global investor relations at Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), said he was convinced aftermarket tools and components would not live up to the safety requirements in an increasingly self-driving industry.
""While the auto industry has not thought through the problem it's created, the complexity of these systems and the risks of hacking mean automakers have to lock down the repair information to make sure vehicles stay safe and secure,"" he added."
832,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 07:07AM ET</span>",California fire threatens PG&E's plan to raise $14 billion,"By Jim Christie
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A wildfire raging in California threatens to destroy more than homes and businesses - it could also undermine bankrupt PG&E Corp's (N:PCG) plan to raise $14 billion to finance the crisis-stricken utility's turnaround plan.
If the fire becomes large enough, investors could walk away from their commitment to finance the California power utility's bankruptcy plan. That would put in doubt the company's plan to provide up to $8.4 billion to victims of past fires blamed on the company's equipment.
In Sonoma County north of San Francisco, the Kincade Fire has burned more than 75,000 acres in PG&E's service area since breaking out on Oct. 23, forcing evacuation orders for some 180,000 people.
The fire has destroyed 124 structures and more than 90,000 are threatened amid strong winds and dry weather, according to CalFire, California's fire-fighting agency.
The number of structures destroyed is key to PG&E's bankruptcy exit plan. Any fire this year caused by PG&E that destroys more than 500 homes or commercial structures would trigger a clause in the financing agreement that would allow investors to back out. The agreement has a similar termination clause for next year.
PG&E said in court filings last week it has agreements to sell $14 billion of stock to affiliates of investment firms such as Abrams Capital Management LP, Knighthead Capital Management LLC and Soros Fund Management.
The cause of the Kincade Fire has not been determined. But it ignited near a broken wire on a PG&E transmission tower, raising concerns that the company's equipment may again be to blame for a massive wildfire.
The San Francisco-based power producer in January filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection anticipating its liabilities from massive wildfires in 2017 and 2018 blamed on its equipment could top $30 billion.
One of the blazes, November's Camp Fire, leveled the town of Paradise and destroyed more than 14,000 structures in the deadliest and most destructive in California's modern history.
PG&E's main priority in its bankruptcy is paying thousands of wildfire victims, which it expects to do with $34 billion in debt financing and its $14 billion in equity commitments.
Wildfire victims have rejected PG&E's plan and back a competing proposal by a group of the company's bondholders.
Several investment firms that have committed to buy PG&E stock declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.
A principal at one firm, however, said the firms are standing by their commitments, noting they could simply choose to waive the termination clause even if the number of structures destroyed by the Kincade Fire tops 500.
Losses from the blaze so far appear small and a determination on its cause could be some time off, he added.
It took state investigators over a year to determine that PG&E was not at fault for October 2017's Tubbs Fire, which struck Santa Rosa, California, and was the state's most destructive wildfire until the Camp Fire.
PG&E spokesman James Noonan said the company and state authorities are only beginning to investigate what triggered the Kincade Fire.
""It's too soon for us to be talking about an event for which there is no official cause,"" he added.
Shares of PG&E Corp closed up more than 32 percent at $5.03 after a sharp selloff in recent days triggered by the Kincade Fire."

839,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 06:30AM ET</span>",Fly Emerson Air: How a U.S. company deploys its seven corporate jets,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Tim McLaughlin
BOSTON (Reuters) - As Tiger Woods staged his dramatic comeback at Augusta National Golf Club earlier this year, most of Emerson (NYSE:EMR) Electric Co's fleet of luxury corporate jets swooped in.
Its planes arrived at Georgia's Augusta Regional Airport from all over the United States, flying in from Austin, Dallas, Houston, New Orleans, New York and the industrial conglomerate’s hometown of St. Louis, according to U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records. By the time Woods sealed his fifth Masters victory on April 14, Emerson pilots had landed 13 times at the airport during the four-day tournament.
Emerson, which is in the vital but unglamorous business of making products such as measurement and control systems used by manufacturing companies, is now taking heat over its ownership of eight aircraft. The fleet consists of seven jets and one helicopter, according to St. Louis County Assessor records.
Hedge fund D.E. Shaw, which owns more than 1% of the company, earlier this month wrote to Emerson's board and spotlighted the ""great expense to shareholders"" of its corporate jets, seeing them as emblematic of a ""bloated structure and expense base."" The fund is agitating for big changes at Emerson, including splitting it in two, and is seeking support from other shareholders. 
Its case is that Emerson's stock has lagged badly, partly because of elevated costs. Its shares rose 12% in the past five years, a period in which the S&P 500 gained 53%. In the three fiscal years ending in 2016 to 2018, Emerson's selling, general and administrative expenses surged 23% but its net sales rose only 20%. 
Soon after D.E. Shaw's campaign became public in a Reuters story on Sept. 27, Emerson announced a review of its operations. Aviation costs will be part of that. 
The company, which employed 87,500 people in 2018, declined to answer Reuters' questions about its aircraft. A spokeswoman declined to say who was ferried to Augusta and other destinations, and whether people were being taken to the tournament or were traveling for some other reason. Emerson has a South Carolina facility near Augusta. 
The size of the fleet and the number of times Emerson's Chief Executive David Farr uses the planes for personal trips is out of step with most major U.S. companies. Some others have sold their jets, and those retaining them have smaller fleets than Emerson, National Business Aviation Association data show.
A Reuters analysis of FAA records shows that Emerson’s planes have made 260 flights in the past 90 days. This month alone, the jets were tracked in Alaska, California, China and New York. There also have been recent trips to Boston, Minneapolis, New Delhi, Japan and Washington, D.C.
The intensity of the flying, and other details about how Emerson's aviation arm operates, have not been previously reported. The information is gathered from flight and local authority records as well as from interviews with former staff at the operation. 
SECURITY ARGUMENT
Certainly Emerson executives do need to travel as the company has more than 200 manufacturing sites and more than half its sales are abroad, but it is the way they do it that has sparked questions among investors.
In its annual proxy statement, Emerson says it requires Farr to use the company's aircraft for all his travel, including personal trips, ""to promote business efficiency and safety.""
This reasoning is challenged by corporate governance expert Jonathan Macey, a Yale Law School professor. Given tight security at most airports that argument ""is just balderdash,"" he said.
Private aviation business experts counter that security is an issue not just for the executive but for the things they may be working on or discussing while traveling. On a private plane “they don’t have to worry about anyone listening in on their business dealings,” said SherpaReport’s Nick Copley, who analyses the private aviation industry. 
DOG ON HIS LAP
Luxury jet flying can be a family affair for the CEO.
Photographs posted on the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page of his son Andrew in August 2007 show Farr flying with a small brown dog on his lap. His son and a handful of his son's friends, teenagers at the time, are pictured sitting in a jet's plush chairs eating pastries.
In the fiscal year to September 2018, Emerson estimated Farr's personal jet travel cost it $369,000, according to a filing. It said he reimburses the company for personal trips based on first-class ticket prices, but Emerson does not disclose how much he pays.
The cost was higher than for CEOs at many other manufacturing companies. Michael Roman, the CEO of 3M (NYSE:MMM) Co, whose sales are almost double Emerson's, cost his company $56,743 in personal aircraft use last year.
The fanciest jet in Emerson's fleet is a 2013 Dassault Falcon 7X, which it bought last year for an undisclosed sum. The price tag for the plane, which seats up to 16 and can be equipped with an on-board shower, would be between $25 million and $30 million, according to SherpaReport.com.
Emerson employs enough staff to run a small airline, including pilots, schedulers, hangar security, and at least one summer intern, according to former employees and LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) pages of current employees. Annual costs for operating the fleet are estimated to be $20 million to $25 million, according to Liberty Jet Management’s expense calculator. That excludes costs of buying the planes. 
The Augusta trips alone would likely have cost $120,000, Copley estimates.
Expenses include $61,122 Emerson paid in real estate taxes for its hangar, and property taxes of $112,000 for the jets, local tax records show. 
COUNTRY RETREAT 
Both Emerson's St. Louis headquarters and its corporate retreat some 40 miles (64 km) away in Winfield, Missouri, have helipads.
Photographs posted by Emerson pilots on Facebook show the company's Bell 412 helicopter, identifiable by its tail number, at Winfield. The retreat has a conference center, a tennis court and swimming pool on more than 400 acres, according to the county assessor and real estate records. 
Emerson's ties to Augusta, the exclusive golf club, date back to Farr’s predecessor, Charles Knight, who was one of only about 300 members.
Farr is an avid golfer. He told Forbes in March he had ""dragged everyone from my wife to friends and Emerson colleagues for a round,"" in the United States, Ireland and Scotland. Neither Emerson nor the club would comment on whether he belongs to Augusta.
The corporate jet's heyday was in the 1980s when tobacco-to-food conglomerate RJR Nabisco had 10. The book ""Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall Of RJR Nabisco"" details how one jet was flown across the United States with the CEO's dog as the key passenger.
By 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, attitudes were very different. CEOs of U.S. auto companies were criticized by lawmakers for traveling by corporate jet when they were seeking a bailout from the government.
Even St. Louis beer maker Anheuser-Busch, whose fleet once matched Emerson's, now owns only one jet and one helicopter after the company was acquired by Belgium-based InBev. 
Charlie Horton, who worked at Emerson as a flight department maintenance supervisor more than 20 years ago, said Emerson and Anheuser once competed to see who had the best-looking fleet in St. Louis. 

""I'd have to say they are the best-maintained aircraft in aviation,"" Horton said of the Emerson fleet. ""It's almost like a scheduled airline.""

840,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 06:30AM ET</span>","Aramco IPO will come soon, Saudi crown prince to decide: energy minister","By Rania El Gamal and David Lawder
RIYADH (Reuters) - The initial public offering (IPO) for state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco will come soon, and will be a decision taken by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's energy minister said on Wednesday.
Aramco aims to announce the start of its IPO on Nov. 3, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday, after delaying the deal earlier this month to give advisers time to secure cornerstone investors.
""It is going to come soon ... but it will come at the right time with the right approach and definitely with the right decision,"" the minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, said in a speech at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh.
""And it will be a Saudi decision first and foremost,"" he said. ""Specifically, Prince Mohammed's decision."" 
The prospect of Aramco selling a piece of itself has had Wall Street on tenterhooks since Prince Mohammed first flagged it three years ago.
Aramco is looking to float a 1% to 2% stake on the kingdom’s Tadawul market, in what would be one of the largest ever public offerings, worth upwards of $20 billion.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday Aramco's IPO would be a ""great opportunity"" for developing Saudi Arabia's capital markets.
The much-anticipated stock market listing was delayed earlier this month after deal advisers said they needed more time to lock in cornerstone investors, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters last week.
Talks have taken place with Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Singapore’s GIC and other funds, sources have told Reuters.
Anchor, or cornerstone, investors such as sovereign wealth funds are considered key to secure demand. In 2016, state-owned Postal Savings Bank of China sold 77% of its $7.4 billion IPO to such backers.
In Oslo on Wednesday, the chief executive of Norway’s $1.1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, said the fund did not plan to invest in Aramco's IPO.
""Saudi Arabia is not part of our reference index,"" Yngve Slyngstad told a news conference.
The Norwegian fund has some smaller investments in Saudi companies through an emerging-markets portfolio, but a major company such as Aramco would not be a natural part of this, Slyngstad added.
Russia's sovereign wealth fund will not make a huge investment in Aramco's IPO as it is quite exposed to oil, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, Kirill Dmitriev, told Reuters on Wednesday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) Chief Executive Rex Tillerson is expected to take the stand on Wednesday in a closely watched civil lawsuit accusing the company of hiding the true cost of climate change from investors. 
The case in Manhattan state court, which kicked off last week, is the first of several lawsuits pending against major oil companies related to climate change to go to trial.
The lawsuit, brought by New York's attorney general, alleges that Exxon falsely told investors it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business using a “proxy cost” of up to $80 per ton of carbon emissions, but internally used figures as low as $40 per ton or none at all.
It says Exxon caused investors to lose up to $1.6 billion.
Exxon has assailed the claims as false and politically motivated.
In his opening statement, Theodore Wells, a lawyer for the company, said that after Tillerson became chief executive in 2006, the company put in place a “robust system” to manage the risk of increasing climate change. Tillerson served as Exxon CEO from 2006 to 2017, and U.S. secretary of state under President Donald Trump from 2017 to 2018.
Wells said the $80 per ton proxy cost represented a ""global,"" ""macro-level"" assessment of the cost, while lower figures, known as greenhouse gas or GHG costs, were used for particular capital projects depending on circumstances. He said Exxon never told investors the two numbers were the same.
Last Thursday, just two days after the New York trial began, Massachusetts filed a similar lawsuit accusing Exxon of misleading investors and consumers for decades about the role fossil fuels play in climate change.
Both Massachusetts and New York began investigating Exxon after news reports in 2015 saying that its own scientists had determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change.
Those reports, by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times, were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon said the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions.
Exxon and other oil companies including  BP  (LON:BP) Plc,  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc face lawsuits by cities and counties across the United States seeking funds to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels brought on by climate change.

The companies have said in court filings that they cannot be held liable for climate change.

843,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 06:22AM ET</span>",U.S. lawmakers will press Boeing CEO on Day 2 of testimony,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg will face a second day of questions Wednesday from U.S. lawmakers on its now grounded 737 MAX after sharp criticism at a Senate hearing Tuesday.
U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, who heads the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee that will hear from Muilenburg on Wednesday, said in a written statement that the committee's lengthy investigation into the MAX has turned up significant questions about Boeing's decision-making.
""Something went drastically wrong, a total of 346 people died, and we have a duty to fix it,"" DeFazio will say in his opening statement.
DeFazio said the panel is aware of ""at least one case where a Boeing manager implored the then-Vice President and General Manager of the 737 program to shut down the 737 MAX production line because of safety concerns."" Boeing did not comment Tuesday on the allegation.
Muilenburg on Tuesday acknowledged errors in failing to give pilots more information on a key safety system known as MCAS before the crashes, as well as for taking months to disclose that it had made optional an alarm that alerts pilots to a mismatch of flight data on the 737 MAX.
""We've made mistakes and we got some things wrong. We're improving and we're learning,"" he said.
The hearing, the highest-profile congressional scrutiny of commercial aviation safety in years, heaps pressure on a newly rejiggered Boeing senior management team fighting to repair trust with airline customers and passengers shaken by an eight-month safety ban on its 737 MAX following the crashes, which killed 346 people.
""You have told me half-truths over and over again,"" Senator Tammy Duckworth told Muilenburg, questioning why the manufacturer did not disclose more details about MCAS's lack of safeguards.
Taking turns to grill Muilenburg during his first appearance at a hearing on Capitol Hill in the year since the first crash in Indonesia, senators suggested Boeing had not been completely honest and expressed dismay that the 2016 instant messages did not prompt an immediate reaction from the company.
For months, Boeing had largely failed to acknowledge blame, instead vowing to make a ""safe plane safer."" Tuesday's hearing represents Boeing's broadest acceptance of responsibility that it made mistakes but Muilenburg stopped short of what some lawmakers and family members had sought.
Family members were seated just three rows behind Muilenburg during his testimony and were invited at one point to stand and show large photos of their loved ones.
Nadia Milleron, whose daughter was killed in the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March, said Muilenburg and the board should resign for failing to do more to prevent the crashes.
As Muilenburg departed the hearing, she implored him to look at the victims' families when he apologized. He turned to her and said: ""I'm sorry."""

The multinational investment bank wants to reduce the number of platforms used to connect with customers to 15 from 45 by the first quarter of 2020, the newspaper said. Citigroup has sent a survey to all the providers, the FT said.

Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. are the two biggest foreign-exchange traders by market share due to their technology and client networks, according to a 2018 study by Greenwich Associates.

SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies captured a record 42% of China's smartphone market in the third quarter as local consumers rallied behind it after U.S. sanctions, leaving Apple (O:AAPL) to languish towards the bottom of the pile, market data showed.
Apple's market share in China slipped to 5% from 7% in the year-ago quarter, according to a report that market research firm Canalys released on Wednesday, hours before the Cupertino, California-based company was to report quarterly results.
The July-September quarter marked the iPhone's weakest sales in China in five years, said Nicole Peng, vice president of mobility at Canalys, with shipments likely down more than a quarter.
Concerns about slowing iPhone sales in China have dogged Apple for many quarters even as the global smartphone market has slowed and a resurgent Huawei has hit record sales in the country.
Huawei, the world's No. 2 maker of smartphones, was all but banned by the United States in May from doing business with American companies, significantly disrupting its ability to source key parts.
The company was then granted a reprieve until November but the blacklisting pushed up patriotic purchases of its smartphones in China, helping it more than offset a shipments slump in the global market.
With the expected rollout of the super-fast 5G network in China in coming months, Huawei's advantage is expected to grow further.
""Huawei is in a strong position to consolidate its dominance further amid 5G network rollout, given its tight operator relationships in 5G network deployment, and control over key components such as local network compatible 5G chipsets,"" Peng said.
""This puts significant pressure on Oppo, Vivo and  Xiaomi , which find it very hard to make any breakthrough.""
Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi (HK:1810) and Apple together accounted for 50% of the market in the third quarter, down from 64% a year earlier.
Huawei said last week it had sold more than 200 million phones globally in 2019, 64 days earlier than in 2018. The company's profits have remained resilient and revenue jumped 27% in the third quarter.
The Chinese smartphone market contracted by 3% in the third quarter, and Huawei smartphones made up 41.5 million of the 97.8 million shipped in the period, Canalys said.
Apple and Xiaomi did not have an immediate comment on the Canalys data. Huawei and Oppo declined to comment, while Vivo said it does not comment on third-party reports.
IPHONE 11 HOPES
Apple launched its latest iPhone 11 range in China in September to tepid responses on social media, but shoppers have warmed to the model's additional cameras and cheaper pricing.
""Apple is more prepared than previous years to face strong headwinds in China,"" said Canalys analyst Louis Liu, noting the iPhone 11's camera improvements and lower launch price ""were critical market stimuli"".
The company's quarterly results likely received a boost from the launch and accounted for 40% of its shipments, with customers willing to wait two to three weeks to receive shipments of the newer models, Peng said.
""But it faces a looming challenge, as Chinese vendors and operators are set to drive heavy marketing and promotions around 5G in the next two quarters,"" Liu added. ""This could steal its thunder.""

The U.S. tech giant is expected to report flat revenue and a dip in earnings in the September quarter, based on Refinitiv data.

The positive result mirrors that of British rival  BP  (LON:BP) Plc, which also used a strong refining performance to offset weaker crude prices caused by the U.S.-China trade war and a flood of American shale output.
“The group continues to achieve solid results” despite weaker prices, Total Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said in a statement on Wednesday. The company is accelerating dividend growth and is on track to buy back $1.75 billion of its shares this year, he said.
Reaping Rewards
Adjusted net income fell 24% from a year earlier to $3.02 billion, said the company based near Paris. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had forecast $2.77 billion on average.
Total is reaping the rewards of growth from new projects and acquisitions, while also shedding barrels with higher production costs through asset sales. The company said it has reduced the price at which it can cover spending, excluding dividends, from cash flow to less than $25 a barrel, well below current international prices of about $60. Cost cuts will exceed $500 million in 2019.
Operating cash flow before working capital changes, a measure of oil majors’ ability to keep paying generous dividends and investing in growth, proved resilient. It fell just 3% in the third quarter to $6.85 billion.
Like its peers, Total is under pressure from investors to boost returns. BP shares fell 3.8% on Tuesday despite earnings that beat estimates, as investors’ hopes of a dividend increase this year were dashed.
As announced in September, Total’s interim dividend for the third quarter will rise by 6% year on year to 68 euro cents. It plans to boost its payout by 5% to 6% annually in the coming years, up from a previous plan for 3% growth.
New Projects
Oil and gas production climbed 8.4% from a year earlier to 3.04 million barrels equivalent a day. Thanks to project startups in the U.K. North Sea, Norway and Brazil, output is on track to grow by 9% for the full year, the company said.
Sales of liquefied natural gas grew 20% in the quarter to 7.4 million tons, helped by the ramp-up of projects in Australia and Russia, and the start of the first liquefaction plant at Cameron LNG in the U.S. Cash flow from Total’s integrated gas, renewables and power segment jumped by 53% to $848 million.
The downstream division benefited from better petrochemicals margins in Europe and rising sales of gasoline and other petroleum products. The unit generated almost $2 billion of cash flow in the third quarter, up 14% from a year earlier, and is “well positioned” to generate close to $7 billion of cash flow this year, the company said."

(Reuters) - European shares inched lower on Wednesday as weak bank earnings and doubts over an interim U.S.-China trade deal spurred selling, although losses were limited by excitement over merger talks between  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and France's PSA (PA:PEUP).
By 0930 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was down just 0.1%, with banks (SX7P) leading losses after disappointing results from some of the region's top lenders.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) fell 6%, putting it at the bottom of the benchmark index, as it reported a loss for the second consecutive quarter due to the costs of its wide-ranging global restructuring.
""The losses were massive, so it's no surprise that investors aren't too happy,"" said Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex. ""Even though the CFO's tried to say that earnings are a little bit better than in the interim planning, it's enough to spook investors.""
The euro zone's biggest lender, Santander, (MC:SAN) slid 2% as net profit fell 75% due to one-off charges in the UK, while Swiss lender  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) lost over 3% after issuing a cautious 2020 outlook.
Expectations had been low going into the European corporate earnings season, and after three weeks the overall picture has proved better than expected, with most companies modestly beating estimates.
Trade-sensitive tech (SX8P) and commodity-linked stocks (SXPP) took a hit on Wednesday as concerns over the U.S.-China trade pact resurfaced after a U.S. administration official told Reuters the deal might not be completed in time for the leaders of the two countries to sign in Chile next month.
MERGER TALKS DRIVE AUTOS
Auto stocks (SXAP) hit their highest level in nearly six months after Italian-American carmaker Fiat Chrysler (MI:FCHA) confirmed it was in merger talks with French rival PSA (PA:PEUP) on a deal that would reshape the global industry.
Shares of both companies rose between 7% and 8%, with  Peugeot  hitting an 11-year high. Shares in another French carmaker,  Renault  (PA:RENA), which was in talks with Fiat earlier this year about a similar deal, slid 3.5%.
""The deal is geographically complementarily given FCA's strong hold in North America and PSA's footing in Asia and (the) rest of the world,"" Martino De Ambroggi, senior equities analyst at Equita, wrote in a note.
Oslo-listed stocks (OSEAX) got a boost from a near 2% rise in the world's largest fish farming company Mowi (OL:MOWI) which plans to increase its production by 4.7% in 2020.
All eyes will move later in the day to the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest announcement on interest rates, widely expected to cut borrowing costs for the third time this year and offer more signals on the path ahead."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Bayer (DE:BAYGn) is now facing 42,700 U.S. plaintiffs blaming its glyphosate-based weedkillers for their cancer, more than twice the tally in July, raising the stakes in the group's efforts to reach a settlement.
""This significant increase is clearly driven by the plaintiff-side television advertising spend which is estimated to have roughly doubled in the third quarter compared with the entire first half of the year,"" Bayer, which last year acquired  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) for $63 billion, said as it reported third-quarter profit grew in line with expectations.
""The number of lawsuits says nothing about their merits,"" it said, adding the company was still constructively engaged in a mediation process ordered by a federal judge.
Bayer, the inventor of aspirin and owner of Yasmin birth control and Claritin allergy relief brands, is widely expected to eventually buy itself out of the litigation wave, with analysts estimating the size of a future settlement at $8-$12 billion.
Many of them, however, see a knock-down share price reflecting market expectations for the lawsuits to cost as much as $20 billion. 
The stock has lost about 30% in value since last August, when a California jury in the first such lawsuit found Monsanto should have warned of the alleged cancer risks associated with its glyphosate-based weedkillers such as Roundup.
Bayer shares were up 0.8% at market open at 0800 GMT. The German group had earlier this month prepared investors for a surge in cases, saying the prospect of a settlement was fanning mass tort lawyers' efforts to recruit plaintiffs.
Bayer, which says regulators and extensive research have found glyphosate to be safe, is banking on U.S. appeals courts to reverse or tone down the first three court rulings that have so far awarded tens of millions of dollars to each plaintiff.
Third-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the group rose 7.5% to 2.3 billion euros ($2.6 billion), in line with market expectations. They were helped by higher sales of crop protection chemicals, seeds and consumer healthcare products. 
It said its new 2019 guidance confirmed its previous one, except for stripping out its animal health division and a stake in chemical park operator Currenta being divested, as well as a currency burden of about 100 million euros.

The drugs and pesticides maker is now expecting 11.5 billion euros in full-year EBITDA before special items, down from 12.2 billion euros estimated in July.

850,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 05:24AM ET</span>","StockBeat: PSA, Fiat Surge on Merger Talks; Renault Cold-Shouldered","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Confirmation of merger talks between   Peugeot   parent PSA Group (PA:PEUP) and   Fiat   Chrysler (MI:FCHA) sent both stocks skyrocketing on Wednesday, while Renault's (PA:RENA) made fresh losses on fears that it stands most to lose from any such combination.
By 5:15 AM ET (0900 GMT), FCA shares were up 8.6% in Milan, mirroring their rise in after-hours trading in New York on Tuesday. PSA was up over 6.3%, hitting a new 11-year high of 27.06 euros.
By contrast,   Renault   (PA:RENA) skidded another 3.3% to its lowest in six and a half years, amid a mounting sense of crisis at its strategic drift since its bust-up with Nissan over the fate of former chairman Carlos Ghosn. Fiat had dropped an approach to Renault earlier this year, grumbling about the degree of political interference from the French government.
 Renault  (PA:RENA), which was forced to slash its guidance earlier this month after ousting its CEO Thierry Bollore, has every reason to be afraid. The move would create Europe’s second-largest automotive group, behind Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), with considerably improved pricing power vis-à-vis both suppliers and customers. And PSA, which did something that proved beyond General Motors (NYSE:GM) for nearly 20 years by making Opel profitable, has proved it can execute big, complex deals successfully (even if it has had a minor disaster in China, where it has had to slash and burn its joint venture with Dongfeng to stem losses).
The need for action could hardly be more pressing. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said on Wednesday that it expects auto markets “in many regions of the world” to shrink more than previously expected this year. VW now expects deliveries to be flat this year instead of rising slightly, but it nonetheless upheld its forecasts for a revenue increase of up to 5% and an underlying operating margin of between 6.5% and 7.5%.
VW, the world’s largest automotive group has the scale to live with a large new competitor. The same can’t be said for  Renault  (PA:RENA), which would produce only half as many units a year as a combined FCA-PSA.
The strength of VW’s numbers was reflected in a 0.7% rise in its shares on Wednesday, despite the prospect of beefed-up competition on its European doorstep. That’s on a day when most of Europe’s bourses were in the red after some disappointing earnings. Losses were led, not for the first time, by   Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn), which fell 6.3% after reporting a larger-than-expected quarterly loss on restructuring charges and a poor trading result. Cosmetics group L’Oreal (PA:OREP) was the honorable exception, posting stellar results as its long-standing investments in Asia continued to reap dividends.
L’Oreal and PSA made the French CAC 40 the best performing of the major markets, with a 0.1% gain by 5:15 AM ET (0915 GMT). The U.K. FTSE 100 and DAX were down 0.2%, while the benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 0.1%."

SYDNEY/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) and Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) are stepping up checks for structural cracks on  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 NGs after discovering problems with planes that did not require urgent inspections, airline sources said.
The cracks are on what is known as the ""pickle fork"" - a part that attaches the plane's fuselage, or body, to the wing structure.
Repairing the cracks requires grounding the airplane, with remedial work costing an estimated $275,000 per aircraft, according to aviation consultancy IBA.
Boeing on Oct. 11 said 38 planes worldwide had been grounded after urgent checks but has not provided a further update. The issue surfaced while the newer 737 MAX model is grounded globally following two deadly crashes.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Oct. 2 mandated checks of 737 NGs with more than 30,000 take-off and landing cycles within seven days.
It said jets with 22,600 to 29,999 cycles must be inspected within 1,000 cycles, which typically correspond to the number of flights. 
Qantas discovered cracks in a plane with about 26,700 cycles that was undergoing heavy maintenance, while Southwest found cracks in one with about 28,500 cycles, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
A Qantas spokesman said the airline had found cracking in one jet with just under 27,000 cycles that had been removed from service for repair. 
He said that no Qantas jets had yet reached 30,000 cycles, but that the airline would inspect 33 planes with more than 22,600 cycles by the end of this week.
A Southwest spokesman said he could not confirm the number of cycles of the three jets the airline has pulled from service for pickle fork repairs. He said the company has complied with the FAA directive on inspections but was expanding checks to its entire 737 NG fleet.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, Boeing said all 737 NGs with more than 30,000 flight cycles and about one-third of planes with over 22,600 flight cycles had been inspected for pickle fork cracks.
The manufacturer said additional assessments were underway to determine the cause and potential implications for planes with fewer than 22,600 cycles.
""Depending on the results of these assessments, additional inspections or repairs may be required,"" Boeing said.
It said that so far the repair costs were not big enough to affect its bottom line. But the company added that it could not estimate potential future financial impacts because since the inspections were ongoing. 
A Boeing spokesman on Wednesday said he could not provide a further update.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines, whose 737 NG fleets have less than 30,000 cycles, are also inspecting their entire fleets but have not found any pickle fork issues so far, representatives for both airlines said. 
Virgin Australia said it had already inspected all 19 of its 737 NGs with more than 22,600 cycles and did not find any cracks.

South Korea's transport ministry said all nine 737 NGs grounded in the country with cracks had more than 30,000 cycles.

  BP   (LON:BP) PLC tried to repair the damage done by chief financial officer Brian Gilvary on Tuesday's conference call when he said it was unlikely that the company would raise its dividend this year.
""No decision has yet been made with respect to the 4Q 2019 or any future dividend. Any decisions with respect to future dividends will be made by the Board of  BP  (LON:BP) p.l.c. following the end of each quarter,"" the company said in a brief statement.
 BP  (LON:BP) had announced an unchanged dividend of 10.25c a share for the quarter. The shares now yield an annualized 6.29%. 


  Next   (LON:NXT) said sales and profit growth slowed in the three months to Oct. 26 after a summery September stopped people buying its new autumn collection. Sales perked up as soon as temperatures fell in October, but the rest of the year is unlikely to be as strong as the last month, it said.

Full-price sales rose 1.6% on the year, with store sales falling 6.3% and online sales rising 9.7%.
The company maintained its guidance for the full year of a 5.2% increase in earnings per share and a 3.6% increase in full-price sales.

  Standard Chartered   (LON:STAN) reported third-quarter underlying profit before tax rose 16% to $1.2 billion, slightly ahead of expectations of $1.1 billion. 
Revenue rose 8% in currency-adjusted terms to $4.0 billion, while costs rose 1% to $2.5 billion and net interest margins were flat at 1.58%, defying the squeeze reported by most big banks from falling long-term rates in the quarter.
The bank repeated its aim of reaching a 10% return on tangible equity in 2021, but warned of ""growing headwinds from the combination of continuing geopolitical tensions and expectations of declining near-term global growth and interest rates."" RoTE in the third quarter rose 160 basis points to 8.9%.

Packaging group Smurfit Kappa (LON:SKG) indicated revenue and underlying profit growth slowed in the third quarter. Revenue for the first nine-months of the year grew 3% to 6.85 billion euros ($7.60 billion), down from a 4% increase in the first half. 

 Severn Trent  (LON:SVT) said it has appointed Capgemini's Christine Hodgson to succeed current chairman Andrew Duff in April 2020. She'll join as an independent non-executive director on Jan. 1.

Nine-month adjusted operating profit rose to 14.8 billion euros, up from 13.3 billion euros, the carmaker said on Wednesday.
VW said a slowdown in global demand would result in 2019 Volkswagen Group vehicle deliveries being in line with year-earlier figures, adjusting its earlier forecast, according to which they would rise slightly.
""Despite the gain in market share, the Volkswagen Group anticipates that vehicle markets will contract faster than previously anticipated in many regions of the world,"" the carmaker said.
Earlier this week Ford cut its forecast for operating profit, blaming a slowdown in demand in China and other headwinds.
A rise in demand for higher-margin Tiguan and Touareg models helped to offset an overall drop in sales of the VW brand, while Porsche and Skoda saw deliveries jump 8% and 15.3% respectively.

Volkswagen said special items from legal risks, caused by its 2015 diesel emissions cheating scandal, had fallen to 1.3 billion euros from 2.4 billion euros in the year-earlier period.

The 108% net profit rise put earnings ahead of expectations in the bank's own consensus forecast for 751 million francs. 
""We have continued, in a challenging environment, to grow our wealth management franchises, increasing our revenues and gathering record net new assets of 72 billion Swiss francs across the Group year to date,"" Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam said in a statement.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank said it expected geopolitical challenges, particularly the US-China trade dispute and Brexit, to lead to more cautious capital expenditure and investment decisions in 2020 and 2021, but said the long-term outlook remained attractive in wealth management.
Thiam is due later on Wednesday to speak publicly to journalists for the first time since being cleared early this month of spying into former wealth management executive Iqbal Khan, an incident which shook up Swiss banking, costing one of his close allies a job and exposing bitter enmities between the CEO and his former employee Khan. 
Its return on tangible equity--a key profitability metric--stood at 9%. The group aims to reach a 10-11% return this year but in July stressed this represented more of an ambition than a target, based on flat revenues and thus linked to market conditions.
It made a 327 million franc revenue gain from combining InvestLab with Spain-based funds solutions provider Allfunds Group. Factoring out the transfer, pre-tax income rose 21%.

Europe's largest aerospace group expects to deliver ""around 860"" airliners in 2019 instead of the 880-890 previously targeted, the company said as it posted 1.6 billion euros ($1.78 billion) in adjusted operating income for the third quarter.
The revised delivery numbers and outlook ""reflect the underlying actions to secure a more efficient delivery flow in the next years"", Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said in the company statement.
The adjusted operating profit figure rose 2% year-on-year as revenue fell 1% to 15.3 billion euros for July-September and net income rose 3% to 989 million euros. The group also trimmed its 2019 free cash flow goal to reflect the revised delivery outlook.

To reach its revised 2019 goal, Airbus must still hand over 289 planes in the final quarter, a little short of its record 297 deliveries in the same period last year."

“I don’t think we should fear a hawkish cut, but I do think one of the things to keep in mind, relative to the prior cut periods, is the Fed starting from a much lower rate so there is a lot less room for the Fed to continue to cut,” Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer at Abbot Downing Investment Advisors, told Bloomberg in an interview. “But we are pretty constructive - cautious but constructive on markets.”
A first reading on third-quarter U.S. economic growth, due out ahead of the Fed decision, was also expected to be scrutinized for clues on the monetary policy outlook."

The South Korean tech giant teased https://youtu.be/AZDl_SP-w9E the new concept on Tuesday at the Samsung Developer Conference 2019 in the United States.
""The amazing thing with the foldable technology is that it can also become more compact like this,"" said Sally Hyesoon Jeong, head of Framework R&D Group at Samsung's mobile communications, showing the mock-up on a screen behind her.
""Incredible, right?"" Jeong said, followed by applause from the floor.
The world's largest smartphone maker is powering ahead with the launch of 5G phones and $2,000 foldable handsets as it battles rivals Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd in an increasingly saturated market.
Its new design enables the device to fold in half horizontally.
""This brand new form factor we are now exploring not only easily fits in your pocket but it also changes the way you use the phone,"" Jeong said.
China's Huawei started taking orders last week in China for its eagerly awaited foldable smartphone, hoping to make up for weak overseas sales amid U.S. trade sanctions.
Samsung did not provide details about when the square-folding phone would be launched.
""While we can't comment on future products, Samsung is committed to pioneering the foldable category, including investing in the development of new form factors,"" Samsung said in a statement to Reuters."

864,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 09:18PM ET</span>",WhatsApp sues Israel's NSO for allegedly helping spies hack phones around the world,"By Raphael Satter and Elizabeth Culliford
WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - WhatsApp sued Israeli surveillance firm NSO Group on Tuesday, accusing it of helping government spies break into the phones of roughly 1,400 users across four continents in a hacking spree whose targets included diplomats, political dissidents, journalists and senior government officials.
In a lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco, messaging service WhatsApp, which is owned by  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), accused NSO of facilitating government hacking sprees in 20 countries. Mexico, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were the only countries identified.
WhatsApp said in a statement that 100 civil society members had been targeted, and called it “an unmistakable pattern of abuse.”
NSO denied the allegations.
""In the strongest possible terms, we dispute today’s allegations and will vigorously fight them,"" NSO said in a statement. ""The sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime.""
WhatsApp said the attack exploited its video calling system in order to send malware to the mobile devices of a number of users. The malware would allow NSO's clients - said to be governments and intelligence organizations - to secretly spy on a phone's owner, opening their digital lives up to official scrutiny.
WhatsApp is used by some 1.5 billion people monthly and has often touted a high level of security, including end-to-end encrypted messages that cannot be deciphered by WhatsApp or other third parties.
Citizen Lab, a cybersecurity research laboratory based at the University of Toronto that worked with WhatsApp to investigate the phone hacking, told Reuters that the targets included well-known television personalities, prominent women who had been subjected to online hate campaigns and people who had faced “assassination attempts and threats of violence.”
Neither Citizen Lab nor WhatsApp identified the targets by name.
Governments have increasingly turned to sophisticated hacking software as officials seek to push their surveillance power into the furthest corners of their citizens' digital lives.
Companies like NSO say their technology enables officials to circumvent the encryption that increasingly protects the data held on phones and other devices. But governments only rarely talk about their capabilities publicly, meaning that the digital intrusions like the ones that affected WhatsApp typically happen in the shadows.
UNPRECEDENTED MOVE
Lawyer Scott Watnik called WhatsApp's move ""entirely unprecedented,"" explaining that major service providers tended to shy away from litigation for fear of ""opening up the hood"" and revealing too much about their digital security. He said other firms would be watching the progress of the suit with interest. 
""It could certainly set a precedent,"" said Watnik, who chairs the cybersecurity practice at the Wilk Auslander law firm in New York.
The lawsuit seeks to have NSO barred from accessing or attempting to access WhatsApp and Facebook's services and seeks unspecified damages.
NSO’s phone hacking software has already been implicated in a series of human rights abuses across Latin America and the Middle East, including a sprawling espionage scandal in Panama and an attempt to spy on an employee of the London-based rights group Amnesty International. 
NSO came under particularly harsh scrutiny over the allegation that its spyware played a role in the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul a little over a year ago. 
Khashoggi’s friend Omar Abdulaziz is one of seven activists and journalists who have taken the spyware firm to court in Israel and Cyprus over allegations that their phones were compromised using NSO technology. Amnesty has also filed a lawsuit, demanding that the Israeli Ministry of Defense revoke NSO’s export license to ""stop it profiting from state-sponsored repression.""
NSO has recently tried to clean up its image after it was bought by London-based private equity firm Novalpina Capital earlier this year. In August, NSO co-founder Shalev Hulio appeared on ""60 Minutes"" and boasted his spyware had saved ""tens of thousands of people."" He provided no details. 

NSO has also brought on a series of high-profile advisers, including former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge and Juliette Kayyem, a senior lecturer in international security at Harvard University. Last month, NSO announced it would begin abiding by U.N. guidelines on human rights abuses.

LONDON (Reuters) - Banking in Britain paid 40 billion pounds ($52 billion) in taxes in the last financial year with half from foreign lenders, underscoring the need for a government rethink on taxes to keep London competitive after Brexit, UK Finance said on Wednesday.
Banks and their employees paid a total of 39.7 billion pounds in taxes, or 5.5% of government receipts, unchanged from the prior year, UK Finance said in a review compiled by consultants PwC (see graphic).
The tax raised was roughly split between those paid by employees, and the corporate tax, surcharge on profits and balance sheet levies paid by the lenders themselves.
The surcharge and levies were introduced after Britain had to bail out lenders with public money during the financial crisis a decade ago.
Britain's ""fiscal competitiveness"" has declined relative to other global financial centres like New York, where banks have benefited from recent cuts in corporate taxes, the review said.
Many banks operating in Britain have opened European Union hubs in cities like Frankfurt to ensure continuity of service for EU customers after Britain leaves the bloc.
Banks are moving about a trillion euros in assets from London to their new subsidiaries, which is likely to lead to a loss of some UK tax revenue.
The review estimated that the total tax rate for banks in London is 47.1%, compared with 44.7% in Frankfurt and 33.5% in New York.
""In this context, maintaining fiscal competitiveness is more important than ever,"" the review said.
""This is also vital to ensure a healthy domestic banking market which can continue to provide credit to support future growth of the UK economy."" 
UK Finance Tax Graphic: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7933/7864/UKFinancetax.png
The review also showed a fall in headcount at UK-headquartered banks due to restructuring, and customers using online and mobile banking.
While foreign-heaquartered banks hired more staff, this was due to getting ready for Brexit, implementing IT changes and mergers, and is unlikely to be indicative of the long-term trend, the review said.
The sector overall employed 342,413 people, it added.

866,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 07:51PM ET</span>","BP eyes Brazil gas buildout, may swap LNG imports for domestic output","By Gram Slattery
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) -  BP  Plc (L:BP) wants to be part of an effort to build up natural gas infrastructure in Brazil, an executive said on Tuesday, and believes a power plant it is building in Rio de Janeiro could eventually be supplied by gas from offshore oilfields here.
Speaking at Rio's Offshore Technology Conference on Tuesday, BP Regional President for Latin America Felipe Arbelaez said he believed a plant being built by a consortium of BP, Germany's  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn) and Brazil's Prumo Logistica SA could eventually be fired by offshore gas rather than imported liquefied natural gas (LNG), as plans now forecast.
""Associated gas can definitely compete with LNG in Brazil, and there is tons of associated gas,"" Arbelaez said, using a term for the gas pumped from fields that primarily produce oil.
""BP, over time, if I had to guess, will be satisfied with associated gas,"" he said.
Offshore gas is considered both a problem and opportunity in Brazil. The country is quickly ramping up oil production in offshore fields, many of which have significant gas volumes.
Traditionally, gas produced in such fields is burned off or ""re-injected"" in a process that increases crude production. But some fields coming online have too much gas for those processes to remain viable.
At the same time, there are few pipelines to bring the gas ashore and domestic consumption is weak.
The government is encouraging more gas infrastructure, and firms with gas-heavy fields, such as Norway's Equinor ASA (OL:EQNR), are looking at building pipelines and onshore terminals.
""We're convinced that there is a need for additional infrastructure to be built,"" Arbelaez said. ""We believe there is probably a need for between two to three ... gas processing corridors in the next 10 to 15 years.""
During the same panel, executives from Equinor and Portugal's  Galp Energia  SGPS SA (LS:GALP) also said they expected to be selling offshore Brazilian gas to consumers within the next two years.
""I have the certainty that Galp will be selling gas in the next two years to clients,"" said Miguel Pereira, chief executive of Petrogal, a Galp unit. ""We have to surpass some barriers but we are dealing with it."""

Maoneng will develop four large-scale batteries with a total capacity of 200MW/400MWh to be operational from 2023 to fulfil the deal.
AGL will be able to call on that supply, which is enough energy to power up to 30,000 homes, for a fixed price over the 15 years.
The deal comes as Australia struggles to cope with variable wind and solar power and ageing coal-fired plants that are often overloaded during the hot summer months, leading to widespread shutdowns and price spikes for consumers.
""Australia’s energy market is undergoing significant changes and large-scale batteries like these will be pivotal in providing firming capacity in the shift between baseload power and renewables,"" AGL Chief Executive Brett Redman said in a statement."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pension adviser Mercer has cautioned clients about Fisher Investments in the wake of off-color comments by firm founder Ken Fisher, citing concerns of a potential loss of assets and staff turnover, according to an Oct. 16 memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday.
It is the latest fallout for Fisher which has faced client outflows of $3 billion following Fisher's remarks that critics have said were sexist.
Mercer did not suggest clients terminate the firm as rival pension adviser NEPC has done, however. This stance which could help Fisher as it campaigns to keep assets.
A Fisher representative did not comment.
Mercer and NEPC are among an influential group that counsels pension plans and other institutions on which investment managers they should hire to handle assets.
In the memo Mercer, part of Marsh & McLennan Cos (N:MMC), said it has added the term ""provisional"" to its ratings of Fisher products. A Mercer spokesman said it does not comment on individual ratings.
A Florida State Board of Administration spokesman said via email that ""provisional"" means ""there is uncertainty about a rating that Mercer expects to resolve quickly.""
The board, for which Fisher manages $168 million, on Tuesday provided the Mercer research memo dated Oct. 16 in response to a public records request, and an Oct. 14 memo in which Mercer first added the provisional qualifier.
The board had previously said it was reviewing Fisher's firm in the wake of his comments at an Oct. 8 investment conference, for which he has apologized.
Mercer wrote that after a conference call with Fisher Investments' top executives, though not with Fisher himself, it would keep monitoring factors including the stability of the firm's investment teams and assets under management, or AUM, and that it could further change ratings.
""We remain mindful that concerns regarding potential AUM loss and staff turnover may take time to play out,"" Mercer wrote.
So far withdrawals at Mercer have been just a fraction of its $114 billion under management.
According to an attendee of the Oct. 8 conference, Fisher made derogatory remarks about genitalia and picking up girls, among other topics. Fisher has apologized in several forums, although he initially pushed back on some criticism.
In an Oct. 10 note to clients that Mercer's Oct. 14 memo included, Fisher apologized but rejected the idea his remarks were sexist. Fisher wrote that attention his comments received on social media ""deliberately mischaracterizes them."""
869,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 07:34PM ET</span>","In South Korea's dangerous shipyards, subcontracted workers are most at risk","By Hayoung Choi, Hyunjoo Jin and Ju-min Park
GEOJE, South Korea (Reuters) - Park Chol-hee was working the holiday shift at Samsung Heavy Industries' Geoje shipyard on Labour Day, 2017, when a giant crane collided with another and crashed to ground, killing six people, including Park's younger brother.
""It was as if a bomb was dropped,"" Park said. ""Bodies were too damaged to describe.""
Park and his brother Sung-woo were among nearly 1,500 subcontracted employees - 90% of the shipyard workforce that day - building an oil and gas platform for French energy giant Total.
All six killed and 25 workers who were injured were subcontractors, who receive lower pay, fewer employment protections and less training compared to full-time employees.
Samsung and other big Korean conglomerates acknowledge they rely increasingly heavily on subcontractors and temporary workers to cut costs and increase labor flexibility, but they bear little responsibility for workplace accidents, according to interviews with about two dozen workers, subcontractor executives and experts.
And according to a 2018 government-commissioned report, lenient sentences for companies and officials are hampering attempts to reduce occupational accidents in South Korea, which has the third worst industrial safety record among countries in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
More than two years after South Korea's worst shipyard accident in at least a decade, Park says he is suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder which worsened after a court in May ruled that no Samsung officials will serve jail time over the accident.
In an emailed response to Reuters' questions, Samsung Heavy said it regretted the casualties caused by the accident but could not elaborate further because of the appeal trial.
Samsung's email sign-offs read: ""Safety is the No.1 value in management.""
Total and Park's direct employer Haedong both declined to comment on the story. Haedong, which remains as a subcontractor for Samsung Heavy, was not prosecuted in the criminal trial, court documents showed.
South Korea's industrial accidents interactive: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/SOUTHKOREA-SAFETY/0H001QXE3909/index.html
MULTI-LAYERED SUBCONTRACTING
South Korean conglomerates like Samsung have been the backbone of the country's rapid economic transformation since the devastation of the Korean War into a global manufacturing and engineering powerhouse.
But as competition has increased and growth slowed, the groups known locally as chaebol have increased hiring of temporary and subcontracted workers to cut costs, boost production and make it easier to dismiss staff when demand fluctuates, experts and industry officials say.
Temporary workers accounted for 21.2% of all the workers in South Korea in 2018, nearly double the OECD average of 11.7%.
Workers at South Korea's subcontracted firms earned 3.4 million won ($334) per month, only 62% of what their peers at prime contractors made, the state-funded Korea Labor Institute said in a report last October.
""This is not just a problem of Samsung, but Korea Inc,"" said Lyou Sung-gyou, a labor attorney and a member of a presidential labour advisory body. ""Conglomerates take profits, but they escape legal responsibility by creating a multi-layered subcontractor structure.""
South Korea's Labour Ministry said it is ""essential"" to strengthen the responsibility of prime contractors for their subcontractors' safety measures.
""(Prime) contractors know the best harmful and risk factors at workplaces controlled or managed by them,"" the ministry said in a statement to Reuters.
The ministry added it had revised an occupational safety law to expand the scope of work sites where prime contractors are responsible for the safety of the workers.
Outsourcing is especially prevalent in South Korea's shipbuilding industry, the world's largest by order volumes last year.
Subcontractors at Korean shipbuilders accounted for less than half of the total workforce in 2000, but topped 70% in 2014-2015, according to a report by a government-sanctioned panel of experts who investigated the 2017 Samsung crane accident.
Subcontractors further outsourced their work to third-tier workers to cut costs more, which would ""inevitably increase the risks of industrial accidents"", the 2018 report said.
At Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), a major client for South Korean shipbuilders, Ju Young-kyu, a senior manager at its South Korean unit, told Reuters multi-tier subcontracting is a ""unique"" feature in South Korea's shipyards as opposed to Chinese peers which tend to outsource less.
Better management and assessment of unskilled workers was needed to reduce accidents, he added.
The use of subcontracted workers has also enabled businesses to reduce occupational accident insurance premiums.
Samsung Group, South Korea's biggest conglomerate, enjoyed discounts of nearly 400 billion won ($334 million) from 2016 to June 2019 for its occupational accident insurance premiums because of fewer accidents involving staff employers and because it was not liable for accidents involving subcontractors, two ruling party lawmakers said this year, citing internal government data.
Samsung Heavy, asked about insurance premiums and legal responsibilities, said prime contractors and subcontractors shoulder responsibility depending on legal liabilities of each accident.
Workers for subcontractors in other industries are also vulnerable.
For instance, a fire at a Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) phone parts supplier, Seil Electronics, left nine dead and several injured last year, a court ruling showed.
Samsung Electronics did not comment on the fire incident at Seil, its second-tier phone parts supplier. Seil declined to comment.

GAGGING CLAUSES
In South Korea, private settlements between companies and individuals at criminal proceedings are a key factor in leading to lighter sentences in civil workplace accident cases, according to last year's government-commissioned report.
Over 90% of offenders received suspended sentences or minor fines - less than 10 million won ($8,500) in most cases - according to the report, which analyzed 1,714 rulings on industrial accident cases between 2013 and 2017.
""Because of light punishments, employers may find it cheaper to pay fines and compensation instead of investing in safety equipment,"" said Kim Sung-ryong, the lead author of the report and a law professor at Kyungpook National University.
Out of court settlements between the families of workers who died in the 2017 crane accident and Samsung contributed to suspended jail sentences for seven Samsung employees, a ruling by the Changwon District Court in May shows.
Samsung Heavy paid compensations of hundreds of thousands of dollars each to the families of some victims on behalf of subcontractors, an executive at a supplier firm who had direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
In return, the families of the victims agreed not to sue Samsung Heavy or the subcontractors, according to the executive, who declined to be named to discuss terms of the agreement meant to be confidential.
Samsung Heavy declined to comment on settlements with victims' families, saying it could not disclose ""personal information"". A prosecution official with direct knowledge of the case said prosecutors appealed the sentences but declined further comment.
After the death of a temporary worker at a power plant prompted a public outcry last year, South Korea in January amended occupational safety laws to restrict subcontracting, but only in limited areas.
The restrictions that take effect next year will barely affect outsourcing practices of the shipbuilding industry, which reported nearly 2,000 industrial accidents, including 26 deaths last year, said lawyers and labour activists who analyzed the laws.
The labour ministry declined to say if the new laws apply to the shipbuilding sector and Reuters was unable to independently confirm it. 
Since the deadly 2017 crane accident, Park has been unable to take the subway or elevators for fear they might collapse.
In his first interview with international media, he recalled the mangled bodies around the shipyard after the crane collapsed, hitting workers on cigarette breaks, including his brother.
Sung-woo, whose back was hit by a swinging wire, died in the emergency room from heavy bleeding.
""In the ambulance, my brother said it hurts really bad,"" Park said, tearfully recounting the moment. ""We were there to work, not to be killed."""
870,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 06:59PM ET</span>","Fiat Chrysler, Peugeot owner PSA in talks to combine: source","(Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot owner PSA are in talks to combine in a deal that could create a $50 billion automaker, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
Fiat Chrysler shares rose sharply after news of the talks and ended up more than 7.5% in U.S. trading. The companies and the French government had no comment. 
The Wall Street Journal first reported the discussions. PSA's supervisory board was due to meet on Wednesday to discuss the potential merger, another source close to the matter said. 
If a combination of Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler succeeded in overcoming political, financial and governance hurdles, the new enterprise would still face substantial challenges. Global automakers face the prospect of a slowdown in global demand coinciding with the most dramatic technology changes in a century.
Peugeot Chief Executive Carlos Tavares has predicted ""ten years of chaos"" for global automakers as regulators demand a switch to electric vehicles to reduce emissions linked to climate change.
Investors have speculated for several years that Fiat Chrysler was hunting for a merger partner, encouraged by the rhetoric of the company's late chief executive, Sergio Marchionne. 
In 2015, Marchionne outlined the case for consolidation of the auto industry and tried unsuccessfully to interest General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) in a deal. Fiat Chrysler earlier this year broached a merger with French automaker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) that ultimately collapsed.
Created when Fiat, under Marchionne's leadership, bought control of Chrysler out of a U.S. government-backed bankruptcy in 2009, Fiat Chrysler has one of the global auto industry's most profitable franchises in the Jeep sport utility vehicle brand and a money-spinning North American pickup and commercial van operation in Ram. Both would boost Peugeot, which does not sell vehicles in the U.S. market.
Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler could over time share engines and vehicle architectures, reducing capital spending and freeing up cash to invest in electric vehicles and emissions reduction technology required in Europe, China and other global markets.
Fiat Chrysler is under increasing pressure to invest in clean car technology. The company disclosed earlier this month that it faces a $79 million fine for falling short of U.S. fuel efficiency standards. Fiat Chrysler agreed to pay U.S. electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc for credits to help it comply with European emissions standards until 2022.
Evercore analyst Arndt Ellinghorst in a note on Tuesday said a combination of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot ""should ignite more rational industry behavior around allocation of capital and this particular merger makes materially more sense than a potential FCA-Renault merger."" 
Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler had discussed a combination earlier this year, before Fiat Chrysler proposed a $35 billion merger with Renault. At that time, Fiat Chrysler said a deal with Renault offered more advantages than a combination with Peugeot.
Fiat Chrysler Chairman John Elkann broke off talks with Renault in June after French government officials intervened and pushed for Renault first to resolve tensions with its Japanese alliance partner, Nissan Motor Co. 
Following the collapse of the Renault merger plan, Fiat Chrysler CEO Mike Manley left the door open for talks with would-be partners. But he said the Italian-American automaker could go it alone despite mounting costs to develop electric vehicles and comply with tougher emissions rules in Europe, the United States and China. 
Along with Jeep and Ram would come Fiat's Italian operations, which have struggled in recent years. Fiat's Mirafiori assembly complex in its home city of Turin has run below 50% capacity, with thousands of workers on temporary layoffs. 
Overall, Fiat has 58,000 workers in Italy, where the government has long resisted mass lay-offs by large employers. 
Peugeot's Tavares dismissed the idea of a combination with Fiat Chrysler during a discussion with reporters at the Frankfurt auto show last month. 
""We don't need it,"" he said when asked whether he was still interested in a deal with Fiat Chrysler.
Tavares has moved aggressively to expand Peugeot, acquiring German auto brand Opel from General Motors Co for $2.6 billion in 2017. Since then, he has overseen a turnaround at Opel. 

Fiat Chrysler already has a commercial vehicle partnership with Peugeot.

(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) said on Tuesday that 15 new tests found no asbestos in a bottle of baby powder that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says tested positive for trace amounts of asbestos, a finding the agency stands by.
The tests are the latest effort by J&J to prove the safety of its widely used consumer product after a test by the FDA prompted J&J to undertake a nationwide recall of one lot of its Johnson's Baby Powder.
FDA officials, in an interview with Reuters, said the agency continues to support the company's voluntary recall. 
“They would say the product is free of asbestos based on their testing, and we would say the opposite for that sample,” said Steve Musser, deputy director for scientific operations in the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Nutrition. 
Earlier this month, J&J recalled around 33,000 bottles of baby powder in the United States after the FDA found trace amounts of asbestos in samples taken from a bottle purchased online.
""Rigorous and third-party testing confirms there is no asbestos in Johnson's Baby Powder. We stand by the safety of our product,"" J&J said in a statement. The company did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment on the FDA standing by its test result. 
The different test outcomes could have resulted from the fact that contaminants are not uniformly dispersed throughout talc and there is no standard test for asbestos in talc, FDA officials said. 
The voluntary recall was limited to one lot of Johnson’s Baby Powder produced and shipped in the United States in 2018, the company said at the time. 
That move marked the first time the company recalled its iconic baby powder for possible asbestos contamination, and the first time U.S. regulators have announced a finding of asbestos in the product. Asbestos is a known carcinogen that has been linked to deadly mesothelioma.
J&J will not reverse the recall of those 22-ounce containers, but its baby powder remains available to consumers in stores, a company spokesman told Reuters. 
The recall had been the latest blow to the more than 130-year-old U.S. healthcare conglomerate that is facing thousands of lawsuits over a variety of products, including baby powder, opioids, medical devices and the antipsychotic Risperdal.
J&J faces more than 15,000 lawsuits from consumers claiming its talc products, including Johnson’s Baby Powder, caused their cancer.

872,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 06:37PM ET</span>","U.S. telecoms supply chain rules, seen hitting Huawei, under review: official","By Alexandra Alper
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Rules to implement a White House executive order that is expected to pave the way for China's Huawei to be banned from the U.S. telecoms supply chain are ""under consideration and review,"" a Commerce Department official said on Tuesday.
The rules, which were due earlier this month, would implement an earlier declaration of a national emergency in the telecoms supply chain, and are likely to be used by Washington to tighten the squeeze on the telecoms equipment giant. 
Speaking at an event in Washington, the official, Eileen Albanese, said the rules were ""under consideration and review,"" without offering a time line. They are ""not yet ready for prime time,"" she added.
The White House in May mandated that Commerce write the rules, which will likely spell out new requirements for companies to participate in the telecoms supply chain. That same day, the department placed Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the world's No. 1 telecoms equipment supplier, on the so-called entity list, citing national security concerns. U.S. companies are banned from selling to Huawei without a special license. 
Although top officials have encouraged U.S. companies to apply for licenses, promising to permit sales of products to Huawei that are readily replaceable and do not compromise U.S. national security, the Commerce Department has yet to issue responses to more than 200 license requests it has received. 
Albanese said the license requests were still in process and declined to give a time line on issuing them.
Many China-watchers see Huawei as a pawn in the trade war between the United States and China as President Donald Trump's administration uses the sanctions against one of China's most successful multinationals to wring concessions out of Beijing. 
SLEDGEHAMMER
Concerns about China stealing U.S. technology prompted Congress to pass legislation last year requiring the Commerce Department to write new rules to toughen standards for the export of emerging and foundational technologies to rivals. 
Late last year, the Commerce Department sought public comment on how to design rules for exports of emerging technologies, but has yet to issue proposals. It has not yet sought public comment on how to draft measures regulating exports of foundational technologies, those seen as key in making critical technologies such as chips. 
Albanese also said Commerce would propose emerging technology rules ""shortly"" and that the agency hoped to seek comment before proposing a rule for foundational technology before the end of the year. 
But she cautioned against being ""shortsighted"" and writing rules that are so tough that they cut off the revenue flows from foreign customers that allow U.S. firms to stay at the forefront of technology. 

""We need to take a very balanced approach, use all the tools in our tool box but not to the point where it's a sledgehammer,"" she said, arguing such an approach could drive U.S. companies offshore.

1. It's Fed Day!
The Federal Reserve delivers its interest-rate decision on Wednesday at 2:00 PM ET (18:00 GMT).
But with a rate cut all but priced in, the language in the accompanying monetary policy statement will be carefully parsed for clues on whether more cuts are in the pipeline for this year.
The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's rate-making body, is expected to cut its benchmark rate to a range of 1.5% to 1.75% from a previous range of 1.75% to 2.00%.
Many on Wall Street expect the Fed won’t commit to further cuts, but will signal a willingness to carry out further easing if economic conditions deteriorate.
After the rate decision, attention will turn to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference, expected to start at 2:30 PM ET.
2. U.S. Q3 GDP, Private Jobs Data
A first reading on third-quarter U.S. economic growth and an update on the private jobs market are also in focus for tomorrow.
Ahead of Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report, traders will look to ADP’s measure of private-sector employment for an update on the labor market.
The report is due at 8:15 AM ET (12:15 GMT).
Economists, on average, expect that private nonfarm payrolls rose by 120,000 in October, lower than the gain of 135,000 seen in September.
A wider read on the economy comes just 15 minutes later, with the Bureau of Economic Analysis reporting its initial reading of third-quarter 2019 gross domestic product.
Economists, on average, expect that third-quarter growth slowed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.6% from 2.0% in the second quarter, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
3. Facebook, Apple in Focus With Earnings Due
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reports earnings after Wednesday's closing bell.
Its user additions during in the quarter will likely be the key metric to watch. Monthly active users are expected to rise to 2.45 billion for the quarter, up about 8% from the year-ago period's 2.27 billion.
Despite the uptick in regulatory scrutiny, investor sentiment on Facebook ahead of the earnings report is positive, even if the shares were off slightly on Tuesday. Wall Street seems confident that the company has continued to benefit from strong advertiser demand.
The shares are up 44% on the year, although down 9.3% from their 52-week high of $208.66, reached in July.
Facebook is expected to report earnings of $1.90 a share on revenue of $17.36 billion. Earnings would be up 7.95% from a year ago. Revenue would be up 26.4%.
Beyond earnings, guidance will also come under scrutiny amid expectations that the company may predict a return to being cash flow positive following a two-year investment in measures to improve security on its platform.
""As we have been expecting for some time, our primary focus is a return to free-cash-flow growth (for Facebook) in 2020 after a two-year period of investment. Our checks with advertisers continue to suggest minimal deceleration for U.S. budgets,""   Credit Suisse   (SIX:CSGN) said in a note to clients.
In addition, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reports fiscal-fourth-quarter results after Wednesday's close.
Analyst estimates compiled by Investing.com project earnings of $2.83 a share, down slightly from a year ago. Revenue is estimated at $62.9 billion, up 2.4%.
But the fiscal first quarter is the biggest revenue and profit generator. "
874,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 05:37PM ET</span>",Ex-FDA chief Gottlieb sees investment opportunity in 'unloved' antibiotics,"By Rebecca Spalding
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As a private investor, former U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is focused on an area where few have found success in recent years: developing new antibiotics.
Since leaving the FDA in April, Gottlieb has revealed little about what types of investments he would make in his new role at New Enterprise Associates, one of the country's largest venture capital firms where he worked prior to his time in government.
But in an interview, Gottlieb said he intends to use his expertise to back therapeutic areas that other healthcare investors have overlooked due to concerns over how the treatments are paid for.
Near the top of his list are companies researching new kinds of antibiotics, an issue he advocated for while at the FDA.
""I'm very interested in finding opportunities in the anti-infective space, particularly around multi-drug resistant organisms,"" Gottlieb said in an interview. ""Anti-infectives have been unloved for a very long time. There's a huge clinical need.""
In many ways, it's a contrarian bet. Global health officials have repeatedly warned about the rise of bacteria and other microbes that are resistant to most available drugs, raising the specter of untreatable infectious diseases that could spread rapidly.
But few large drugmakers are researching new medicines that can combat these so-called ""superbugs"" because the economics often work against them. Drugmakers earn more revenue the more drugs they sell. However, antibiotics are more effective the less they are used.
Last year, pharmaceutical giant  Novartis  AG (S:NOVN) said it would abandon its antibiotic research, following similar moves made by peers AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN) and Sanofi SA (PA:SASY).
 Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE), whose board Gottlieb joined in June after leaving government, is one of the few remaining large players still in the space along with GlaxoSmithKline Plc (L:GSK), which this week begun late-stage testing of an experimental antibiotic in patients with urinary tract infections and gonorrhea.
Smaller players, meanwhile, have struggled to find financing. Achaogen Inc said earlier this year that it would file for bankruptcy despite having brought a novel antibiotic through FDA approval. Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc (O:TTPH) plummeted earlier this month after it gave a disappointing sales forecast for its antibiotic treatment.
Gottlieb said the sector's low valuations create an opportunity to roll up therapies into a larger company focused on making antibiotics.
""After the Achaogen episode, a lot of valuations have been driven down quite dramatically. I think there's an opportunity to try to find some existing assets and maybe build a company around those assets,"" he said.
""That's what I think I'd be interested in doing,"" Gottlieb said. ""There are other investors that are interested in this as well. I think the capital is out there to do that.""
While at the FDA, Gottlieb advocated finding new ways to pay for antibiotics, such as a licensing model that would charge hospitals upfront for access to new kinds of anti-infective drugs rather than paying for them on a per unit basis.
In the past, Gottlieb was criticized over potential conflicts of interest between his government and private sector work, including an investment in Kure Corp, a privately-held vaping company. Gottlieb promised to divest that interest prior to joining the FDA, where he assumed oversight of the burgeoning e-cigarette market."

The inquiry centers on whether incentives in Valic's compensation structure rewarded representatives for selling higher-cost products to retirement plan participants and whether Valic properly discloses the payments its representatives receive on certain product sales, the report said. (https://on.wsj.com/2JyG1WN)
Valic provides retirement products to employees in K-12 schools, colleges, and not-for-profit organizations.
The SEC is also looking at Valic's arrangements with school districts, in which it provides money to cover certain school expenses while also offering investment advice and products to school employees, the report said.
""We cannot comment at this time on any regulatory inquiries or related personnel matters,"" an AIG spokesman told Reuters.
Several high-level Valic executives have been placed on administrative leave in recent weeks, the report said."

877,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 05:14PM ET</span>",Apple Pay in EU antitrust spotlight as regulators seek details,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) faces more regulatory woes in Europe as EU antitrust regulators ask online sales companies whether they have been told to use its mobile payment service instead of rival services, an EU document seen by Reuters showed.
In a questionnaire sent in August, the European Commission said it had information Apple may have restricted online payments for the purchase of goods and services made via merchant apps or websites, in breach of EU antitrust rules.
Launched in October 2014, Apple's mobile payment service Apple Pay is part of the company's diversification from device sales. It is available in more than 50 countries worldwide, including in more than 20 EU countries.
The questionnaire asked if companies were under a contractual obligation to enable a certain payment method and also if such contracts included conditions for integrating Apple Pay in their apps and websites.
Regulators wanted to know if Apple has rejected merchant apps as incompatible with the terms and conditions for integrating Apple Pay in their apps.
The Commission confirmed that it had sought information from market participants.
""The Commission is actively monitoring the development of mobile payment solutions, the behaviour by operators active in the payments sector, including mobile payments,"" the EU competition enforcer said.
Apple said its payment system offers the safest and most secure solution in the market as evidenced by the thousands of banks using it. 
""IPhone has completely transformed mobile payments by providing customers with a choice of how to pay including cash, credit card and debit card, as well using apps from the major banks and financial institutions,"" it said. 
Critics have long complained about an NFC chip embedded in the Apple iPhone which means Apple Pay is automatically selected when an iPhone user pays for goods and services, barring rival payment methods.
Recent alerts on iPhones asking users if they want to set up Apple Pay on their devices have also triggered protests from some.
In an interview with Reuters last year, European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said she might investigate Apple Pay if there are formal complaints.

Apple is already the target of a complaint by Swedish music streaming service  Spotify Technology  SA (N:SPOT) which says the U.S. company unfairly limits rivals to its own streaming service. The Commission has yet to decide whether to open an investigation.

878,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 05:09PM ET</span>","Barbie, K-pop's BTS power Mattel's surprise revenue rise; shares jump","(Reuters) -  Mattel Inc  (O:MAT) reported a surprise jump in quarterly revenue on Tuesday as newer models energized demand for its flagship Barbie brand, while the launch of dolls based on Korean pop-sensation BTS lifted international sales.
The U.S. toymaker's shares rose nearly 20% in extended trading.
Worldwide Barbie gross sales rose 10% to $412.8 million in the third quarter, while analysts had expected a 1.2% drop on fears that demand would ease in the run-up to the release of the Disney princess movie ""Frozen 2"", the doll rights to which are owned by  Hasbro Inc  (O:HAS).
Mattel's international gross sales rose 10% to $721.7 million, lifted by sales of dolls based on Korean boy band BTS, which has dominated international music charts.
Mattel bagged the rights for dolls based on the seven-member band earlier this year.
BTS and Barbie, which has been modernized with variants of based on popular celebrities, role models, different skin tones and professions, helped lift worldwide doll sales by 5%. 
""The story around BTS shows how we're able to capture cultural trends and commercialize them,"" Chief Executive Officer Ynon Kreiz told Reuters.
Mattel, unlike rival Hasbro, said it was not seeing any cancellations by its retail partners ahead of a Dec. 15 U.S. tariff deadline on Chinese toy imports.
""At this stage, we are not seeing any impact from tariffs and we don't expect anything this year,"" Kreiz said, adding consumer sentiment was strong heading into the crucial holiday season.
Hasbro missed quarterly profit estimates earlier this month, blaming higher shipping and warehousing costs from the uncertainty around tariffs.
Mattel also disclosed material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting and said Chief Financial Officer Joseph Euteneuer will leave the company.
The disclosure was a result of an investigation by the company into an anonymous whistleblower letter that was made public in August.
The investigation found that income tax expenses were misstated in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, and while there was no impact on full-year financials, the error was not reported to then-CEO Margaret Georgiadis.
The toymaker had canceled a debt sale in August after receiving the letter.
Euteneuer, who was appointed as finance chief in 2017, will leave after a transition period of up to six months. The company is conducting a search for its next CFO.
Mattel's third-quarter net sales rose 3% to $1.48 billion from a year earlier, while analysts had expected a fall of 0.5%.

Excluding items, Mattel earned 26 cents per share, 10 cents above estimates.

879,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 05:07PM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P Pulls Back as Investors Take Some Profits Ahead of Fed,"Investing.com – The big stock market rally lost some steam Tuesday as four days of sizable gains produced the inevitable profit-taking.
Technology shares, especially giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), led the pullback.
The S&P 500 hit a new intraday high of 3,047.87 early in the session but pulled back to a 0.08% loss.
The Dow Jones industrials dropped a modest 0.07%. The Nasdaq Composite slid 0.59% and the Nasdaq 100 index fell 0.78%.
Alphabet's earnings miss on Monday was probably the biggest reason for the tech pullback. But Apple, down 2.3%, had the bigger impact on the Dow and especially the Nasdaq 100. The decline cut 39 points from the Dow and nearly 22 points from the Nasdaq 100.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reports fiscal-fourth-quarter results after Wednesday's close. Analyst estimates compiled by Investing.com project earnings of $2.83 a share, down slightly from a year ago. Revenue is estimated at $62.9 billion, up 2.4%. But the fiscal first quarter is the biggest revenue and profit generator. 
 
It also looked as if traders were surprised by a report that the phase one U.S.-China Trade Deal might not be ready when President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping meet next month in Chile.
Part of the malaise also was the inevitable uncertainty ahead of a Federal Reserve rate decision due Wednesday at 2 PM ET (18:00 GMT). Wall Street believes a rate cut is coming. Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor tool puts the odds of a quarter-point cut at 97.3%.
There was some ugly selling in Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), down 22.1% following its IPO lockup period, and GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), which plunged 43%, on weak guidance.
There was some excitement about a Wall Street Journal report that Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) is in merger talks with French automaker Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY). Fiat Chrysler was up about 7.6%.
Adding some additional support to the market was strength in healthcare, materials and energy stocks. 
Gold futures fell modestly to $1,490.70 an ounce. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 27 cents to $55.54. Brent crude was up 2 cents to $61.59.
Interest rates dipped lower with the 10-Year Treasury yield dropping to 1.835% from Monday's 1.853%.
Oil-and-gas equipment supplier National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV), Xerox (NYSE:XRX), consumer products maker Leggett & Platt (NYSE:LEG) and hospital operator HCA Holdings (NYSE:HCA) were among the top S&P 500 performers on the day. 
S&P laggards were led by fiber-laser maker IPG Photonics (NASDAQ:IPGP), water-heater maker AO Smith(NYSE:AOS), oil-and-gas producer TechnipFMC (NYSE:FTI) and supermarket giant Kroger (NYSE:KR)."

SINGAPORE/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Singapore's Jungle Ventures said on Wednesday it has raised $240 million from investors, including Temasek Holdings, for a third fund designed to back Southeast Asian startups, highlighting the growing interest in the region's technology firms.
Jungle Ventures' latest fund comes as a growing number of venture capital firms, including Vertex (NASDAQ:VRTX) Ventures and Golden Gate Ventures, have been raising funds focused on the region this year.
Investors are betting on the market potential of Southeast Asia's population of 640 million, which is fast going online, and using smartphones to shop, commute and make payments.
The region's Internet economy is forecast to balloon to $300 billion by 2025 from an estimated $100 billion this year, according to a report by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Temasek and consultants Bain & Co.
More than 90% of the capital was from institutional investors, with about 60% coming from outside Asia - mainly the United States and Europe, Jungle Ventures' managing partner Amit Anand told Reuters.
The investors include German development finance institution DEG, the World Bank Group's IFC, Bangkok Bank's (BK:BBL) corporate venture capital fund Bualuang Ventures, Dutch development bank FMO and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) Investments.
The fund exceeded Jungle Ventures' initial target range of $150 million to $200 million, Anand said. In its previous fund, the company raised $100 million from investors in 2016 and its debut fund had raised $10 million in 2012.
Jungle Ventures' portfolio includes Singaporean hotel booking and management platform RedDoorz, cloud-based software provider Deskera, research platform Smartkarma and Thai fashion e-commerce start-up Pomelo Fashion.
The firm has created an internal rate of return of about 79% with its four exits that included vacations rental platform Travelmob, Anand said. It typically allocates $10 million-$20 million per company, making 10 to 15 key investments in each fund."

RBC’s C$2.5 billion ($1.91 billion) of five-year notes were quoted at a spread of 96.8 basis points over Canada’s 1.5% bonds due 2024 compared to 97.8 basis points yesterday, according to Bloomberg Valuation bid prices. The deal’s order book was oversubscribed around 1.5 times, people familiar with the transaction said on Monday.
The lender’s 2.609% bonds saw this increased demand amid a mixed tone in the global financial markets ahead of the Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada monetary policy meetings on Wednesday.
“A benchmark deal of that size will dictate how the bail-in sector trades,” Andrew Torres, chief executive officer at Toronto-based Lawrence Park Asset Management, which manages over C$500 million of assets. “The lead syndicate got the balance right.”
Canadian systemic banks began building their buffers of senior bail-in eligible securities in September 2018, and RBC was the first to sell the debt with a C$2 billion dollar deal. The bonds are designed to help prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis when taxpayers worldwide had to rescue banks. Bail-in bonds are riskier than deposit notes because they may be converted to equity in the event a bank runs into trouble.
The biggest Canadian banks, including RBC, may together issue at least C$108 billion more of bail-in eligible senior bonds to comply with total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements by Nov. 1, 2021, according to latest Bloomberg Intelligence estimates released Sept. 14.
RBC last priced a benchmark-size, senior bail-in deal in loonies in July when it sold C$2 billion of five-year securities at a spread of 97.1 basis points over Canada’s 2.5% bonds due 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A representative for RBC hasn’t replied to a request for comment."
885,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 04:36PM ET</span>","Beyond Meat, Shopify Fallout Is Latest Sign of Growth Reckoning","(Bloomberg) -- The price that equity investors are willing to pay for fast growth is being tested again as slumps in Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc. and Shopify Inc. show they’re demanding more of companies with premium valuations.
The veggie-burger maker and e-commerce platform on Tuesday became the latest examples of firms that delivered on revenue-growth expectations only to see their stocks fall. Meanwhile, the food-delivery company GrubHub Inc. showed how damaging the fallout can be when that growth fades.
Shopify slid as much as 7.7% in Toronto despite boosting its revenue forecast for the year. The company reported an unexpected third-quarter loss after it increased spending to expand its customer network and build out fulfillment centers across the U.S. The stock was up 124% year to date through Monday’s close and has a forward price-to-estimated sales ratio of 18, compared with an average of 1.6 for the S&P/TSX Composite Index.
A higher sales forecast also proved insufficient for Beyond Meat, which saw its shares tumble as much as 24% on concerns about competition and the expiration of a lockup for early investors. Beyond Meat shares are still up 240% since their initial public offering in May, but that’s far from their 800% returns back in July. The stock trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 12, more than 6 times the average multiple for stocks in the S&P 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
GrubHub may provide a cautionary tale. Its shares plunged a record 44% after the food-delivery company gave a fourth-quarter outlook that was well below expectations, as intensifying competition and “promiscuous” customers weighed on growth trends."
886,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 04:36PM ET</span>",Quants Cut Stock Exposures to Lowest Since 2014 as S&P Crawled to Record,"(Bloomberg) -- As the S&P 500 crawled its way to a new record, some of the smartest investors were creeping to the exit.
Coming into this week, market-neutral quants had cut their gross stock allocations to the lowest in nearly five years, according to data compiled by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG’s prime brokerage.
Conflicting signals on risk appetite and economic growth are whiplashing funds that dissect equities based on traits like value and momentum. All that is stoking factor volatility and increasing the temptation to delever as the anxiety-ridden rally of 2019 rolls on.
The market-neutral cohort, which take no directional bets on the benchmark, eked out a return of 1% in the nine months through September, compared with 6% for hedge funds overall. They recorded some $3.9 billion of outflows in the period, taking total assets to $66 billion, Eurekahedge data show.
“It looks nice -- the market’s up 20%, but it’s been a wild ride underneath the covers,” said Mark Connors, global head of risk advisory at Credit Suisse in New York. “The factor path has been unpredictable.”
Case in point: Last week saw the value strategy revive once more as hopes for a U.S.-China trade deal buoyed economic prospects, just weeks after a rotation in the opposite direction driven in part by recession fears.
To some, it’s a sign of late-cycle fragility as investors turn on every economic and political headline on a dime. But there’s also a whiff of suspicion that choppy rotations have been exacerbated by deleveraging among systematic funds.
“Quants sometimes can be a canary in the coal mine,” said Melissa Brown, managing director of applied research at Qontigo GmbH, which provides tools for portfolio construction and risk analytics. “Maybe we are going to see going forward more volatility in style factors as funds need to deleverage or people pull their money.”
Some factors are becoming more sensitive to shifts in positioning. The strength of the recent rally in cheap cyclical shares, for instance, caught many by surprise given the lack of a fundamental catalyst, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). strategists led by Derek Harris wrote in a note.
At Los Angeles Capital Management, while cheap relative valuations are starting to push portfolios toward value shares, its models still favor more expensive growth stocks because the fund expects global economic growth to remain weak.
“We are in a choppier environment,” said chief investment officer Hal Reynolds at the firm overseeing $25 billion including absolute-return strategies. “Compression in returns and pick-up in risk have both occurred this year, leading to the reduction in risk budgets.”
Relative to their market-neutral quant peers, other hedge funds appear to have turned more bullish. Macro funds and commodity trading advisors, which mostly trade index futures rather than individual stocks, have expanded their long bets this month, Credit Suisse data show.
Meanwhile, long-short stock pickers have boosted net exposure to the highest since March as they covered short positions amid the surprise resurgence this month of trades betting on higher inflation and growth. Financial stocks have outperformed, while defensive sectors from consumer staples to utilities have lost money -- a reversal of market trends seen earlier this year.
Still, the very fact that these funds haven’t added longs aggressively underscores the persistent caution stalking the 2019 rally.
“The short didn’t work, so you reduce it -- but don’t commit your capital to going long something that may be just a short-lived rotation,” said Credit Suisse’s Connors. “They don’t see a reflation trade there.”"

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 edged lower to snap a four-session win streak on Tuesday and it retreated from a record high as investors grappled with a flood of earnings and the latest update on a potential trade deal between the U.S. and China. 
Hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal and expectations of another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve when it concludes its two-day meeting on Wednesday have pushed stocks higher the past several sessions, sending the S&P to its second straight record intraday high.
But indexes pulled back after a U.S. administration official told Reuters that Washington and Beijing are continuing to work on an interim trade agreement, but it may not be completed in time for the leaders of the two countries to sign in Chile next month.
""It is actually impressive that we have held these gains, even if we are down slightly, it is a pretty impressive day considering what is going on, that there hasn’t been this hard sell-off pressure,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. 
""The encouraging thing is we are trading more on what you should be trading on, that being earnings, and less on rumor and innuendo, which is a nice change of pace and how the market should work.""
Tech (SPLRCT) shares, which have been closely tied to trade progress, lost ground after the report and were last down 0.92%. 
Drugmakers Merck & Co Inc (N:MRK) and  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) both gained after reporting upbeat third-quarter results to help keep the Dow and S&P near the flat line. The healthcare sector (SPXHC), which has been the second-worst performer among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors this year, rose 1.16% as the best performer on the session as Merck gained 3.5% and Pfizer advanced 2.5%.
But shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), however, lost 2.20% and weighed on the Nasdaq as its quarterly profit missed estimates due to higher costs.
Third-quarter earnings of S&P 500 companies have largely been better than expected, with over 77% of the 236 firms to report so far surpassing profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data. Still, earnings are expected to decline by 1.9% for the quarter. 
Other big names reporting this week include tech and internet heavyweights Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), as well as oil majors  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX).
The focus now shifts to the Fed meeting, where the central bank is widely expected to deliver a quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut for the third time this year.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 20.04 points, or 0.07%, to 27,070.68, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 2.54 points, or 0.08%, to 3,036.88 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 49.14 points, or 0.59%, to 8,276.85.
The S&P earlier in the session reached a high of 3,047.87, its second straight intraday record. 
General Motors Co (N:GM) gained 4.28% after its quarterly net profit topped estimates, but the carmaker slashed its earnings forecast for 2019 as the 40-day U.S. labor strike by the United Auto Workers union brought virtually all of its North American operations to a standstill.
 Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND) tumbled 22.22% as the vegan burger maker said it would need to offer more store discounts amid rising competition.
Shares of GrubHub Inc (N:GRUB) plunged 43.30% after the online food delivery company warned of slowing growth as customers opted to choose from a growing pool of rival providers.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.08-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

894,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 03:51PM ET</span>",Murray Energy files for bankruptcy as U.S. coal decline continues,"By Valerie Volcovici
(Reuters) - Murray Energy Corp, one of the largest privately-held U.S. coal miners, whose founder is an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump, became the latest in a string of coal companies to file for bankruptcy on Tuesday as generators shift to cleaner-burning natural gas and renewable energy.
As part of a restructuring, founder Robert Murray, a Trump ally and climate change denier, will step down as chief executive and a lender group will take on more than 60% of about $1.7 billion in claims.
""Although a bankruptcy filing is not an easy decision, it became necessary to access liquidity and best position Murray Energy and its affiliates for the future of our employees and customers and our long-term success,” Robert Murray said in a statement.
The bankruptcy comes even after the Trump administration weakened or eliminated dozens of environmental regulations that Murray and other executives had called burdensome for the coal industry.
Early in the Trump presidency, Murray presented the administration with a wish list of environmental regulations he wanted slashed as coal companies have struggled due to growing use of renewables and cheap natural gas.
Eight other coal companies have filed for bankruptcy over the last two years as natural gas has taken over as the primary fuel for U.S. power plants, while coal's share of generation has collapsed. 
The United Mine Workers of America said its members are preparing to fight for their wages and benefits should Murray seek relief from its obligations during reorganization.
“We have seen this sad act too many times before,” said UMWA President Cecil Roberts. “But that does not mean we will sit idly by and let the company and the court dictate what happens to our members and our retirees.”
West Virginia's Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said an additional 14,000 miners were at risk of losing their healthcare benefits and 82,000 pensions are under threat, which ""underscores the urgent need"" for Congress to pass legislation to protect miners' benefits. 
Coal's share of U.S. power generation is expected to fall to 22% in 2020, compared with roughly 25% this year. As recently as 2003, coal accounted for half of the country's electricity generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).
The EIA expects the power sector will burn less coal this year than it has since 1979.
In addition to rolling back regulations on coal plants, the administration attempted to use emergency orders to bolster coal.
For example, Energy Secretary Rick Perry tried to slow the retirement of coal and nuclear plants through a directive in 2017 to subsidize the aging units, arguing those plants make electric grid more resilient, a policy advocated by Murray. Federal regulators rejected Perry's plan, instead electing to study the issue further.
Murray was a donor to Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016 and a frequent attendee at events held by the administration, such as the announcement at the Environmental Protection Agency headquarters of its plans to kill the Obama-era Clean Power Plan carbon regulations.
The White House declined to comment on Murray's bankruptcy filing.
The company intends to continue operating during the Chapter 11 reorganization with cash on hand and access to $350 million from lenders.
Robert Moore will take over as president and CEO of the company while Murray will head up the board of directors.

(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) will reward employees for the bank's strong performance through special bonuses for the third straight year, according to an internal memo viewed by Reuters.
Roughly 95% of the bank's employees will receive the special bonus this year. Those making less than $100,000 a year will get$1,000 in December, and those making between $100,000 and $350,000 a year will receive stock awards in first quarter of next year. ""A critical part of our commitment to making Bank of America a great place to work is our ongoing focus on recognizing achievements and sharing our success,"" Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said in a memo addressed to employees.
The second-largest U.S. bank by assets has posted record profits both years since President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts, and has shared some of those earnings with employees through wage increases and special compensation. The bank has paid out about $1.6 billion in special bonuses since 2017 and has set goal of raising its minimum wage to $20 over the next two years from $13.50 in 2017.
The bonuses were reported earlier by Bloomberg.

Last year, the Charlotte-based bank's board awarded Moynihan a 15% raise for a total compensation of $27 million reflecting a higher variable compensation tied to company performance. Other C-suite executives got bonuses that were on average 9% higher, according to filings.

The company will also cut 10% to 15% of its workforce by the end of the year as part of a broad reorganization under CEO K.C. Crosthwaite, a former executive at major shareholder Altria (N:MO).
Juul, by far the most popular e-cigarette maker in the United States, has been rocked by concerns over the strong appeal of its nicotine products among teenagers.
The departures of Chief Financial Officer Tim Danaher (NYSE:DHR) and Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers come just weeks after Juul suspended advertising in the United States.
The company's colorful advertisements have been slammed by regulators, lawmakers and state attorneys general over their part in the sky-rocketing use of e-cigarettes among teenagers.
Danaher, who has been CFO for five years, will be replaced by insider Guy Cartwright, while the role of marketing chief will be terminated, a company spokesman said.
Chief Administrative Officer Ashley Gould and product development executive David Foster are also leaving, he added.
Crosthwaite replaced Kevin Burns last month, taking the top job as merger talks between Altria and Philip Morris (N:PM) collapsed. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in September warned Juul that it was misleading consumers by marketing its USB resembling e-cigarettes as safer than cigarettes, and requested additional information on its nicotine blend. 
Soon after, the Trump administration announced plans to ban all flavored e-cigarette products, citing the alarming growth in teenage use.

Crosthwaite has said Juul will refrain from lobbying the Trump administration on the proposed flavor ban.

(Reuters) - Shares of  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND) plunged more than 20% on Tuesday as investors rushed to cash in after a restriction on selling stock lifted and worries mounted about rising costs and increased competition at the hugely popular plant-based meat producer. 
A surge in interest in plant-based burgers, sausages and other meat-lookalikes this year has spurred a doubling in value of the Los Angeles-based company since its stock market launch in May.
However, the restrictions on selling nearly 80% of the company's outstanding shares ended on Monday, and analysts said expectations that some investors would lock in profits were weighing on the stock.
Along with Monday's results release, the company announced the departure of venture capital specialist Gregory Bohlen from its board after more than six years with the company.
Bohlen said neither he nor his firm were selling stock on Tuesday. Bohlen owns 160,000 shares and his venture capital firm Union Growth Venture Partners owned about 735,000 shares after the IPO. 
""I might sell a portion of it down the road, but I suspect I'm going to keep Beyond Meat in my portfolio for a really long time.""
Similarly, Ray Lane, one of Beyond Meat's first investors who sits on the company's board, said he did not sell his shares and would remain a long-term holder. Lane owned 256,108 shares in Beyond Meat immediately after the IPO, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
""There was so much short-selling and lockup pressure on the stock that today was just the perfect storm, but even at $80 or $90 per share, Beyond Meat’s value is still a significant multiple on earnings.""
Lane, a former partner at Beyond Meat investor Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, said the venture capital fund distributed about 20% of its original shares to its limited partners. Those partners, including Lane himself, can now decide whether they want to sell the shares. According to Beyond Meat's IPO filing, Kleiner Perkins held around 606,000 common stock at the time of the IPO.
Hamburger Helper maker  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS), which owned about 164,000 Beyond Meat shares post-IPO, told Reuters its venture capital arm 301 INC is selling its stake. The fund bought Beyond Meat in 2013, a spokeswoman said.
Shares fell as much as 24% to $80.10 on Tuesday - their lowest since May 24, just three weeks after the IPO.
BEYOND THE LOCK-UP
By early afternoon, almost 27 million shares - worth more than $2 billion - were traded, making it the stock's busiest session since the IPO in May.
""What is less apparent, though, is the number of shareholders willing to sell with the stock down well over 50% from its high,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said.
""Either way, putting the lock-up expiry in the past ultimately should incent some investors to start buying the stock again.""
At their peak in July, Beyond Meat shares had risen five-fold in value from their debut price of $46 in early May. The stock has since retreated, and closed at $105.41 on Monday, valuing the company at $6.38 billion.
The vegan burger maker posted its first ever profit on Monday and raised its full-year sales forecast, but also said it would need to offer more discounts as competition heats up.
At least three Wall Street analysts cut their price target on the stock after the results, with J.P. Morgan's Goldman reducing his target to $138 from $189.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York state appeals court on Tuesday rejected IAC/InterActiveCorp's (O:IAC) bid to dismiss a $2 billion lawsuit by a group of Tinder founders, executives and early employees who said it undervalued the dating app to avoid paying them billions of dollars.
The Appellate Division in Manhattan said Tinder co-founder Sean Rad and the other five plaintiffs, who also sued IAC's  Match Group Inc  (O:MTCH) unit, were not bound under their stock options agreements to what they considered artificially low valuations of their stakes.
""Although the parties agreed that the value of their stock options would be determined by the valuation process, nothing in the agreements provided that the valuation would be binding or final or that the parties would be precluded from fully disputing the valuation in court,"" the five-judge panel said.
The decision affirmed a June 13 ruling by New York State Supreme Court Justice Saliann Scarpulla in Manhattan.
She had said the plaintiffs could pursue claims of breach of contract, and intentional interference with both contractual relations and prospective economic advantage.
In seeking a dismissal, New York-based IAC and Dallas-based Match had called the August 2018 lawsuit a belated and improper attack on a ""binding expert appraisal"" done 13 months earlier.
""This baseless lawsuit has no more merit today than it did over a year ago when it was filed,"" IAC said in a statement. ""We look forward to defending ourselves in court.""
Orin Snyder, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in a statement said his clients looked forward to a jury trial. ""IAC and Match cheated our clients and engaged in a brazen cover-up,"" he said.
IAC and Match separately sued Rad in January, accusing him of having secretly copied files and other proprietary information.
They also filed a $400 million countersuit in September accusing him of having recorded conversations with his superiors without their consent.
Rad has sought to dismiss the January lawsuit, and in an Oct. 17 court filing Snyder called the countersuit ""legally without merit"" and an effective attempt to bankrupt Rad.
IAC said on Oct. 11 it intends to spin off its 80.5% stake in Match, which includes Tinder.
The appeals court case is Rad et al v IAC/InterActiveCorp et al, New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, 1st Department, No. 9946. The cases in the New York State Supreme Court, New York County are Rad et al v IAC/InterActiveCorp et al, No. 654038/2018, and Match Group Inc et al v Rad, No. 650287/2019."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co (N:KKR) reported a 23% year-on-year drop in its quarterly after-tax distributable profit on Tuesday, as fee revenue slid amid a broader slowdown in asset sales by buyout firms.
KKR said after-tax distributable earnings, the cash available for paying dividends, fell to $388.8 million in the third quarter, from $496.7 million a year earlier.
Still, KKR's after-tax distributable earnings per share of 46 cents surpassed the average analyst estimate of 42 cents per share, according to Refinitiv.
Many private equity firms, including KKR, have sold fewer companies this year, even though the U.S. stock market is hovering near all-time highs, as potential acquirers balk at their valuation expectations. This has weighed on the income they generate from the lucrative fees accompanying such transactions.
Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX), the world's largest private equity firm, last week also reported a decline in its distributable earnings, of 8%.
During the third quarter, KKR-backed U.S. entertainment and talent agency Endeavor Group Holdings (N:EDR) postponed a plan to raise $400 million in an initial public offering because of weak market demand for the money-losing firm - a move that hit KKR's capital markets business, which had underwritten the IPO.
KKR said total assets under management climbed to $208 billion, up 7% from a year ago.
New York-based KKR said it plans to begin fundraising across its three largest flagship funds - Asia private equity, Americas private equity and global infrastructure - in addition to 20 other funds, as part of a plan to increase management fee revenue by 50% over three years.
""So given what's coming to market plus our ongoing distribution efforts, if the fundraising environment cooperates and we continue to perform, we believe we can grow our management fees by at least 50% again over the next three years,"" KKR Co-president Scott Nuttall said during a call with analysts on Tuesday.
Ongoing U.S-China trade tensions has heightened concerns that investments by U.S. investors in Chinese companies could be affected in a tit-for-tat retaliation as the world's two biggest economies hold talks in an attempt to reach a trade deal.
KKR has been one of the biggest U.S. private equity investors in China and other Asian countries, bolstered by about $19 billion the buyout firm has raised in its three funds focused on the region. The firm's investments in China include ByteDance, the owner of short-form video app TikTok, and Gambol Pet Group, a pet food manufacturer.
But KKR said it expects a minimal impact to the overall performance of its Chinese investments since they are focused on domestic consumption.
""I think the overall impact on the portfolio was one that is one that's pretty small, and the same point of time, we're trying to find ways to pursue opportunities if there are companies that have decided to exit the region,"" KKR's head of investor relations, Craig Larson, said during the earnings call."

Shares were up 7.6% at 2:45 PM ET (18:45 GMT).

There is no deal yet as the two sides are trying to figure out the terms. One option is for an all-share deal. It's also not clear how the Trump Administration would view such a merger.

A deal between the two would create a company with sales of as much as $50 billion a year, the Journal said. It learned of the talks from multiple sources familiar with the negotiations.
Fiat Chrysler had offered this past spring to merge with   Renault   (PA:RENA), Peugeot's French rival. But it pulled the offer in June, saying ""political conditions in France do not currently exist for such a combination to proceed successfully.” The French government is Renault's biggest shareholder. And it has an ongoing partnership with Japanese auto giant Nissan (OTC:NSANY).

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is eliminating its grocery delivery service free for Prime members in the United States and making shopping easier by combining AmazonFresh and Whole Foods Market ordering on a single site, in a bid to fend off rival grocery sellers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co. 
Amazon is dropping its $14.99 grocery delivery fee as Walmart - the No. 1 grocery seller in the United States - rolls out a $98 annual ""Delivery Unlimited"" grocery membership to compete with Amazon's $119 Prime delivery subscription.
Amazon has fat profits from its Web Services business and has demonstrated a willingness to lose money on initiatives aimed at driving more customers to its sprawling online marketplace. 
Chief Executive Brian Olsavsky last week said ""foregone shipping revenue"" - or money Amazon would otherwise have brought in from customers who once paid for fast shipping - would contribute to a spike in Amazon shipping costs that some expect to top $11 billion in the fourth quarter.
""I think that this is going to be a game changer, and it will grow into one of the most loved benefits of Prime,"" Stephenie Landry, Amazon's vice president of grocery delivery, said.
Amazon said in 2017 it was ending its Fresh grocery delivery service for select areas. Landry, however, said the business is very much growing and has expanded this year to areas like Nashville, Orlando and Las Vegas.
Amazon last week forecast revenue and profit below Wall Street's target, amid intense competition and surging costs related to its drive to speed up shipping around the world.
Sales at Amazon's Whole Foods Market chain and other physical stores stalled in the second quarter and fell 1 percent in the third quarter.
Profits from grocery sales are notoriously slim. But selling staples like bananas, milk and toilet paper gives retailers like Amazon, Walmart,  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) the opportunity to upsell shoppers who make frequent trips to replenish such necessities.
Tuesday's move from the world's biggest online retailer is yet another salvo in the continuing delivery ""arms race,"" Charlie O'Shea of Moody's said.
Amazon is already cutting delivery times to one day for its Prime loyalty members in a bid to outmaneuver Walmart and other retailers who offer competing two-day shipping without subscription fees.
""This new delivery effort is yet another example of Amazon's willingness to suffer short-term for the potential for long-term benefit,"" O'Shea added.
Shares in Amazon slipped 0.7% in midday trading, while  Kroger Co  and Walmart were down 2.1% and 1.1%, respectively. 
Walmart plans to offer its ""Delivery Unlimited"" grocery membership to shoppers in more than half of the United States by the end of the year. Members have the option of paying the $98 annual fee or $12.95 per month instead of the usual $9.99 delivery fee.
Kroger charges a $5.95 delivery fee and a $6.00 service fee for home delivery. 

A recent study from CapGemini found that 38% of U.S. consumers order groceries online, but that only 14% were willing to pay more for two-hour deliveries.

902,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 02:26PM ET</span>","India's competition watchdog to probe SoftBank's Oyo, MakeMyTrip","By Sachin Ravikumar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - An Indian regulator has ordered an investigation into allegations that hotel-booking service  MakeMyTrip Ltd  (O:MMYT) gives special treatment to SoftBank-backed (T:9984) hotel chain Oyo on its platform, stifling competition in the industry.
There is a ""prima facie case for investigation"" against MakeMyTrip and Oyo for alleged violations of rules barring uncompetitive agreements between parties, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) said in an order dated Oct. 28.
The order follows a complaint from the Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI), an industry body.
Both Oyo and MakeMyTrip allow guests to book hotels through their mobile apps while charging hotels a fee on room revenue, but Oyo also franchises its brand and offers standardized amenities at hotels on its network.
Gurugram-headquartered Oyo, valued at $10 billion and one of the world's largest hotel chains, is already facing backlash from an increasing number of Indian hotel operators who are complaining about being blindsided by fee increases.
The backlash against Oyo has come at a sensitive time for its major investor SoftBank, which is struggling to close its second $100-billion plus Vision Fund and has faced challenges at some of its other marquee bets such as WeWork and Uber (N:UBER).
While Uber has seen its valuation slide after a poor market debut in May, SoftBank has also had to endure a painful bailout of WeWork following a failed public listing.
The FHRAI said agreements between Oyo and Nasdaq-listed MakeMyTrip were restricting market access to Indian hotel chains such as Fab Hotels and Treebo, according to the CCI's order. ""(MakeMyTrip) and OYO have entered into confidential commercial agreements wherein (MakeMyTrip) has agreed to give preferential treatment to OYO on its platform, further leading to a denial of market access to Treebo and Fab Hotels,"" the CCI's order said, quoting from the FHRAI's allegations.
Oyo said in a statement it was reviewing the order and would cooperate with the CCI's investigation.
""We will co-operate with CCI and demonstrate that the allegations are unfounded,"" a MakeMyTrip spokeswoman said in an email.
The complaint from the FHRAI also included a long list of other allegations. It said Oyo and MakeMyTrip are hurting competition by offering deep discounts and charging ""exorbitant"" fees from hotels.
Oyo's prices in small Indian markets are about 30% lower than average industry prices, which helps it attract more customers at the cost of smaller, independent hotels which are then forced to join Oyo's network or lose out on potential revenues, the FHRAI said.
However, the CCI said it would not provide a finding on the allegations around discounts and excessive commissions before investigating the ""market structure, entry conditions, cost structure of platforms"" in the industry.
""There are no clear standards to determine what price is excessive or fair,"" it said.
The FHRAI had also alleged that Oyo and MakeMyTrip misled customers by continuing to list some hotels on their platforms with a ""sold out"" sign even after the hotels asked the companies to sever ties.
The CCI said these allegations, in the case of MakeMyTrip, need to be investigated, but did not provide any finding against Oyo."

907,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 01:50PM ET</span>","Shipping companies, retailers look to develop cleaner marine biofuel","By Jonathan Saul
LONDON (Reuters) - Top shipping, retail and transport companies are looking to develop an alternative marine fuel which aims to reduce carbon emissions from ships, in another step to push the sector to go green. 
International shipping accounts for 2.2% of global carbon dioxide emissions, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), more than aviation's 2% share.
The IMO, a United Nations agency, has said it aims to halve greenhouse gas emissions from 2008 levels by 2050.
Investor and activist pressure is prompting companies to look to speed up reducing the industry's carbon footprint. 
Denmark's A.P. Moller-Maersk, which owns the world's no. 1 container shipping line, has joined with Norwegian vehicle shipping group Wallenius Wilhelmsen, Swedish fashion retailer H&M, British retailer Marks & Spencer, denim apparel maker Levi Strauss & Co (NYSE:LEVI) and carmaker BMW to look into testing an alternative fuel called LEO, which is a blend of lignin and ethanol. 
Lignin, a low-value waste product from ethanol production typically burned for industrial power, can be dissolved in ethanol to create LEO. 
John Kornerup, Maersk's chief adviser for climate change, said LEO would enable the use of the inexpensive energy contained in the lignin waste product to produce a lower-cost, carbon-neutral fuel that can be burned on large marine engines. 
""As such it has the potential to become a viable solution,"" he told Reuters on Tuesday.
Copenhagen University is engaged in laboratory work on the fuel before the project moves to a test phase on small stationary engines in the second quarter of 2020. 
Kornerup said depending on the success of further testing phases and on actual ships, the project could become operational in a couple of years. He declined to comment on how much would be invested in the initiative.
""Regardless the final outcome, this project will significantly contribute to the overall understanding of the issues and the potential solutions to shipping's decarbonization challenge,"" he said. 
Lina Ödeen, sustainability manager with H&M Group's global logistics, said it sourced the majority of its transport needs by sea to their warehouses. 
""We believe we have to move towards other alternatives, such as biofuel, which is what is being developed under the LEO coalition,"" Ödeen told Reuters.

Shipping companies are exploring solutions ranging from using high quality paint to working on infrastructure to enable zero carbon ships to be on the water by 2030, which is seen as the latest time to be ready for 2050 given that ships have a lifespan of up to 25 years.

The company expects revenue of $315 million to $335 million in the quarter. Analysts had been looking for $368 million. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were projected at $15 million to $25 million. To move forward, the company said it must spend more to expand its list of restaurant clients and keep consumers using its app. 
While revenue was up 30% in the third quarter to $322 million, analysts tracked by Investing.com had expected $330 million. Adjusted earnings were in line at 27 cents a share. Dining orders were down 15% from a year ago, on top of an 11% decline in the second quarter. 
Competition is intensifying from the likes of Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER), DoorDash and Post Mates. That's forcing GrubHub to offer free delivery for customers of important restaurant chains like KFC, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) and Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA).
The stock hit a 52-week high of $97.96 in February and has lost 65% of its value since. It went public at $26 in 2014 and peaked at $147 in early 2018.

U.S. sales, which account for the biggest share of the company's total revenue, fell to $3.13 billion from $5.13 billion a year earlier.
Sales in China rose 64% to $669 million and its other segment, which covers the rest of the globe, rose by more than a billion dollars to $1.83 billion, a regulatory filing showed.
""Musk & Co. are laser-focused on Europe and China for growth, while domestically, core demand is fading relative to other regions,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said, adding that U.S. growth will remain more challenging going forward.
In its earnings report earlier this month, Tesla reported a nearly 8% drop in total revenue to $6.30 billion, missing analysts' average estimate of $6.33 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. It did not break down sales by geography in the report.
The company, however, surprised investors with a quarterly profit, making good on Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk's promise, as it delivered a record 97,000 cars.
The company has said it plans to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles for all of 2019, and that it was ""highly confident in exceeding 360,000 deliveries this year.""
The drop in sales in its domestic market in the latest reported quarter compares with a 55% rise in the second quarter ended June.
Tesla did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the reason for the fall in the U.S. market.
Tesla is expanding its service in other markets including China and Europe, as Musk is under pressure to make Tesla sustainably profitable, while still spending on major initiatives ranging from a Shanghai factory and assembly-line to upcoming models such as the Model Y SUV and a Semi commercial truck.
The company forecast capital expenditure to be slightly below $1.5 billion in 2019.
In the filing, Tesla also said it had a provision for warranty of $138 million in the third quarter versus $187 million last year.
The filing shows warranty adjustments and other one-time items are a large driver of perceived strength, Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said, who downgraded stock to ""sell"" from ""neutral"", adding that he sees margins as unsustainable. 

The company's shares were down nearly 3% at $318.66.

The company’s post-IPO share lockup period expired, paving the way for early investors to potentially take profits in the company, whose shares are up more than 200% since its IPO.
Beyond Meat fell 19% to $85.33.
Pre-IPO shareholders are usually restricted from selling shares in a company for a period between 90 and 180 days after it goes public.
Despite the drop, sentiment on the company remained bullish after it reported earnings that beat estimates compiled by Investing.com.
Beyond Meat raised full-year guidance and reported earnings of 6 cents per share on revenue of $91.96 billion.
The company guided full-year revenue in a range of $265 million to $275 million, up from a previous forecast of more than $240 million.
The earnings beat was driven by a 250% jump in sales amid increasing demand for meatless products.
But with demand for meatless products on the rise, competition is heating up.
In its post-earnings call, Beyond Meat warned that it may have to slash prices to stay ahead of rivals like Impossible Foods and Nestle.
Despite the rise in competition, the company will likely continue to boost manufacturing and marketing, which in the long run will support revenue growth.
""With management currently compromising profitability at the EBITDA level for manufacturing investments and marketing, we believe this is the right strategy to continue to deliver outstanding top-line growth coupled with healthy levels of profitability for what still can be seen as a young company in an emerging food category,""   Barclays   (LON:BARC) said in a recent note."

""The banks have raised an issue around intra-day liquidity, and that is something that makes sense for regulators to look at,"" Mnuchin told Bloomberg in an interview on Tuesday in Tel Aviv.
His comments came after weeks of turmoil in overnight lending markets that banks rely on for short-term funding needs.
While Mnuchin has sway over general financial policy-making in Washington, the Treasury Secretary has very little direct control over the nuts and bolts of bank regulation. The overwhelming share of that work falls to independent banking regulators including the Federal Reserve, which so far has resisted calls to ease liquidity regulations. 
The Fed was forced to step in and provide liquidity in those markets after rates suddenly spiked, its first intervention there since the global financial crisis. The New York Federal Reserve already extended its support to that market, committing to offer at least $75 billion a day in cash injections market through Nov. 4.
Big U.S. banks have said liquidity requirements imposed by the Fed contributed to the market issues and that those required buffers have discouraged banks from lending in those markets. Fed Chairman Jay Powell said in September he did not believe liquidity requirements were too high.
""It’s not impossible that we would come to a view that the (liquidity coverage ratio) is calibrated too high, but that’s not something that we think right now,"" he said at a press conference.
Mnuchin told Bloomberg he agreed with the Fed's assessment that the turmoil was largely caused by a ""technical issue,"" but expressed openness toward broader policy changes.
""It’s a reasonable question: Have we gone too far in the other direction in requiring the banks to maintain this excess liquidity for intra-day operations?,"" he added.
While specific rule changes would likely have to go through a formal and lengthy Fed rule-making process, the central bank can take a more relaxed approach when enforcing existing rules.
Earlier this month, Reuters reported that banks believed they had received the greenlight from Fed supervisors to hold more Treasury debt and less cash, a move that could help boost liquidity in that market.

A Treasury spokesman declined to elaborate on Mnuchin's remarks when asked by Reuters. A Fed spokesman declined to comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S.-China trade war persists as an impediment to the growth of U.S. companies, even as the two countries appear close to clinching a limited agreement.
In third-quarter corporate reports over the past few weeks, companies such as  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), 3M Co (N:MMM) and Texas Instruments Inc (O:TXN) have blamed the protracted trade dispute for undermining their revenue or profits as well as their financial outlooks.
On Friday, the U.S. Trade Representative's office said the United States and China were ""close to finalizing"" parts of a trade deal. 
But judging by several companies' comments, trade-related challenges may have an abiding impact on their results for several quarters to come.
In its post-earnings conference call on Thursday, for instance, 3M said it expected ""continued softness"" in China through at least the fourth quarter and cut its full-year profit forecast. China's slowing economy hurt factory production, leading to weakened demand for 3M's automotive products. The company's shares fell 4.1% on Thursday, their biggest one-day drop since April.
Texas Instruments, whose shares sank 7.5% after the chipmaker's quarterly report late last Tuesday, struck a similar tone.
""This thing, we've been in it for four quarters, and it's going to be longer than that,"" Rafael Lizardi, senior vice president of finance and operations, said during the company's conference call with analysts, in reference to trade tensions.
Several companies, such as Honeywell International Inc (N:HON), have said they have been able to mitigate the impact of tariffs. 
But, according to some investors, the tariffs themselves may not be the biggest worry as the U.S.-China trade war has also sapped business confidence.

Moreover, several chipmakers, including  Xilinx Inc  (O:XLNX) and Micron Technology Inc (O:MU), have taken a financial hit from the United States' blacklisting of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/u-s-blacklists-chinas-huawei-as-trade-dispute-clouds-global-outlook-idUSKCN1SL2DI Technologies Co Ltd , a move the White House has said would not be addressed in the ""Phase 1"" trade agreement.
""That would be the bigger thing than tariffs by far,"" Xilinx Chief Executive Victor Peng said of the White House's continued restrictions on Huawei during the company's post-earnings conference call on Wednesday.
To be sure, investors have largely shrugged off negative results so far this earnings season. 
The benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) stock index hit a record high on Monday. Shares of Caterpillar and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) rose after their reports even though results were well below estimates.
The fallout from the trade war reported so far from companies may not be as bad as investors had feared, said Jamie Cox, managing partner of Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia.
""I've actually been happy with what I've seen,"" he said.
The number of S&P 500 companies that have mentioned the term ""tariff"" so far this earnings season is 59, down slightly from 66 over a comparable period in the second-quarter reporting season, according to data as of Friday from FactSet.
As of Tuesday, nearly half of the S&P 500 companies had reported quarterly results.
Even so, some market watchers were concerned that fallout from the trade war may be spreading beyond bellwethers such as industrial companies and chipmakers.
Toymaker  Hasbro Inc  (O:HAS), for instance, said uncertainty over tariffs had caused retailers to cancel or delay orders. Hasbro shares fell 16.8% on Tuesday after its quarterly revenue and profit came in below Wall Street estimates.
Seasoning maker McCormick & Co (N:MKC), even though it posted stronger-than-expected earnings and raised its forecast, was among companies expressing some wariness over China.
""We're cautious about China,"" McCormick Chairman and Chief Executive Lawrence Kurzius, said during the company's Oct. 1 earnings call. ""We just had a great quarter in China, but we are aware of the volatile environment that we're in.""
Consequently, even companies relatively insulated from the trade war could see some strain as the conflict weighs on the global economy, said Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private in Boston.

""Deep cyclical (stocks) have always traded on the trade war,"" she said. ""But what we're seeing in the results is that negative sentiment is starting to bleed over to other areas.""

915,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 11:55AM ET</span>",GM earnings beat lifts shares but U.S. strike weighs on outlook,"By Nick Carey and Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Tuesday posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit on robust U.S. demand for its lucrative pickup trucks and SUVs, offsetting the $3-billion hit from a U.S. labor strike that led it to slash its earnings forecast.
Wall Street analysts have viewed the strike costs as a tradeoff for three U.S. plant closures agreed to with the union that will boost GM's profitability. Shares in GM were up 4.3% in midday trading.
""The underlying business was strong this quarter,"" Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara told reporters at GM's headquarters, describing the strike as a ""one-time impact.""
Last Friday, the 48,000 United Auto Workers union members at GM ratified a new four-year labor deal with the Detroit company, ending a 40-day strike. RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak in a research note called the deal's financial impact ""manageable."" 
The Detroit-based automaker reported a 6% increase in third-quarter U.S. sales, led by its highly-profitable full-size pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers that helped it race to a strong profit margin of almost 11% in North America. It's that underlying business that has investors excited.
""Frankly, I'm as emboldened as ever,"" said Chris Susanin, co-portfolio manager at Levin Easterly Partners, which owned more than 4 million GM shares at the end of June. ""I don't see why this stock isn't north of $100 (a share) in a couple years.""
Virtually all of the pre-tax profits came from its North American business and its captive finance arm.
In China, where GM reported a 17.5% drop in third-quarter sales, the company's equity income fell 40% to $300 million.
It was the fifth straight quarterly sales decline for GM in China, the world's largest auto market, where the industry is expecting a second consecutive annual sales drop.
The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers expects a 5% decline in industry sales in 2019, then contracting or growing slowly over the next three years.
""It (China) remains volatile,"" GM CFO Suryadevara said. Last week, GM's smaller U.S. rival, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, cut its forecast for operating profit for the year after a disappointing quarter hurt by higher warranty costs, bigger discounts and weaker-than-expected performance in China.
GM said the strike by the UAW had cost it $1 billion in pre-tax profits in the quarter, or 52 cents per share. CFO Suryadevara said the automaker lost around 300,000 units of vehicle production during the strike. GM will not recover most of that loss in 2019 and any recovery next year will be dependent on U.S. market demand.
The union wrung higher pay and other benefits from GM as part of the deal to end the strike.
Under the deal, GM will invest $9 billion in the United States, including $7.7 billion directly in its plants, with the rest going to joint ventures. 
The No. 1 U.S. automaker said the full-year impact of the strike would be around $2 per share, or around $3 billion.
GM said it now expected full-year adjusted earnings per share between $4.50 to $4.80, down from its previous forecast of $6.50 to $7 per share. 
The company said it now expected full-year adjusted automotive free cash flow in a range from zero to $1 billion, down from its previous forecast of $4.5 billion to $6 billion. GM's adjusted automotive free cash flow stood at $2.4 billion at the end of the third quarter. The strike reduced cash flow for the year by about $5.5 billion.
GM also cut its projected 2019 capital expenditures to around $7.5 billion from its previous outlook of $8 billion to $9 billion. Suryadevara said no plans were cut and the lower spend was due to operating efficiencies.
GM will provide more detailed forecasts for 2020 early next year, but Suryadevara said one expected 2020 challenge will likely be lower U.S. industry sales.
The automaker posted third-quarter net income of $2.3 billion, or $1.60 a share, down from $2.5 billion, or $1.75 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, GM earned $1.72 a share. Analysts had expected $1.31, on average, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Revenue fell slightly to $35.47 billion from $35.79 billion, above analysts' estimates of $33.82 billion.

917,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 11:38AM ET</span>",Boeing CEO tells U.S. lawmakers at hearing: 'We've made mistakes'; faces tough questions,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg was pressed by U.S. lawmakers at a hearing on Tuesday over what the company knew about its MCAS stall-prevention system linked to two deadly crashes, and about delays in turning over internal 2016 messages that described erratic behavior of the software in a simulator.
Muilenburg acknowledged errors in failing to give pilots more information on MCAS before the crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia, as well as for failing to tell the Federal Aviation Administration for months that it made an alarm alerting pilots to a mismatch of flight data optional on the 737 MAX.
""We've made mistakes and we got some things wrong. We're improving and we're learning,"" he said.
The hearing, the highest-profile congressional scrutiny of commercial aviation safety in years, adds pressure on a newly rejigged Boeing senior management team fighting to repair trust with airline customers and passengers shaken by an eight-month safety ban on its 737 MAX following the crashes.
Muilenburg's appearance marks the first time Boeing has appeared at a hearing on Capitol Hill in the year since the first fatal crash, as the company had previously resisted earlier requests to testify.
Asked ahead of the hearing if he would resign, Muilenburg said that was ""not where my focus is."" He also declined to say if he or the board were considering his resignation after the plane returns to service.
For months, Boeing had largely failed to acknowledge blame, instead vowing to make a ""safe plane safer."" Tuesday's hearing represents Boeing's broadest acceptance of responsibility that it made mistakes.
U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, questioned Muilenburg over the company's delay in releasing internal messages. In those messages, a former test pilot described erratic behavior of a simulator version of the same software now linked to the deadly crashes, and also mentioned ""Jedi-mind tricking"" regulators over training requirements. 
Wicker said those messages revealed a ""disturbing level of casualness and flippancy.""
Muilenburg said he apologized to the FAA administrator for the delay in turning over the messages, and said additional documents would likely be provided over time. 
""We will cooperate fully,"" Muilenburg added.
In his opening remarks, Muilenburg walked the committee through software upgrades to limit the authority of the stall-prevention system, known as MCAS, that has been linked to both crashes, as well as changes to improve safety oversight and transparency inside the company. 
During one particularly tense exchange, Senator Maria Cantwell grilled Muilenburg and John Hamilton, a senior engineering executive, over the extent of testing on the MCAS system. Cantwell asked Hamilton whether it was a mistake for Boeing not to test a failure mode similar to the scenarios faced by pilots in the crashes. 
""In hindsight, senator, yes"", Hamilton said. Both he and Muilenburg, however, pointed to extensive testing by engineers and pilots during the certification process that lasted years.
Muilenburg also acknowledged a ""mistake on that implementation"" for failing to tell the FAA for 13 months that it inadvertently made a so-called angle of attack disagree alert optional on the 737 MAX, instead of standard as on earlier 737s. The company insisted the missing display represented no safety risk.
""We got the implementation wrong,"" Muilenburg said, referring to the angle of attack disagree alert. 
He added: ""One of the things we've learned ... is we need to provide additional information on MCAS to pilots.""
Boeing on Tuesday ran full-page advertisements in major newspapers expressing condolences to the families and loved ones of those killed in the crashes. 
""These two accidents occurred on my watch and I have a keen sense of responsibility,"" Muilenburg, who was stripped of his title as Boeing chairman by the board earlier this month, told reporters.
Family members, holding photos of victims of the crash, were seated just three rows behind Muilenburg during his testimony.
Wicker addressed the families, saying: ""I promise to their loved ones that we will find out what went wrong and work to prevent future tragedies.""

918,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 11:33AM ET</span>",Mnuchin Open to Looser Rules Backed by Dimon to Ease Repo Stress,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is open to loosening financial crisis-era regulations that have stiffened liquidity rules for big banks to relieve possible cash crunches in short-term funding markets.
Mnuchin said in an interview Tuesday that he had spoken to Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., and other banks about how to avoid liquidity problems.
“The banks have raised an issue around intra-day liquidity, and that is something that makes sense for regulators to look at,” Mnuchin said in Tel Aviv, his first stop during an 11-day trip through the Middle East and India.
There may be a way around current regulations that creates more intra-day liquidity without raising risks, according to Mnuchin.
Turmoil last month that led the Fed to inject liquidity for the first time in a decade is largely a result of the “technical issue” of a corporate tax deadline draining money from the banking system, Mnuchin said, expressing a widely held view. The dysfunction has kept the U.S. central bank pumping money to quell a surge in short-term rates that was pushing up its policy benchmark rate. The operations also eased the pain of hedge funds and broker-dealers that need to finance their Treasury holdings.
Repo glitches have cast a spotlight on how thoroughly the environment for short-term funding has changed since the 2008 credit crisis, according to bank executives, traders and observers of the market. They said that’s even created a generational gap: Big banks and regulators have seen so little repo-market turmoil in recent years that they have lost some of their reflexes.
Mnuchin said he believes the Fed has resolved the technical issues that caused the glitch and he doesn’t expect them to happen again, adding that any issues with regulations are separate.
But banks say a strict liquidity requirement instituted after the financial crisis is also a contributing factor.
To Big to Fail
Regulations introduced after 2008 oblige financial institutions to hold more cash and cash-like assets as a buffer against times of stress. Systemically important banks -- JPMorgan is the largest in the U.S. -- face year-end reviews to determine how much more common equity they must carry.
Dimon has said his firm had the cash and willingness to calm repo markets when they went haywire in September, but regulations held it back.
Instead, the Fed began daily liquidity injections, as market forces alone weren’t able to calm the ructions. Even as repo rates have since returned to more normal levels, the Fed has also resumed purchases of Treasuries to bolster bank reserves.
JPMorgan is building its case, with analysts warning that money-market stress is likely to get much worse despite the Fed’s attempts to fix the problem. Conviction is also lacking that the central bank has resolved the issues in the funding markets.
“It’s a reasonable question: Have we gone too far in the other direction in requiring the banks to maintain this excess liquidity for intra-day operations?” Mnuchin said.
Warren’s Letter
However, banks are unwilling to go negative with their accounts at the Fed, citing regulatory burdens.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly vowed to loosen the leash on Wall Street, but some of regulators’ most meaningful efforts to revamp post-crisis constraints on big banks have run into problems.
Any further effort to loosen the rules is also likely to face push-back. Senator Elizabeth Warren already waded into the debate around last month’s repo turmoil, warning Mnuchin not to use the incident as a rationale for weakening post-crisis regulations.
Warren, a front-runner in the race to challenge Trump in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, sent a letter to the Treasury earlier this month seeking Mnuchin’s views on what triggered the spike in rates for repurchase agreements and expressed concern about potential costs to businesses and consumers if strains persist."

KIGALI (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is importing a batch of electric powered Golf models into Rwanda for a local ride-hailing service, establishing a bridgehead in the country that it hopes to expand to other nations as it seeks to increase market share globally.
Importing the vehicles into Rwanda, which sells itself to foreign investors on its reliable infrastructure, stability and relative ease of doing business, and where VW already assembles cars, is initially intended to test infrastructure and performance in the region's climate.
""We’ve been investing more than $30 billion into new electric vehicles and platforms and the entire world is moving in that direction,"" VW's Africa boss Thomas Schaefer told Reuters. ""The plan for Africa is that ultimately, we replace the whole fleet into electric.""
VW, which has a global target of producing 600,000 electric cars a year by 2022, is starting small in Kigali, importing 50 eGolf models in the first few months. The vehicles - combustion-engine cars modified to run on electricity - will be integrated into the company's app-driven ""Move"" service, launched last December.
German power equipment firm  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) will build 15 charging stations in Kigali.
The stations can charge up to 80 percent of a car's battery within an hour, although it takes around 11 hours to charge a car at home, said Andile Dlamini, the group's communications officer. The eGolf's range, fully charged, is up to 230 kilometers. VW's new ID3 models to be launched next year will have a range of 600 km.
Rwanda has an installed power generation capacity of 286 MW the cars would mainly charge at night, when there is an excess of power. Unlike many African nations, Rwandan electricity is relatively reliable.
Rwanda’s prime minister Edouard Ngirente said he hoped electric car use could expand, noting fuel products were Rwanda's biggest import last year.
Schaefer acknowledged the high price of electric cars would not appeal to most African consumers, but said scaling up production and favorable government policy could help bring prices down.
""The Rwandan government is working on electric vehicle policy and if that policy favors electric cars over traditional, then that development can happen very fast,” Schaefer said."

(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) posted third-quarter profit well above analysts' estimates on higher sales of cancer drug Ibrance and new heart medicine Vyndaqel, encouraging the largest U.S. drugmaker to lift its earnings forecast for the year.
Shares of the company rose 3.4% on Tuesday as the results suggested that Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla's efforts to slim down the sprawling drugmaker were paying off.
Pfizer announced in July it would separate its off-patent branded drugs business and combine it with generic drugmaker Mylan NV (O:MYL), allowing it to focus on its more profitable drugs.
Bourla said on Tuesday Pfizer would become a ""smaller, science-based company"" following the Mylan deal, which is expected to close next year.
Pfizer raised its 2019 adjusted earnings per share forecast to between $2.94 and $3.00 from a prior estimate of between $2.76 and $2.86. Analysts on average were expecting $2.82 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES.
Although sales of Ibrance rose to $1.28 billion and those of rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz jumped nearly 39% to $599 million, analysts called out Vyndaqel as the biggest surprise in the quarter.
Vyndaqel, chemically known as tafamidis, was approved in May and brought in revenue of $156 million, nearly double the consensus estimate of $82 million. 
Priced at $225,000 per year, Vyndaqel's high cost has faced criticism, with experts affiliated with Boston-based Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) warning that it could be among the most costly cardiovascular treatments ever sold.
""Importantly, Ibrance is back to strong growth after a period of slowing ... (and) the Vyndaqel number in particular is impressive,"" UBS analyst Navin Jacob said.
The company also said sales of its patented medicines benefited from demand in emerging markets, which contribute about a quarter of total sales.
Net income attributable to Pfizer's shareholders rose nearly 87% to $7.68 billion, or $1.36 per share, as the company recognized a gain of $8.1 billion after closing its consumer health joint venture with Britain's GlaxoSmithKline Plc (L:GSK).
Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 75 cents per share, easily beating the average estimate of 62 cents.
Investor sentiment on Pfizer has been poor since it announced the deal with Mylan, making the third-quarter beat a relief, Jacob said.
Including Tuesday's gains, Pfizer shares had lost about 11% of their value since the deal with Mylan was announced.
Total revenue fell about 5% to $12.68 billion as sales of pain treatment Lyrica, which recently lost patent protection in the United States, more than halved to $527 million.

926,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 09:31AM ET</span>",EU should revise fiscal rules to free up spending on climate: advisers,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union should revise its fiscal rules to allow governments to spend more on policies to fight climate change and infrastructure, an independent advisory body said on Tuesday.
With the euro zone's economy slowing, the rationale of fiscal rules that were hastily tightened after the EU debt crisis of 2010-12 is now widely questioned.
In its annual report, the European Fiscal Board (EFB) - which advises the EU's executive European Commission - said the rules present ""a number of weaknesses.""
It urged an overhaul that would allow states to increase ""productive"" investments that could boost growth even in belt-tightening periods. Among them, it listed investments in digital infrastructure and to help in the ""mitigation of climate change"".
""Countries could voluntarily top up expenditures beyond their co-financing commitments (to the EU). Additional spending in the identified areas should be excluded from the calculation of the net primary expenditures,"" it said.
The EFB, which is in charge of assessing EU fiscal policies, proposed similar changes last year but they were not enacted. Its call could carry more weight this year as the European Commission is carrying out a periodic review of fiscal rules.
Top financial bodies, such as the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, have called for more expansionary fiscal policies to boost growth in the slowdown. 
Mario Centeno, the head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers from countries that use the euro currency, has also expressed support for this fiscal stance to counter recession risk, echoing calls from Italy and other countries with low economic growth. 
But Germany, the EU's largest economy, has resisted changes, fearing they could reduce pressure on countries with large public debts, such as Italy and Greece, to pursue structural reforms. 
SIMPLER RULES
The EFB acknowledged in its report that highly indebted governments have done little to reduce their debt burden, but recognized that the efforts required by a strict interpretation of the rules might have been disproportionate.
The European Commission, which is in charge of monitoring EU states' budgets, has applied the rules with broad discretion, the EFB said.
While this could have avoided a worsening of the economic situation in some crisis countries, it has also weakened the rules, it said.
To address these shortcomings, the EFB suggested moving away from uniform fiscal targets and tailoring goals to individual nations.
The exclusion from fiscal requirements of investment in infrastructure and in protecting the climate is already permitted in exceptional circumstances, but the EFB wants to give states more leeway to continue investing during hard times. That would also help the EU meet its targets on cutting carbon emissions. 
The EFB wants simpler rules that can be enforced more effectively. Existing regulations envisage sanctions for wrongdoers but they have never been imposed. 
States with high debts should focus only on capping their net expenditure, which excludes debt servicing costs and unemployment benefit payments, the EFB said. 
But if applied now, the new rule would already be flouted by France and Italy, which this month submitted their 2020 budgets with a net expenditure growth well above what was recommended by Brussels.

Power, LMC Automotive","(Reuters) - U.S. auto sales are expected to dip 1.3% in October from the same period a year ago, auto consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Tuesday, as replacement demand slows following a long bull run since the 2008 financial crisis.
The consultancies expect total U.S. vehicle sales of about 1.39 million units for October, with retail sales of new vehicles declining about 1% to 1.13 million units.
Large discounts from manufacturers are powering top-line industry results for October, J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said in a statement.
""Incentive spending is on pace to exceed $4,000 per unit for the fourth consecutive month as record levels of old model-year inventory persist,"" the consultancies added.
They estimate average new-vehicle sales price to cross $34,000 for the first time in October, and up almost $1,300 from a year earlier.
The rise in prices is partly due to the ongoing shift in demand toward more expensive trucks and sport utility vehicles, which are expected to make up for more than 72% of the vehicle sales in October, up 2.4 percentage points from last year. 
Higher prices mean that U.S. consumers are expected to spend $38.8 billion on new vehicles in the month, up nearly $2.5 billion from a year ago, the consultancies said.
""Trade risk and vehicle affordability remain top concerns for the coming year, but the economy is expected to remain supportive with growth at a sub-2% level.""

Shares of GrubHub slumped 34% in early trading, after it forecasted slowing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, pushing at least two brokerages to downgrade the stock and cut their price targets.
""Most concerning is that the new strategic plan is unproven, creating greater uncertainty,"" Guggenheim analysts said, shedding their rating on the stock to ""neutral"" from ""buy"".
GrubHub, one of the early pioneers in the industry, has been battling growing competition from startups such as DoorDash and Uber Technologies' (N:UBER) Uber Eats.
In response, the company has spent heavily on promotions to attract customers. The Chicago-based company has also tried to increase its market share by partnering with various companies, including a recent deal with Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (O:DNKN).
In a letter to shareholders on Monday, Chief Executive Officer Matt Maloney said diners were becoming ""more promiscuous"" and that the company would reduce its advertising spending and instead focus on growing the number of brands on its platform by adding non-partnered restaurants. (https://s2.q4cdn.com/772508021/files/doc_financials/2019/q3/October-2019-Shareholder-Letter.pdf)
""We will be moving quickly, spending more and trying many different strategies over the next 12-18 months to increase restaurant supply aggressively while making our diner experience more sticky - effectively taking action to remove any reason for diners to look anywhere else.""
Typically, online food delivery often has one clear winner as users download and use only one app, constricting the market to one or two major players.
BTIG analyst Peter Saleh said GrubHub's strategy to invest more to add restaurants and increase customer loyalty through various rewards and incentive programs could take several years to bear fruit - and will not be well received by investors.
Shares of GrubHub were trading at $38.50 before the bell, significantly below the stock's median price target of $86. If premarket losses hold, the stock would have its worst day ever and open the lowest in over two years."

DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco aims to announce the start of its initial public offering (IPO) on Nov. 3, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, after delaying the deal earlier this month to give advisers time to secure cornerstone investors.
The people also said Aramco's chief executive officer, Amin Nasser, was not present at the conference on Tuesday as he was meeting investors abroad ahead of the offering.
Aramco is looking to float a 1% to 2% stake on the kingdom’s Tadawul market, in what would be one of the largest ever public offerings, worth upwards of $20 billion. 
Aramco, in response to queries by Reuters, said on Tuesday the oil company ""does not comment on rumor or speculation. The company continues to engage with the shareholders on IPO readiness activities. The company is ready and timing will depend on market conditions and be at a time of the shareholders' choosing.""
The people declined to be identified due to commercial sensitivities.
The company will soon have more shareholders from institutions, the head of the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, Yassir al-Rumayyan, said. 
Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Public Investment Fund (PIF) and chairman of Aramco's board of directors, was speaking at a panel at the conference in Riyadh.
Aramco will start subscription for investors in its initial public offering on Dec. 4, Saudi-owned news channel Al-Arabiya said in a news flash on Tuesday citing sources.
The oil giant plans to announce the transaction's price on Nov. 17, it added. The company will begin trading on the local stock market, the Tadawul, on Dec. 11, the broadcaster reported. 
The prospect of Aramco selling a piece of itself has had Wall Street on tenterhooks since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first flagged it three years ago.
However, his desired $2 trillion valuation has always been questioned by some financiers and industry experts, who note that countries have been accelerating efforts to shift away from fossil fuels to curb global warming, putting oil prices under pressure and undermining producers’ equity value.
Russia's sovereign wealth fund, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), is working on a consortium of investors for Aramco's IPO, its chief executive said.
“There are several Russian pensions funds who are interested to invest in the Aramco IPO and we have also received indications from our Russia-China fund of some Chinese major institutions also interested in Aramco IPO,"" Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) head Kirill Dmitriev told reporters on Tuesday.
Separately, Aramco has not approached the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) to invest in the IPO, the sovereign wealth fund's managing director Farouk Bastaki said on Tuesday.
""KIA has not been approached by Aramco or its advisers for the IPO, and KIA will look at the IPO like any other investment,"" Bastaki told reporters on the sidelines of an investment conference in Riyadh.
Singapore Exchange Limited's chief executive Boon Chye Loh on Tuesday declined to comment directly on whether the exchange was in talks about a future international listing of Aramco in Singapore. 

""As an exchange that offers efficient access into almost 100% of Asia, we are as attractive as any other exchange for any other company looking for capital raising,"" he said on the sidelines of the conference in Riyadh.

930,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 08:40AM ET</span>","After Boeing crashes, jet design rules to get tougher for all","By Marcelo Rochabrun and Tim Hepher
BRASILIA/PARIS (Reuters) - Planemakers worldwide face tougher scrutiny and changes in the way aircraft are certified in the aftermath of two fatal crashes of Boeing 737 MAX jets, leading regulators have told Reuters.
Tuesday marks one year since the deadly crash of a Lion Air jet, which Indonesian investigators linked in part to violent seesaw movements triggered by flawed anti-stall software.
The MCAS software, activated by a single faulty sensor and omitted from training manuals, has led to calls for tighter regulation as well as improvements in the training of pilots.
""The certification process will change; I think so,"" the head of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, Steve Dickson, told Reuters late on Monday at an airlines meeting in Brazil.
Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX aircraft have been grounded around the world since March following a second fatal crash, this time involving a plane operated by Ethiopian Airlines.
Speaking to airlines earlier, Dickson also emphasized a need to raise standards for airplane pilot training globally.
A recent report by international regulators, commissioned by the FAA, faulted processes at both the U.S regulator and Boeing.
But the impact of the crisis is likely to be felt worldwide, including at Boeing's rival Airbus and new entrants from Russia to China and Japan, as regulators step up efforts to ensure that risks are correctly identified right from the drawing board.
""We are going to make it harder,"" Patrick Ky, executive director of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), told Reuters when asked about the future of certification in general, without naming countries or companies.
""In the future we may ask to have a larger set of data which will be used in the certification case than today,"" he added.
In part, that will involve using new technology to run simulations to spot flaws that may be missed in flight testing.
But regulators are also expected to take a close look at one of the key tenets of aviation safety, an obscure piece of regulation known as the ""Changed Product Rule"".
Under this rule, manufacturers revamping an old design like the 737 only need to comply with latest regulations on systems undergoing major changes, which means risks must be understood.
For the rest of the aircraft, the original standards still apply, which in the case of the 737 date back to the 1960s.
That is no problem when risks are small, officials say.
But this month's international regulatory panel report said the rule did not adequately address the cumulative effects of individual changes on small systems.
""In general, the analysis was limited to areas that changed, re-using prior certification basis to complete the process,"" former Boeing engineer Peter Lemme wrote in a blog on Tuesday, citing a series of flawed assumptions used in the design.
BIG PICTURE
The Joint Authorities Technical Review (JATR) also found Boeing had missed the big picture by focusing on whether individual systems like MCAS complied with regulations, without also taking a top-down view of the impact on the whole aircraft.
Boeing's chief executive was due to tell a Senate committee on Tuesday that it made mistakes over the MAX.
It has also said it is committed to working with regulators in reviewing the recommendations in the JATR report.
One regulator told Reuters a review of the Changed Product Rule would be among the main changes stemming from the crisis.
That could have implications for airplane design after years in which global planemakers have focused on upgrading existing models before tackling costlier clean-sheet designs.
""There is nothing wrong with derivatives; it is just (a question of) how we certify with full confidence the way in which modifications are made from an existing type,"" Ky said.
Others say regulators are likely to check each other's homework more actively than in the past, while preserving a convention that allows the home regulator for each planemaker to take the lead, such as the FAA for Boeing or EASA for Airbus.
Safety officials don't expect this to lead to meddling by foreign regulators on routine design changes. But post-MAX, agencies are likely to be vigilant when the risks warrant it.
The JATR also broke with tradition by suggesting companies should design systems with an over-arching vision of safety in mind, not just ensure their work complied with regulations.
Some saw this as a rare rebuff to the decades-old framework of aviation safety, which depends on thousands of rules and regulations with its own United Nations agency to oversee them.
One engineer outside the United States voiced concern about the move, saying record-low accident rates demonstrated there was no conflict between compliance and safety. But the JATR said the process as it stood had not managed to identify every risk."

Total production, excluding Libya, rose 98,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) to 1.322 million boe/d, with output from U.S. basins including Eagle Ford, Bakken and the Permian rising 21% in the quarter.
The company's results kick off a quarter for U.S. shale producers that is expected to see sharp earnings declines on a year-over-year basis, as lower oil and gas prices and pressures to cut costs weigh on profits.
ConocoPhillips said the total realized price per barrel of oil equivalent fell 18% to $47.07 in the quarter.
The world's largest independent oil and gas producer has been divesting its non-core assets to focus on its U.S. shale assets and earlier this month, agreed to sell its northern Australian business to partner Santos Ltd (AX:STO) for $1.39 billion.
Net earnings rose to $3.1 billion, or $2.74 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $1.9 billion, or $1.59 per share, a year earlier.
ConocoPhillips recorded a gain from the $2.68 billion sale of its U.K. assets to North Sea oil producer Chrysaor.

The state-owned oil producer disclosed the unaudited net figure to financial analysts working on its planned initial public offering, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information isn’t public. Aramco has not published comparative numbers for the same period last year and its media office declined to comment.
When the Saudi company disclosed financial results for the first time earlier this year, showing income of $111 billion for all of 2018, it vaulted to the top of the list of the planet’s highest-earning businesses. Its nine-month income alone exceeded the 2018 net posted by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., the most profitable publicly traded company, and is more than the annual earnings of  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)., the biggest listed oil firm.
Saudi Arabia is lifting the veil on the financials of its crown jewel as it hurries to conclude what may be the world’s biggest share sale ever by the end of the year. Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is counting on Aramco’s profit and the nation’s vast oil reserves to attract investors to the company’s IPO, which in turn will help fund his plan to overhaul the Saudi economy.
Vastly profitable though the company is, the Saudis have struggled to persuade investors to accept their valuation of $2 trillion or more. The IPO process will begin on Sunday and shares of Aramco will start trading on the Saudi stock exchange on Dec. 11, Saudi television news channel Al Arabiya reported on Tuesday. The company has pledged to pay a dividend of at least $75 billion next year.
The earnings cover a period during which the company was dealing with one of the biggest crises in its history. Aerial attacks on its facilities in September briefly slashed output by half. Aramco says it restored production shortly after that attacks and relied on crude in storage and swapped between different grades to honor all of its commitments to customers."

Thousands of residents have already fled and hundreds of thousands of others were left in the dark with power companies cut off electricity to try to prevent more fires being sparked by snapped cabling in the brushland.
""I know this moment generates a tremendous amount of anxiety,"" California Governor Gavin Newsom said on Monday about the two major blazes burning at opposite ends of the state.
The latest fire broke out near the Getty Center museum, housing priceless artworks, on the west side of Los Angeles, hundreds of miles from where crews were fighting the biggest and most destructive fire, the Kincade, north of San Francisco.
Los Angeles Lakers basketball great LeBron James, ""Terminator"" actor and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, as well other celebrities, said on Twitter they had been forced to leave their homes.
Weather forecasters are forecasting there could be worse to come.
""The worst of this (weather) is coming later today and tonight,"" Marc Chenard, a forecaster with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center, said early on Tuesday.
""The winds in the south will really pick up, 50-to-70 mph with some gusts up to 80 mph in the Los Angeles mountain area.""
The so-called Santa Ana winds in the south could hit their worst levels of the season and last into late Thursday, Chenard said, adding that northern California will not be spared either.
Until at least Wednesday, in the bone-dry wine country about 70 miles north of San Francisco, winds will hit up to 65 mph in the mountain areas and 35 mph in the valleys and coast, he said.
POWER CUTS
Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) (N:PCG) said early on Tuesday that almost 600,000 more electric customers would have their power shut off, starting early in the day, as a fire prevention measure ahead of the wind storms.
This is on top of the 970,000 customers already shut off, although about half of those were restored by Monday night, the company announced.
As of early Tuesday, the Kincade fire had scorched more than 74,000 acres, destroyed 123 homes and other structures and was 15 percent contained as it burned across parts of Sonoma County's picturesque wine country, state fire officials said.
The governor said he was confident that firefighters had secured enough perimeters around the Kincade fire that it no longer posed an imminent threat to two communities north of Santa Rosa, although he conceded the fight was not over.
The so-called Getty fire covered more than 600 acres in the scrub-covered hills around Interstate 405, near some of the city's most expensive homes.
It destroyed eight structures and was 5 percent contained, officials said.
The Getty fire prompted the University of California at Los Angeles, about 2 miles (3 km) from the Getty Center, to close for the day, along with a number of public schools.
Los Angeles Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas said his firefighters had told him ""they were literally overwhelmed"" in the early hours of the Getty fire. ""They had to make some tough decisions on which houses they were able to protect.""
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told a news conference property losses could rise, urging residents in the mandatory evacuation zone, which encompasses more than 10,000 homes and businesses, to get out quickly.
The cause of the Kincade fire in Sonoma County, where 190,000 people were ordered to evacuate, remained under investigation."

Nine Chinese companies have filed for initial public offerings in the U.S. this month, including three overnight, making October the busiest of the year so far in terms of filings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Canaan Inc., the world’s second-largest maker of Bitcoin mining machines, podcast and radio streaming app creator Guangzhou Lizhi Network Technology Co., and the operator of the Chinese co-living platform Danke Apartment, Phoenix Tree Holdings Ltd., all filed overnight. Meanwhile Fangdd Network Group and apartment rental business Q&K International Group are both taking investor orders this week.
The flurry of activity comes even as the U.S. threatens to delist Chinese companies from American exchanges and amid the blacklisting of Chinese technology companies.
In addition, the performance of Chinese IPOs in the U.S. has been dismal. All but four of the 25 companies that have completed U.S. listings this year are underwater. The average return is a 24% slump from their offer prices and the companies have raised 63% less than in the same period last year, the data show. Three companies that made their debuts last Friday, including NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc.’s education arm Youdao Inc., are now down by an average 24%.
Still, two of the three largest deals this year have performed well. Luckin Coffee Inc. and GSX Techedu Inc., which raised $853 million between them, have respectively risen 20% and 44% from their offer prices.
Applications from Chinese companies to list in Hong Kong have also picked up this month to the most since June, with 13 filing for IPOs in what may signal an acceleration of deal activity after a summer drought.

(Reuters) - European shares fell for the first time in seven sessions on Tuesday as weak earnings dampened optimism surrounding the U.S.-China trade progress and ahead of an expected interest-rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve later this week. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.4% at 0920 GMT after scaling a 21-month high in the previous session, tracking gains on Wall Street, where the benchmark S&P 500 hit a record high. 
""Investors seem to be taking some money off the table given how strong markets have been,"" said David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets. ""We tend to see a pullback from time and time and this is exactly that."" 
The Helsinki index <.OXHPI> underperformed the broader market as Finnish paper firm Stora Enso's (HE:STERV) slumped 9% as its quarterly profit dropped and it warned of global political uncertainties.
Peers Mondi (L:MNDI) and  Smurfit Kappa  (I:SKG) also fell following the results.
The oil and gas sector (SXEP) fell 0.5%, dragged down by British energy firm  BP  (L:BP), which reported a sharp drop in third-quarter profits, hurt by weaker oil prices and lower production.
Also weighing on the sector was British oilfield services firm  Hunting  (L:HTG), down 3.5%, after the company said it sees annual core profit at the lower end of market expectations as it grapples with a slowdown in the U.S. onshore drilling market.
Financials (SXFP) were pulled lower by a 2.4% drop in Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) after the German exchange operator missed its third-quarter profit forecasts. 
Expectations were low going into the European corporate earnings season, but after its three busiest weeks the overall picture has been slightly better than expected with companies pulling off modest beats. 
Banks (SX7P) were dragged lower by shares of Swedbank , which fell nearly 4%, after Estonia's financial regulator said it decided to open a misdemeanor case with regard to the Estonian subsidiary of the Swedish lender.
Among positive movers, shares of German healthcare group Fresenius (DE:FREG) gained 5% to top the STOXX index after beating revenue expectations on strong sales in emerging markets and growth in its dialysis unit.
FED WATCH
The catalyst for markets this week is expected to be the Fed meet where officials are expected to cut interest rates for the third time this year, but focus will squarely be on further clues from the central bank on the policy path ahead.
""Markets are 90% pricing in a [rate] cut,"" said CMC's Madden.

948,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 05:42AM ET</span>",StockBeat: BP's Resilient 3Q Overshadowed by Aramco IPO,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Investors fearing a bloodbath for Big Oil after a rocky third quarter for crude prices may be reassured – a little – after   BP   (LON:BP) kicked off earnings season with figures that were modestly ahead of expectations, but nonetheless overshadowed by news elsewhere. 
The shares fell by 2.7% by 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), but that was less a reflection of the results than of the news that Saudi Aramco is planning to begin marketing its IPO on Sunday. That’s causing investors to make room in their books for the new stock by paring existing holdings.
 BP  (LON:BP) had done its best to massage expectations lower in the weeks leading up to the announcement, most notably warning of an impairment charge of up to $3 billion in respect of the disposals it announced during the quarter (the legacy gas assets at BPX Energy first and foremost). As it turned out, BP actually reported an impairment of $2.6 billion, well below the maximum feared.
There was no escaping the impact of lower prices, however. U.S. crude had ranged between $68 and $74 a barrel a year earlier, but the global economic slowdown and fears of oversupply kept it stuck in the mid-50s all through this summer. As a result, underlying replacement cost profit – BP’s preferred measure – fell by over a third to $2.25 billion. The reported bottom line swung to a loss of $749 million. Operating cash flow stayed at a still-healthy $6.5 billion, thanks to better-than-expected performances from Rosneft and from its downstream operations.
The reported loss was of less concern than an unwelcome rise in gearing, as the asset disposals failed to bring down net debt significantly. Gearing, which measures net debt as a proportion of a company’s entire value, rose to 31.7% from 31% three months earlier, moving away from the targeted range of 20%-30%. Chief financial officer Brian Gilvary said he expects it to stay above 30% through the end of the year (even though the group expects to sell nearly $3 billion more in assets by then), before falling to around 25% next year. That reflects BP's optimism that it can continue to generate enough cash to cover both capex and dividends at current prices and still have something left over to strengthen the balance sheet.
Elsewhere, all of Europe’s main indexes were in the red. The FTSE 100 was down 0.4%, while the German DAX was down 0.3%. The benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 0.5% at 396.58."
949,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 05:29AM ET</span>",BP Profit Beats as Strong Refining Offsets Lower Oil Price,"(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.
  BP   Plc (LON:BP) reported profit that beat analyst estimates as a strong refining performance offset the effect of lower oil and natural gas prices, and bad weather that curbed production.
The positive result will please investors expecting a gloomy third quarter for Big Oil. Crude prices have fallen as the U.S.-China trade war stokes demand concerns, while American output has continued to flood the market.
“BP delivered strong operating cash flow and underlying earnings in a quarter that saw lower oil and gas prices and significant hurricane impacts,” Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in a statement.
BP said adjusted net income was $2.25 billion in the quarter, exceeding the average analyst estimate of $1.77 billion. That compares with profit of $3.84 billion a year earlier, when BP decided to buy a $10.5 billion package of U.S. shale assets in cash rather than shares because it was so confident oil prices would stay high.
Advance Warning
This year, the London-based company took the unusual step of issuing a statement before earnings to flag up factors affecting business in the third quarter. BP warned it would pay a tax rate of about 50%, higher than the expected full-year rate of 40%. It also signaled that gearing -- a measure of debt to equity -- would remain above its target range.
The company also gave advance warning of a non-cash impairment charge from the sale of gas assets in the U.S. That amounted to $2.61 billion in the quarter, meaning the company reported a net loss of $749 million. In response to that guidance, analysts had already downgraded their estimates for adjusted net income by about a third over the past four weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“It looks like a decent result, although worth keeping in mind that this comes after heavy downgrades in recent weeks,” said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Martijn Rats “As recent as early October, the consensus third-quarter net income was still $2.7 billion.”
Strong Trading
BP’s refining and marketing unit posted adjusted profit of $1.88 billion in the period compared with $2.11 billion a year earlier, a much smaller decline than its upstream business.
That result was achieved despite weakening margins as price differentials between heavy and light crude became less favorable to BP. Instead, the strong performance came from high operational reliability, with the company’s Whiting and Cherry Point refineries in the U.S. processed record amounts of crude, the company said.
BP also said that it enjoyed better income from natural gas trading and a higher contribution from oil. Although better known for its oil fields, refineries and pump stations, BP also runs an in-house trading businesses that’s larger than the better-known independent oil traders like Vitol Group,  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc and Trafigura Group.
“It’s a volatile market,” Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “The teams have been making some very good calls.”
Hurricane Impact
Output fell from the preceding quarter as a result of the hurricane and maintenance, sliding to 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, including the contribution of barrels from strategic partner Rosneft PJSC. Production should rise again in the fourth quarter, the company said.
Cash flow from operations including working capital, an important measure of whether BP’s shale deal is paying off, held steady compared with a year earlier at $6.5 billion.
BP has worked diligently to cut costs and boost the cash it generates from projects after crude’s collapse in 2014. Some of that work can be attributed to Bernard Looney, the company’s upstream director and incoming chief executive officer. Investors and analysts will expect him to continue that push, while expanding efforts to cut carbon, when he takes over the top job in February.

The Tadawul All Shares Index retreated 1.6% as of 10:35 a.m. in Riyadh, the most among benchmarks tracked by Bloomberg, as 90% of its members fell. Al Rajhi Bank was the biggest drag on the gauge.
Stocks dropped after television news channel Al Arabiya reported subscription for the shares in Saudi Aramco will start on Dec. 4, and trading will start on Dec. 11. Saudi Arabia’s Capital Market Authority will officially announce the start of the initial public offering process on Sunday, Al Arabiya said.
The IPO, which has been at least three years in the making, is part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s efforts to modernize the economy and diversify the nation’s revenue from oil, including turning the bourse into a gateway for foreign investment. In 2016, he valued the company at about $2 trillion, although some analysts have said it may be closer to about $1.5 trillion.
A 1% float of the company could be valued about $20 billion, which would account for about 4% of the market and could equal a decade of proceeds raised through other IPOs in the Saudi market.
Earlier this month, the Saudi stock index fell into a bear market fueled in part by an increase in geopolitical risk after attacks on Aramco’s facilities in September."
951,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 05:25AM ET</span>",Exclusive: India's IndiGo close to mammoth 300-plane Airbus deal - sources,"By Aditi Shah and Tim Hepher
NEW DELHI/PARIS (Reuters) - Indian budget airline IndiGo is close to placing a near-record order for more than 300 Airbus (PA:AIR) A320neo-family jets worth at least $33 billion at recent catalog prices to cement its position as India's largest carrier by market share.
People familiar with the matter told Reuters that IndiGo, part of InterGlobe Aviation (NS:INGL), was putting the finishing touches on an order that would include Airbus's newest jet, a long-range version of the single-aisle A320 type called the A321XLR.
IndiGo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. On Monday, a spokeswoman said there were no plans on the order front ""as of now"". Airbus declined to comment.
The expected deal caps a contest between Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA), which seeks a new endorsement for its grounded 737 MAX after British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) tentatively agreed in June to drop Airbus as its medium-haul supplier and commit to 200 MAX.
It comes days after IndiGo's biggest quarterly loss hurt by engine issues on its earlier A320neo jets.
A new deal for 300 A320neo-family aircraft would be worth $33 billion at the most recent list prices, published in 2018, but a deal of this scale would come in well below half that after discounts, according to aircraft valuation experts.
Airbus stopped publishing list prices earlier this year.
IndiGo was among the first carriers to buy the re-engined A320neo in early 2011.
Two years ago, an unrelated U.S. private equity company called Indigo Partners placed a record order for 430 jets spread between four airlines, but the expected new IndiGo order could be Airbus's largest ever from a single airline.
In 1997, U.S. Airways placed an order for up to 400 Airbus A320 jets including options, but many were not delivered.
IndiGo has expanded rapidly to claim almost half the Indian market as rivals such as bankrupt Jet Airways fall by the wayside. Its closest competitor is SpiceJet, a Boeing operator.
However its two co-founders, Rakesh Gangwal and Rahul Bhatia, have been embroiled in a dispute about corporate governance of the airline that shows no signs of easing.
In June, IndiGo dropped its original engine supplier, United Technologies unit Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX), in favor of French-U.S. engine venture CFM by agreeing a record $20 billion deal for more than 600 engines to power Airbus jets already on order.
CFM is jointly owned by France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  (N:GE) of the United States.
Indian regulators on Monday ordered IndiGo to modify its 16 earlier Airbus A320neo aircraft fitted with Pratt & Whitney engines, which have been linked to in-flight shutdowns, to avoid their grounding."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. telecommunications regulator plans to vote in November to designate China's Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763) as national security risks, barring their U.S. rural carrier customers from tapping an $8.5 billion government fund to purchase equipment or services.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) also plans to propose requiring those carriers to remove and replace equipment from such designated companies, FCC officials said on Monday.
At a meeting set for Nov. 19, the FCC said it plans to vote to ask carriers how much it would cost to remove and replace Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] and ZTE Corp (SZ:000063) from existing networks and to establish a reimbursement program to offset the costs of removing the equipment.
""When it comes to 5G and America's security, we can't afford to take a risk and hope for the best,"" FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement.
""As the United States upgrades its networks to the next generation of wireless technologies - 5G - we cannot ignore the risk that the Chinese government will seek to exploit network vulnerabilities in order to engage in espionage, insert malware and viruses, and otherwise compromise our critical communications networks.""
This is the latest in a series of actions by the U.S. government aimed at barring U.S. companies from purchasing Huawei and ZTE equipment. Huawei and ZTE would have 30 days to contest the FCC's national security risk designation and a final order compelling removal of equipment is not expected until next year at the earliest.
""In 30 years of business, Huawei has never had a major security-related incident in the 170 countries where we operate,"" said a Huawei spokesman in Shenzhen, China.
""Today's proposal, released by the FCC Chairman, only impacts the broadband providers in the most unserved or underserved rural areas of the United States,"" the spokesman said. ""Such action will further widen the digital divide; slowing the pace of economic development without further securing the Nation's telecommunications networks.""
ZTE did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China was ""resolutely opposed"" to the United States putting such pressure on Chinese companies, which was ""economic bullying"" that went in the face of U.S. claims to follow the principles of a market economy.
This decision would only harm U.S. consumers, especially in rural areas, which could be left without telecommunication services, he told a daily news briefing.
""I don't know what the U.S. view is on this risk,"" Geng added.
The United States should stop trying to smear Chinese companies and provide them with a non-discriminatory environment in which to operate, he said.
'NEED TO BE MINDFUL'
Pai first proposed in March 2018 to bar companies that posed a national security risk from receiving funds from the FCC's Universal Service Fund, but did not name Huawei or ZTE. The fund provides subsidies to provide service in rural or hard-to-reach areas, and to libraries and schools.
FCC Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel noted the move comes after 18 months of review and the FCC should take additional action.
""We need to be mindful that in a global economy, our networks will still connect to insecure equipment abroad. So we should start researching how we can build networks that can withstand connection to equipment vulnerabilities around the world,"" Rosenworcel said.
The FCC argued the companies' ties to the Chinese government and military apparatus, and Chinese laws requiring that such companies assist the Chinese government with intelligence activities, pose a U.S. national security risk.
Congress has been considering legislation to authorize up to $1 billion for small and rural wireless providers to replace network equipment from the Chinese companies. The FCC could tap the fund itself to pay for replacing equipment if Congress does not act.
About a dozen rural U.S. telecom carriers that depend on inexpensive Huawei and ZTE switches and equipment were in discussion with Ericsson (ST:ERICb) and Nokia (HE:NOKIA) to replace their Chinese equipment, Reuters reported in June.
The United States has been pressing nations not to grant Huawei access to fifth-generation networks and alleged Huawei's equipment could be used by Beijing for spying, which the Chinese company has repeatedly denied.
Pai said in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Monday that ""China could compel Huawei to spy on American individuals and businesses. Imagine if a 5G network with Huawei equipment were operating near a U.S. military installation, critical infrastructure facility or other sensitive location.""
He also cited a report by cybersecurity firm Finite State that ""found a majority of the Huawei firmware images it analyzed had at least one potential back door and that each Huawei device had an average of 102 known vulnerabilities.""
Several European countries in recent months have not agreed to bar Huawei, despite U.S. pressure.
In May, Trump signed a long-awaited executive order declaring a national emergency and barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by companies posing a national security risk. The order directed the Commerce Department, working with other government agencies, to draw up an enforcement plan by mid-October. The Commerce Department has yet to publish a plan.

The U.S. government added Huawei to its economic blacklist in May, saying the Chinese company was involved in activities contrary to U.S. national security.

958,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 12:42AM ET</span>","GM, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler back Trump on California emissions challenge","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major automakers are siding with the Trump administration in its bid to bar California from setting its own fuel efficiency rules or zero-emission requirements for vehicles, the companies said in a filing with a U.S. appeals court late on Monday.
The move by firms including General Motors Co (N:GM), Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203),  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380), and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA), follows legal challenges by California and 22 states and environmental groups in September.
Those challenges aim to undo the Trump administration's determination, issued in September, that federal law bars California from setting stiff tailpipe emission standards and zero-emission vehicle mandates.
In their filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the automakers and the National Automobile Dealers Association said they backed the administration bid to bar individual emissions rules by states.
They asked to intervene, arguing the administration's rule provided ""vehicle manufacturers with the certainty that states cannot interfere with federal fuel economy standards.""
The decision to side with President Donald Trump could prompt a furious backlash from Democrats and environmentalists.
It also poses a risk for automakers if a Democrat wins the White House in next year's election and reverses Trump’s actions, and also reinstates California’s right to set its own rules and tougher national emissions standards adopted by President Barack Obama.
A spokeswoman for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the action ""doesn’t change our resolve to fight as long and hard as necessary to protect our standards.""
She added, ""The courts have upheld our authority to set standards before and we’re hopeful they will yet again.""
Other automakers, such as  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), Honda Motor Co (T:7267) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), which announced a voluntary deal with California in July on emissions rules, are not joining the bid to intervene on the administration's side.
The group backing Trump also includes Mazda (T:7261), Nissan Motor Co (T:7201), Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270) and Subaru Co (T:9778).
John Bozzella, president and chief executive of Global Automakers, a trade group representing major foreign firms, said the companies had little choice but to back the administration.
""It's been the federal policy for the better part of 40 years that the federal government has the sole responsibility for regulating fuel economy standards, but it doesn't have to get to that,"" Bozzella told reporters, speaking for an ad-hoc group, the Coalition for Sustainable Automotive Regulation.
""We can still reach an agreement"" on fuel economy rules, Bozzella said, adding that companies still support a ""middle ground"" between California and the administration that would see rising attainable fuel efficiency requirements. He said the Trump administration did not ask the automakers to intervene.
Senator Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, had harsh words for the automakers.
""Instead of choosing the responsible path forged by four automakers and the state of California, one that will move us toward the cleaner, alternative fuel vehicles of the future, these companies have chosen to head down a dead-end road,"" Carper said in a statement.
A group of major environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, the Union of Concerned Scientists and Natural Resources Defense Council, sued in September to block the determination.
On Friday, seven U.S. states, including Alabama, Ohio, Texas, Utah and West Virginia, also filed in support of the Trump regulation, arguing that without the rule their residents would have to pay ""higher vehicle costs.""
In Aug. 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed freezing fuel efficiency requirements at 2020 levels through 2026.
The Obama-era rules adopted in 2012 called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2026, with average annual increases of nearly 5%, compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration’s preferred option.
The final rule is expected to modestly boost fuel efficiency from the initial proposal, with some automakers anticipating annual increases of about 1.5%, but still much less stringent than the Obama rules.
The group was not taking a position on what those requirements should be, Bozzella emphasized, but reiterated they should continue to rise annually.
""The decision to intervene in the lawsuit is about how the standard should be applied, not what the standard should be,"" Bozzella said.
The announcement showed an industry split.

After the four automakers, including BMW AG, announced the voluntary California pact, the Justice Department warned them the agreement ""may violate federal antitrust laws,"" according to documents seen by Reuters.

The deal marks the Hong Kong group's first step in tapping Manila's gaming industry, which has grown rapidly over the past decade, attracting foreign entrants and generating tax revenue.
Suncity said in a statement it has acquired a majority stake in the Philippines'  Suntrust Home  Developers Inc (PS:SUN), which plans to co-develop and then manage and operate a five-star hotel and casino in Manila.
""Outside of Macau the most decent city for gaming is Manila because of the scale, three international brands and facilities, airport. Quite convenient,"" Andrew Lo, executive director at Suncity, told Reuters.
Alvin Chau, the founder of Suncity, has grown the company from operating a high roller table in Wynn Macau's casino in 2007 to a sprawling conglomerate with businesses ranging from property to autos and thousands of employees.
In a separate statement, Suntrust said it signed a deal to develop and exclusively operate the main hotel casino portion of an integrated resort in the capital. Suntrust would operate the casino and a hotel with at least 400 rooms, around 400 gaming tables and 1,200 slot machines for both mass market and high rollers.
Shares in Suntrust were suspended from trading on Tuesday. Its shares surged 37% on Monday.
Suntrust will lease the site for the casino-hotel from the developers of the larger Westside City Resorts World project, including  Genting Hong Kong  Ltd (HK:0678), which will also include a retail center and residential apartments.
As of end-June, the Westside developers had spent 96.5 billion Philippine pesos ($1.89 billion) on the project that will start operations before 2023.
Philippines' gross gaming revenues rose 14% to 120.48 billion pesos ($2.36 billion) in the first half, government data showed.
The industry includes 10 private casino firms operating 1,785 gaming tables and 10,799 electronic gaming machines, according to government data. The state gaming regulator Pagcor also operates several casinos totaling 477 tables and 9,751 gaming machines.
Suncity's acquisition of Suntrust is subject to regulatory checks."

A stress test performed by the U.S. bank projected that local lenders including Hang Seng Bank Co. and Bank of East Asia Ltd. could see earnings slump 24% to 45% next year and 39% to 67% in 2021. That would lead to significant deterioration in return on equity and core capital buffers, analysts led by Jemmy Huang told clients in a note Monday.
They downgraded Hang Seng Bank to underweight from neutral and said they are taking a “cautious” view of lenders in the city.
“The social unrest in Hong Kong has persisted for more than four months and shows no signs of moderation,” Huang wrote.
While the Hong Kong government has laid out policy support including boosting loans to small businesses and cutting banks’ capital buffers to mitigate an economic downturn, “history suggests a sustainable rally would not come through until the underlying issues are resolved,” Huang said. Hong Kong banks probably won’t outperform the benchmark Hang Seng Index in the next six to 12 months, he predicted.
Hong Kong may report negative growth this year as the economy reels from the social unrest, Financial Secretary Paul Chan wrote in a blog post on Sunday. Once Asia’s manufacturing powerhouse before the rise of mainland China, Hong Kong’s freewheeling consumer and finance-led economy is vulnerable to a potential collapse in confidence triggered by the turmoil.
Declines in residential prices, retail and office rents threaten higher credit costs on mortgages and property loans while potential capital outflow and the monetary authority’s intervention will hurt banks’ net interest margin. Overseas loans, trade finance, and lending to wholesale and retail sectors also could be impacted, JPMorgan said.
Hang Seng Bank, controlled  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), is likely to be hit the most among peers due to its higher leverage and concentration of Hong Kong-dollar denominated portfolio, the JPMorgan analysts said. Shares of Hang Seng Bank have lost 6% this year while Bank of East Asia tumbled 23%.
BOC Hong Kong Holdings Ltd. may fare better given its sufficient capital position to sustain dividend yields even under stress tests, according to the note."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg will acknowledge on Tuesday that the aircraft manufacturer made mistakes, as he appears at a congressional hearing on two 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people, according to written testimony made public on Monday.
""We have learned and are still learning from these accidents, Mr. Chairman. We know we made mistakes and got some things wrong,"" Muilenburg will tell the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee.
The testimony, which was first reported by Reuters and made public later on Monday, added that the company had made improvements to the now-grounded 737 MAX airplane ""that will ensure that accidents like these never happen again."" 
Muilenburg, who was stripped of his title as Boeing chairman by the board earlier this month, will also testify before the U.S. House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on Wednesday.
U.S. airlines have canceled flights into January and February because of the grounding and the Federal Aviation Administration is not expected to approve the 737 MAX's ungrounding until December at the earliest.
""We also know we can and must do better,"" Muilenburg's testimony says. It also expresses ""deepest sympathies to the families and loved ones"" of those killed, noting the hearing would be taking place on the anniversary of the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia that killed 189 people. 
Muilenburg visited the Indonesian embassy in Washington on Monday to meet with the country's ambassador, offer condolences and pay respects to those lost on the flight, Boeing said in a statement.
Muilenburg's prepared testimony for Tuesday said that when the 737 MAX returns, ""it will be one of the safest airplanes ever to fly.""
In March, after a 737 MAX crash of Ethiopian Airlines 302 killed 157 people, the plane was grounded worldwide.
Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Roger Wicker told Reuters last week that the 737 MAX ""won't fly unless 99.9% of the American public and American policymakers are convinced that it's absolutely safe.""
Indonesian investigators reported on Friday that Boeing acting without adequate oversight from U.S. regulators and failed to grasp risks in the design of cockpit software on the 737 MAX, sowing the seeds for Lion Air 610 that also involved errors by airline workers and crew.
'LONGER THAN EXPECTED'
Muilenburg noted that both crashes involved the repeated activation of a flight control software function known as MCAS after it received faulty sensor input.
Boeing's development of that software has come under criticism in reports and from lawmakers and the company is adding safeguards to the system. Muilenburg said the changes would ""eliminate the possibility of even extremely unlikely risks that are unrelated to the accident.""
Boeing has admitted few mistakes since the two fatal crashes. Earlier this month, the FAA questioned why Boeing withheld instant messages from a former pilot for months that raised questions about MCAS.
In May, Boeing acknowledged it did not tell the FAA for 13 months that it inadvertently made an alarm alerting pilots to a mismatch of flight data optional on the 737 MAX, instead of standard as on earlier 737s. The company insisted the missing display represented no safety risk.
Muilenburg acknowledged that getting the plane in the air ""has taken longer than we originally expected, but we're committed to getting it right, and return-to-service timing is completely dependent on answering each and every question from the FAA.""
He added that ""regulators should approve the return of the MAX to the skies only after they have applied the most rigorous scrutiny, and are completely satisfied as to the plane's safety.
The flying public deserves nothing less.""

U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the House panel, has one main question for Boeing at Wednesday's hearing: ""How the hell did this happen?""

The Japanese newspaper, without citing sources, said the National Tax Agency found Ghosn used Nissan money for several years to pay consultant's fees to his sister for fictitious work and to make donations to a university in Lebanon.
The former Nissan chairman holds Lebanese nationality. He is awaiting trial in Japan on charges of financial misconduct, which he denies.
Nissan recorded some 150 million yen ($1.4 million) as secretary's office expenses for three years through March 2014. But the agency ordered Nissan to pay tax on the amount after judging the expenditure was for private use and should not have been deducted as expenses from corporate income, the Yomiuri reported.
While the finding has not led to a criminal case, it backs up Nissan's claim that Ghosn improperly used the company's money, the newspaper said.
A tax official told Reuters that the agency could not comment on individual cases. A Nissan spokeswoman said the automaker was checking the newspaper report. Lawyers for Ghosn did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment.
Since his first arrest in November last year, Ghosn has been charged four times on allegations he underreported his Nissan salary, temporarily transferred personal financial losses to Nissan's books, and authorized payments to car dealers with the purpose of enriching himself.
On Thursday, Ghosn's lawyers said they had asked the Tokyo District Court to dismiss all charges against their client, saying prosecutors had colluded with government officials and Nissan executives to oust him from his post.
At the time of his arrest, Ghosn was working to strengthen Nissan's relationship with  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), which he also chaired and which is part-owned by the French government. The effort was unpopular among Nissan management, people close to the Japanese automaker previously told Reuters.
The Yomiuri said Nissan had already filed a correction and paid additional tax of around several tens of millions of yen (several hundred thousand dollars).
The tax agency is investigating additional years, the newspaper said.

965,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 10:15PM ET</span>",California regulator to investigate utilities' mass fire-prevention power outages,"By Steve Gorman
(Reuters) - California regulators said on Monday they will open a formal probe of whether utilities violated any rules by cutting power to millions of residents for days as a precaution during recent periods of high winds and heightened wildfire risks.
The investigation was urged by safety and enforcement staff of the California Public Utilities Commission after more than 1 million homes and businesses were left without electricity on Monday, mostly from planned ""public safety power shut-offs"" on an unprecedented scale. 
The announcement did not single out any utilities by name, but the overwhelming bulk of the shut-offs were implemented by Pacific Gas and Electric Co, a unit of PG&E Corp (N:PCG), California's largest investor-owned utility. 
PG&E filed for bankruptcy in January, citing some $30 billion in civil liability from major wildfires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018, including last year's Camp Fire which killed 85 people and incinerated most of the Northern California town of Paradise. That fire ranks as the state's deadliest on record.
Responding to the latest windstorms over the weekend, PG&E turned off electricity to 970,000 homes and workplaces in 38 counties in northern and central California, encompassing millions of people across more than half of PG&E's service area of 70,000 square miles.
That tally far surpassed the previous record planned outage of 730,000 customers during high winds two weeks ago.
By Monday evening as the latest winds began to subside, PG&E crews had restored electricity to 325,000 customers, utility spokeswoman Tamar Sarkissian said. She said the company had some 6,000 technicians in the field patrolling power lines, making repairs and turning electricity back on.
Even as power was being gradually restored, PG&E said it was considering yet another round of power shut-offs due to more high winds forecast for later in the week.
The precautionary blackouts have drawn sharp criticism from the governor and state regulators as being too widespread and disruptive, as well as poorly managed and communicated to the public earlier this month.
'HELD TO ACCOUNT'
California Governor Gavin Newsom has said PG&E is largely to blame for its own predicament, arguing that corporate greed and mismanagement kept the utility from upgrading its infrastructure while wildfire hazards have steadily worsened over the past decade.
He has vowed that under the leadership of the new Public Utilities Commission president he appointed in July, Marybel Batjer, utilities such as PG&E would be ""held to account"" for their lapses.
The agency's statement on Monday said its enforcement division will ask commissioners in the next 30 days to open an investigation of the outages. The inquiry will examine utility compliance with agency regulations, ""any resulting violations and potential actions to ensure utilities are held accountable,"" the statement said.
Fines of up to $100,000 per violation per day and additional penalties can be assessed for violations of commission rules and regulations, agency spokesman Christopher Chow said.
PG&E was previously assessed a record $1.6 billion penalty for the unsafe operation of one of its gas pipelines that exploded in San Bruno, California, near San Francisco, in 2010.
In addition, the commission said it would ensure that customers do not end up charged for services they failed to receive during the blackouts. 
Batjer also plans to reevaluate the protocols for precautionary power shut-offs and consider how utilities can minimize future outages.
In response to the commission's action, PG&E said, ""We are constantly working to minimize the impact of these safety shut-offs while prioritizing public safety. The sole purpose of these power shut-offs is to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire in the communities that we serve.""

PG&E acknowledged last week that a major wildfire in Sonoma County wine country erupted near a damaged a transmission tower owned by the utility at about the time a live high-voltage line carried by that tower malfunctioned.

J&J said the subpoenas were related to anti-diversion policies and procedures and the distribution of its opioid medications developed by its Janssen pharmaceuticals unit.
The company said in the filing it believes the investigation relates to monitoring and reporting programs by manufacturers and distributors of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act.
""Like other companies that have manufactured opioid medications, Janssen has received subpoenas and investigative demands from various government entities, and this includes the August 2019 subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York,"" the company said in a statement emailed to Reuters.
J&J said it understands the subpoenas are part of a ""broader, industry-wide investigation"" and said the company believes its anti-diversion policies and procedures complied with the law.
Johnson & Johnson last week lowered its previously reported third-quarter profit to account for a proposed $4 billion cash settlement related to the opioid crisis.
That followed a Reuters report citing sources that drug distributors McKesson Corp (N:MCK), AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC) and  Cardinal Health  (N:CAH) had offered to pay $18billion in cash over 18 years, while J&J would pay $4 billion in cash. 
The drug industry faces roughly 2,600 lawsuits brought bystate and local governments, hospitals and other entities seeking to hold drugmakers and distributors responsible for the toll of opioid abuse.

In August, an Oklahoma judge ordered J&J to pay $572.1 million to the state for its part in fueling an opioid epidemic, a sum that was substantially less than investors had expected.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of bankrupt California power utility PG&E Corp (N:PCG) extended losses on Monday as investors worried that its equipment might be responsible for wildfires spreading in northern California.
After a brief trading halt caused by its rapid fall, PG&E's stock was down 16%, bringing its loss to nearly 50% since late Wednesday, when the Kincade Fire started in Sonoma County and rapidly became the worst blaze in California.
Crews on Sunday lost ground against the wind-driven fire that has blackened part of the state's picturesque wine country and driven 190,000 people from their homes. The Kincade Fire is the worst of more than a dozen major blazes that have damaged or destroyed nearly 400 structures and prompted Governor Gavin Newsom to declare a statewide emergency.
While the cause of the Kincade Fire has not been determined, it appears to have erupted near the base of a damaged high-voltage transmission tower owned by PG&E, which is California’s largest investor-owned utility and serves the northern part of the state.
California's wildfires generally erupt in the fall as hot, dry winds blow westward. High wind forecasts prompted PG&E to shut off power to about 940,000 customers in 43 counties on starting on Saturday to guard against the risk of touching off more wildfires. The utility said the protective blackouts could last two days.
PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January, citing potential liabilities in excess of $30 billion from major wildfires in 2017 and 2018 linked to its equipment. Its stock market value has shrunk to under $3 billion from $25 billion a year ago."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) decides to fight the Pentagon's decision to award a highly contested $10 billion cloud computing contract to Microsoft, it could act as early as next week.
A challenge to the Defense Department's award announced Friday is widely expected by legal experts, analysts and consultants, especially after President Donald Trump publicly derided Amazon's bid for the high-stakes contract. 
In July, Trump said the administration was reviewing Amazon's bid after complaints from other companies. Before then, Amazon was widely considered to be a front-runner. Trump has repeatedly taken swipes at Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post.
For over a year, the acrimonious contract-award process for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) contract, set off a showdown among Amazon,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT),  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Corp and involved conflict of interest allegations, legal challenges and intense lobbying.
In a statement, Amazon Web Services said it was ""surprised about this conclusion."" A person familiar with the matter told Reuters the company is considering options for protesting the award. The company did not respond to requests for comment on its next steps.
Reuters spoke to several legal experts who said the company primarily has two options. It could go to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) - a legislative branch of the government that offers auditing services, which could offer an immediate stay. Amazon could also go to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, which could allow it to strengthen its case through discovery.
Amazon has three calendar days to request a debriefing: a process in which the government explains to Amazon why it was unsuccessful and shares details on the evaluation process, said Michael Hordell, an attorney who works with Barnes and Thornburg LLP.
The debriefing could also get extended by a few days if the Defense Department allows additional questions after offering an explanation - a move the agency has allowed in the past, several attorneys said.
After the Pentagon has answered Amazon's questions, the company has five calendar days to file a ""protest"" with the GAO, Hordell said.
If the company is not happy with the GAO's decision, Amazon could also go to the United States Court of Federal Claims, the attorneys said. It could even skip going to the GAO altogether, they said.
Another option for Amazon is to file a protest with the Department of Defense, but all attorneys Reuters spoke to said that is highly unlikely.
AN AUTOMATIC STAY
If Amazon goes to the GAO, it can get an ""automatic stay of performance,"" said Franklin Turner, an attorney with McCarter & English LLP. 
That gives the GAO 100 days to make a decision, Turner said.
If the company goes to the court, it does not get an automatic stay and has to file a preliminary injunction: an order that may be granted before or during trial, with the goal of preserving the status quo before final judgment.
The court, on the other hand, allows for ""discovery"": a process which allows an aggrieved party to obtain evidence by requesting additional documents and depositions.
The direction of the company's legal fight could further be decided by a set of documents and evidence that the Defense Department will need to offer the company after Amazon files its protest.
If Amazon does not receive all the documents and evidence it wants, the company could either file a supplemental protest at the GAO or could go to court, the attorneys said.
Amazon is likely to fight the decision if only to show it is serious about its government contracting business, some of the attorneys and analysts said.
Down the road, the company is likely to focus on winning cloud contracts from the Central Intelligence Agency, which is looking to ramp up its reliance on the cloud, with plans to solicit tens of billions of dollars of work from tech companies next year.

Amazon already has a $600 million contract with the CIA.

970,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 08:09PM ET</span>","Google's search for sales in cloud, hardware clip Alphabet profit","By Munsif Vengattil and Paresh Dave
(Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) reported quarterly results on Monday that show costs continue to rise faster than revenue as the web search leader seeks to broaden its business, dampening Wall Street's enthusiasm despite Google's continued dominance in advertising sales.
The company, the world's leading provider of internet search, advertising and video services, posted its highest-ever quarterly expenses. It missed analysts' estimates for third-quarter profit by about $1.7 billion, though it beat revenue estimates by about $175 million.
Alphabet shares lost 1.6% after-hours, to $1,268.50, nearly erasing the 1.95% gain notched in regular trading when Reuters, citing sources, reported Google had made an offer to acquire U.S. wearable device maker  Fitbit Inc  (N:FIT).
Google has increased spending in recent years on areas including cloud computing and consumer electronics that it views as essential to maintaining its industry leadership in the face of stiff competition from Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT).
The new businesses are pushing Google into sales of subscriptions, devices and technology licenses. But it has had to invest in people, facilities and content. Google is on track to hire more than 20,000 people this year, in large part to staff its newer units.
Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), said he was not overly concerned by the spending.
""CEO Sundar Pichai can turn off the speculative spending at any time if he suddenly becomes more interested in profitability – but we suspect most investors would rather he stuck to the approach,"" Hyett wrote in a note.
Alphabet reports highest-ever quarterly expenses: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/ALPHABET-RESULTS/0H001QXFP954/eikon.png
Alphabet provides limited product-level financial disclosures compared with some peers, leaving investors increasingly uncertain about how pressures including regulatory scrutiny, advertiser boycotts and global trade tensions are affecting operations.
For instance, Alphabet reported $1.5 billion in unrealized losses in the third quarter from shares held in other companies, helping negate about $1 billion in profit. But an Alphabet spokeswoman declined to disclose which investments lost money.
Profit also was hurt by a $554 million charge from a settlement with French tax authorities in September.
Alphabet's chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, told financial analysts that the company's revenue growth rates underscored ""the strength and vibrancy"" of the company.
""In the last 12 months, we're generating over $150 billion in total revenues, that's about $25 billion of growth in the last year,"" she said.
COSTLY PURSUITS
Google has tried to demonstrate that its cloud-computing business is roaring, disclosing last quarter about $2 billion in revenue and saying that plans continued to hire thousands to stoke the unit's growth.
In hardware, Google's debut in May of the Pixel 3a, its most affordable smartphone yet, went well, according to technology analysts. It boosted Google's overall smartphone sales this summer in a typically slow quarter.
Google also has tried to reassure investors that there is no weakness in its YouTube video unit, while expressing confidence in its business overall through share buybacks.
But spending has not been held back and higher costs loom as Google deals with clashes with regulators. Total quarterly expenses grew 25% compared to a year ago - a similar rate to recent periods - to $31.3 billion. It topped the previous high of $31.1 billion in the 2018 fourth quarter.
Alphabet, which generates about 85 percent of its revenue from sales of ad space and ad technology, reported total third-quarter revenue of $40.5 billion. In line with recent quarters, that was up 20% over last year. Analysts on average estimated 19.52% growth and $40.325 billion in revenue, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net income for the third quarter rose to $7.1 billion, or $10.12 per share, compared with analysts' estimates of $8.811 billion, or $12.44 per share.
The operating margin was 23%, down from 24% in the second quarter.
Google in the third quarter acknowledged investigations by the U.S. Congress, Department of Justice and 48 states into the company's competitive practices. It settled a privacy investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. It also got an additional 90-day reprieve from an export ban that would restrict its relationship with Chinese smartphone maker Huawei, one of its top partners in distributing mobile apps.
Google has said it is cooperating with the probes, while saying that it has survived calls for increased regulation many times.
Haris Anwar, analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com, said the quarterly results cast a cloud. ""An earnings miss at a time when the big tech companies are being probed for their business practices adds to the uncertainty and creates a hint of pessimism around the company,"" he said in an email to Reuters.
Alphabet shares were up 17% in the trailing 12 months entering Monday, compared with a 33% gain for Microsoft and 29% for  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), the internet's No. 2 seller of advertising."

Banco Safra also said in its statement that Chief Executive Officer Rossano Maranhao had left the bank. Late on Monday, the bank said Alberto Corsetti, a longtime Safra executive, would replace Maranhao.
Local newspapers Valor Economico and O Estado de S. Paulo reported that Alberto Safra left the bank after a disagreement with his brother David Safra. Both were on Safra's board directors, with responsibility for the wholesale and retail businesses, respectively.
The siblings had been arguing about who would oversee a digital wallet system that would mark the family's first foray into retail banking.
In August, Alberto Safra said in an interview with Brazilian financial daily Valor that Banco Safra was hoping to secure a leading position in the retail business. With 172.2 billion reais ($43.24 billion) in total assets, Safra is the country's seventh largest lender.

973,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 06:56PM ET</span>",Trump Explored Cutting Grants for Schools Tied to Erdogan Foe,"(Bloomberg) -- Early in his presidency, Donald Trump’s White House explored whether the U.S. could cut off taxpayer funding for a network of charter schools affiliated with a political opponent of Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to two people familiar with the matter.
The 2017 episode, never previously reported, came as the newly inaugurated U.S. president prepared to meet for the first time with Erdogan, an ostensible U.S. ally who has since complicated American Mideast policy by aligning his country with Russia and, this month, launching a military operation in northern Syria.
The debate over funding for the schools unfolded over a few weeks ahead of Erdogan’s visit to the U.S. in May 2017, and one of the people who took an interest in the matter was former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, according to the people. He would later become Trump’s personal attorney and drive events in Ukraine that have the president on the brink of impeachment.
Administration lawyers ultimately concluded they couldn’t justify cutting off money for the schools, which are associated with a movement headed by a Turkish cleric and Erdogan opponent, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.
It’s not known how the Gulen-linked schools came to the attention of the White House. The two people familiar with the matter said they were told that information about how to cut funding for the schools was sought for the president, though it’s unclear if Trump himself requested it. The episode shows how Erdogan, from the start of Trump’s administration, has appealed to the U.S. president. He has twice persuaded Trump to withdraw U.S. forces in Syria, against the advice of American military officials.
In December, Trump reversed himself after criticism by Republicans and the resignation of his defense secretary. But earlier this month, Trump agreed to remove troops from a region along Turkey’s border, allowing Erdogan to begin an offensive to clear U.S.-allied Kurds and drawing bipartisan condemnation in Congress.
Exiled Cleric
Erdogan and Gulen were once political allies. But the Turkish president blames him for a failed coup in 2016 and has long sought Gulen’s extradition from the U.S. to Turkey. Before Trump, Erdogan tried to persuade President Barack Obama to give up Gulen, who lives in self-imposed exile in the Poconos and has denied involvement in the attempted coup.
In early 2017, officials on the National Security Council and Domestic Policy Council asked Education Department officials whether it was possible to block money that the Gulen-affiliated schools received through a federal grant program for charter schools, people familiar with the matter said. The money is provided to states, which then distribute funding to schools.
The White House suggested that the Education Department could investigate whether Gulen was laundering money through the schools, or could argue that the schools’ ties to Gulen -- a Muslim cleric -- amounted to a religious affiliation and meant they couldn’t receive federal funding.
But the Education Department pushed back against both approaches. Department aides told the White House that the government would be seen as hypocritical and discriminatory if it continued to support Christian schools while punishing schools affiliated with Islam.
Many officials in the department were particularly disturbed by the conversations because cutting funding would also deny resources to schools largely attended by low-income children, people familiar with the matter said.
In the end, the Education Department argued that the grants were multi-year funding for states, not just the Gulen schools. The money couldn’t be pulled back without evidence of malfeasance or a violation of grant conditions, and cutting off the funding otherwise would violate the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, department officials concluded.
The schools still receive federal funding. A spokeswoman for the Education Department declined to make Secretary Betty DeVos available for an interview or comment for this story.
White House spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment. The Turkish embassy in Washington also did not respond to a request for comment.
Giuliani’s Role
While the administration was debating whether it could cut off money for the schools, Giuliani was pushing the White House to extradite Gulen, according to four people familiar with the matter.
Giuliani’s interest in Gulen and the schools isn’t clear. At the time, he was a prominent Trump supporter but had not assumed his role as Trump’s personal lawyer. He was working for a Turkish gold trader, Reza Zarrab, who had been arrested in the U.S. and faced prosecution for his role in a scheme to evade Iranian trade sanctions. Erdogan wanted Zarrab released, and Giuliani was attempting to work out a diplomatic deal that would entail his client being freed.
Giuliani participated in one phone call concerning the Gulen-linked schools’ funding, according to a person who was also on the call. The person didn’t know who Giuliani was representing on the call and couldn’t remember what he said.
At one point, at Giuliani’s request the White House gave a pamphlet about the Gulen-affiliated schools to then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, as evidence there was something wrong with them, according to one person familiar with the matter. Tillerson discarded it, concluding the pamphlet was simply an advertisement for the schools and showed no evidence of wrongdoing, the person said.
Giuliani didn’t respond to a text message about this story or a message left with a man who answered his phone but didn’t identify himself.
This year, as Trump’s personal lawyer, Giuliani’s role in a behind-the-scenes effort to pressure Ukraine’s president into investigating Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, has emerged as a central focus of House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry.
International Campaign
Turkey’s government has undertaken an international campaign to shut down Gulen-linked schools in dozens of countries around the world. A state-backed Turkish foundation is opening new schools to replace them, where the campaign has been successful. Erdogan has repeatedly said the Gulen schools provide capital for a “terrorist” group responsible for the 2016 coup, although those connections have been disputed by others.
Since 2015, the Turkish government has paid $1.3 million to a law firm, Amsterdam & Partners, for a campaign to discredit U.S. schools allegedly run by Gulen’s adherents. Turkey’s lobbyists have contacted officials ranging from Senate staffers to local school boards in the effort, disclosures filed with the Justice Department show.
Robert Amsterdam, the firm’s founding partner, said in an interview that he was “not aware of Giuliani’s involvement.” He accused the schools of committing immigration fraud by hiring Gulen followers from Turkey under U.S. employment visas and said: “Getting the government to wake up to this threat has been our job for years.”
In the U.S., the schools aren’t formally organized and their ties to Gulen are indirect, at times including the employment of Turkish administrators, teachers and vendors who are adherents of his movement. Alp Aslandogan, executive director of the Alliance for Shared Values, a nonprofit that promotes Gulen’s teachings, has described ties between taxpayer-funded U.S. charter schools and Gulen’s movement as on the “intellectual or inspirational level.”
Aslandogan said in an email that Erdogan’s pursuit of Gulen “now extends to trying to limit the educational opportunities available to American children. We are grateful that U.S. institutions are strong and can stand up to such pressure.”
CBS News counted about 136 Gulen-affiliated American schools in 2017. Some of the schools have been the subject of an FBI investigation into whether they secretly finance Gulen’s organization. Critics say Gulen gets payments from supporters doing contract work on the schools or from “donations” made by Turkish instructors brought to the U.S. on special visas to teach at them, charges he has rejected."
974,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 06:54PM ET</span>","VW ramps up China electric car factories, taking aim at Tesla","By Edward Taylor, Jan Schwartz and Joseph White
FRANKFURT/ZWICKAU (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) is ramping up production of electric cars to around 1 million vehicles by end of 2022, according to manufacturing plans seen by Reuters, enabling the German carmaker to leapfrog Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and making China the key battleground. 
Volkswagen is readying two Chinese factories to build electric cars next year. The Chinese plants will have a production capacity of 600,000 vehicles, according to Volkswagen's plans, which have not been previously reported - revealing VW’s ability to industrialise production faster than other pioneers in the electric vehicle market.
Tesla is still trying to reach its goal of making more than 500,000 cars a year by building a new factory in Shanghai, China, while VW can rely on an established workforce in two of its plants in Anting and Foshun to build zero-emission cars.
The scale and speed of VW's electrification push marks a shift in favour of established manufacturers that can use existing factories and profit from combustion-engined sport utility vehicles (SUVs) to scale up faster than startups.
""The truth is barriers to entry in autos remain high,"" said Max Warburton, an analyst at Bernstein Research. ""Making cars is hard. The move to electric vehicles will be expensive, but will probably be led by traditional manufacturers."" 
VW is leveraging its large infrastructure of suppliers, factories and workers, long a handicap to its profitability, more aggressively than rivals BMW,  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Tesla, which were all quicker to sell a custom-designed electric car.
Rather than adjusting production gradually, and using multi-powertrain platforms, Volkswagen is making a massive bet on a dedicated electric vehicle architecture, known as MEB, in the hope of increasing economies of scale sufficiently to push down the price of electric cars to around 20,000 euros ($22,262). 
The Wolfsburg, Germany-based carmaker is retooling eight plants across the globe by 2022 to specialise in manufacturing electric cars, and license its electric MEB platform to rivals, senior VW executives told Reuters, putting it on track to become the world's largest maker of zero-emission vehicles.
Tesla has emerged as a serious competitor with a credible car, its Model 3, Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess told Reuters last week. But startups have a hard time entering mass production without sufficient production facilities, he said. 
""The question is, can you expand your production quickly enough? The capital intensity is increasing,"" Diess said.
To fund its own electrification shift, the German carmaker aims to increase sales of VW SUVs, with combustion engines, to 40% of overall sales by 2020 from 23% in 2018. 
The powerstation that supplies energy for VW's flagship e-vehicle factory in Zwickau, Germany, marked by two tall chimneys, was built to power production of the combustion-engined Volkswagen Golf. 
Now Zwickau can piggyback off this infrastructure to ramp up production to 330,000 VW ID electric cars by 2021. 
Volkswagen Group will increase economies of scale by rolling out electric vehicle platforms to its Audi, Skoda and Seat and Porsche brands. 
Volkswagen Group will be in a position to build 22 million electric cars by 2028, of which 11.6 million could come out of Chinese factories, VW said.

PRODUCTION PAIN
VW’s expansion push comes at a time when investors have started to question businesses delivering growth without real profit, a change in sentiment that is crippling the ability of several electric car pioneers to raise more cash.
Back in 2016, Tesla said it wanted to build more than 500,000 Model 3 cars by 2018, a goal it has failed to meet. This year it expects to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars, a target that includes selling all models.
Tesla's struggles have dampened optimism about how easy it is to enter the car business, making it harder for China's NIO, backed by internet company Tencent Holdings Ltd, as well as others like Faraday Future and Byton Ltd, to fund the next stage of growth: capital-intensive volume production and sales.
""So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted earlier this month. ""It's insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you."" 
After starting trial production runs at its factory in Shanghai, Tesla now hopes to reach its 500,000-vehicle target in the 12-month period ending June 30, 2020. Tesla is also looking for a site to start production in Europe. 
Volkswagen is converting two German plants, Hanover and Zwickau, to build electric vehicles and will retool other factories including plants in China: Foshan which VW runs together with its joint-venture partner FAW-Volkswagen, and another in Anting, which VW runs together with SAIC. 
It will retool plants in Emden and Dresden in Germany, Mlada Boleslav in the Czech Republic, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, in United States, as part of a 30 billion-euro ($33.24 billion)investment push into e-mobility by 2023. 
As a result, Volkswagen Group will be the No. 1 electric vehicle producer globally by 2025, while Tesla is likely to remain a niche player, according to UBS autos analyst Patrick Hummel.
TECHNOLOGY INTERLOPERS 
The cutthroat rivalry between automakers and software companies started when Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google presented a prototype autonomous vehicle in 2012, leading analysts and industry executives to fear a so-called Nokia (HE:NOKIA) moment. This occurs when a new player from the tech sector unveils a superior design, in the way that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) presented the iPhone in 2007, ending Nokia's dominance of the mobile handset business.
Today, Tesla's cars are generally perceived as cutting-edge and potentially more sophisticated than VW's. Volkswagen's ID.3, which starts production this year, has an operating range of between 330 and 550 kilometers (205 to 341 miles), below the 560 km long-range Model 3 version offered by Tesla. 
That is because Tesla has a sophisticated software algorithm to control how much electricity goes to the electric motor, air conditioning, seat heaters, in-car infotainment, and cooling system. 
Volkswagen's edge is more blunt: price and massive economies of scale. 
The ID.3 has a starting price of under 30,000 euros ($33,363) in Germany. By contrast, Tesla's Model 3 had an average selling price of $50,000 in the second quarter. The long-range version retails for 52,390 euros in Germany.
The VW vehicle's lower price comes from the carmaker's ability to place large orders which, by nature of their size, help drive down the price. Volkswagen is investing 50 billion euros ($55.5 billion) to buy battery cells and will also license its MEB electric car platform to rival carmakers to further increase economies of scale. 
That is, Volkswagen will make that huge investment if suppliers can keep up. 
""There is a lot of investment,"" Stefan Sommer, Volkswagen Group's board member responsible for procurement, told Reuters last month. ""But even the big companies like Samsung (KS:005930), CATL, LG Chem, the big guys, SK, they hesitate to take so much money and invest because they are not seeing the market on the other side."" 
""We are now seeing the first battery plants, LG in Poland, CATL in Germany, they don't have the skilled workforce. That will be the bottleneck,"" Sommer said. ""It's a learning curve everybody has to work through. This will cause some lags in supply. We have no other choice.""
VW plans to license its electric MEB vehicle platform to rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, which will give VW $10 billion in revenue over the next six years. 
Thomas Ulbrich, Volkswagen's member of the board who oversees production of electric vehicles, told Reuters, ""Ford and Volkswagen's agreement will be a blueprint for further licensing deals."" 
In the short term, Volkswagen and its Chinese joint venture partners will invest 15 billion euros to produce 15 different electric cars for China alone by 2025.
""The first MEB-based vehicle is an SUV model,"" Volkswagen said about its China push.

975,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 06:54PM ET</span>",Singapore’s Labor Market Is Showing Strain as Economy Slows,"(Bloomberg) -- Follow Bloomberg on LINE messenger for all the business news and analysis you need.
Singapore’s resilient labor market is starting to come under strain as the trade-reliant economy struggles in the face of global pressures.
Retrenchments are rising, companies are more cautious raising wages, and it’s getting harder for those who lose their jobs to find new work. While the central bank is optimistic of some recovery in the economy in upcoming quarters, there are signs the employment outlook may continue to deteriorate.
Analysts are closely watching Singapore’s net employment data, job vacancies, average monthly earnings, and unemployment rates. Here’s a look at what the labor-market gauges tell us about the outlook:
Net Employment Outlook
Among 669 hiring managers in Singapore, attitudes toward the employment outlook in the final three months of the year are at their most pessimistic since the third quarter of 2017, according to the most recent ManpowerGroup survey released in September.
The difference between those saying staff numbers will increase in the fourth quarter versus those predicting a decrease is a slim 5 percentage points, the data show. Respondents in the manufacturer sector, which has been especially hard hit by the U.S.-China trade war, expect the weakest performance in a decade, according to Lee Ju Ye, an economist at Maybank Kim Eng Research Pte Ltd.
Job Vacancies
Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore, has her eyes on the job vacancy-to-unemployed ratio. DBS Group Holdings Ltd.’s Irvin Seah and Maybank’s Lee also closely track this gauge.
The measure slipped below 1 in the second quarter for the first time since the end of 2017, showing the city state’s jobless outnumbered open roles.
“The job vacancy-to-unemployed person ratio is key to me and it has dipped below parity, suggesting a softening in the labor market,” said Seah.
Average Monthly Earnings
Paychecks also have been feeling the pinch, at least through the first half of this year. Average monthly earnings rose 2.1% in the three months through June, the slowest pace since the start of 2017.
Unemployment Rates
Two unemployment rates tracked in Singapore -- one for citizens, and the other for citizens and permanent residents -- have been on the rise for the past few quarters. While still below their post-recession peaks, neither measure has seen a quarterly decline in almost two years and each has been worsening of late.
Retrenchments
Retrenchments climbed to 2,900 in the third quarter, after easing in the previous three months, according to advanced quarterly data released last week. The biggest losses were in the services industries, although manufacturing and construction also saw job cuts.
The Ministry of Manpower will provide more detailed information about retrenchments in an upcoming report, including whether terminations among professionals, managers, executives, and technicians -- or PMETs -- rose again in the quarter.
That’s a cause for worry for Seah.
“I look at the PMET share of retrenchment because this is the most vulnerable segment in the market,” he said before the advance quarterly report was released. “This is against conventional wisdom as most people assume that the lower-wage workers are more prone to retrenchment, which is not the case in Singapore.”
Re-Entry Duration
Ling is also tracking how fast retrenched workers find new jobs, which offers more bleak news.
The government tallies the share of retrenched who return to employment within six months, for any given quarter. That “re-entry” rate dropped sharply to 59.9% as of the second quarter, with those with “diploma and professional qualifications” declining to 57.7% from 70.9% in the first quarter."
976,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 06:46PM ET</span>","United, Avianca and Copa's South American deal delayed as they mull fourth partner","By Marcelo Rochabrun
BRASILIA (Reuters) - A proposed joint venture between United Airlines (O:UAL), Colombia's Avianca Holdings (CN:AVT_p) and Panama's Copa Holdings (N:CPA) has been delayed due to the potential inclusion of Brazil's  Azul SA  (N:AZUL) as a fourth partner, as well as problems at Avianca, the CEOs of two of the companies said.
The three airlines had said in November 2018 they would file for U.S. antitrust approval ""in the near term"" in order to coordinate routes between South America and the United States, a bold move to expand their market share in the region. At the time, the carriers said they aimed to implement the agreements in 2020.
United said last week it wants to include Azul, in which it already has a stake, in the planned tie-up with Copa and Avianca, the latest play by a U.S. carrier for a region expected to have significant air-travel growth in coming decades.
But almost a year after United, Copa and Avianca announced the preliminary joint venture plan, they have yet to file any paperwork with the U.S. Department of Transportation, seeking antitrust immunity. Now, the regulatory process may begin as late as next year.
Copa's CEO, Pedro Heilbron, said the group expects to file in early 2020, while Avianca's CEO, Anko van der Werff, said it would file between late 2019 and early 2020. Both spoke to Reuters in separate interviews on Monday on the sidelines of the ALTA Airline Leaders' Forum in Brasilia.
Both said there was a delay on the original timeline.
United did not respond to a request for comment. Azul had no comment other than saying it was ""always looking for opportunities with its partners.""
The potential inclusion of Azul, which may be in the early stages of negotiations, has been one reason for the timetable slipping.
""Quite frankly, really completely open and honest, we haven't had many discussions,"" van der Werff said. ""I personally haven't had even one real, serious discussion at the CEO level about when to include (Azul) and what to include.""
Both executives said they want Azul to be part of the joint venture - Brazil is by far the largest aviation market in the region - but its inclusion makes negotiations more difficult.
""It almost doubles the level of complexity,"" Heilbron said.
Avianca has also gone through corporate turmoil. In May, United Airlines ousted the chairman and controlling shareholder at Avianca, revamping leadership.
""We should have filed with regulators this year but everything got delayed because of what has happened at Avianca,"" Heilbron added."

979,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 06:02PM ET</span>",T-Mobile beats quarterly phone subscriber estimates,"By Sheila Dang and Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) on Monday beat analysts' third-quarter estimates for net new phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, boosted by competitive wireless plans aimed at fending off its bigger rivals.
The third-largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers has been locked in a lengthy battle to close its merger with smaller carrier Sprint Corp (N:S). It faces a state attorneys general lawsuit, led by New York and California and set to go to trial on Dec. 9, that alleges the merger would be harmful to consumers.
T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere, speaking on a conference call with analysts, said discussions were continuing with the attorneys general and he felt good about where they were headed ""either in settlement or going to trial.""
Legere said T-Mobile expects it will be permitted to close the merger in early 2020. 
The carrier added 754,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill on a net basis in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with 774,000 additions a year earlier.
Analysts had expected 742,600 new postpaid phone subscribers, according to research firm FactSet.
Investors pay close attention to postpaid customers, or those with a recurring bill, because they are more valuable to carriers and tend to remain with the company longer than prepaid users. 
T-Mobile customer growth in quarters: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/T-MOBILE-RESULTS/0H001QXFM94Y/eikon.png
Legere also teased an announcement on Nov. 7 related to New T-Mobile, the name that has been dubbed for the combined T-Mobile and Sprint. 
Though Legere provided few details, he said in response to an analyst question that he expected the announcement would answer some of the questions from the states in the merger lawsuit. 
Both Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T), which are larger than T-Mobile by subscriber count, beat Wall Street estimates for net new phone subscribers.
Bellevue, Washington-based T-Mobile said it expects pre-close merger-related costs to be $125 million to $150 million before taxes in the fourth quarter. 
The company said it now targeting adjusted core earnings for 2019 of $13.1 to $13.3 billion, up at the midpoint from prior guidance of $12.9 to $13.3 billion.
T-Mobile's third-quarter net income rose to $870 million, or $1.01 per share, from $795 million, or 93 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.01 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Revenue rose 2% to $11.06 billion, missing estimates of $11.33 billion. 

Shares of T-Mobile were down slightly to $82.02 in trading after the bell.

982,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 05:17PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow. 
1. U.S. Consumer Confidence, Housing in Spotlight
Top-tier economic data is on the calendar for tomorrow in the form of pending homes sales and consumer confidence. 
The Conference Board will issue its measure of consumer confidence for October at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
The index is expected to rise to 128 from 125.1 in September, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Consumer confidence data will take on added scrutiny after weaker retail sales data released last week raised concerns about consumer spending, which has been the main tailwind for the economy. 
At the same time, the latest data on pending home sales, meanwhile, is slated for 10:00 AM ET as well. The report will come from the National Association of Realtors.
On average, economists predict that pending home sales rose 0.9% in September, compared with a 1.6% increase in the previous month.
The duo of reports comes just a day ahead of the Federal Reserve's rate decision, with the odds of a cut to 1.5% to 1.75% at about 95%, up from 92% last week, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. 
2. GM, Pfizer Earnings Due
General Motors (NYSE:GM) and   Pfizer   (NYSE:PFE) roll up with earnings before the market opens tomorrow. 
The automaker’s earnings, however, are likely to take a back seat to commentary about how the 40-day of the UAW hurt business. 
The strike, which involved about 50,000 workers at GM, is expected to have costed the company about $2 billion, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). 
Beyond the impact of the strike, car sales will also be in focus with the company reporting earlier this month that it had sold 738,638 vehicles in the quarter, up 6.3% from a year earlier. 
GM is expected to report earnings $1.38 a share on revenue of $34.95 billion. 
In pharma, Pfizer will be in the spotlight, with the drugmaker forecast to report earnings of 62 cents per share on revenue of $12.27 billion. 
The company's share price has come under pressure amid valuation concerns, with   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS) saying the earnings power of Pfizer) and Upjohn, the off-patent drug business it spun off this year, are weaker than expected amid concerns about negative regulatory action and lower margins. 
3. AMD Earnings on Deck
Chip stocks will be in focus tomorrow as AMD reports earnings after the closing bell tomorrow. 
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) reports earnings amid a favorable backdrop, following the launch of its new chips, which attracted notable customers like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). 
The earnings report comes as the company continues to scoop up new business at the lower end of the market, after Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) decided to de-prioritize shipments of low-end CPUs. 
“IIntel's PC CPU shortages should again have allowed AMD to gain share at OEMs/ODMs who need to find substitutes for older/low end INTC parts,” Wedbush said in a note to clients.
Its gaming sector, which makes up the bulk of revenue, will likely get a boost from strong PC shipments, which should “have boosted both AMD's CPU and GPU businesses in the quarter,” Wedbush added.
AMD is expected to report earnings of 18 cents per share on revenue of $1.81 billion. "
983,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 05:13PM ET</span>","Stocks - S&P Hits a Record Close as Tech, Trade Hopes Power Market","Investing.com - U.S. stocks surged Monday with the S&P 500 hitting new intraday and closing highs and new records set for the Nasdaq 100 index as well.
The rally was pushed by gains in technology and communications services, which translates basically into big tech stocks, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT). All of those stocks hit new highs.
Banks also saw new highs.
The S&P 500 hit an all-time high of 3,044.08 soon after the open and finished up 0.6% at a record 3,039.42, breaking the old closing high of 3,025.86, set on July 26.
The Nasdaq 100 ended up 1.01% at 8,110.67. It hit a new intraday high of 8,119.73 and broke its old closing record of 8,029.22, set just on Friday. The Nasdaq Composite was also up 1.01%.
The Dow Jones industrials were up 0.5%, thanks to gains for Microsoft, Apple and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), but was off about 1.1% from its high.
The catalysts were expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut its key interest rate on Wednesday and bullishness about Alphabet, which reported postmarket today and Apple, which reports fiscal fourth-quarter results after Wednesday's close.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares were 0.8% lower after hours after its earnings missed analyst estimates because of heavy marketing spending, even as revenue jumped 20% to $40.5 billion.
Luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF) shares jumped 31% after French luxury group LVMH (PA:LVMH) offered to buy the iconic New York company for $14.5 billion.
In addition, there were continued hopes that a partial U.S.-China trade deal would be negotiated soon. President Donald Trump tweeted Monday progress was being made.
It wasn't clear if the market was reacting to the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who died Saturday during a raid on his compound in Syria.
In addition to the usual big-tech names, semiconductors also surged, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 1.75% and hitting a new intraday high as well. Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) hit new highs and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) were leaders in the group. 
Banks pushed higher with new highs for Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and   Citigroup   (NYSE:C), as well as JPMorgan Chase. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), up 1.63%, was the third-best performer among the 30 Dow stocks after Microsoft and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM).
With Monday's close, the S&P 500 was up 21% for the year, with the Dow up 16.1% and the Nasdaq up 25.5%. 
But a little context is in order because the drubbing the market sustained in the fourth quarter of 2018. So, compared with the market's 2018 peaks, the S&P 500 is up 3.35%. The Dow is up 0.5%, with the Nasdaq up 2.37%. 
 
 
 
The rally pulled money from bonds, pushing the 10-YearTreasury yield up to 1.847% from Friday's 1.801%.
Rising rates weighed on utilities and real estate stocks. Also lower: consumer staples and energy stocks.
Energy shares were hit by lower oil prices. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 85 cents to $55.81 a barrel. Brent crude also fell 45 cents to $61.47. Gold futures fell $9.50 to $1,495.80 in New York. 
Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF), asset manager Affiliated Managers Group (NYSE:AMG), biotech company Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) and meat-processor   Tyson Foods   (NYSE:TSN) were among the S&P 500 leaders Monday. 
Industrial-real-estate developer   Prologis   (NYSE:PLD),   Molson Coors   Brewing (NYSE:TAP), Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG) and home builder DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) were among the weakest.

984,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 05:13PM ET</span>",French luxury group LVMH offers to buy U.S. jeweler Tiffany: sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (PA:LVMH) has approached  Tiffany & Co  (N:TIF) with a $14.5 billion acquisition offer, people familiar with the matter said, at a time when the U.S. luxury jeweler grapples with the impact of tariffs on its exports to China.
LVMH, which has for years been looking for ways to expand in the U.S. market, submitted a preliminary, non-binding offer to Tiffany earlier this month, one of the sources said.
LVMH's offer valued Tiffany at about $120 per share, another of the sources added. Tiffany shares ended trading on Friday at $98.55.
Tiffany has hired advisers to review LVMH's offer but has not yet responded to it, and there is no certainty that it will negotiate a deal, according to the sources.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. LVMH and Tiffany declined to comment. Bloomberg News reported earlier on Saturday that LVMH was holding talks with Tiffany.
LVMH, which is behind brands such as Fendi, Christian Dior and Givenchy, as well as Veuve Cliquot champagne, has stood out for several years as one of the top performers in the upscale retail sector, where not all labels are benefiting to the same degree from booming Chinese appetite for branded goods.
Tiffany, on the other hand, has not been as resilient. Beyond the tariffs that have been triggered by the trade war between the United States and China, a lower Chinese domestic sales tax has also contributed to double-digit decreases in its sales to Chinese tourists in the United States and in other destinations.
High-end brands have also long relied on Hong Kong as a major shopping hub drawing visitors from mainland China in particular, and four months of pro-democracy demonstrations are starting to take their toll.
However, earlier this month LVMH, which has a market capitalization of 194 billion euros ($215 billion), beat sales forecasts for the third quarter despite the unrest in Hong Kong. In August, Tiffany reported quarterly earnings that also beat analysts' expectations, thanks to a drop in marketing costs.
Tiffany has been refreshing its offerings with more affordable items such as pendants and earrings, to appeal to millennials who have been gravitating to lower-priced competitors such as Denmark's  Pandora  A/S (CO:PNDORA) and Signet Jewelers (N:SIG).
Paris-headquartered LVMH is controlled by the Arnault family and is led by Bernard Arnault, France's richest man. Based in New York and best known for its diamond engagement rings, Tiffany operates more than 300 retail stores globally."

The company's shares fell 8% in after-market trading as the surge in expenses overshadowed a beat on quarterly revenue and a raised forecast for full-year sales.
Operating expenses surged 124% to $29 million in the three months ended Sept. 28. It also represented a 42% jump from the second quarter. 
The California-based company raised its full-year net revenue forecast for the second time to $265 million to $275 million. It had previously forecast net revenue to exceed $240 million.
Consumers looking to switch to healthier diets have fueled demand for faux meat alternatives, prompting restaurants like Carl's Jr and Yum Brands' KFC to rush to get Beyond Meat's products on their menus. 
Net revenue rose 250% in the third quarter to $91.96 million, above Wall Street's estimate of $82.2 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

986,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 04:34PM ET</span>","Venezuela Defaults on Its Last Bond, Setting Up Legal Showdown","(Bloomberg) -- The team advising Venezuelan National Assembly President Juan Guaido skipped a payment Monday on the nation’s only bonds not in default, setting up a legal showdown with creditors.
Rather than pay the $913 million due on Petroleos de Venezuela’s 2020 notes, Guaido’s advisers say they will take legal action against investors to fight any efforts to seize the collateral on the bonds -- 50.1% of Citgo Holding Inc.’s shares. Their argument is that the debt is illegal because the opposition-led National Assembly never approved its issuance. On Thursday, the Trump administration moved to temporarily shield the collateral from creditors.
“Despite all the efforts to date, the ad hoc administrative board of PDVSA hasn’t achieved a reasonable arrangement with the bondholders,” the board said in a statement. The board “will take legal actions aimed at protecting its rights based on the invalidity of the 2020 bonds.”
Looming PDVSA Default Pits Ashmore Against Venezuela’s Guaido
Luxembourg-based Clearstream Banking and Brussels-based Euroclear, the clearinghouses for the debt, didn’t receive the $843 million in principal and $71 million in interest due Monday, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Guaido, recognized by the U.S. and nearly 60 countries as Venezuela’s interim president, scored a last-minute victory on Thursday when the Treasury Department updated its sanctions guidelines to block creditors from seizing their collateral for 90 days. With the Trump administration’s support, Guaido and his allies effectively run Houston-based Citgo, yet have little operational control over its Caracas-based parent PDVSA.
London-based Ashmore Group Plc holds about half of the PDVSA 2020 bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., T Rowe Price Group Inc (NASDAQ:TROW). and the Royal Bank of Canada are among the other top reported holders."

The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $10.12 on revenue of $40.50 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com forecast EPS of $12.28 on revenue of $40.3 billion. That compared to EPS of $13.06 on revenue of $33.74 billion in the same period a year earlier.
Costs rose to $31.32 billion in the quarter from $25.11 billion a year earlier, pressuring margins to 23% in the quarter from 26% a year earlier, offsetting a jump in advertising revenue.
Advertising revenue, which forms a large chunk of Alphabet’s top line, rose to $33.9 billion during the quarter, up from around $28.9 billion a year earlier. 
Meanwhile, Alphabet’s Other Bets category, which includes smart home brand Nest, reported a wider operating loss of $941 million for the quarter, compared with a loss of $727 million in the previous year.
""I am extremely pleased with the progress we made across the board in the third quarter, from our recent advancements in search and quantum computing to our strong revenue growth driven by mobile search, YouTube and Cloud,” said CEO Sundar Pichai. “We’re focused on providing the most helpful services to our users and partners, and we see many opportunities ahead.”"

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 hit a record high on Monday, while the Nasdaq fell just short of its lifetime high touched in late July as a more civil tone between the United States and China lifted hopes for a possible trade deal and investors looked toward a Federal Reserve rate cut later this week.
 Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) shares climbed 2.46%, making the stock among the biggest boosts to each of three major indexes after the technology giant won the Pentagon's $10 billion cloud computing contract, beating out Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
After rising as much as 0.71% to 3,044.08, the benchmark S&P closed up 0.56% at 3,039.34, topping the record high of 3,025.86 hit on July 26, while the Nasdaq ended the session less than 5 points below its closing high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended less than 1% away from its record closing level.
President Donald Trump said on Monday he expected to sign a significant part of a trade deal with China ahead of schedule but did not elaborate on the timing, building on optimism from Friday when Washington said it was ""close to finalizing"" some parts of a trade deal.
Economic data shows the trade war between the world's two largest economies has begun to take a toll on both countries, leading to worries about a global slowdown. 
Global central banks have responded by easing monetary policy. The Federal Reserve is expected to follow that trend at its two-day policy meeting beginning on Tuesday, with high expectations that it will cut interest rates for a third time this year.
""After we finish earnings season and get through this Fed meeting, people will be looking to the trade deal,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina. ""Importantly, as you watch the economic numbers come in here and globally between now and year end, you want to continue to see incremental positive sequential changes. You want to get some confirmation that in fact growth has bottomed and has started to improve."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 132.25 points, or 0.49%, to 27,090.31, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 16.79 points, or 0.56%, to 3,039.34 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 82.87 points, or 1.01%, to 8,325.99.
The outlook for a quarter percentage point cut in U.S. borrowing costs have jumped to 94.1% from 49.2% last month, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.
The third-quarter earnings season has managed to ease some concerns related to the impact of trade tensions on corporate profits, with over 78% of the 204 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far surpassing profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data. Still, third-quarter earnings are expected to show a decline of 2%. 
Investors are waiting for earnings from heavyweights this week such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Starbucks (O:SBUX) and Merck & Co Inc (N:MRK).
Chipmakers, which have acted as a proxy for trade tensions with China, gained 1.75% on Monday. The technology (SPLRCT), healthcare (SPXHC) and communication services (SPLRCL) sectors gained more than 1% each. 
Among other stocks, AT&T Inc (N:T) rose 4.28% after the U.S. wireless carrier said it would add two new board members and consider selling off up to $10 billion worth of non-core businesses next year.
Tiffany & Co (N:TIF) surged 31.63% after Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (PA:LVMH) made a $120 per share offer to buy the U.S. luxury jeweler.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.28-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.83-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -  BP  (LON:BP) Plc is still looking to close its deal with Bunge Ltd to merge sugar and ethanol assets in Brazil in 2019, so the companies can go on to plan their operations together for the new cane season that starts in early 2020.
BP's chief executive for biofuels, Mario Lindenhayn, told reporters on the sidelines of Datagro's sugar conference in Sao Paulo the oil major was just waiting for the green light of antitrust bodies in three countries, including China, to close the deal.
""We already had the approval from Brazil and the European Union, and we are expecting remaining approvals still this year, that is the objective,"" Lindenhayn said.
BP and Bunge announced in July the deal to merge their Brazilian sugar and ethanol operations. BP agreed to transfer $700 million of Bunge's debt to the new venture, and make an additional cash payment of $75 million to Bunge.
The resulting company will have 11 plants in Brazil and capacity to crush 32 million tonnes of cane per year.
Lindenhayn said BP sees an opportunity for continued growth in ethanol consumption in Brazil for years, despite changes in the global auto industry toward electrification.
He said he believed the current fuel infrastructure in Brazil, with ethanol pumps spread over all states, makes it likely that flex fuel cars and hybrid vehicles that will use ethanol will continue to dominate the market for years to come.
Lindenhayn also said he felt positive regarding the potential for increased ethanol blending in gasoline in large fuel-consuming countries such as India and China, which could help boost the global market for the biofuel."
992,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 04:11PM ET</span>","New tuberculosis treatment for developing countries to cost $1,040","By Manojna Maddipatla and Manas Mishra
(Reuters) - A newly approved three-drug treatment for tuberculosis will be available in 150 countries including India and South Africa, priced at $1,040 for a complete regimen, more than twice the cost proposed in the past by advocacy groups for other treatments.
The United Nations-backed Stop TB Partnership said on Monday that BPaL would be obtainable in eligible countries through the Global Drug Facility (GDF), a global provider of TB medicines created in 2001 to negotiate lower prices for treatments.
Tuberculosis was responsible for 1.5 million deaths in 2018.
BPaL is an oral treatment which promises a shorter, more convenient option to existing TB treatment options, which use a cocktail of antibiotic drugs over a period of up to two years.
The new cocktail, which will treat extensively drug-resistant strains of the illness, consists of drug developer TB Alliance's newly-approved medicine pretomanid, in combination with linezolid and Johnson & Johnson's (N:JNJ) bedaquiline.
Pretomanid, which will be available at $364 per treatment course, is only the third new medicine for drug-resistant tuberculosis to be approved in about 40 years, after J&J's bedaquiline and Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co Ltd's delamanid.
Advocacy groups have long criticized the cost for bedaquiline and delamanid. Not-for-profit Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has waged a running battle in public with J&J over its $400 price tag for a six-month course for bedaquiline.
MSF has argued that bedaquiline could be produced and sold at a profit for 25 cents per day, and that the price of treatments for drug-resistant TB should be no higher than $500 for a complete treatment course.
Leena Menghaney, the South-Asia head for MSF's Access Campaign, said it was a cause of concern that pretomanid was priced just below the price of bedaquiline.
But Stop TB Partnership says costs of other regimens for extremely drug-resistant TB range from $2,000 to $8,000 for courses of at least 20 months.
TB Alliance in April granted a license to U.S. drugmaker Mylan NV (O:MYL) to manufacture and sell pretomanid as part of certain regimens in high-income markets, as well as a non-exclusive license for low-income and middle-income countries, where most tuberculosis cases occur.
Stop TB Partnership said it would start supplying the regimen following World Health Organization's guidance on using the drug. Mylan, however, said it will also sell the drug directly to countries.
Prices in low-income countries would be in-line with the price offered through GDF, but would be decided on a case by case basis where the drug is not supplied through GDF, it said.
The drug will be available in bottles of 26 tablets, with a six-month treatment requiring seven bottles.
India-based Macleods Pharmaceuticals Ltd has also been granted a non-exclusive license to make pretomanid as part of the BPaL regimen, TB Alliance said on Monday.
The generic drugs maker will market the treatment in about 140 countries with high tuberculosis rates."

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Wind-whipped flames chased thousands of residents from some of Los Angeles' wealthiest neighborhoods and threatened the famed Getty Center museum on Monday, the latest outbreak in a wildfire season that has triggered mass evacuations and power outages across California.
The fire erupted in the vicinity of the Getty Center at around 1:30 a.m.(0830 GMT) and by daybreak had swept across more than 500 acres (202 hectares) in the scrub-covered hills around Interstate 405, near some of the city's most expensive homes. 
Basketball great LeBron James, ""Terminator"" star and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, ""Agents of SHIELD"" actor Clark Gregg and ""Sons of Anarchy"" creator Kurt Sutter all said on Twitter they had been forced to flee their homes. Commuters posted videos on social media of entire slopes engulfed in orange flames close to the highway's edge.
At least five homes had burned down, but no injuries were reported, Mayor Eric Garcetti said at a news conference along with fire officials, warning that he expected property losses to rise.
""This is a fire that quickly spread,"" he said, urging residents in the mandatory evacuation zone, which encompasses more than 10,000 homes and businesses, to get out quickly. 
James, an area resident who plays for the Los Angeles Lakers, said he had heeded the warning and had been driving around before dawn with his family looking for shelter.
""Finally found a place to accommodate us!"" he wrote a short time later on Twitter. ""Crazy night man!""
Kathleen Crandell, a 33-year-old resident of the Pacific Palisades neighborhood adjacent to sprawling parkland in L.A.'s coastal foothills, said she managed to grab her two cats and a handful of other belongings as she fled in her first-ever evacuation.
""This little thing is like a bad dream,"" Crandell said in an interview with local radio station KPCC.
The fire was stoked by sustained winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour, gusting to 50 mph (80 kph), weather officials said. 
Officials at the Getty art museum said the fire was burning north of the building, which was designed with thick stone walls to protect its treasures from flames.
WINE COUNTRY FIRE
Fierce winds fanning wildfires elsewhere across the state in recent days, including a large blaze consuming parts of Sonoma County's picturesque wine country north of San Francisco, were expected to abate later on Monday.
But forecasters with the National Weather Service said high winds would return later in the week and could become the strongest so far this year in Southern (NYSE:SO) California.
Sonoma County has been hardest hit in the latest spate of more than a dozen California wildfires, with more than 100 square miles (260 sq km) burned and 190,000 people evacuated in a blaze dubbed the Kincade Fire.
Only about 5% of that fire was contained early on Monday after crews lost ground against a wind-driven flareup a day earlier.
More than 4,000 firefighting personnel were battling the Kincade, which has destroyed 96 structures, about a quarter of the homes and other buildings known to have been lost in California wildfires since last week, prompting Governor Gavin Newsom to declare a statewide emergency.
The cause of the Kincade remained under investigation, although Pacific Gas and Electric Co (N:PCG) has acknowledged the blaze ignited near a damaged high-voltage transmission tower at about the time a malfunction of the line occurred.
More than 1 million homes and businesses were without electricity on Monday morning, most of those from planned, precautionary power outages. Forecasts of high winds prompted PG&E to shut off power to 940,000 customers in 43 counties on Saturday night to guard against the risk of touching off wildfires. 
PG&E said it expects to issue a weather all-clear for safety inspections and restoration work to begin on Monday for the northern Sierras and North Coast, the company said.
The governor has been sharply critical of PG&E, saying corporate greed and mismanagement kept it from upgrading its infrastructure while wildfire hazards have steadily worsened over the past decade.
PG&E filed for bankruptcy in January, citing billions of dollars in civil liabilities from deadly wildfires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018. 

After a brief trading halt tripped by its rapid fall, PG&E's stock was down more than 20% on Monday.

In a statement, the ministry said cancellation of the fee would be part of a group of measures to stimulate tourism. Infrastructure Minister Tarcisio de Freitas first disclosed plans to cancel the $18 fee in remarks to reporters earlier Monday.
The fee was created in the late 1990s to raise tax revenue. Freitas said in the ministry statement that abolishing it would help attract low cost carriers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve announced Monday it had proposed easier rules for when banks must set aside cash to safeguard derivatives trades between affiliates.
The proposal follows a similar plan laid out by another banking regulator, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in September. The simpler proposal could potentially free billions of dollars at large banks that would no longer have to post upfront margin on internal derivatives trades. The proposal was approved by a vote of four to one as Governor Lael Brainard said the reversal was unjustified and could heighten risk in the financial system."

While U.S. demand has held firm, the diamond market has weakened elsewhere and trade tensions and protests in Hong Kong have dented sales in China, the second largest diamond market.
But luxury groups see potential for growth in jewelry demand, as shown by LVMH's (PA:LVMH) nearly $14.5 billion offer, made public on Monday, to buy  Tiffany & Co  (N:TIF).
Esther Oberbeck, group head of strategy at De Beers, the world's biggest diamond producer by value, said in an interview the company was about to launch new marketing campaigns, focused on the U.S. and China.
She did not specify the budget, but said De Beers' 2019 spend would exceed last year's $170 million and was the highest in more than a decade.
The campaigns, which she said would concentrate on ""self-purchase and the bridal market"", are based on research carried out for De Beers, published on Monday.
It found the share of U.S. women buying their own engagement ring doubled from 7% to 14% over the five-year period 2013-2017 and that women on average spent a third more than men – $4,400 compared with $3,300.
De Beers sells rough diamonds and jewelry through its Forevermark brand.
Its research anticipates the rough diamond market will recover from a period of oversupply as some mines reach their end of their lives, notably Rio Tinto's (L:RIO) (AX:RIO) Argyle mine in Australia.
Global consumer demand for diamonds rose by 2% in 2018 to $76 billion and, in dollar terms, China and the United States were the fastest-growing regions, both increasing by 5% year on year, it said.
Demand for diamond jewelry in the U.S. rose by 5% to $36 billion, representing just under half of total global diamond jewelry demand, underpinned by ""solid macro-economic factors"", the De Beers research found.
Diamonds are still the leading choice for engagement rings, whether between same-sex or heterosexual couples.
But demand for diamond jewelry as a gift to mark all kinds of special occasions, including rewards to oneself, now outweighs demand directly related to weddings, De Beers said."

(Reuters) - Google owner Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) has made an offer to acquire U.S. wearable device maker  Fitbit Inc  (N:FIT), as it eyes a slice of the crowded market for fitness trackers and smartwatches, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
While Google has joined other major technology companies such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) in developing smart phones, it has yet to develop any wearable offerings.
There is no certainty that the negotiations between Google and Fitbit will lead to any deal, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. The exact price that Google has offered for Fitbit could not be learned.
Google and Fitbit declined to comment.
Fitbit shares rose 27% on the news, giving the company a market capitalization of $1.4 billion. Alphabet shares rose 2% to $1,293.49.
A deal for Fitbit would come as its dominant share of the fitness tracking sector continues to be chipped away by cheaper offerings from companies such as China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810).
Fitbit's fitness trackers monitor users' daily steps, calories burned and distance traveled. They also measure floors climbed, sleep duration and quality, and heart rate.
Fitbit, which helped pioneer the wearable devices craze, has been partnering with health insurers and has been making tuck-in acquisitions in the healthcare market, as part of efforts to diversify its revenue stream. Analysts have said that much of the company's value may now lie in its health data.
Fitbit cut its 2019 revenue forecast in July, blaming disappointing sales of its newly launched cheapest smartwatch Versa Lite. The watch is priced at $160, compared with $200 for the full version. It can track workouts and heart rate but lacks features such as the ability to store music directly.
In August, Fitbit said it had signed a contract with the Singapore government to provide fitness trackers and services in a health program it said could reach up to 1 million users.
Fitbit in August also launched its latest smartwatch, Versa 2, adding Amazon.com Inc’s (O:AMZN) voice assistant Alexa, online payments and music storage to the device’s capabilities.
Fitbit is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Nov. 6. Alphabet is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings later on Monday.
Fitbit would not be the first deal that Google would be carrying out in the wearables space. Fossil Group Inc (O:FOSL) said in January it would sell its intellectual property related to smartwatch technology under development to Google for $40 million. Google's plans for these assets are not clear.
Reuters had reported last month that Fitbit was speaking to investment bank Qatalyst Partners about exploring a sale."

(Reuters) - Shares of Richard Branson-backed Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc (N:SPCE) jumped as much as 7.7% in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, underscoring investor interest in the first space tourism company to hit public markets.
The company was created from the merger between British billionaire Branson's Virgin Galactic and former Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) executive Chamath Palihapitiya's publicly traded shell company, which has invested $800 million for a 49% stake.
Merging with an already public company allowed Branson's space venture to sidestep the traditional initial public offering process, including filing extensive paperwork with the U.S. SEC.
Virgin Galactic's stock market splash comes during a particular bruising period for debuts by private firms and startups, with unproven business models. 
WeWork's IPO, which was billed as the most high-profile public debut of the year, was scrapped after investors raised concerns over its burgeoning losses and poor corporate governance, while debuts of others such as  Peloton Interactive Inc  (O:PTON). and SmileDirectClub were lackluster.
""This is a shaky environment for companies with grand visions but unproven models"" said Matthew Kennedy, senior IPO market strategist at Renaissance Capital.
Branson, with a 51% stake, retains control of the company which had a market cap of $2.3 billion following the announcement of the merger completion on Friday. Palihapitiya is chairman of the combined company.
Branson is racing against competitors Blue Origin, the space business of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk's SpaceX to bring tourists into space.
Hundreds of people from 60 countries, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber, have paid or put down deposits to fly on one of Virgin's suborbital flights. 
Some of Virgin Galactic's ticket holders have been waiting over 14 years for their trip. A 90-minute flight, which allows passengers to experience a few minutes of weightlessness, costs about $250,000.
Virgin's current reservations represent about $80 million in total collected deposits and $120 million of potential revenue.
Earlier this month, the company announced space-wear for passengers developed in collaboration with sportswear maker  Under Armour  Inc (N:UAA).

The stock rose to as much as $12.93 after opening at $12.01.

Last week, Microsoft won the Pentagon contract termed Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, or JEDI, that will be worth up to $10 billion over a period of 10 years, beating out favorite Amazon's AWS.
Shares of Microsoft rose as much as 3.4% to a record high of $145.67 on Monday.
""Bottom line, the contract is a significant win for Microsoft and vaults Azure forward in the cloud platform wars,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Mark Murphy said.
Amazon's Amazon Web Services currently holds about 32% of the cloud computing market, while Microsoft's Azure has about 18%, according to research firm Canalys.
While AWS contributes nearly 13% to Amazon's total net sales, Azure accounts for about 33% of Microsoft's revenue and are both a major cash cow for the companies.
Friday's decision came after months of controversy and protest over the process for awarding the deal and even drawing the attention of President Donald Trump, who has publicly taken swipes at Amazon, long considered the frontrunner.
Analysts at brokerage firm Compass Point said the deal was a ""significant victory"" for Microsoft over AWS and added that Amazon could challenge the decision.
""We expect a degree of handwringing among Congressional Democrats given the political and practical dimensions of this issue, but our sense is that lawmakers are unlikely to wade too deeply into these waters,"" Compass Point's Marshall Senk said.
Brokerages Mizuho and Independent Research raised their price target on the Microsoft stock at the prospect of the company getting a boost from the contract.
""In the end, the fact that Azure was chosen as the sole provider for this important project is a testament to just how far it has come over the past couple of years,"" said Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz, who raised his price target by $8 to $160.
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives noted that the deal helps Microsoft gain a bigger chunk of an estimated $1 trillion of next decade cloud business and $100 billion of U.S. government business.

1004,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 01:40PM ET</span>",NewsBreak: Uber Starts Uber Money to Create Financial Ecosystem,"Investing.com – Ridesharing company Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) is expanding its financial services offerings, with plans to start a digital wallet service and offer debit and credit cards.
The move, announced Monday, is intended to add new revenue streams to the company, which has struggled to convince investors it can be profitable. The company has been losing millions since its startup.

The new business, to be called UBER Money, will start by expanding Uber’s efforts to give its 4-million-plus drivers and couriers around the world access to a mobile bank account so they can get paid after each ride, Peter Hazlehurst, who will head the new division, told CNBC.

The service is being tested now. Debit cards are linked to an account provided by pre-paid debit card company Green Dot.
Uber (NYSE:UBER) shares were up 1.5% at 1:20 PM ET (17:22 GMT). They're still off more than 26% from their IPO price of $45.

1005,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 01:36PM ET</span>",StockBeat: Virgin Galantic Lifts off in Public Market Debut,"Investing.com - Virgin Galactic surged Monday in its public market debut, with investors backing the company's mission to ramp up space tourism.
Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE), backed by Sir Richard Branson, surged as much as 5% after opening at $12.50. It took an unconventional path to Wall Street, ditching the traditional IPO route and going public with a direct listing after raising funds through a merger with   Social Capital Hedosophia   .
Social Capital Hedosophia forked out $800 million for a 49% stake in the company.
""We believe Virgin Galactic is ideally positioned to capitalize on the fast-growing, multibillion-dollar commercial space market and ultimately open space to thousands of new astronauts,"" Branson said on the trading floor, according to reports.
Space tourism has yet to take off, with only the rich and famous seemingly able to afford the opportunity to get a taste of astronaut life. The 90-minute space ride is priced at about $250,000 per ticket, according to Virgin.
Virgin does not, however, see the ticket price as a stumbling block, with the company expected to turn a profit by 2023.
The company said it already sold 600 tickets, hauling in $80 million from customers, with 15 trips in the pipeline for next year. In 2023, the company expects to make 270 trips to space, generating more than $430 million in profit.
Virgin's commercial space mission is behind schedule after the death of a pilot in 2014 during a flight test forced the company to delay its space program.
But Virgin Galatic is not the only company vying to become the first company to ferry customers into space.
Elon Musk's SpaceX and Blue Origin, the space venture of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, are also in the space race.
The trio's efforts are expected to pave the wave for more affordable space tourism, which will be a $3 billion market by 2030, according to UBS.
“While space tourism is still at a nascent phase, we think that as technology becomes proven, and the cost falls due to technology and competition, space tourism will become more mainstream,” UBS analysts Jarrod Castle and Myles Walton wrote in the note. “Space tourism could be the stepping stone for the development of long-haul travel on earth serviced by space."""

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 01:27PM ET</span>","Vinik to shut down hedge fund, says raising cash 'much harder' than expected","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Money manager Jeffrey Vinik said on Wednesday he was shutting down his stock-picking hedge fund, citing unexpected difficulties raising cash for the decision to end a much-hyped but short-lived relaunch of his asset management firm.
""Simply put, it has been much harder to raise money over the last several months than I anticipated,"" Vinik wrote in a letter to investors seen by Reuters, relaying his decision to shut down the portfolio on Nov. 15, 2019.
While the fund's performance was good, gaining a net 4.8% this year, it was not strong enough to attract fresh waves of capital, Vinik said in an interview. ""I thought I could have 30 to 40 meetings in New York and fly home with commitments for $3 billion, but there is no sign of new money coming in,"" he said.
The 60-year-old investor, who once ran Fidelity's flagship Magellan Fund and in 1996 launched a hedge fund that oversaw $10 billion at its peak, announced his return in January. He had planned to raise as much as $3 billion, and reminded potential investors he had survived many economic cycles.
It had been six years since Vinik shut down the previous fund and he had been itching to get back in the game. He missed the markets and competing with the world's biggest institutional investors, Vinik told Reuters in a January interview.
Other hedge funds had taken their eye off the ball, Vinik said as he prepared to sell his story to pension funds and wealthy investors. Two decades ago, his reputation was so strong that Vinik Asset Management pulled in $800 million on its first day, enough to stop further fund raising immediately.
But times have changed. After scheduling dozens of meetings, Vinik in February offered potential clients fee cuts to drum up support fast. He also sought to temper expectations by saying it was no longer possible to raise $3 billion by March 1. Indeed, he had raised only $465 million at that time, according to a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Vinik said he had planned to run the fund for five years, until he turned 65, but acknowledged that it made little sense to carry on now. He will be helping his staff find new positions, he said, and has not decided whether he will continue to invest his own fortune day to day.
The Wall Street Journal first reported news of the imminent demise of the fund run by Vinik, who owns the Tampa Bay Lightning hockey team.
Vinik is not alone in deciding to shut down his firm. In August, Hoplite Capital announced plans to close after sluggish returns.
Previously, Tourbillon Capital Partners also announced plans to shutter while Highfields Capital Management and Omega Advisors told clients they would stop managing outsiders' money to become family offices, investing mainly their founders' money."

1010,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 01:21PM ET</span>",Factbox: Soft or hard - emerging markets flirting with capital curbs,"LONDON (Reuters) - Argentina ramped up capital controls over the weekend, showing that a clampdown on cross-border movement of hard currency remains a key crisis control tool in emerging markets.
But is the use of capital controls globally increasing alongside rising tariff barriers? And how damaging is this friction in international trade and finance to the economies of the developing world?
Capital controls in various forms have seen something of a renaissance over recent years.
In the past few months alone, policy makers across developing economies have used various restrictions on the purchase or sale of domestic currency to foreigners or hard currency to nationals to get to grips with persistent currency turbulence and dwindling hard cash reserves.
Even giant economies such as China carefully control cross border flows.
Among global investors, the jury is out as to their effectiveness. While they are sometimes applauded as a short-term stabilization tool helping to adjust a country's balance of payments imbalance, they risk deterring often much-needed foreign capital if left in place for a protracted time.
""The idea is if you have capital controls, you make a recession shallower,"" said Gabriel Sterne, head of global macro research at Oxford Economics.
""But in the longer term it kind of works the other way: If you have capital controls it means you will also have no capital coming in, because even if you don't restrict any capital coming in, who is going to put capital in if you cannot get it out again?""
Below are examples of countries that have used capital measures in the past 12 months.
ARGENTINA - The central bank announced early on Monday it would slash the amount of dollars individuals could buy, amid concerns over outflows of FX reserves accelerating after incumbent Mauricio Macri lost Sunday's presidential election. Curbs on dollar purchasing for individuals now stand at $200 per month, down from $10,000 a month, and will be in place until December when the new government is in situ. The central bank has spent about $22 billion in its reserves to defend the peso since Aug. 11.
LEBANON - Although Lebanon has not imposed hard capital controls, a state prosecutor banned traders and money exchangers from taking significant amounts of physical dollar currency out of the country at air and land borders on Sunday, without specifying amounts. Separately, Central Bank chief Riad Salameh said currency exchangers must be licensed to move funds, do it through licensed companies or apply for a license. Banks have been shut for nine days as protests over economic strife have paralyzed the country.
TURKEY - Ankara never officially introduced capital controls. However, pressure on local banks in March to stop lending lira to overseas counterparts looked like a deliberate ploy and one that bore a striking resemblance to a capital control. The squeeze caused borrowing costs to soar to more than 1,000%, making it costly for foreign investors to short or hedge the currency.
CHINA - Draconian capital controls have helped China keep outflows under control over the past year despite an escalating trade war with the United States and weakening economic growth at home. In 2018, China moved to rein in currency outflows via the handful of overseas investment channels available to mainland investors.
GREECE - Athens fully lifted its remaining capital controls in August - more than four years after introducing the curbs when Greece was embroiled in a dispute with lenders over how to prop up an economy overwhelmed by a mountain of debt and its banks were bleeding cash. S&P Global last week upgraded Greece's long-term sovereign credit rating by a notch to 'BB-' from 'B+', saying the restrictions' removal will improve confidence in the economy, while reducing related financial cost."
1011,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 12:46PM ET</span>",Is it worth it? UK banks question EU access after Brexit,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Direct access to the European Union after Brexit may not be worth the cost if Britain has to align itself with EU rules covering only a narrow range of activity, financial industry officials have said.
The UK financial sector's single biggest customer is the EU and it currently enjoys ""passporting"" or unfettered access to the bloc. But this will end after Britain exits the bloc.
Future trade will be based on ""equivalence"", the EU's system of access to foreign firms that Brussels deems to have home rules as strict as those in the bloc.
""The UK will be the most equivalent country in the world,"" Nausicaa Delfas, executive director international at Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, told Reuters on Monday.
She urged Brussels to take a technical and not a political approach to determining UK equivalence.
Equivalence-based EU access amounts to 5-10% of cross-border business under passporting, and Britain wants Brussels to ""enhance"" the system to make it more predictable and transparent.
This could include a ""mechanism"" to deal with any divergence in rules as Britain does not want to become a permanent ""taker"" of EU regulations.
Antony Manchester, a managing director at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), said weighing up the advantages of equivalence would be easier for Britain if the EU were to enhance it.
""Otherwise you end up with a situation where it's all or nothing,"" Manchester told a City & Financial conference on Brexit. ""I hope that the reality of interdependence creeps in... otherwise you end up with closed European markets.""
Over 300 banks, insurers and asset managers in Britain have opened EU hubs to serve their customers directly from inside the bloc, which limits the usefulness of Britain pushing hard for equivalence.
AMBITIOUS
The UK financial sector proposed a broader and novel ""mutual recognition"" approach two years ago, whereby the UK and EU would agree to accept each others' rules. But the EU shot it down - believing Britain should not enjoy the same privileges outside the bloc as it did inside.
""Asking the EU to change equivalence is actually equally ambitious as the mutual recognition model,"" said Conor Lawlor, director of Brexit policy at UK Finance, a banking body.
Jon Whitehouse, group head of government relations at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) bank, said that how quickly or willing the EU might be to change equivalence is a ""big question"".
But the question should be whether Britain wants equivalence in the first place, and whether its cost outweighs the benefits, according to Alexandria Carr, head of European regulatory change at HSBC.
""The cost can be great and the direction of travel is increasing the cost of equivalence,"" Carr said.
Brexit has prompted the EU to toughen up equivalence conditions for foreign clearing houses and for foreign investment firms, with EU supervision now becoming part and parcel of determinations.
Lawlor said it was also unclear how Britain will reconcile meaningful EU market access with not wanting to become an EU rule taker.
""There is a direct correlation between regulatory autonomy and market access. The more you have of one, the less you have of the other,"" he said.
Britain's financial services minister John Glen told the conference he wanted an ""agile"" regulatory approach and that Britain was weighing up equivalence in key areas ""very carefully""."

PARIS (Reuters) - LVMH has offered to buy Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF), known for its engagement rings and ties to Hollywood glamor, as the owner of Louis Vuitton and Bulgari seeks to expand in jewelry, one of the fastest-growing parts of the luxury goods market.
In a deal that would beef up its smallest business and give it a slice of the lucrative U.S. market, LVMH on Monday said it had approached Tiffany about an unsolicited non-binding offer, but gave no details.
Confirming the move, Tiffany said the offer was worth $120 per share, which would value Tiffany at nearly $14.5 billion and represents a 22% premium over the stock's closing price on Friday.
Investors piled into the New York-listed stock on the news, sending Tiffany shares up as much as 31% to one-year highs around $130 and putting them on track for their best daily performance since the 182-year-old company's market listing in 1987.
Several analysts said Tiffany might reject the offer to seek a higher price, potentially kicking off a battle for control of the company known for its signature robin's egg blue packaging.
LVMH said there was no guarantee that preliminary discussions would result in an agreement.
Analysts at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Cowen said Tiffany could be worth as much as $140-$160 per share and UBS analysts estimate cash-rich LVMH has an M&A treasure chest of some 40 billion euros ($44.4 billion).
Tiffany stock is valued at a big discount to the U.S and European sector because it is struggling with falling demand from Chinese tourists and competition from lower-priced rivals such as Denmark's Pandora A/S and Signet Jewelers.
After recent lacklustre share performance - the stock has lost almost a third of its value since hitting all-time highs in July last year - shareholders would likely welcome a takeover, said William Blair analyst Dylan Carden.
""Three years into its turnaround strategy, Tiffany is an arguably more attractive asset than it has been historically,"" he said.
(Graphic: Tiffany at a discount to peers, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7879/7810/lvmh.png)
GLOBAL BRAND
Tiffany, founded in New York in 1837 and made famous worldwide by the 1961 movie ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" starring Audrey Hepburn, said it was still reviewing the proposal and is ""not in discussions"" with LVMH about a deal.
If a deal emerges, it would be the biggest acquisition to date by LVMH, owned by France's richest man, Bernard Arnault. LVMH bought Bulgari in 2011, a deal that transformed its jewelry business.
For LVMH, adding Tiffany would bolster its smallest and newest business division, jewelry and watches, which includes Bulgari jewelry, Hublot and Tag Heuer watches, and expand its exposure to the bridal and diamond category, as well as to U.S. luxury shoppers.
""Tiffany is potentially the biggest prey and the only U.S. global luxury brand,"" analysts at Jefferies said, noting that its addition could double the size of LVMH's watches and jewelry division.
The business accounted for 9% of revenue and 7% of LVMH earnings in 2018, about only a fifth the size of its core fashion and handbag unit, home to Christian Dior, Givenchy and other brands like Fendi, in addition to Vuitton.
Monday's news stirred speculation about possible additional luxury sector deals, boosting shares in rival European watch and jewelry companies, including Salvatore Ferragamo, Pandora, Swatch and Richemont.
The potential deal also comes as some of LVMH's watch brands like Tag Heuer have struggled, in part as they try to adapt to the rise of smartwatches. The sector has also been hit hard by turmoil in Hong Kong, a major market for high-end timepieces. 
CROWN JEWELS
Tiffany CEO Alessandro Bogliolo worked in various management roles at Bulgari for 16 years before leaving the company in 2012 after LVMH acquired it.
Tiffany is considered one of the top prizes in the highly competitive luxury jewelry market.
Jewelry was one of the strongest-performing areas of the luxury industry in 2018, according to consultancy Bain & Co, which forecast that comparable sales in the 18 billion euro ($20 billion) global market were set to grow 7% this year.

LVMH's rivals, Gucci-owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and Switzerland's Richemont, which owns Cartier, are also bulking up in high-end jewelry.

(Reuters) -  Spotify Technology  SA (N:SPOT) posted a surprise profit and beat Wall Street expectations for third-quarter revenue as the music streaming company added more-than-expected subscribers to its premium service, sending its shares up 12%.
The Swedish company, which has outstripped Apple Music (O:AAPL) in the race to dominate music streaming globally, said its number of premium subscribers had risen by 26 million in the past year to 113 million at the end of September.
""The fact that it's delivering growth against an increasingly competitive backdrop is particularly impressive - especially when that competition is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple,"" said  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Nicholas Hyett. 
Spotify said in a letter to shareholders it was adding roughly twice as many subscribers per month as Apple.
However, lower-than-expected addition of new subscribers in the second quarter had led to concerns that rivals might be gaining on Spotify, particularly in countries where Spotify faces home-grown competitors.
""Investors were concerned that competition within the streaming music market was beginning to impact Spotify,"" Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said. ""But the Q3 results seems to put this concern to rest."" 
Spotify said it had also reduced artist marketing and research and development costs in the quarter, contributing to the surprise profit.
Spotify, which launched its service over a decade ago, has overcome resistance from large record labels and some major music artists to reshape how people listen to music.
The world's most popular music streaming service forecast fourth-quarter total premium subscribers of 120 million to 125 million, largely in line with analysts' expectations of 122.6 million.
The company expects its broader measure of monthly average users to grow to between 255 million and 270 million in the current quarter.
Net income attributable to shareholders rose to 241 million euros, or 36 cents per share, for the third quarter, compared with 43 million euros, or 23 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting a loss of 29 cents per share.
Revenue rose 28% to 1.73 billion euros ($1.92 billion) for the three months ended Sept. 30. Analysts were expecting revenue of 1.72 billion euros.
Spotify said Chief Financial Officer Barry McCarthy would retire in January and be replaced by Paul Vogel, the current vice president of financial planning and analysis. McCarthy will rejoin the board of directors after he steps down.

1018,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 10:45AM ET</span>",Lego Builds a New Headquarters to Compete With Apple and Nike,"(Bloomberg) -- The architects working on Lego’s new campus in western Denmark are designing a structure that the chief executive officer says he hopes will make waves as far afield as Singapore.
Lego’s 54,000-square meters (13.34-acre) new grounds will host 2,000 employees when completed in 2021. According to Niels Christiansen, the CEO, it will help the company compete with the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) for digital, analytic and creative professionals.
“People will get back to London or Singapore and talk about it,” Christiansen said.
From its base in Billund, one of the world’s most successful toymakers is designing Googleplex-style headquarters that offer play areas, collaborative work spaces, gyms and cafes. But it’s more than just a trendy design project. The goal of making international talent feel welcome comes as increasingly strict Danish immigration policies dissuade skilled workers from heading to the country.
Successive Danish governments have introduced tight restrictions on immigration. That’s led businesses to complain about a lack of the kinds of qualifications they need to get ahead. According to the latest survey from InterNations, an expat network, Denmark is the second-hardest country in which to settle in, after Kuwait.
Though the Lego CEO didn’t discuss Danish immigration policy, he said that creating a hospitable environment is important. “A building like this does a lot for the retention” of talent and for allowing “really creative people to grow,” Christiansen said in a phone interview on Monday, after completing the first phase of the project. People from more than 50 nationalities currently work for Lego in Billund.
Visitors to the campus are greeted by huge yellow bricks perched haphazardly on the roof of the structure and familiar mesh patterns on its walls.
Christiansen said the expectation is that the design will lead to real productivity gains. But he also noted the building’s unusual look.
“It’s a building that a child would have built,” he said."
1019,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 10:24AM ET</span>",Consumer Cracks Emerge as Banks Say Everything Looks Fine,"(Bloomberg) -- Jamie Dimon has been quick to trumpet the strength of U.S. consumers. Federal Reserve chief Jay Powell calls them a bright spot that is countering weakness in the manufacturing sector.
But there are signs that U.S. households are starting to feel stretched, possibly making it harder for them to continue propping up the economy.
The evidence is showing up on the debt side. Serious delinquencies on credit cards and auto debt have been creeping up in recent quarters. That’s pushed some banks to set aside more money to cover bad loans and tighten lending standards for credit cards and other consumer loans.
Adding to the concerns was an unexpected drop in retail sales in September, the first decline in seven months. While economists don’t see any serious problems yet, the numbers showed that consumers, who power some 70% of the U.S. economy, may be on shakier footing. That’s a potentially worrisome sign when the manufacturing sector slipped into a recession in the first half of the year and businesses broadly are cutting back on investments.
“We’re in a more fragile situation where consumers are more skittish,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton in Chicago. “They’re more susceptible to negative news shocks even though we’ve got what should be these great underlying fundamentals.”
‘Late Cycle’
Many banks are already reacting. Even as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) Chief Executive Officer Dimon was calling the consumer “quite strong” earlier this month, his bank increased the money it was setting aside for loan losses in its consumer and community banking division to $1.3 billion, from $980 million a year earlier. It did so even as the amount of loans in that unit’s books fell.
Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) lifted loan loss provisions by 8%, saying consumers were “holding up well” but the company was being “disciplined and conservative and credit because it feels late cycle.“
  American Express   Co. (NYSE:AXP) also increased the amount it set aside for loan losses by 8% for the three months ended in September, because it had to write off slightly more bad loans, and more borrowers are falling behind on their obligations.
Across the U.S. in the three months that ended in June, auto loans that were 90 or more days late made up 4.6% of total balances, near the highest level since 2011. In credit card lending, 5.17% of loans turned seriously delinquent in that period, the fastest rate since 2012, according to Federal Reserve Bank of New York data.
Those rates remain well below levels seen during the financial crisis, but represent an uptick from earlier years in the recovery when banks were reluctant to lend to all but the most creditworthy borrowers.
“Why would firms go out there and take a big swing on risk?” said Brett Ryan, a senior U.S. economist for  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
Smaller banks have been competing aggressively for new card customers, helping delinquencies on those loans spike to 6.3%, compared with 2.4% for accounts tied to the 100 largest lenders, according to Fed data.
Some bank research analysts are now raising more questions about how any weakness among consumers will affect finance companies. JPMorgan equity analysts said they were turning more conservative on firms including Ally Financial Inc. and Santander (MC:SAN) Consumer USA Holdings Inc., citing a potential economic slowdown and signs of weaker labor markets.
Wage growth has been strong for much of the last year, but it’s since slowed to its lowest level in more than a year, to about 2.9%.
‘More Cautious’
Some corporate executives are also growing more wary. Gene Lee, chief executive officer of Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants Inc (NYSE:DRI)., said in a conference call last month that “there’s some uncertainty entering into the consumer” despite strong wage growth and employment.
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc.'s (NASDAQ:CBRL) CEO Sandra Cochran said last month that the company had turned “more cautious” on consumer demand as they begin to feel the effects of tariffs and higher gas prices.
UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) analysts said they’re growing worried about lower-income consumers who are showing signs of weakness in an otherwise strong market. A survey conducted by the bank found that debt burdens for many of those households have grown, and more are reporting credit problems like loan application rejections.
Of the people surveyed, 21% said their mortgage loan applications aren’t completely accurate, up 2 percentage points from a year ago. That’s a sign that banks’ credit tightening is “substantial enough to require some consumers to falsify part of their loan application,” the analysts wrote. And fewer households reported that their financial condition had improved in recent months.
About 44% of consumers are not meeting their expenses, the UBS report showed. That’s just a tick above the level a year ago but still the highest in five years.
“This is a two-tier economy,” said Matthew Mish, a credit strategist at UBS."

""We are looking probably to be ahead of schedule to sign a very big portion of the China deal, we'll call it Phase One but it's a very big portion,"" he told reporters at Joint Base Andrews before leaving on a visit to Chicago.
Leaders of the world's two biggest economies are working to agree on the text for a ""Phase 1"" trade agreement announced by Trump on Oct. 11. Trump has said he hopes to sign the deal with China's President Xi Jinping next month at a summit in Chile.
Trump on Monday said the signing was planned for the summit but made a reference to recent political unrest in Chile and said he believed they could work things out.
The U.S. president said the phase one portion would ""take care of the farmers"" and ""also take care of a lot of the banking needs.""
""So we're about I would say a little bit ahead of schedule maybe a lot ahead of schedule,"" he said.
Agricultural products are a major area of discussion.
Beijing wants the United States to cancel some existing U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, according to people briefed on high-level telephone discussions on Friday, in return for pledging to step up its purchases of U.S. commodities like soybeans.
The United States wants Beijing to commit to buying these products at a specific time and price, while Chinese buyers would like the discretion to buy based on market conditions.
Beijing and Washington are trying to calm a nearly 16-month trade war that is roiling financial markets, disrupting supply chains and slowing global economic growth.
Trump agreed earlier this month to cancel an Oct. 15 increase in tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods as part of a tentative agreement on agricultural purchases, increased access to China's financial services markets, improved protections for intellectual property rights and a currency pact."

1026,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 08:58AM ET</span>",France orders EDF to tackle nuclear project failings,"By Sarah White
PARIS (Reuters) - The French government on Monday gave EDF (PA:EDF) a month to outline how it plans to tackle skills shortages and other problems which ministers say have delayed nuclear projects and damaged the reputation of a key industry for the country. 
EDF's Flamanville 3 nuclear project in France is running more than a decade behind schedule and has racked up billions of euros in cost overruns, and the utility has encountered setbacks in building plants overseas too. 
But the hitches point to bigger problems for France's nuclear industry as a whole, according to a state-backed audit of Flamanville released on Monday, at a time when the government needs to decide in the coming years on its energy mix. 
The report highlights planning deficiencies and a lack of direction at Flamanville in the early stages of the project, as well as poor coordination with suppliers, but also says France has lost industrial expertise in the sector. 
""The nuclear sector has to get back on track. It's a question of energy sovereignty,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told a news conference to present the report, in a rebuke of EDF's handling of its flagship projects. 
Le Maire said delays at Flamanville - which will take 15 years to get up and running instead of six, and cost almost four times as much as initially planned - were ""a failure for France's entire electricity and nuclear sector.""
Skills shortages were so severe that most of the weldings in the Flamanville project had to be done by foreign sub-contractors, Le Maire added. 
SUPPLIER STRAINS
EDF, which is 84%-owned by the French state and aims be a global leader in nuclear energy, revealed in early October that the Flamanville project, started in 2006, would cost 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) more than previously expected. 
The total bill now runs at 12.4 billion euros. 
EDF has had to contend with problems with some weldings, which it was ordered to repair by nuclear safety watchdog ASN. 
But the audit also underlined the absence of a clear project leader for Flamanville from the outset. 
And while the company was tripped up by a changing regulatory backdrop to some degree, the report said EDF had a strained relationship with suppliers, and in particular Areva. 
Now known as Framatome and 75% controlled by EDF since 2018, Areva was long considered a rival. 
EDF Chief Executive Jean-Bernard Levy will have a month to present his proposals, Le Maire said. The minister reiterated his support to the former Thales boss, who has been at the helm of the utility since 2014, and said the government would check on how the action plan was being implemented by the end of 2020. 
""It's true, France's nuclear industry is going through a difficult time,"" Levy told the same news conference, adding that EDF would ""double down on its efforts"".
EDF has also had to hike its cost estimates for the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant it is building in Britain, and it recently encountered a separate problem with defective weldings at some steam generators of its reactors, although ASN subsequently ruled these could remain operational.

1027,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 08:48AM ET</span>",PG&E Starts Restoring Power as Another Mass Shutdown Looms,"(Bloomberg) -- PG&E Corp. has begun restoring electricity to the almost 3 million Californians who lost power this weekend in the state’s largest deliberate blackout ever. Any respite, however, may be short.
As the bankrupt utility began inspecting power lines for damage from wind storms sweeping through the northern part of the state, it warned that another round of gusts could spur more shutdowns Tuesday. Much of the region remained in the dark as of Sunday evening, including in the San Francisco Bay Area, and some customers who lost electricity may not see their power restored from the initial outage until later the week.
“This one’s going to be tight,” Andy Vesey, chief executive officer of PG&E Corp.’s utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, said at a press conference Sunday. “I urge all of you to ensure you are prepared for the fact that your power may not come back.”
PG&E) sank 13% to $4.35 a share at 7:17 a.m. in pre-market trading in New York. Edison International (NYSE:EIX) was little changed at $66.04 a share.
The company, driven into bankruptcy by two years of wildfires sparked by its equipment, took the unprecedented step of shutting off electricity to 965,000 homes and businesses across Northern and Central California on Saturday and Sunday, as a wind storm packing gusts above 90 miles (144 kilometers) per hour raked the state. Another 100,000 customer accounts -- representing about 300,000 people -- lost power as the winds tossed tree limbs into power lines. The storm was expected to pass by early Monday.
The scope of the current blackout was historic, with 38 of California’s 58 counties expected to be affected. The largest number of shutoffs were in Sonoma County, where the Kincade fire triggered a massive exodus Saturday and Sunday. With that blaze and others burning, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency.
Power was knocked out in heavily populated areas including Oakland and Berkeley, and almost all of the affluent Marin County north of San Francisco. While the city of San Francisco itself was spared, many of the workers in commuter towns were hit.
Lights Out
In the suburbs of Marin County, street lights were out, gas stations were closed and stores were shuttered. People who charged their phones and computers before the outage hit awoke to slow internet connections as they searched for updates. In Oakland, long stretches of banks, pharmacies, restaurants, shops and markets were dark. Police patrol cars parked at intersections to help navigate vehicles through darkened traffic lights.

PG&E said it would begin inspections in the rest of its blacked-out territory early Monday morning, returning electricity as quickly as possible. But while executives said they would try to restore power to everyone who lost it before the next blackout began, they warned that they might not have time. Some customers, they said, might stay in the dark for days.
The coming wind storm appears to be the last in the immediate forecast, according to PG&E meteorologists. Three have already struck this month.
“We’ve had rolling events, rolling events over and over and over again -- as soon as we clean one up we’re prepping for the next,” said Mark Quinlan, PG&E’s senior director of emergency preparedness and response. “And after this one, we kind of get back to normal, at least for a week.”
The shutoffs have triggered a debate over how far California is willing to go to prevent fires in an increasingly warm and dry climate. Despite the power cuts, blazes continue to burn.
The outages are extending to Southern (NYSE:SO) California, where Edison International said 302,900 homes and businesses could face shutdowns. Sempra Energy’s San Diego Gas & Electric said it has no emergency shutoff plans at present.
Wildfires have broken out at both ends of California. The Tick blaze near Los Angeles forced tens of thousands of evacuations. And north of San Francisco, the Kincade fire is still raging. It had burned 54,300 acres, destroyed at least 94 structures and was threatening another 79,575 buildings as of Sunday evening. Almost 200,000 people were forced to evacuate.
“I’ve heard some people express concerns that we’re evacuating too many people,” Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick said Sunday. “I think those concerns are not valid at this point.”
The Kincade fire was reported minutes after a PG&E transmission line in the area malfunctioned late Wednesday. Firefighters have not determined the cause of the blaze. All told, there’s about $12 billion worth of property within a mile of the active fires, said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Evenki Research.
The prospect of more liabilities from wildfires is especially vexing for PG&E. Since filing for Chapter 11 in January, the judge overseeing the case has warned that another big blaze would upend the utility’s bankruptcy and potentially wipe out shareholders. Any claims from new fires sparked by PG&E would have to be paid out first -- and in full -- before those from previous blazes get a dime.
The winds have also arrived at a precarious moment. California receives almost no rain during its summer, and a five-year drought earlier this decade killed millions of trees that can now easily ignite. Recent winds have dried out grasses and shrubs even further.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares steadied near two-month highs on Monday, boosted by hopes for a trade deal and strong U.S. corporate earnings, while the dollar traded near its highest in a week before a Federal Reserve rate decision.
MSCI's All Country World Index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares across 47 countries, was up 0.04% on the day. It was just off its highest level since July 27.
But European shares fell as a glum profit outlook from HSBC offset gains by trade-exposed auto and mining stocks. The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was down 0.16%.
The pound edged up after the European Union agreed to extend the deadline for Brexit until Jan. 31, 2020. It last traded 0.06% higher at $1.2844. 
Euro zone bond yields rose in anticipation of the EU's decision, after sources said the EU was most likely to grant one. 
Earlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.5% to its highest since late July, for a third straight day of gains.
The CSI300 (CSI300) of blue-chip mainland China shares was up 0.8%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (HSI) jumped as much as 1.0%. Japan's Nikkei (N225) rose 0.3% to a one-year high. The advances came after U.S. and European markets gained on Friday.
""Markets are likely to enter a standby mode ahead of the Fed's rate decision on Wednesday amid ongoing developments in the China-US trade negotiations and the corporate earnings season,"" Danske Bank said in a research note.
U.S. and Chinese officials are ""close to finalizing"" some parts of a trade agreement after high-level telephone discussions on Friday, the U.S. Trade Representative's office and China's Commerce Ministry said, with talks to continue.
U.S. President Donald Trump has said he hopes to sign the deal with China's President Xi Jinping next month at a summit in Chile.
The protracted trade war between the world's largest economies has hurt manufacturing, exports and business confidence globally and hurt the profits of many major industrial firms. 
Optimism that Beijing and Washington were close to resolving their dispute led the S&P500 (SPX) to surpass its July 26 closing record of 3,025.86, though it ended just below that level on Friday. The S&P 500's total return index (SPXT) posted an all-time high.
E-mini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) were up 0.16% in early deals in London. 
Strong results from companies including Intel (O:INTC) also boosted sentiment in equities markets. More than 81% of U.S. companies have beaten Wall Street expectations so far this earnings season, despite concerns about the trade war.
Investors next await earnings from the likes of Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), Apple (O:AAPL), Facebook (O:FB) and Exxon (N:XOM).
Activity later in the week will be dominated by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which markets expect will lower interest rates at its Wednesday meeting. Futures show a 90% probability of a cut. 
The Bank of Japan meets on Thursday. On Friday, indicators for Chinese and U.S. manufacturing will be released. 
""The outcome of the FOMC (Federal Open Markets Committee) policy meeting will most likely draw the largest market reaction,"" said Richard Grace, Sydney-based chief currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank. 
""We also think the risk is the FOMC will articulate a pause,"" for future rate decisions, Grace added.

1039,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 06:07AM ET</span>",Google results to share stage with U.S. antitrust probe,"By Paresh Dave and Diane Bartz
SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Beyond fresh insights into Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) quarterly earnings on Monday, financial analysts could press executives for details on the U.S. antitrust probe by 48 states.
They should expect a common refrain during the company conference call: it's deja vu all over again.
Late this summer Texas announced it was leading a group of 48 state attorneys general to probe allegations of anticompetitive practices by Google, largely around its lucrative online advertising business.
Google maintains that the same players were involved in similar investigations, but to no avail. And the Federal Trade Commission settled its own two-year antitrust probe in 2013, concluding it has not manipulated search results to hurt rivals https://www.reuters.com/article/google-antitrust/update-3-us-ends-long-google-probe-with-only-mild-reprimand-idUSL1E9C34Y120130103.
""We have answered many questions on these issues over many years, in the United States as well as overseas, across many aspects of our business, so this is not new for us,"" Google said in a recent blog post on the topic.
That is not stopping states from taking advantage of new political momentum from both sides of the aisle to go after Silicon Valley's giants, including Google.
Missouri, for instance, is folding its two-year old investigation into the new Texas-led probe. The hope is that with more AGs, ""there's a lot more firepower,"" said Chris Nuelle, a Missouri AG spokesman.
Ryan Bangert, who is leading Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's Google probe, is a veteran of the Missouri investigation where he spent nearly two years overseeing it.
Texas is leading the current effort as part of an agreement to put a Democrat in charge of an investigation into Facebook (O:FB) and a Republican at the helm of the Google effort, according to sources familiar with the discussions. New York's Democratic Attorney General Letitia James is leading the multi-state Facebook probe.
Alphabet is expected to report quarterly revenue at or above its usual 20% mark after the closing bell of trading on Monday, with newer businesses such as YouTube and cloud computing driving growth.
But the company offers limited product-level financial disclosures, which has left investors increasingly perplexed about how various pressures including the regulatory scrutiny, advertiser boycotts and global trade tensions are actually affecting operations.
DEJA VU
Some of the previous probes have touched on advertising - the focus of this one - but other issues as well.
In addition to advertising, the FTC's probe involved search bias and ""scraping"" of content. Missouri looked at the scope of Google's data collection and whether it scraped content from competitors.
Texas' previous inquiry, which began in 2010, focused on Google's specialized search tools for shopping, finance data, local businesses, as well as questions about its advertising businesses. New York, California, Ohio and Oklahoma collaborated with Texas.
The states reviewed data from Facebook, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY),  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE), IAC, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Yelp, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and smaller companies such as shopping search service Nextag and ad rival Technorati, according to documents obtained by Reuters through a public records request.
Several companies continue to hold the same complaints about Google.
Texas closed this probe in mid-2014, giving Google and companies that had complained about it notice by phone without offering any reason, three people familiar with the matter said.
Sally Hubbard, a director at the antitrust-advocacy group Open Markets Institute, said five years later the Google practices concerning investigators has not abated.
""But the political winds have shifted,"" said Hubbard, who worked for the New York AG from 2005 to 2012. ""There's a lot more momentum to fix the situation.""
Now, the AGs are hearing complaints that Google is collecting more and more data from users to sell ads, while delivering them an increasingly poor experience.
Google’s critics say the European Union’s $2.7 billion antitrust judgment against Google Shopping two years ago backs them up, and economists in contact with state AGs say that Google's influence has become more problematic with the increased reliance on internet services for news and communications access.
Google declined to comment. In the past the company has said it faces robust competition in ad services, and that in search users can easily shift to alternatives such as Bing.
The states are reviewing the shopping case and other successful European investigations into Google to build a stronger case than they had amassed in their scuttled investigations. Google is more dominant in the EU than in the United States, and European law favors plaintiffs and a looser definition of monopoly power, said Chris Sagers, who teaches antitrust at the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law.
Proving Google is dominant in any given market ""will be a lot harder here than it was in Europe,"" he said."

(Reuters) - European shares retreated on Monday as a glum profit outlook from the region's largest lender HSBC offset gains in trade-sensitive sectors buoyed by positive developments on the U.S.-China trade front.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) fell 0.2% at 0935 GMT with the banking index (SX7P) leading the losses. 
Asia-focused lender HSBC (L:HSBA) slipped 4% to the bottom of the benchmark index after it dropped its 2020 profit target, and said it would undertake a costly restructuring as the bank struggled amidst a slowing global environment. 
Another disappointment among banks was Spain's  Bankia  (MC:BKIA), down 3%, after the state-owned lender posted a 23% drop in third-quarter net profit as it struggles to increase margins from lending because of ultra-low interest rates.
""HSBC did cite weakness, but that's not massively unexpected given what's going on the wider growth dynamics,"" said Will James, senior investment director, European equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments. 
Defensive plays like utility (SX6P) and telecom (SXKP) stocks lost between 0.4% and 0.7% as appetite for riskier sectors rose on the day. 
""Earnings have so far not been a disaster, so we are not seeing massive moves,"" said James. ""From the ongoing underlying rotation, it appears that markets are repositioning and dumping some of those defensive stocks."" 
German stocks (GDAXI) outperformed, lifting the trade-sensitive auto sector (SXAP) to its highest level since May. 
U.S. and Chinese officials said they were ""close to finalizing"" some parts of a trade agreement, raising hopes that the two countries would call a truce on their long-running trade war that has roiled financial markets.
Investors will be keeping a close eye on the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting later this week for more clarity and support from the world's biggest central bank to aid a slowing economy. 
LUXURY LIFT 
Luxury stocks stood out after Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (PA:LVMH) made a bid to buy U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co (N:TIF) with a $14.5 billion acquisition offer.
Shares of the French luxury goods maker rose and boosted gains in peers Swatch (S:UHR),  Pandora  (CO:PNDORA) and Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER). 
Luxury companies continue to show resilience with a host of companies beating earnings expectations last week, including Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP), as Chinese shoppers continue to spend heavily on luxury goods.

""We will negotiate in all forums and use all channels ... to communicate and create understanding on the issues (with the U.S),"" Keerati Rushchano, acting director-general of the Department of Foreign Trade, told a news conference.
He also said the government will support Thai exporters in efforts to diversify their markets.
""There will be trips for business to explore new markets in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Africa and secondary cities in China and India where markets are not so familiar with Thai products,"" Keerati said.
On Friday, the U.S. suspended duty-free treatment of Thai imports worth $1.3 billion, including seafood products, under its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, saying Thailand did not ""afford workers in Thailand internationally recognized worker rights"".

1042,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 05:12AM ET</span>",StockBeat: HSBC Gets Ready to Shrink; LVMH Eyes a Tiffany Bargain,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com --   HSBC Holdings   (LON:HSBA) shares fell to the bottom of the FTSE 100 Monday after a dire third-quarter earnings report at Europe's largest bank shed more light on its strategic problems – and prepared investors for major job cuts and restructuring charges in the months ahead.
Net profit fell 24% and revenue fell 3% on the year in the three months to September, prompting interim CEO Noel Quinn to abandon the bank’s profitability target for next year, although he stopped short of cutting the dividend and said the targeted common equity tier 1 capital ratio – a key measure of financial strength – will remain unchanged at over 14%.
The bank’s problems were already well flagged by the unscheduled departure of John Flint as CEO earlier this year, followed by unconfirmed reports four weeks ago of plans to cut up to 10,000 jobs. The areas highlighted by Quinn in the earnings release are exactly those mentioned in the earlier reports: the U.S. operations, the wholesale banking operation in the U.K. and the retail operations in continental Europe.
“Our previous plans are no longer sufficient to improve performance for these businesses, given the softer outlook for revenue growth,” Quinn said. ""We are therefore accelerating plans to remodel them, and move capital into higher growth and return opportunities.”
The bank now expects “substantial” restructuring charges that will stop it reaching its target of a return on tangible equity of 11% next year. A weak third quarter means that RoTE has dropped to 9.5% for the first nine months of this year. Talking to Bloomberg later, chief financial officer Ewen Stevenson declined to say how long it would take to hit the 11% mark.
The shares lost 3.4% to their lowest in nearly two months, dragging the U.K. FTSE down 0.3% by 4:00 AM ET (0900 GMT). The Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.2%, while a strong performance from the auto sector allowed the German DAX to inch fractionally higher.
Elsewhere, French luxury goods giant LVMH (PA:LVMH) rose 0.4% after confirming that it had made an approach to Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF), a move that would bulk up its presence in “hard luxury” and also strengthen its footprint in the U.S. The Financial Times reported that Tiffany was expected to reject the unsolicited $14.5 billion bid, which was around 30% above the jeweler’s share price when it was made earlier in October. Even at that price, though, it represents a much lower earnings multiple than what LVMH paid for Bulgari in its first foray into jewelry seven years ago."
1043,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 04:29AM ET</span>",HSBC warns of restructuring pain ahead as outlook darkens,"By Sumeet Chatterjee and Lawrence White
HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) -  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) dropped its 2020 profit target, reported a sharp fall in earnings and warned of a costly restructuring, as interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn seeks to tackle its problems head-on in his bid for the full-time role.
Quinn branded the lender's sluggish performance in Europe and the United States as ""not acceptable"", but said investors may have to wait until early next year to hear his full plans to ""remodel"" Europe's biggest bank by assets.
The latest HSBC restructuring comes in a gloomy business environment, including an escalating Sino-U.S. trade war, Britain's protracted withdrawal from the European Union, an easing monetary policy cycle, and unrest in Hong Kong.
HSBC reported pre-tax profit of $4.8 billion for the third quarter on Monday, compared with the $5.3 billion average of analysts' forecasts.
""Overall a poor set of results,"" said analyst Edward Firth at broker KBW.
""But the good news is that this performance looks set to finally goad the management into taking some of the actions to address underperforming businesses that we have been awaiting.""
The bank's shares fell 3% in London on Monday morning, against a 0.5% dip in the STOXX European banks index. 
The earnings update is HSBC's first under Quinn, and is widely seen by shareholders and insiders as a report card on his audition for the CEO role full-time.
""Our previous plans are no longer sufficient to improve performance for these businesses, given the softer outlook for revenue growth,"" Quinn said of the bank's U.S. and European operations.
As a result of a ""more challenging"" revenue outlook compared with the first half of the year, HSBC said it did not expect to meet its return on tangible equity (RoTE) target of 11% in 2020.
HEADACHES
A veteran of the bank since 1987, Quinn, 57, has made it clear he is keen to secure the permanent appointment of CEO from Chairman Mark Tucker, who said in August the search to replace the ousted John Flint would take six to 12 months.
One of Quinn's biggest headaches is HSBC's U.S. retail banking business, which has struggled for years against much bigger domestic rivals and where it booked a loss of $189 million in the first nine months of the year.
Some analysts have said the bank could look to shut down the business, but Quinn dismissed the notion.
""You should not read into anything I've said that we are looking to exit the retail bank in the U.S.,"" he said on Monday, without ruling out scaling it back.
HSBC's investment bank is another sore spot, with profits down 22% in the first nine months of the year. 
Its trading businesses in particular had a tougher third quarter than U.S. peers, with revenue down 22% in fixed income, currencies and commodities, and down 26% in equities.
Quinn said the bank, which generates the bulk of its revenue and profit in Asia, would shift capital away from low-return businesses and further cut costs by simplifying HSBC's notoriously complicated management structure.
""There is scope throughout the bank to clarify and simplify roles, and to reduce duplication,"" Quinn told Reuters.
Such action could result in significant costs in the fourth quarter and beyond, including the possible impairment of goodwill and additional restructuring charges, the bank said.
HONG KONG PROTESTS
The near- to medium-term outlook for HSBC, and rival  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) PLC, has also been clouded by anti-government protests in Hong Kong, their single biggest profit centre.
HSBC said its expected credit losses - including a ""charge to reflect the economic outlook in Hong Kong"" - increased by $400 million in the third quarter. Revenue for the first nine months of the year in Hong Kong, however, rose 7%.
""Obviously the economy is getting impacted by two things - the U.S.-China trade dispute and the protests,"" said Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson.

The bank is particularly monitoring its portfolio of small business customers who may be feeling the strain, he added.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Thailand's  Siam Cement  Pcl's (SCG) (BK:SCC) packaging subsidiary is planning a local listing, in a float that is set to raise about $1 billion, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.
The IPO of SCG Packaging Pcl (SCG Packaging), which could be announced as early as this week, is aimed at independently beefing up the company's funding needs as it charts out a regional expansion strategy, they said.
""Siam Cement has been considering options for this business and an IPO is the next step,"" said one of the sources.
The sources declined to be identified as news of SCG Packaging's IPO has not been publicly reported.
There was no response to emails sent to SCG Packaging.
SCG Packaging is the holding company for the packaging, packaging paper, forestry, pulp and paper business of the country's largest industrial conglomerate.
The unit, 99% owned by SCG Packaging, is expected to file for an IPO in December and launch the issue in the first half of 2020, one of the sources said.
SCG Packaging's planned IPO comes at a time of renewed investor interest in Thai IPOs, supported by growth expectations in the country and the potential for expansion in Southeast Asia.
SCG Packaging has enjoyed strong business growth in the last few years. In 2018, its revenue from sales rose 7% to 87 billion baht ($2.88 billion) and profit jumped 37% to 6 billon baht. These were the highest in nine years, according to SCG Packaging's annual report.
In May, SCG acquired a 55% stake in Indonesian paper packaging company, PT Fajar Surya Wisesa Tbk from existing shareholders for $665 million.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) staff inappropriately gave personal financial advice when marketing pension funds, an Australian court said, overturning an earlier ruling in a rare win for regulators under pressure to crack down on misconduct in the finance sector.
From 2013 to 2016, Westpac contacted customers by mail and phone offering to help them shift money from other pension funds to its own, boosting its own holdings by about A$650 million ($440 million), the Federal Court said.
By ""closing"" sales and getting customers to transfer pension money in the same phone call, ""there was an implied recommendation ... that the customer should accept the service"", the three judges wrote in a ruling published on Monday.
The court gave ASIC and Westpac two weeks to agree on what public declarations the bank must give. If they don't agree, the matter will return to court to determine penalties for the bank.
The decision is a boost for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) which along with other regulators has struggled to land a major court win against banks.
A year-long public inquiry that ended in February gave a scathing assessment of the culture at the country's financial giants, also criticising regulators which it said had allowed the sector to reward overly aggressive, and sometimes deceptive, sales methods.
The Federal Court appeal tribunal dismissed a December ruling that Westpac's advice was only ""general"" and therefore allowed - in what was then an embarrassing loss for ASIC given it took place while the inquiry was still running.
ASIC said the ruling ""provides clarity and certainty concerning the difference between general and personal advice for consumers and financial services providers"".
Westpac said it was carefully considering the judgment.
ASIC lost against Westpac again in August when a court found the regulator had failed to prove the bank approved hundreds of thousands of mortgages without adequate credit checks.
Last month, the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority, the country's banking regulator, lost a landmark case against IOOF Holdings Ltd (AX:IFL) in which it accused the wealth manager's executives of breaking the law by using members' money to top up investment losses. The Federal Court found the action was lawful.

1049,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 01:06AM ET</span>",Small oil-and-gas companies get cold shoulder from large banks,"By David French and Jessica Resnick-Ault
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The largest banking lenders to the oil and gas sector are becoming more cautious, marking down their expectations for oil and gas prices that underpin loans in a move expected to put further financial stress on struggling producers, industry and banking sources said.
Major banks including JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM),  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC), and Royal Bank of Canada (TO:RY) have, as part of regular biannual reviews, cut their estimated values for oil-and-gas companies' reserves, which serve as the basis for those companies to receive reserve-based loans (RBLs), according to more than a dozen sources familiar with the activity.
While the size of the RBL market is unclear, it is estimated that a few hundred companies take such loans, with the cumulative size in the billions of dollars.
Those lenders have marked down the perceived value for both oil and natural gas for the coming five years, with the changes kicking in as early as this month.
Expected natural gas prices have been cut by around $0.50 per million British thermal units, about 20% below levels set in the spring. Industry sources are forecasting some firms face a 15% to 30% reduction in loan size as a result. Oil prices are expected to be about $1 to $2 lower than spring estimates.
""Some banks believe they have too much energy exposure and want to reduce some of this risk,"" said Ian Rainbolt, vice president of finance at Warwick Energy, a private equity firm with upstream investments in Oklahoma and Texas. 
That is a threat to smaller companies, which are already struggling to find other methods of financing - such as issuing stock or bonds - as investors grow restless with years of poor returns in the shale sector even as the United States has risen to become the world's largest oil and gas producer. 
Reduced funding could slow growth in U.S. oil and gas production, and also threaten more bankruptcies in the sector. Bankruptcy filings among U.S. oil and gas producers are at levels not seen since 2016, when U.S. crude slumped to $26 per barrel, according to law firm Haynes and Boone.
Companies heavily focused on natural gas drilling may be the most threatened. Banks are forecasting natural gas prices between $2 and $2.35 per million British thermal units for the next 12 months, and up to $2.50 at the end of the five-year term, all lower than in the spring.
""I expect the biggest issues to be with over-leveraged natural gas producers, especially those without firm transportation in geographically-disadvantaged areas,"" said Brock Hudson, managing director at investment bank Carl Marks Advisors, who referenced companies in Appalachia, the Rockies and parts of Oklahoma.
Smaller RBLs can have huge consequences: Alta Mesa Resources, an Oklahoma-focused producer headed by former Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) chairman Jim Hackett, filed for bankruptcy a month after its borrowing base was slashed by almost half in mid-August.
A number of banks, including JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and  Comerica Inc  (N:CMA), declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.
REDUCED AVAILABILITY 
Eight sources indicated larger banks have set their price decks, the industry term for the value they will ascribe to hydrocarbons behind the RBLs, with oil between $46 and $51 per barrel for the next five years.
There are fewer financing options available to help bridge the gap from lower RBLs. Just one U.S. producer, Contango Oil & Gas (A:MCF), has issued any new equity in 2019, while there has only been one high-yield bond offering by a shale producer since March, according to Refinitiv data. 
Since 2018, the S&P 500 Energy Sector (SPNY) is the worst performing sector in the Standard & Poor's 500, falling 18% against a 12.8% increase for the broader index, and many publicly-traded shale companies have done even worse.
Those facing lower loan guarantees also can not rely on selling unwanted assets to raise cash as mergers and acquisitions activity is at its lowest level in a decade. Profiting from further production is also difficult, as the number of active oil and gas rigs is at its lowest level since April 2017, according to Baker Hughes.
Scott Richardson, head of U.S. energy investment banking at  RBC  Capital Markets, said any uptick in bankruptcies would likely come from the SCOOP/STACK area of Oklahoma and the gas-heavy southern portion of Texas' Midland Basin.
Loan covenants are also being tightened, according to a Dallas Federal Reserve Bank energy survey published Sept. 25. The survey said some participants noted banks had lowered the maximum debt level permissible to 2.5 to 3 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), from 3.5 to 4.0 times.
Some regional lenders have kept prices for oil and gas in fall's redetermination higher than the larger institutions, according to three of the sources. 

Warwick's Rainbolt, who has oversight over four RBLs, said it was switching to regional banks, which offered better price decks. One bank priced gas starting at $2.37, rising to above $3 in the final year, with crude at $52 rising to near-$60 a barrel.

The shift favors an overweight position in financials, consumer staples and utilities, said Michael Wilson, the bank’s chief U.S. equity strategist. The S&P 500 Value Index has returned about 5% since the start of August compared with the 0.9% for the S&P 500 Growth Index.
“The bottom line is that the winds of change are upon us,” Wilson wrote in a report Sunday. “The long-overdue adjustment process for the most expensive secular growth stocks is under way and will likely continue until valuations become so cheap that they discount a more achievable outcome on growth and profitability and/or the risk of economic recession and lower capex subsides. I don’t think we’re there yet on either score.”
It’s a debate that’s captivated stock pickers for years and is dividing Wall Street. Unless the economic outlook changes materially,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists said this month they prefer growth over value, commonly defined as those trading cheap to fundamentals.
While the S&P 500 Index approached a record high on Friday, some growth shares have been underperforming, and Morgan Stanley highlighted software companies in particular. The S&P North American Expanded Technology Software Index is down 7.7% from its record reached on July 26. The gauge has surged 97% since the end of 2016 -- more than double the S&P 500."

(Reuters) - Warehouse giant  Prologis  Inc (N:PLD) said on Sunday it had agreed to acquire rival industrial real-estate business  Liberty Property Trust  (N:LPT) in a $12.6 billion deal to improve its U.S. presence amid the ecommerce boom. 
If approved, Prologis said Liberty shareholders would receive 0.675 times a Prologis share for each unit they hold, about $61 a share. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020.
Prologis, which has a global footprint, said the all-stock deal including the assumption of debt would deepen its presence in U.S. markets such as Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley, Chicago, Houston, New Jersey and Southern (NYSE:SO) California.
""Liberty’s logistics assets are highly complementary to our U.S. portfolio and this acquisition increases our holdings and growth potential in several key markets,"" Prologis Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hamid Moghadam said.
""The joining of these two platforms at this moment, when industrial logistics has become so pivotal to the new economy, will further the industry's ability to support the nation's supply chain,"" Liberty Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Hankowsky said.
Prologis plans to sell about $3.5 billion worth of assets, including $2.8 billion of ""non-strategic"" logistics properties and $700 million of office properties, the announcement said. 
The transaction is anticipated to immediately save around $120 million from administrative costs, operating leverage, lower interest expense and lease adjustments, the companies said. 
Activist investor Jonathan Litt of Land & Buildings Investment Management LLC had pushed Wayne, Pennsylvania-based Liberty to consider selling itself given what he considered to be undervalued shares and recent purchases of similar real-estate assets by Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) and Prologis. 
Litt said in September he knew of an unnamed party willing to pay $60 a share for Liberty. 
Litt did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Sunday night. 

Prologis customers, according to its website, include Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) , Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and FedEx Corp (N:FDX).

1053,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 27, 2019 11:12PM ET</span>",Argentina Investors Look Ahead After Fernandez Pulls Out Win,"(Bloomberg) -- Argentina’s investors are keenly watching for leading candidate Alberto Fernandez’s next steps after the results of Sunday’s presidential election were tighter than expected.
Fernandez won the race for the country’s top job, with 48% of the vote, above the 45-point threshold needed to win outright. But with 91% of votes counted, the big surprise of the night was that incumbent President Mauricio Macri narrowed Fernandez’s margin of victory to seven points from a 16-point gap in an August primary.
Analysts and investors are now watching for two key items as they prepare for the market reaction come Monday morning. First, what the final composition of congress will be, and how that may impact key legislation ahead, including a debt restructuring. Second, they’ll be keeping an eye on what signals Fernandez gives in his acceptance speech Sunday evening.

“I don’t expect massive volatility -- markets will be waiting to see who Fernandez appoints to his cabinet and the economic plan he announces,” said Jimena Blanco, political research director at consulting firm Verisk (NASDAQ:VRSK) Maplecroft in Buenos Aires. “If anything, this greater balance could have a positive impact for those looking to acquire Argentine assets.”
Here’s what analysts are saying:
Ezequiel Zambaglione, head of strategy at Buenos Aires-broker Balanz Capital:
“We’ll have to look at the numbers and see what the makeup of Congress will look like, especially in the lower house. But the main market driver will still be what Alberto Fernandez comes out and says in his speech”Alberto Bernal, chief strategist at broker XP Investments:
“The difference was tight, so Fernandez will have to be a little bit humble about the victory.”“The Fernandez win was priced in, but this tight of a difference was not priced in.”The results show that “something like 44% of Argentina is voting for economic orthodoxy, and still wants to do the right thing in terms of real adjustments. The populist view was not overwhelming, and I think that most of the market was convinced that it was going to be overwhelming.”Siobhan Morden, New York-based head of Latin America Fixed Income Strategy at Amherst Pierpont:
Fernandez’s speech on Sunday will be hugely important to how markets react on MondayAlthough Fernandez would not officially take the top job until Dec. 10, “there is no honeymoon,” and he will be expected to offer an economic plan and cabinet appointees quickly“The only solution for Argentina is reform-based fiscal discipline,” she said in an interview. “If this is what voters are saying, it’s that they expect responsible management.”Jimena Blanco, political research director at consulting firm Verisk Maplecroft:
“The implication is that any restructure taken to Congress will be moderated by Macri’s coalition, and also that it will be hard, if not impossible to undo many of the Macri reforms.”"
1054,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 27, 2019 11:10PM ET</span>",PG&E Cuts Power to 2.8 Million Californians as Fires Burn,"(Bloomberg) -- Mass power shutoffs by PG&E Corp. left more than 2.8 million Californians in the dark Sunday, the state’s largest deliberate blackout ever, as the bankrupt utility tries to keep its equipment from igniting wildfires during the strongest wind storm in years.
As of 1:45 p.m. local time, PG&E had shut off the lights to 941,000 homes and businesses in Northern California, including parts of Oakland and Berkeley, and almost all of affluent Marin County north of San Francisco. The city of San Francisco itself was spared. High winds are expected to lash the region through Monday morning, with another set of gusts forecast for Tuesday and Wednesday -- raising the prospect that some areas will be blacked out for several days.
The scope of the current outage was unprecedented, with 38 of California’s 58 counties expected to be affected. The largest number of shutoffs were in Sonoma County, where the Kincade fire triggered a massive exodus Saturday and Sunday. With that blaze and others burning, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency.
“What we find ourselves experiencing is a historic wind event,” Andy Vesey, head of the Pacific Gas & Electric utility unit, said at a press conference Saturday night. The shutoff is a “last resort to make sure that in these conditions our operations will not create a major public safety issue. That’s why we do it.”
PG&E has said it expected to begin restoring power Monday, when the winds are forecast to subside, after it inspects every line of its equipment for damage. But the company warned Sunday that a separate set of gales expected to descend on the state could lead to another round of shutdowns in 32 counties on Tuesday and Wednesday. Some customers who are currently out of power may remain so throughout that time.
In the suburbs of Marin County, street lights were out, gas stations were closed and stores were shuttered. People who charged their phones and computers before the outage hit woke to slow internet connections as they searched for updates on the blaze and blackouts. In Oakland, long stretches of banks, pharmacies, restaurants, shops and markets were dark. Police patrol cars parked at intersections to help navigate vehicles through darkened traffic lights.
It’s the third time this month that PG&E has resorted to mass blackouts to avoid wildfires. The San Francisco-based company has been taking more extreme measures since its equipment sparked blazes in 2017 and 2018, saddling it with an estimated $30 billion in liabilities and forcing it into bankruptcy. The shutoffs have triggered a debate over how far California is willing to go to prevent fires in an increasingly warm and dry climate. Despite the power cuts, blazes continue to burn.
Read More: The Cost of Doing Business in California Is One Blackout a Week
The outages are extending to Southern (NYSE:SO) California, where Edison International (NYSE:EIX) has cut power to 364 customers and said 302,900 more face shutdowns. Sempra Energy’s San Diego Gas & Electric said it has no emergency shutoff plans at present.
Wildfires have already broken out at both ends of California. The Tick blaze near Los Angeles forced tens of thousands of evacuations. And north of San Francisco, the Kincade fire is still raging. It had burned more than 30,000 acres, destroyed at least 79 structures and was threatening another 31,175 buildings as of Sunday morning. Almost 200,000 people were forced to evacuate.
“I’ve heard some people express concerns that we’re evacuating too many people,” Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick said Sunday. “I think those concerns are not valid at this point.”
The Kincade fire was reported minutes after a PG&E transmission line in the area malfunctioned late Wednesday. Firefighters have not determined the cause of the blaze. PG&E’s shares plummeted 31% Friday to $5, a record low. Shares of Edison fell 8.5% as fires burned in its Southern California service territory.
All told, there’s about $12 billion worth of property within a mile of the active fires, said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Evenki Research.
The prospect of more liabilities from wildfires is especially vexing for PG&E. Since filing for Chapter 11 in January, the judge overseeing the case has warned that another big blaze would upend the utility’s bankruptcy and potentially wipe out shareholders. Any claims from new fires sparked by PG&E would have to be paid out first -- and in full -- before those from previous blazes get a dime.
The winds are arriving at a precarious moment. California receives almost no rain during its summer, and a five-year drought earlier this decade killed millions of trees that can now easily ignite. Recent winds have dried out grasses and shrubs even further.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC)said the extra conditions on IOOF Investment Services Ltd related to governance, structure and compliance arrangements.
The changes were part of a broader restructure of the IOOF group, ASIC said, and took into account concerns highlighted by a powerful government-backed inquiry into the financial services sector, which concluded earlier this year.
Among the new conditions is a requirement that IOOF Investment Services appoint a majority of independent directors to its board.
IOOF, Australia's second largest wealth manager, said it had already started implementing the changes.
IOOF's shareholders launched a class action lawsuit in the wake of the Royal Commission inquiry, alleging the company engaged in deceptive conduct and breached stock market disclosure obligations. IOOF has said the case, which is ongoing, is without foundation.
IOOF recently won a separate case brought by the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) to disqualify five top IOOF executives for failing to act in customers' interests by breaching pension laws.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a U.S. Senate panel reviewing two catastrophic Boeing 737 MAX crashes told Reuters ahead of hearings this week that the plane would not return to U.S. skies until ""99.9% of the American public"" and policymakers are convinced it is safe.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg will testify for two days before Congress starting on Tuesday, which is the anniversary of the Lion Air 737 MAX crash in Indonesia, the first of two crashes within five months that killed a total of 346 people.
""Clearly the accidents didn't have to happen and I don't think there was sufficient attention to how different pilots would react to signals in the cockpit,"" Senator Roger Wicker, a Republican who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee that will hold the first hearing, said in an interview on Friday.
Several reports have found Boeing failed to adequately consider how pilots respond to 737 MAX cockpit emergencies in designing the airplane.
The Federal Aviation Administration has spent months reviewing Boeing's proposed software upgrades to a key safety system and other training and system changes but is not expected to allow the plane to return to service until December at the earliest.
""That plane won't fly unless 99.9% of the American public and American policymakers are convinced that it's absolutely safe,"" Wicker said, adding he planned to raise Boeing's communication with the FAA during the 737 MAX's development and ""the relationship between regulators and manufacturers"" during the hearing.
""The main question is how can we have a comfort level that they won't happen again,"" Wicker said.
Wicker said he expected to see the results of all the various investigations before proceeding to legislative moves and whether Congress must reform the FAA's practice of designating some certification tasks to Boeing and other manufacturers.
""Clearly there was a breakdown in the system somewhere and clearly changes needed to be made,"" Wicker said. ""We need to make sure (the 737 MAX) is as safe as humanly possible.""
'A LOT OF SCRUTINY'
Muilenburg, who earlier this month was stripped of his title as board chairman, said on a conference call last week he was ""looking forward to participating in those hearings. I anticipate there will be tough questions, challenging questions, a lot of scrutiny.""
Also last week, Boeing ousted its commercial airplanes chief.
A report issued on Friday by Indonesian investigators found Boeing, acting without adequate oversight from U.S. regulators, failed to grasp risks in the design of cockpit software on its 737 MAX, sowing the seeds for the Lion Air crash that also involved errors by airline workers and crew.
Earlier this month, the chairman of the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which will hold Wednesday's hearing, told Reuters that Boeing must shake up its management team. ""Boeing's got to clean up its culture and I don't think you can clean it up with the people who were in charge when this all unfolded,"" U.S. Democratic Representative Peter DeFazio said.

DeFazio said Congress must reform how the FAA certifies new airplanes. In the case of the 737 MAX, the FAA designated more than 40% of the tasks to Boeing.

(Reuters) - Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (PA:LVMH) has approached Tiffany & Co (N:TIF) with a $14.5 billion acquisition offer, people familiar with the matter said, at a time when the U.S. luxury jeweler grapples with the impact of tariffs on its exports to China.
LVMH, which has for years been looking for ways to expand in the U.S. market, submitted a preliminary, non-binding offer to Tiffany earlier this month, one of the sources said.
LVMH's offer valued Tiffany at about $120 per share, another of the sources added. Tiffany shares ended trading on Friday at $98.55. 
Tiffany has hired advisers to review LVMH's offer but has not yet responded to it, and there is no certainty that it will negotiate a deal, according to the sources. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. LVMH and Tiffany declined to comment. Bloomberg News reported earlier on Saturday that LVMH was holding talks with Tiffany.
LVMH, which is behind brands such as Fendi, Christian Dior and Givenchy, as well as Veuve Cliquot champagne, has stood out for several years as one of the top performers in the upscale retail sector, where not all labels are benefiting to the same degree from booming Chinese appetite for branded goods.
Tiffany, on the other hand, has not been as resilient. Beyond the tariffs that have been triggered by the trade war between the United States and China, a lower Chinese domestic sales tax has also contributed to double-digit decreases in its sales to Chinese tourists in the United States and in other destinations.
High-end brands have also long relied on Hong Kong as a major shopping hub drawing visitors from mainland China in particular, and four months of pro-democracy demonstrations are starting to take their toll.
However, earlier this month LVMH, which has a market capitalization of 194 billion euros ($215 billion), beat sales forecasts for the third quarter despite the unrest in Hong Kong. In August, Tiffany reported quarterly earnings that also beat analysts' expectations, thanks to a drop in marketing costs.
Tiffany has been refreshing its offerings with more affordable items such as pendants and earrings, to appeal to millennials who have been gravitating to lower-priced competitors such as Denmark's  Pandora  A/S (CO:PNDORA) and Signet Jewelers (N:SIG).

Paris-headquartered LVMH is controlled by the Arnault family and is led by Bernard Arnault, France's richest man. Based in New York and best known for its diamond engagement rings, Tiffany operates more than 300 retail stores globally.

For the 171-year-old bank this is a critical appointment as it needs to retain clients and market share in Europe after Pigasse's departure as well as cope with a slowing pipeline of merger and acquisition (M&A) deals.
The firm has come under increasing pressure from U.S. boutique banks including Evercore (N:EVR) and Centerview which are looking to open offices in Paris and have poached some of Lazard's dealmakers including Nicolas Constant.
Girodolle joined Lazard in 2007 and he primarily advises companies on M&A and financial transactions. Previously, he worked at the French APE state holding company and at the finance ministry. 
Lazard said in a statement it had also appointed Charles-Henri Filippi and François Kayat as co-chairs.
Filippi joined the firm in 2018 from  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and has also worked at HSBC and Credit Commercial de France. He began his career in the French civil service and government departments.
Kayat joined Lazard in 2010 from  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) CIB. Previously, he chaired the European Mergers and Acquisitions Group of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) First Boston.
Lazard, founded in New Orleans in 1848 by three French brothers, opened its Paris Investment Banking office in 1854.

Today, it is one of the firm's principal investment banking offices, and the base of several global investment banking businesses, in particular sovereign advisory, Africa/Middle East and Central & Eastern Europe advisory, Lazard said.

1060,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2019 02:13PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Brazil to lure airlines to fly domestic, taking meetings with three carriers","BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil is determined to lure airlines to operate domestic flights in Latin America's largest aviation market, and is taking meetings with at least three carriers, a senior government official told Reuters.
""We are going to talk with  Jet Blue , we are going to talk with Volaris, a Mexican group ... we are going to talk with Sky Airline, which is Chilean,"" Ronei Glanzmann, Brazil's civil aviation secretary, told Reuters on the sidelines of the ALTA Airline Leaders Forum, an industry conference.
""These are conversations to introduce Brazil to them, they do not mean that the airlines are saying that they will come here,"" he added.
Glanzmann said the meetings with Volaris and JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) will take place on Monday.
A representative for Sky said they had canceled their participation in the ALTA conference due to the civil unrest in Chile, but declined to comment on taking a meeting with the Brazilian government. Jet Blue and Volaris did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Brazil's government has recently begun a push to open its aviation market, the largest in Latin America. Right-wing president Jair Bolsonaro has allowed foreign carriers to set up domestic carriers in the country.
Currently, Brazil's domestic air travel market is highly concentrated among three airlines. Until earlier this year, there was a fourth player, Avianca Brasil, but the airline stopped operations in May after filing for bankruptcy operations late last year, highlighting the high risk and volatility of operating in Brazil.
Reaction to Brazil's liberalization been slow, but already Spanish airline group Globalia has declared its intention to operate a domestic airline in Brazil. But Glanzmann hopes others will too.
His strategy, he said, involves airlines dipping their toes in the Brazilian market first by operating international flights.
""We are working first with international routes, but we are already working so that those operations will become domestic operations in the Brazilian market,"" Glanzmann said.
In the past year, four foreign low cost airlines have begun operating international flights to Brazil: JetSMART, which belongs to Indigo Partners, Sky Airline, Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC) and Argentina's Flybondi.
Still, some industry watchers are skeptical that anyone will attempt to enter Brazil's domestic market anytime soon.
""We don't see anything changing in the short term regarding a new low cost airline operating domestically,"" said Eduardo Sanovicz, who heads ABEAR, an industry group that represents Brazil's two largest airlines. ""For a company to start flying in Brazil, they will need to know that they will have the same costs as we do.""
Brazil's carriers have long complained about high costs of operating in Brazil, especially value-added taxes on fuel that can be as high as 25%."

UBS's board would welcome it if Khan abandoned his complaint against the three private detectives who followed him during his last weeks as a Credit Suisse employee, the paper said, citing sources close to the UBS board.
The board at Switzerland's biggest lender thinks a trial cold pose dangers for Khan and the bank, especially if new details emerged that could incriminate Khan, the paper said.
It could also be embarrassing for Khan if prosecutors dropped the proceedings without a result, it added.
Khan, who left Switzerland's second-biggest bank in July and began working at UBS in October, was under surveillance by private detectives hired by Credit Suisse from Sept. 4 to Sept. 17, when he spotted them.
The affair saw suicide and espionage invade the secretive world of Swiss private banking, and exposed a feud between Khan and Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam.
Credit Suisse has cleared Thiam of involvement in the affair, which was blamed on Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee, Thiam's right-hand man. Bouee resigned following the investigation.
""We are not commenting on the ongoing criminal proceedings,"" UBS said on Sunday. ""We are very happy to have Iqbal Khan in our team. He is concentrating fully on his role at UBS and is in close contact with employees and clients."""

The United States on Friday suspended duty-free treatment for $1.3 billion worth of Thai imports, including seafood products, under its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, saying Thailand did not ""afford workers in Thailand internationally recognized worker rights.""
The tariffs that would take effect in six months would be 4-5% instead of zero, Jurin said.
""Thai products that are sold in the U.S. will have a burden ... which comes to around 1.5 to 1.8 billion baht,"" he said.
Separately, Labor Minister Chatumongol Sonakul said Thailand is working on measures to ensure migrant worker rights, but that those would be based on Thai standards and laws.
""We refer to international standards, but do not translate them into law,"" Chatumongol told reporters.
""One of the issues is large unions … we don't want that - we have company unions,"" he said, adding there would be more negotiations but that migrant workers should not have more rights than Thai workers.
The world's largest producer of canned tuna and owner of the Chicken of the Sea brand, Thai Union Group Pcl (BK:TU), said in a statement that the move should not affect its products.
""The decision will not have a material impact on Thai Union Group's business, as no seafood or pet food products sold into the U.S. from Thailand are currently covered by the GSP,"" it said."

(Reuters) - More than half a million homes and businesses in California could lose power this week as utilities including Pacific Gas & Electric (N:PCG) and Southern (NYSE:SO) California Edison (A:SCE_pe) cut off electricity as a preventive measure against wildfires.
Over 308,000 customers in seven counties, including Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Ventura in southern California, are under the Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) consideration, Southern California Edison said.
Shutoffs from SCE could start early Thursday.
Meanwhile, PG&E has shut off power in 15 counties, affecting about 178,000 customers in those areas. The company said additional power shutoffs for parts of San Mateo County and Kern County were expected to begin at about 1 a.m. (0800 GMT) on Thursday, affecting more than 1,000 customers.
San Diego Gas & Electric Co has also identified more than 41,000 customers under PSPS consideration, but has not implemented any power shutoffs on Thursday.
Forecaster Marc Chenard said the worst of the winds would arrive on Thursday afternoon and into Friday.
""It looks like at its worst, southern California will see wind gusts of 55 mph. Down in some of the coastal areas the winds could reach 75 mph later today,"" he said.
Power lines could be knocked down and start fires among dry trees and vegetation, according to earlier forecasts.
Bankrupt Californian power producer PG&E cut off electricity to more than 730,000 homes and workplaces in northern California earlier this month to try to reduce wildfire risks posed by extremely windy and dry weather.
Chenard added that northern California could experience dangerous wind gusts of up to 45 mph. ""This is not going to abate until at least this weekend.""
Wildfires were also growing through the night in Sonoma County, about 65 miles north of San Francisco, which is popular with tourists visiting wine-producing areas in California.
Evacuation warnings were issued before midnight in some communities as the wind-driven fires moved toward the tourist towns of Healdsburg and Geyserville, officials said."

Peter Wong, deputy chairman and chief executive of HSBC's Asia Pacific operations, also told a financial summit in Shanghai that China needs to improve corporate governance and investor protection to mitigate systemic risks.
""We really don't want to have another situation ... similar to the Lehman crisis in China,"" Wong said, referring to the collapse of the U.S. bank that helped trigger the global financial crisis in 2008.
China has stepped up opening its giant financial industry amid a bruising trade war with the United States. Earlier this month, regulators announced a firm timetable to fully open its futures, brokerage and mutual fund sectors to foreign investors in 2020.
Wong said relaxed foreign ownership rules are very important for HSBC, which, in addition to its banking business, also owns insurance, asset management and brokerage ventures in China.
But other regulations also need to be relaxed, he said, for example to allow HSBC to expand its insurance business more easily into new cities and provinces in China.
Another obstacle, Wong said, is that ""it's very difficult for foreign banks to get deposits in China"" due to very stringent requirements, so China should ""figure out a way"" to help them.
""We've been trying for a number of years. Now we're developing, we're increasing our share, but the journey is not easy,"" he said."

1069,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 26, 2019 04:23AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here are three things that flew under the radar this week.
1. GM Strike Sends Out Economic Shockwaves
The strike that involved about 50,000 workers at General Motors (NYSE:GM) ended Friday as employees and unions voted to approve the deal struck with management.
It may be surprising a strike of such size at one of the Big 3 automakers was pretty much overshadowed by other news as it continued, but U.S. auto stocks have taken a back seat to other equities ever since the government bailout.
Still, this work stoppage had an impact well beyond the GM factory lines.
On Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that durable goods orders fell 1.1% in September, much more than the 0.5% drop expected, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
“Losses were concentrated in transportation equipment, fabricated metals and losses associated with the GM strike, which exacerbated weakness associated with tariffs and slower global growth,” Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, wrote in a note.
“I spoke to one manufacturer who told me senior management is now spending 20-25% of their time trying to figure out how to mute the costs of tariffs instead of planning for the future,” Swonk said. “The GM strike has only added to those pains.”
“The manufacturing sector is not expected to recoup all that was lost to the GM strike until into the first quarter of 2020.”
In addition, the Labor Department said that the strike will reduce October nonfarm payrolls by at least 46,000, with striking workers not receiving a paycheck being counted as unemployed for the period.

2. Will Tesla Keep Driving Profits or Will It Stall?
Not all earnings beats are created equal. Some require a deep dive to discover whether the underlying factors driving earnings are sustainable.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) generated blowout earnings. But some on Wall Street were quick to identify signs of air pockets, including a fall in revenue for the first time in seven years, potentially sending the carmaker veering off course.

Tesla reported $6.3 billion in revenue and an unexpected return to profit in the third quarter, with earnings of $1.91 per share. Analysts had expected a loss per share of 45 cents.
RBC suggested the wide earnings beat was helped by cost cuts, which can only drive growth so far, particularly at a time when revenue and margins are stuck in the mud and costs continue to soar.
“Cost control can help a quarter, but we struggle to understand how spending doesn’t have to go up to support Tesla’s growth ambitions,” said Joseph Spak, RBC Capital Markets analyst.

Tesla slashed costs by 16% in the third quarter from a year earlier, thanks to improvements in operating efficiency and a decline in manufacturing and material costs.
But while suggest a bumpy road may lie ahead for carmaker, others have lauded the report, hailing the company’s efforts to get its Giga 3 factory in China up and running. 

Tesla revealed that its flagship Giga 3 was already in trial production, ahead of expectations, which is “key to penetrating the important China market over the coming years,” Wedbush said,

“(W)e move one step closer to believing this Tesla turnaround story is real with Musk delivering a robust performance with his back against the wall,” Wedbush added.

Tesla ended the week up more than 20%, cutting its losses for the year so far to under 2%.
3. IPO Insider Thinks There's Big Trouble
Renaissance Capital has built a nice business tracking the ups and downs of the IPO world.
It's been a frustrating year. A partial shutdown in the early part of the year meant there were no initial public offerings.
And then there were some of the crazier IPOs, which Renaissance would define as companies built on getting sales growth first, no matter the cost, like Uber (NYSE:UBER) and   Lyft   (NASDAQ:LYFT). The responsibility lies with bankers and private-equity investors who bid up valuations of startups to hardly realistic levels.
Renaissance thinks the environment is dangerous and late Thursday published an article in a projected series of six that will describe how the situation came about and what can be done to bring sanity to bear.
The current environment is reminiscent of the 1990s when IPOs were a dime a dozen and many companies went public with no profits and no real idea how they would become profitable. And then the dot.com bubble burst and the IPO market was pretty much dormant for a decade.
It's come full circle, Renaissance argues.

The average net loss of companies going public is about $36 million. When a company tries to go public, it's started to find buyer resistance. Witness the performance of shares like Lyft and Uber.
We Co., the parent of WeWork, had to shelve its IPO and be rescued by Softbank, its largest investor.
The other five installments are not yet published, but they will deal with problems created by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which added accounting requirement in the wake of the Enron collapse, and the 2012 JOBS Act, which has let young but large tech companies come to market with values that public investors promptly slash."
1070,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2019 06:01PM ET</span>","Vale, BHP's Samarco gets license to resume operations after dam burst","By Marta Nogueira
RIO de Janeiro (Reuters) - Samarco, a joint venture between Vale SA (SA:VALE3) and BHP Group (AX:BHP), on Friday won permission to resume operations at their Germano iron ore mine, the environmental regulator of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais said, roughly four years after a fatal dam collapse there.
Vale said in a separate release that it expected production at the joint venture, which is trying to restructure $3.8 billion in debt it defaulted on about a year after the accident, to resume toward the end of 2020.
Resumption will be contingent on a filtration system - which will take about a year to build - that will allow Samarco to use a ""dry stacking"" technology to dispose of minings waste, replacing the previous tailings dam based system, the company said.
The mine, which once produced nearly 25 million tonnes of iron ore a year, will restart at an annual rate of less than a third of that, Vale said, with a potential increase to 14 to 16 million within another six years.
The Samarco joint venture signed a deal with state and local authorities in March 2016 to create a foundation to oversee the cleanup and after the disaster. It has spent over 6 billion reais ($1.50 billion) so far but some victims have complained about the pace of rebuilding efforts.
Vale and BHP have previously denied media reports that they were negotiating a deal that would see the Anglo-Australian multinational unload its stake in the joint venture.
Vale on Friday reported weaker-than-expected earnings nine months after another fatal mine accident which has sparked a renewed effort by the company to dismantle its most dangerous tailings dams."
1071,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2019 05:53PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Wells Fargo lays off more than 200 business bankers in U.S. - sources,"By Imani Moise and P.J. Huffstutter
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) has laid off more than 200 bankers in its U.S. lending divisions in recent months, as the bank reacted to business trends and restructured some units, sources familiar with the matter said this week. 
Most of the cuts were in Wells Fargo's commercial bank and many impacted its team that gives loans to farmers. The bank has also made cuts to its energy lending group. Energy and agriculture are two portfolios in which the company is traditionally strong. 
The fourth-largest U.S. lender by assets cut the unit that specializes in agricultural lending by at least 25%, according to four sources with direct knowledge of the matter. 
Representatives for Wells Fargo confirmed the cuts but did not elaborate on how many agricultural bankers were laid off. 
Over the summer, 22 bankers were axed from its energy team, according to two other sources. The cuts represented about 7% of the energy group, a spokeswoman said. 
The energy lending team sits within the investment bank and the agriculture group is part of commercial banking. The company has about 6,000 commercial bankers in the United States.
Many of the agriculture cuts were concentrated in rural areas, one source told Reuters, including North Dakota and South Dakota where staff was cut in half. Wells Fargo plans to create a smaller group of agricultural bankers in one of its new centralized hubs who will work with customers, the person said.
While the move marks Wells Fargo’s latest bid to centralize operations and shed risk, the move comes as a blow to energy companies and increasingly cash-strapped farmers. 
With fewer bankers on hand in local markets, some small companies and family farmers will likely need to find a new lender, said three sources familiar with the businesses.
The staffing cuts are particularly ill-timed for the bank’s soybean, corn and grain farm customers, who are looking to renew loans to finance their spring planting operations. 
Wells Fargo is the biggest bank lender to the U.S. agriculture sector, according to the American Bankers Association. An Wells Fargo executive told Reuters the bank intends to retain that position and there has been no strategic move to reduce exposure. The moves were made because the commercial bank wants to align resources to better serve clients who do more business with the bank.
The bank is currently hiring agricultural bankers in markets like California, Wyoming and Idaho, a bank spokeswoman said. After the hires the total reduction to the team will be 5%. 
SCALING BACK
Federal data analyzed by Reuters shows Wells Fargo is following other large U.S. banks in scaling back exposure to farmers. The bank’s Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured units have pared $1.24 billion, or 15.3%, of their farm-loan holdings between the end of December 2016 and June 30 of this year, according to the most recent data from the regulator. 
Wells Fargo has also been traditionally regarded as one of the most active lenders to the U.S. oil and gas sector. But its energy team was still recovering from hefty losses it booked in 2016, when crude prices plunged to $26 a barrel and forced a number of bankruptcies in the sector. (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-fargo-energy-idUSKCN0XA09K)
The unit created a separate credit resolution group to try to work with customers to stem the losses. Since then the bank has disbanded its Energy Capital Group and put less emphasis on lending, two of the sources said. 
Another Wells Fargo spokeswoman, Hannah Sloane, said the bank remains committed to the sector and has expanded the business over the past three years. 
“We regularly review and evaluate the needs of our clients and the dynamics in the markets we serve in order to ensure we align our resources accordingly,"" she said. 
Wells Fargo has been working to centralize operations to improve risk controls since 2016, when a wide-ranging sales practices scandal erupted and placed the bank under a regulatory microscope. The Federal Reserve has prevented the bank from increasing its balance sheet until it believes it has made significant changes to its risk management and compliance structures. 

Revenue in Wells Fargo's wholesale bank, which houses the merged banking unit, has fallen every year since the scandal and fell another 2% during the first six months of 2019. The unit has had some trouble attracting new business in the wake of the scandal, Reuters has reported.

Gains for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),   Charter Communications   (NASDAQ:CHTR), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) also contributed to the Nasdaq-100's new highs. These stocks and Intel together contributed more than 48 points to the index's gain of 62 points. 
 
The Dow Jones industrials finished up 0.57% and ended the day off 1.53% below its all-time high in July. While Intel was the biggest percentage gainer, the Dow was also pushed higher by new highs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM).   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT) also moved up 4.4% and added nearly 40 points to the Dow's 152-point gain.
 
The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7% on the day and is 1.2% below its peak.
Amazon fell 1.09%, or more than 19 points, to $1,761.33 after reporting weaker than expected third-quarter results late Thursday. It was the company's first profit decline in two years The company also offering softer-than-expected fourth-quarter guidance. The share decline reduced the Nasdaq's gain by 8.1 points.
The decline wasn't as large as might have been expected, but Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has aggressive plans for fourth-quarter promotions. And it has a history of offering soft guidance that's blown away when earnings are announced.
 
The market's gains were dominated by tech stocks but still quite broad except for interest-rate sensitive stocks, like utilities and real estate investment vehicles. The sectors were the weakest among the 11 S&P 500 sectors as rates moved higher with stocks. The 10-year Treasury yield move to 1.803% from Thursday's 1.766%.

Boeing (NYSE:BA) fell 1.4% as the 737 MAX issue continued to weigh on the company .
While earnings were the biggest driver's in the stock market's performance, there was some early fuel provided by the Trump Administration, which said the negotiations of a text for the first phase of what is hoped to be a comprehensive trade agreement were going well. 
Gold was flat on the day at about $1,505 an ounce. West Texas Intermediate crude and Brent crude moved higher. 
Medical-equipment maker ResMed (NYSE:RMD), flooring company   Mohawk Industries   Inc (NYSE:MHK) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) were the top S&P 500 performers.

Sidewalk Labs LLC, the urban innovation unit of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. and Waterfront Toronto, the public corporation in charge of the development, are finding common ground on a majority of contentious issues, according to people familiar with the discussions. The parties have been meeting ahead of an Oct. 31 deadline set by Waterfront to reach agreement on topics such as data privacy, land values and geographical boundaries, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private.
Sidewalk had proposed investing C$1.3 billion ($990 million) alongside local partners to kick off the development, anchoring Google Canadian headquarters in neighboring Villiers Island.

1078,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 25, 2019 04:19PM ET</span>","GM Union Is Poised to Ratify Contract, End Strike in Sixth Week","(Bloomberg) -- General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). employees are voting in favor of the tentative labor agreement reached with the United Auto Workers, ratifying a new contract and ending a strike that has cost the company about $2 billion.
United Auto Workers union locals at major plants across the country have reported voting results this week that suggested GM was well on its way to clinching a contract that will bring an end to the walkout in its sixth week. With 93% of votes counted ahead of a 4 p.m. Detroit time deadline Friday, the trade publication Automotive News reported it was mathematically impossible for the deal to fall through.
The agreement GM and the UAW reached last week awards workers pay raises, $11,000 ratification bonuses and a route for temporary employees to reach full-time status. The contract also preserves the automaker’s generous health-care plan.
The strike rippled through the U.S. economy, potentially shaving tens of thousands of workers from the October jobs report due out next week from the Labor Department. GM reports earnings on Oct. 29 and will detail the impact of the strike on earnings and likely address how much can be recouped. The automaker’s shares rose as much as 2.8% to $36.80 on Friday, on course for the highest close in almost a month.
The new contract is expected to raise GM’s labor costs by at least $100 million a year, though it allows the company to follow through with closing all but one of the four U.S. plants it announced plans to shutter almost a year ago.
While the deal likely won’t help reduce the $13-an-hour premium that the Center for Automotive Research estimates GM pays workers over foreign automakers’ wage rates, it’s unlikely to lead to an increase in vehicle prices. Labor expenses only account for about 5% of the cost of a car.
Electric Trucks
GM committed to investing $7.7 billion in U.S. plants and create or retain 9,000 jobs as part of the deal. The automaker will save a factory that sits on the border between Detroit and the town of Hamtramck, where it will build a new line of electric trucks and sport utility vehicles. Among the models under consideration are SUVs that would revive the Hummer brand.
The automaker also plans to build a new joint-venture facility in Lordstown, Ohio, that will make battery packs for electric vehicles. That’s still a setback for workers at a now-idled assembly plant in Lordstown that once made Chevrolet Cruze compact cars. GM has no new work for that facility or two former transmission plants in Baltimore and Warren, Michigan.
The contract -- which the UAW will use as a benchmark for its negotiations with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV -- included the following concessions to workers:
$60,000 early-retirement bonuses for up to 2,060 eligible employees who leave between Dec. 31 and Feb. 28$11,000 ratification bonus for senior employees; $4,500 for temporary workersHourly pay raises from $18 to $32.32 for entry-level workers within four years or less3% wage increases in the second and fourth year of the contract, and 4% lump sums in first and third yearsOne-time company contribution of $1,000 to personal savings plan for members with defined pension plans"
1079,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2019 04:15PM ET</span>",What slowdown? China's riding to the rescue of luxury brands,"By Sophie Yu and Siddharth Cavale
BEIJING/LONDON (Reuters) - When Tiffany & Co said this month it was sending its priciest jewelry to mainland China to reach wealthy shoppers no longer jet-setting abroad, it reflected a trend helping global luxury brands weather a Chinese economic slowdown. 
Well-off Chinese consumers, whose trips to fashion capitals like New York and Paris have long buttressed luxury-sector sales, are increasingly staying at home because of a weaker yuan currency which has blunted their overseas firepower. 
Hong Kong, another top shopping destination, has also become less appealing due to mass anti-government protests that have erupted into violence on some occasions.
However third-quarter earnings showed that, despite China's economic growth slowing to a three-decade low, shoppers are continuing to spend heavily on luxury - but they are doing it at home or online, with their wallets reinforced by savings on flights, hotels and other steep holiday costs. 
Several large U.S. and European luxury brands reported strong demand for their goods in China, even as Beijing and Washington remain embroiled in a trade war.
Lisa, a finance worker in her late 20s, is among Chinese shoppers who are increasingly turning their eyes away from foreign shores. 
""I don't feel like there is such a big gap anymore between prices overseas and at home, so when I feel like making a purchase I usually just go straight to the store these days,"" she told Reuters outside a Hermes outlet in Shanghai.
Hermes (PA:HRMS), known for its leather goods, printed silk scarves and Birkin bags that cost $10,000 or more, said its stores in mainland China had outstanding results that helped fuel a 19% sales gain in the wider region.
The French company opened its 26th boutique in China in July in Xiamen and continues to build out its e-commerce site for Chinese customers, hermes.cn, launched a year ago. Italy's Moncler is meanwhile studying expanding the size of its stores in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai. 
""The whole economy is slowing down and salary growth is also slowing. So consumers who originally bought when they traveled will now buy domestically,"" said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING. 
She added a cut to sales taxes this year which prompted some luxury brands to lower their prices in China could also be an attraction.
HONG KONG PROTESTS 
The strength in China has helped insulate luxury companies from a major financial hit from months of pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong that have forced them to temporarily close shops and which have kept tourists away.
Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci fashion label, for example, said it has managed to make up for lost business in the former British colony due to spending shifting back to mainland China.
The turmoil is far from over, however, with protests in Hong Kong descending into clashes between demonstrators and police this week.
In the United States, meanwhile, Tiffany (N:TIF) boss Alessandro Bogliolo told Reuters this month the company was pursuing Chinese buyers who were staying at home, saying it needed to ""follow customers where they shop"". 
He has sent high-end jewelry including diamond necklaces costing $1 million or more to its stores in mainland China from New York.  
The demand for luxury in China may even be aiding more mass-market players like personal care products maker Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG), which raised its global sales forecasts on the back of premium beauty brands such as China Olay.
Emma Zhang, a 32-year-old investment analyst in Shanghai, said she was indulging more in what she said were little luxuries.

""I used to be the type to buy many cheap items, and would change them frequently,"" she said. ""My shopping habits have changed and I've been buying things that are better quality.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 rose on Friday, briefly surpassing its record closing high, after Washington said it was close to finalizing parts of a trade pact with Beijing.
The benchmark index (SPX) hit a session high of 3,027.39, reaching above its closing record of 3,025.86 on July 26. It came within a point of overtaking its all-time high of 3,027.98 set during the July 26 session.
U.S. stocks added to marginal gains early in the session after the U.S. Trade Representative's office said that deputy-level trade talks would continue. President Donald Trump also struck a hopeful tone, saying that China wanted ""to make a deal very badly.""
The developments rounded off a strong week for equity markets, which were boosted by a clutch of better-than-expected third-quarter earnings reports. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were both set for their biggest weekly percentage gain in seven weeks.
Intel Corp's (O:INTC) quarterly report added to Friday's upbeat sentiment. The chipmaker's shares jumped 7.6%, on track for their largest daily percentage gain since January 2018, after the company beat Wall Street revenue and profit estimates and raised its full-year revenue forecast.
The gain in Intel shares helped propel the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index (SOX) to a record high.
Trade optimism and Intel's gains outweighed losses in shares of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), which fell after the e-commerce giant forecast revenue and profit for the crucial holiday quarter below estimates. Amazon shares were last down 1.7%, off their session low.
""The market reaction to Amazon wasn't as bad as people thought, which created a positive atmosphere,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""Then the trade headlines - I think the market liked that as well.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 149.4 points, or 0.56%, to 26,954.93, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 10.93 points, or 0.36%, to 3,021.22 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 46.16 points, or 0.56%, to 8,231.96.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) shares dropped 1.5% after Indonesian authorities looking into October 2018's Lion Air crash said the world's largest planemaker failed to grasp risks in the design of cockpit software on its 737 MAX jet.
Shares of VF Corp (N:VFC) fell 6.7% after the apparel maker reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue as its popular Vans and Timberland brands faced intensified competition.
 Charter Communications  Inc (O:CHTR) shares gained 6.9%. The cable operator posted better-than-expected quarterly results, fueled by customer growth in its broadband services business.
The next round of earnings due next week includes Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL),  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) and  Merck & Co  Inc (N:MRK).
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.43-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.74-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) said on Friday it is recalling 108,000 Ram 1500 diesel-powered pickup trucks in the United States for coolant leaks tied to reports of some fires and four minor injuries.
The Italian-American automaker said the recall covers trucks from the 2014 through 2019 model years after finding microscopic cracks in some Exhaust Gas Recirculation coolers. The injuries occurred when customers attempted to manually extinguish engine compartment fires.
Fiat Chrysler said it will alert owners when they can get recall repairs. Until then customers should monitor coolant levels and contact dealers if they are consistently low.
The automaker said dealer-service reports and other data streams prompted an internal investigation that discovered cracks may allow coolant to ""escape and – in rare circumstances – pose an engine fire risk."" Fiat Chrysler said it was not aware of any crashes tied to the recall.

The recall does not affect the redesigned, current-generation Ram 1500, nor any gasoline-powered Ram 1500 from any model year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Restricting the flow of U.S. capital to China would have a ""devastating"" impact on global markets, the head of index provider  MSCI Inc  (N:MSCI) told CNBC on Friday.
""If that happens, then we're going to have a world in which the fuel that lubricates economic growth and prosperity in the world is cut off, the oxygen gets cut off, and therefore you end up with a global economy that is significantly smaller than we have today,"" said MSCI Chief Executive Officer Henry Fernandez.
His remarks came after a bipartisan group of senators on Tuesday, led by Marco Rubio, a Republican, and Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, asked a federal retirement fund to reverse a decision to track a popular MSCI index that includes China. A failure to do so would lead to federal retirement funds being funneled into companies controlled by the Chinese government, they said.
These companies ""assist in the Chinese government's military activities, espionage and human rights abuses, as well as many other Chinese companies that lack basic financial transparency,"" the senators said in their second letter to the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB.)
But if the United States, as the most open economy and democracy in the world, were to set severe restrictions on global capital flows, other countries would follow its example, Fernandez told CNBC at the Baron Investment Conference in New York.
The FRTIB said it was reviewing the matter.
The issue comes amid heightened U.S.-China trade tensions, and as the U.S. government considers delisting China-based companies from U.S. markets and limiting the flow of U.S. capital to Chinese companies due to security concerns about their activities, Reuters has reported.
Rubio also said MSCI does not vet companies from China that it includes in its indexes.
Fernandez said MSCI is an intermediary that does not invest any funds and only lets investors know what is available to buy and sell in global markets.
""We cannot tell investors what decision to make,"" he said.
Ron Baron, the billionaire CEO of Baron Funds, which sponsored the conference, asked Fernandez what effect U.S. capital restrictions on China would have on the markets.
""Devastating,"" Fernandez said. ""Because right now there's a trade war going on in the world and that affects supply chains. When you start having a finance war, in which you're restricting the flow of capital around the world, that disrupts the financial system of the world."""

“Data center came back much more strongly than even we anticipated this quarter,” Intel Chief Financial Officer George Davis told Reuters in an interview after the release of Intel’s third-quarter results.
That was music to the ears of many Nvidia investors and analysts alike, as data center segment sales make up more than quarter of the chipmaker’s overall revenue. Nvidia revenue hit $11.7 billion in its 2018-2019 fiscal year and looks as if it will top $12 billion this year.
Pointing to Intel’s comments on higher-than-expected demand in its data center business, which focuses on server chips, RBC lifted its price target on Nvidia to $251 to $217, forecasting that the chipmaker will likely experience higher growth relative to CPU server demand.
Nvidia surged more than 3.8% higher.
“Nvidia will experience a return to growth as utilization of GPUs (graphics processing units) in the Data Center have officially improved and are no longer running below normal,” RBC said in a note to clients.
The anticipated return for data center growth comes just as U.S.-China relations are seemingly on the mend.
The United States and China are close to finalizing some sections of their ""phase one"" trade agreement after a phone call between both trade teams, CNBC reported on Friday, citing a statement from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.
RBC also said investors were too cautious on Nvidia’s gaming business, which still makes up the bulk of revenue. That echoed earlier sentiments from some of its peers on Wall Street.
Earlier this month, Evercore ISI raised its price target on Nvida to $225 from $185, on the back of expectations for a ramp up in gaming demand and a recovery in the data center division, driven by an anticipated product refresh.
Nvidia is up about 53% so far this year and currently has an average price target of $193.10, according to consensus estimates from Investing.com. "
1086,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2019 01:19PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Qatar pushes for Deutsche Bank chairman to go - sources,"By Tom Sims, John O'Donnell and Patricia Uhlig
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Qatari investors in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) want the lender's chairman to leave after he botched an attempt to appoint their envoy to the board, people familiar with the matter said.
The Qataris have been unhappy for months with Paul Achleitner’s stewardship of Germany's largest bank amid a prolonged stock slump. His failure to get Swiss banker Juerg Zeltner onto the supervisory board was a breaking point, according to six people, including top shareholders, bankers and others with direct knowledge of the matter.
Representatives of the Qatari royal family have told Deutsche management and other major investors that Achleitner, 63, should announce his departure soon, these people said.
Two Qatari entities, Paramount Services Holdings and Supreme Universal Holdings, which are each controlled by senior members of the nation's Al-Thani ruling family, have a combined stake of close to 10% in Deutsche Bank, one person familiar with the matter said, making them the bank's largest shareholder.
One person said that Achleitner should leave in the coming months, while a second said he should announce his exit by next year's annual general meeting in May at the latest.
Achleitner, whose term ends in 2022, has assured colleagues he has been looking for a successor.
Deutsche Bank and Achleitner declined to comment, as did Michele Faissola, CEO of Dilmon, a family office which looks after the Deutsche Bank investments held by members of the Al-Thani ruling family.
The soured relationship between Achleitner and the Qataris was described by 10 individuals, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
TURNAROUND EFFORTS
The move against Achleitner underscores the deep frustration with the Austrian. Deutsche Bank’s share price has dropped 70% since he took on his role in 2012.
Achleitner survived a motion to remove him at this year’s annual general meeting.
The former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker, who has overseen multiple changes of chief executive at Deutsche, has failed to arrest the decline of the bank. Earlier this year, merger talks with state-backed Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) foundered.
Deutsche Bank’s aggressive expansion into investment banking has left it with multibillion euro fines for misconduct and years of losses.
After previously being criticized for moving too slowly to scale back the investment bank, Achleitner has supported Chief Executive Christian Sewing's deeper overhaul to focus on Germany.
Sewing in turn has voiced support. ""I am happy that he is here,"" he said in September at a conference hosted by a regional German newspaper.
A CONFLICT OF INTEREST
The two primary Qatari investors are former Qatar Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabor Al-Thani and Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani.
In 2016, when Achleitner was under pressure over Deutsche’s performance, Al-Thani’s investment vehicle Paramount came out in support of him, in a rare public statement.
Since then, relations have cooled.
At Qatar's behest, Achleitner in August nominated Zeltner, a former UBS executive, onto the supervisory board.
But Deutsche's regulators saw a conflict of interest because Zeltner is chief executive of KBL European Private Bankers, a business that overlaps with Deutsche's and is controlled by members of Qatar's royal family.
Regulators at the European Central Bank and Germany's financial markets watchdog BaFin blocked the appointment this month.
It was an embarrassing misstep for Achleitner, one of Germany's best-connected corporate heavyweights, who is currently a director of Monsanto-owner Bayer (DE:BAYGn) and previously the Chief Financial Officer at insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG) .
Some regulators griped privately that Achleitner failed to informally clear Zeltner's appointment with them before making it public, according to a senior official.
A name several investors floated as a potential candidate to replace Achleitner is Theodor Weimer, currently CEO of Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn). Deutsche Boerse declined to comment but a person close to Weimer said he was in the midst of extending his current three-year contract.
Another is Nikolaus von Bomhard, currently chair of the boards of Munich Re (DE:MUVGn) and  Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn). He declined to comment."

1089,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2019 12:36PM ET</span>",Upcoming reports from money-losing unicorns may test Wall Street's patience,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A slew of upcoming quarterly reports from companies including Beyond Meat and Uber may test Wall Street's waning patience for money-losing former unicorn startups.
Investors have become pickier in recent months, a trend highlighted recently when office-sharing startup WeWork was forced to scuttle its much-anticipated market debut due to skepticism about its business model, corporate governance and burgeoning losses.
Stocks that soared following IPOs earlier this year, like Beyond Meat (O:BYND) and Pinterest (N:PINS), have fallen back toward earth. Stocks that failed to find traction after their IPOs, like  Lyft  (O:LYFT) and Uber Technologies (N:UBER), have deepened their declines.
While the S&P 500 approaches record highs, worries about an aging bull market and fallout from the U.S.-China trade war are making investors less willing to roll the dice on risky bets, including newly listed companies with no clear paths to profitability.
""People are rolling up their sleeves and saying, 'I have to do more analysis on these companies, I need to understand its fundamentals and the management team, and how it will eventually make money',"" said Jerry Raio, head of capital markets at ClickIPO, a small company aiming to give retail investors better access to IPOs.
Underscoring Wall Street's increasing selectiveness, SmileDirectClub (O:SDC) and Peloton Interactive (O:PTON) have tumbled 49% and 24%, respectively, from their September IPOs, even after analysts from the banks that underwrote their market debuts published a deluge of ""buy"" recommendations.
Beyond Meat on Monday is expected by analysts, on average, to report revenues that quadrupled from a year ago to $82 million as the faux meat seller makes early inroads into grocery stores and fast food restaurants, including McDonald's (N:MCD). Analysts on average expect a quarterly net profit of $2.48 million on a non-GAAP basis from Beyond Meat, and a loss of $1.66 million under GAAP.
The stock has tumbled 33% in October, still leaving the gain since its May IPO at about 300%. The day after Monday's report, Beyond Meat employees and insiders will be permitted for the first time since the IPO to sell their shares, and they may be tempted to, given the stock's still mammoth return.
This year saw a series of IPOs from ""unicorns"" - rare startups valued at over $1 billion - as their investors rushed to tap equity markets near record highs. But many investors of late are refocusing on safer investments.
Unprofitable U.S. companies holding IPOs this year have had a median stock return of 0%, compared to a median increase of 2% for profitable companies that held IPOs, according to a Reuters analysis. The S&P 500 has grown 21% in 2019.
""You're seeing a broad rotation with investors moving out of high valuation companies. Beyond Meat is executing incredibly well, but its valuation is way ahead of itself by any metric,"" said Brad Gastwirth, chief technology strategist at Wedbush Securities.
Lyft surged last Tuesday after saying it would become profitable at the end of 2021, sooner than analysts expected. But shares of the ride-hailing company, which reports on Wednesday, remain down 39% since its March IPO.
Uber, which has lost a quarter of its value since its May IPO, reports its results on Nov. 4. It is expected to post a 25% increase in revenue to $3.70 billion and a loss of $1.44 billion. For full 2019, analysts expect revenue growth of 24%, down from 42% growth in 2018.
Short interest in Peloton Interactive (O:PTON), which sells stationary bikes and subscriptions for streaming exercise classes, stands at around 77% of its float, making it one of the U.S. market's most shorted stocks, according to S3 Partners. Analysts on average expect Peloton's report on Nov. 5 to show a 76% jump in revenue to $197 million and a $107 million non-GAAP loss, up from a loss of $55 million a year ago.
Reflecting Wall Street's increased nervousness,  Zoom Video Communications  (O:ZM), Crowdstrike Holdings (O:CRWD) and Medallia (N:MDLA), three of this year's more successful IPOs, have each fallen more than 25% since Sept. 5, when they reported quarterly results that exceeded consensus analyst expectations."

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2019 12:24PM ET</span>",Verizon earnings beat estimates as cheaper plans attract customers,"By Neha Malara and Sheila Dang
(Reuters) -  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter profit and revenue on Friday, as the largest U.S. wireless carrier cut prices of its unlimited plans to pull in more subscribers who pay monthly bills.
The results underscore the company's focus on strengthening its core wireless business in a highly competitive U.S. market by also adding free streaming content to its unlimited plans.
Verizon said earlier this week that it would offer a free one-year subscription to Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) soon-to-be-launched Disney+ streaming service, taking aim at rival AT&T Inc (N:T) that is set to launch streaming service HBO Max later this month.
""We added Apple Music and will now have Disney+. As we make it easier for people to step up into unlimited, that brings value for us as well,"" Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis told Reuters.
Verizon introduced four new pricing plans for its unlimited packages in the third quarter, starting at $35, and expanded its 5G services to four new cities, taking the total to 15.
That helped add 615,000 postpaid customers in the latest quarter, well above analysts' estimates of 527,000, according to research firm FactSet.
Postpaid subscribers, or those who pay monthly bills, are valuable to telecom companies as they provide a steady stream of revenue and tend to stick longer than prepaid users.
Vijay Jayant at Evercore ISI said while price cuts helped the company add subscribers, the cost per upgrade was likely higher, given the launch of Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) iPhone this year.
Meanwhile, revenue in Verizon's media unit slipped 2% to $1.8 billion from a year earlier.
Verizon recently sold social media platform Tumblr as part of its efforts to revamp the unit, Verizon Media, which also houses Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA), HuffPost and TechCrunch.
Net income rose to $5.34 billion, or $1.25 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30 from $5.06 billion, or $1.19 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, Verizon earned $1.25 per share, edging past analysts' average estimate of $1.24, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Total operating revenue rose nearly 1% to $32.89 billion, beating the estimate of $32.75 billion.
The company's shares were marginally higher in morning trade."

1093,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2019 11:52AM ET</span>",Boeing considered system redesign before accidents: NTSB report,"By Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Boeing (N:BA) engineers and test pilots considered before two fatal 737 MAX crashes whether an anti-stall system should be redesigned after discussing how flawed data from a single sensor could trigger it repeatedly, U.S. investigators have found.
The so-called MCAS system, which relied on one sensor, has been linked in part to crashes of 737 MAX jets flown by Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines, which triggered a worldwide grounding and a corporate crisis at the world's largest planemaker.
The potential redesign discussed during 737 MAX development was ultimately ruled out, based in part on the assumption pilots would react in time to any malfunction, according to a National Transportation Safety Board report to Indonesian investigators.
Although not formally part of the required analysis, the Boeing staff discussed the scenario of repeated activation of MCAS due to erroneously high Angle-of-Attack data and considered whether a redesign was necessary, the NTSB report said, citing a 2019 presentation by Boeing to the agency.
""As part of this discussion they discussed the combined flight deck effects ... but determined that no redesign was necessary,"" the NTSB said of the Boeing discussion, referring to alerts that could be potentially distracting to pilots.
Later, in a review after the Lion Air 737 MAX crash last October which killed all 189 people on board, Boeing also found that presenting the scenario to regulators would not have led it to classify the anti-stall system as a bigger hazard at the time.
Boeing has redesigned the system to rely on more than one sensor and help reduce pilot workload as it strives to return the model to the air.
The fresh details of the design of the MCAS system from the NTSB are included in a final report by Indonesian officials into the Lion Air crash. The NTSB has been supporting the Indonesian-led probe.
Reuters obtained a copy of the overall report, due to be released publicly later on Friday or on Saturday.
In a statement on Friday, Boeing said it had redesigned the system so MCAS would in future compare information from both Angle-of-Attack sensors before activating and would be easier for pilots to over-ride.
""These software changes will prevent the flight control conditions that occurred in this accident from ever happening again,"" it said, declining further comment.
RELATIVELY SIMPLE 
Boeing had assumed pilots would recognize the plane's uncommanded nose-down movement within the three seconds required by regulators, making it relatively simple to restore the aircraft to a normal position, according to the final report.
The manufacturer did not consider what would happen if a pilot reacted more slowly, leaving MCAS able to move the nose down by the system's maximum allowable amount. In the Lion Air crash, it took the pilot 11 seconds to respond to the first movement, during which the system reached the maximum authority.
Indonesian authorities recommended Boeing make more allowance in the design of its jets for the reactions of normal pilots, rather than its exceptionally skilled test pilots.
Boeing, which did not describe the MCAS system in pilot manuals, thought pilots would quickly perform a checklist to deal with a problem called ""runaway stabilizer"", for which they were already trained and which resembled the impact of MCAS.
However, the report found that MCAS did not behave in the same manner as a typical runaway, as the movement was not continuous and pilots were able to counter it multiple times by pulling back on their control columns.
At the same time as the aircraft was moving nose-down, making it difficult to control, the pilots were faced with a cascade of alerts as they tried to diagnose the situation.

""The flight crew were running out of time to find a solution before the repetitive MCAS activations placed the aircraft in an extreme nose-down attitude that they were unable to recover from,"" the report said.

1094,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2019 11:44AM ET</span>",Global insurers face quiet strain from hacker ransom demands,"By Suzanne Barlyn
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global insurers that cover cyberattacks are facing more claims related to ransom-demanding hackers who cripple businesses’ technology systems, and only stop after receiving substantial payments. 
These hackers use malicious programs known as ransomware to take down systems controlling everything from supply chains to payments to manufacturing. The hackers have grown more sophisticated during the past year, cybersecurity experts say, shifting from individuals and mom-and-pop operations to larger companies that can afford bigger ransoms. 
The effort, known in the cybersecurity industry as “big game hunting,” has been paying off for hackers. It has also been hurting insurers that provide cyber coverage for victims, which are often mid-sized companies desperate to get their systems restored and running quickly. 
“They’re large enough to be worth extorting but not large enough to have sufficient network protections to defeat the ransomware,” said Brad Gow, global cyber product leader for insurer Sompo International (T:8630). 
Sompo has been fielding a spate of claims related to a ransomware strain known as “Ryuk,” Gow said. He described the victims as companies with annual revenue between $500 million and $1 billion. 
The number of attacks and size of ransom demands have been soaring. 
Businesses detected 365% more ransomware attacks in the second quarter than they did a year earlier, according to Malwarebytes, which sells cybersecurity software. The average ransom nearly tripled, to $36,295, from $12,762 between the first and second quarters of this year, according to Coveware, a firm that helps negotiate and facilitate cyber-ransom payments. 
Criminals who dispatched the Ryuk strain have demanded as much as $5 million in bitcoin, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in May.
""We’ve seen an unprecedented amount of ransomware attacks in 2019,"" said Eireann Leverett, a senior risk researcher at the University of Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies. The size of losses for those attacks poses a serious risk to the business, Leverett said. 
Companies that have cyber insurance are often covered for a variety of expenses. They include: data recovery, legal liabilities for exposing sensitive customer information, negotiators fluent in hackers’ native languages and the ultimate ransom payments. 
Cyber experts say the criminals launching ransomware against companies are organized gangs in Russia and eastern Europe, or hackers sponsored by foreign governments. Insurers sometimes have restrictions in their policies to avoid covering attacks by nations, but it can be difficult to know for sure what type of criminal is launching an attack. 
Insurers interviewed by Reuters said ransomware attacks are accelerating but declined to say how much they have paid in total claims. 
Lloyd’s of London insurer Beazley (L:BEZG) expects to handle double-to-triple the number of ransomware incidents in 2019 as it did last year, including at least another 800 claims by year-end, according to Katherine Keefe, Beazley's global head of breach response services.
Ransomware incidents during the third quarter increased 37% over the prior year quarter, Beazley said. 
Similarly, Chubb Ltd (BN:CB) had already responded to the same number of ransomware events by June of this year as it did for all of 2018, said Michael Tanenbaum, its head of cyber for North America. 
The average Ryuk ransomware attack claim from large companies is roughly $2 million, said Wade Chmielinski, a cyber consultant for commercial property insurer FM Global. Claims from smaller companies are typically between $150,000 and $250,000. FM Global does not pay for ransoms, he said. 
One prominent attack in March against Norwegian aluminum maker Norsk Hydro (OL:NHY) turned out to be a lot more expensive.
Norsk Hydro is among the few public examples available of ransomware striking a business, because publicizing such events can invite more attacks, experts said. 
After its systems were paralyzed by the LockerGoga strain of ransomware, Hydro experienced $60.1 million to $71.1 million (550 million to 650 million Norwegian crowns) in related losses during the first half of 2019, the company said in a filing on Wednesday.
In March, Norsk Hydro identified American International Group Inc (N:AIG) as its lead cyber insurer. An AIG spokesman declined comment.
Norsk received a $3.6 million (33 million Norwegian crowns) insurance payout during the quarter and will report additional payouts when ""deemed virtually certain,"" the company said on Wednesday.
Global insurers collected $7 billion to $8 billion in cyber-insurance premiums during 2018, up about 13% from 2017, according to ratings agency AM Best. 
But insurers are grappling with pricing as ransomware attacks become more common. Many of those attacks occur in the dark, making their frequency hard to know or how severe losses are. Although a simple ransom payment is often the cheapest, easiest solution, it also emboldens hackers, said Robert Hudock, a lawyer in Washington who advises clients on dealing with cyber attacks. 
“It’s going to be a hard problem to solve,” he said, “if people keep paying the ransoms and the systems keep getting compromised.”

""Xtra failed to comply with requirements to repair only aircraft parts on list of parts acceptable to the FAA that it was capable of repairing,"" the FAA said, which had opened an investigation soon after the October 2018 crash. Xtra responded in a statement that it had been cooperating closely with the FAA ""and though we have reached a settlement with the FAA, we respectfully disagree with the agency's findings."" The company noted the FAA action was separate from the Indonesia's ""investigation and report of the Lion Air Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 Max accident and is not an indication that Xtra was responsible for the accident."" A final report into the Lion Air 737 MAX crash by Indonesian investigators made public on Friday recommended that the FAA improve oversight of maintenance organizations.  Xtra Aerospace had conducted a repair on a Lion Air sensor that was miscalibrated, the report said, and gave erroneous readings that led to the activation of an anti-stall system that pushed down the plane's nose. The report added that the lack of a ""written procedure"" at Xtra Aerospace was not detected by the FAA, which indicates ""inadequacy of FAA oversight."" The FAA order was part a settlement agreement with the company in which it agreed to waive its right to appeal the revocation to the National Transportation Safety Board or any court.

(Reuters) - Shares of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) were down 3% on Friday, as investors were let down by a lower-than-expected sales outlook and surprised by slower revenue growth at its lucrative AWS cloud business.
As many as 16 brokerages cut their price targets on the stock, with many saying higher costs to keep its one-day delivery Prime members happy played a big part in weaker profits.
""Going forward, it is difficult to assess when Amazon will once again begin to deliver profit upside. We think that the buildout of next day delivery is likely to take several quarters, and don't expect a return to outsized profits anytime soon,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter.
Amazon's median price target is $2,220, a 33% premium to where its shares are indicated to open. The shares are trading down at $1,734.70.

Amazon was again hurt by heavy investments to speed up deliveries to its Prime members as it tries to beat back Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, which is swiping market share.
Amazon expects costs to cater to Prime members to nearly double to $1.5 billion during the holiday season from what it spent on one-day delivery during the second quarter.
The company reported sales growth of 24% to $70 billion in the third quarter, but its prediction of $80 billion to $86.5 billion sales in the fourth quarter fell short of the $87.4 billion analysts were expecting, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Holiday sales typically pull in a major share of retailers' revenue and profit.

Amazon also disappointed on slower revenue growth for Amazon Web Services, the company's traditionally lucrative cloud business.
Daniel Liu, research analyst at Canalys, said Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Corp's Azure cloud business narrowed its gap with AWS during the third quarter. AWS accounts for nearly a third of the global cloud market.
AWS revenue grew by 35% year-on-year and came in slightly below Microsoft's Commercial Cloud revenue growth of 36%, according to Shebly Seyrafi, CFA Managing Director, Technology & Internet Research at FBN Securities .

Most analysts, however, stood by Amazon's long-term prospects.
Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) said Amazon's revenue continues to grow at an astonishing, and for rival retailers probably alarming, rate, adding that robust cash generation meant that Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos would be unfazed. 
""Whether all the extra investment will be worth it in the end is perhaps open to question, especially given the lackluster sales guidance for next quarter. But it's been foolish to doubt Amazon in the past,"" Hyett said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock indexes were flat to higher on Friday as upbeat earnings offset weaker-than-expected results, while the British pound extended losses from the previous day amid fresh uncertainty around Britain's exit from the European Union.
Strong results from Intel (O:INTC) helped to buoy the S&P 500 index in early trading, even as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) shares weighed following the company's forecast for revenue and profit for the holiday quarter below expectations.
Trade talks were also back in focus with U.S. and Chinese trade officials due to discuss plans for China to buy more U.S. farm products while Beijing in return will request cancellation of some planned and existing U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.

Workers at the Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant ratified the contract on Thursday by a 3-to-1 margin, according to a post on UAW Local 22's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. GM has said it will invest $3 billion to transform that complex into a hub for assembling electric trucks and vans.
With nearly half of the United Auto Workers union votes counted as of Thursday morning, an estimated 55% of the remaining members would have to vote ""no"" for the proposed deal to fail, according to an unofficial tally by Automotive News.
Some large locals are completing voting Friday on whether to ratify the deal, and the union is scheduled to announce the final results after 4 p.m. ET (2000 GMT) on Friday. The UAW recommended that the 48,000 members at GM, who have remained on the picket lines, ratify the deal reached on Oct. 16.
In 2015, rank and file UAW workers at  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) rejected the first version of a contract before it was eventually approved. 
The GM strike began on Sept. 16, with UAW negotiators seeking higher pay for workers, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits. Other issues included the fate of plants GM targeted to close, as well as the use of lower-paid temporary workers. 
Under the deal, GM would invest $9 billion in the United States, including $7.7 directly in its plants, with the rest going to joint ventures. The Detroit company also would create or retain 9,000 UAW jobs, a substantial portion of which would be new, a source previously said. The contract offers $11,000 signing bonuses to members, and pay raises.
Among the larger plants with workers voting on the deal on Friday are a truck plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana; the large sport utility vehicle assembly plant in Arlington, Texas; and an SUV assembly plant in Lansing Delta Township in Michigan. If the deal is approved by the workers, the union will next begin negotiations with  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) or Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU), covering many of the same issues. The UAW previously agreed to temporary contract extensions with both automakers while it focused on GM.

LONDON (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's asset management arm DWS said on Friday it now sees a 45% chance that Britain will not leave the European Union at all, as the prospects of a UK snap election, a second referendum or even revoking Brexit altogether have climbed this month.
An outlier from consensus, the giant investment firm which manages about 719 billion euros in assets worldwide raised its probability of 'no Brexit' to 45% from 40% in August.
If Britain were to hold another referendum, DWS said it expected the ""Vote Leave"" campaign to start with a ""severe disadvantage"", especially if the alternative was a hard version of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's proposed deal.
""Other paths toward 'No Brexit' include snap elections and/or revoking Article 50 if, at some point, that is the only way to stop 'No Deal',"" the German asset manager said in a note to clients.
More than three years after Britons voted 52%-48% to be the first sovereign country to leave the European Union, the future of Brexit is unclear.
The European Union agreed to London's request for a Brexit deadline extension on Friday but set no new departure date, giving Britain's divided parliament time to decide on Prime Minister Boris Johnson's call for a snap election.
Meanwhile DWS also trimmed its probability of a Halloween no-deal Brexit by 5 percentage points to 15%, saying it had become very hard to envision scenarios leading to such an outcome given both Boris Johnson and other Tory Brexiteers were now on record as preferring ""their deal"" to ""No Deal"".
DWS ascribes a higher chance of Brexit being abandoned than other international investment firms. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has a 25% probability on Brexit not happening at all, while Nomura sees that scenario at 30% and ING at 10%.
Peter Kinsella, head of FX strategy at UBP, said he thought it was very unlikely Westminster would end up revoking the Article 50 notice to leave the European Union.
""I would not say more than 5%,"" he said. ""Would the EU even want a permanently divided UK in the EU?"""
1105,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2019 09:04AM ET</span>","Exclusive: India probe finds AB InBev, Carlsberg, United Breweries colluded on prices - sources","By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The investigations unit of India's Competition Commission has concluded that  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI), Carlsberg (CO:CARLb) and  United Breweries  (NS:UBBW) colluded to fix beer prices, two people with direct knowledge told Reuters.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) launched the investigation after AB InBev told the watchdog it had detected an industry cartel, leading in 2018 to dawn raids at the three brewers' offices to collect evidence.
The investigation has found that 15-20 executives from the three brewers were involved in discussions of beer prices before they were submitted to Indian state regulators, thereby violating antitrust laws, said the two sources, who declined to be named as the report is not public.
""The evidence seized by the CCI during searches last year was enough to nail the culprits,"" said one of the sources.
AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, whose Indian offerings include Budweiser and Corona, told Reuters it would not be appropriate to comment at this time, but said it takes antitrust compliance ""very seriously"".
Carlsberg, which sells beer under its own-name brand and also owns Tuborg, declined to comment on Friday, but has previously said it is ""committed to complying"" with all relevant laws.
United Breweries, which is part-owned by  Heineken  (AS:HEIN) and known for its  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) brand, said it is ""given to understand"" the investigation report has been submitted to the CCI, and will present its case during the commission's hearing.
The company added that it had made complete disclosures to CCI's investigation unit that it will use to ""counter any legal presumptions and material impact against"" it.
The CCI did not respond to Reuters' request for comment. Heineken declined to comment.
The chairman of the CCI, Ashok Kumar Gupta, and other members of the commission are expected to decide on a penalty over the next few months, or dispute the investigation findings which were submitted in August, the two sources said.
The report will not be made public and its findings have not previously been reported.
The three brewers, who according to IWSR Drinks Market Analysis account for about 85% of beer consumption in the $7 billion India market, together face a potential fine of around $280 million, sources told Reuters last year.
Any company executives found to have fixed prices could also be fined, though AB InBev could escape its share of the fines as it first reported the issue.
In cases such as this the next step would typically be for the companies to argue over penalties, with the CCI deciding on the extent of the leniency to be shown, said Gautam Shahi, a New Delhi-based antitrust lawyer who is not involved in the case.
After an internal investigation in 2017, AB InBev reported its detection of industry collusion under the CCI's so-called ""leniency programme"" that provides a whistleblower-type protection for cartel members.
The disclosures came after it discovered the Indian operations - which it acquired through its purchase of SABMiller (LON:SAB) Plc - had for years fixed beer prices with Carlsberg and United Breweries.
Carlsberg and United Breweries have also filed leniency applications in the case, Reuters has reported, though it is not clear how the CCI treated those submissions.
Separately, AB InBev is battling a city-wide ban in New Delhi for alleged evasion of state taxes, which the company denies."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is getting ready to tighten rules against money laundering, an EU draft document shows, a year after previous reforms now deemed inadequate to tackle a series of banking scandals.
EU regulators were caught off guard last year by revelations of one of the largest ever money-laundering scandals, involving some 200 billion euros ($222.3 billion) in suspicious payments made between 2007 and 2015 through Danske Bank's (CO:DANSKE) tiny Estonian branch.
When the Danske scandal emerged in September 2018 in the wake of other smaller cases around the continent, the EU had just adopted the fifth revision of its anti money-laundering rules. But, watered down by conflicting interests among its 28 states, the overhaul quickly appeared insufficient.
Now the EU Commission, the bloc's executive arm, is being urged to quickly assess any restrictions stemming from existing legislation and present proposals to address shortfalls, an EU draft document seen by Reuters said.
The text was prepared by the Finnish presidency of the EU after the bloc's finance ministers debated the matter at a meeting earlier in October.
The draft text says the Commission should consider the transfer of money-laundering supervisory powers to an EU agency and proposes a mechanism to coordinate national investigators.
Despite criminal organizations frequently laundering the proceeds of their illegal activities abroad, the fight against financial crime is mostly dealt with by national authorities, which do not always fully cooperate.
The European Central Bank and the EU Parliament have said a body with EU-wide oversight powers could address this shortcoming.
The Finnish text is expected to be adopted at a Council meeting of EU finance ministers in December, but it is subject to changes. ""There are still many discussions to be had before it is adopted,"" an EU official said.
Many governments have long opposed changes to the supervision of financial crime, fearing they would be forced to share sensitive information.
Yet supporters of tighter rules were positive. ""For the first time, the Council supports the requests of the European Parliament to establish a truly European approach for combating financial crime,"" said EU lawmaker Sven Giegold, the Greens' leading deputy on financial matters.
The draft document also calls for a closer alignment of existing and future rules to reduce states' discretionary powers in applying them.
Governments are currently free to independently set fines for wrongdoers, in some cases at very low levels, and keep them secret despite guidelines recommending the contrary."
1107,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2019 08:59AM ET</span>",How SoftBank made WeWork an offer it had to accept,"By Mike Spector, Joshua Franklin, Greg Roumeliotis and Anirban Sen
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Just a few months ago, WeWork's co-founder Adam Neumann was being courted by Wall Street's top investment bankers in anticipation of one of this year's most high-profile initial public offerings. 
By October, with the IPO abandoned and his office-space sharing company bleeding cash, Neumann found himself late on a Sunday evening pleading with WeWork's largest lender for a $5 billion lifeline, people familiar with the matter said. The message was clear - without new financing WeWork would run out of money within weeks.
""Do you still believe in the company?"" Neumann, who had stepped down as CEO but was still WeWork's chairman, asked a room of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co (N:JPN) bankers on the 42nd floor of their midtown Manhattan headquarters on Oct. 6, the sources said. 
The JPMorgan bankers, led by asset and wealth management CEO Mary Erdoes and debt capital markets head Jim Casey, told Neumann and other WeWork directors they would back the company, and were confident they could raise the money. But they would not underwrite the deal on the spot, as one board member requested. 
With questions swirling around WeWork's chances of survival in the wake of its failed IPO, the bankers told Neumann they needed some time to sound out investors first, according to the sources.
A few days later, an alternative rescue plan began to emerge from WeWork's largest shareholder, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984). 
Both were far from perfect. But given its dire straits, WeWork was fortunate to have a choice. 
This account of how WeWork's financial rescue came together over the past three weeks is based on interviews with eight people with knowledge of the negotiations. They requested anonymity to discuss the confidential deliberations.
WeWork, SoftBank and JPMorgan declined to comment for this story.
Requests for an interview with Neumann were also declined. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PROBLEM
SoftBank offered $9.5 billion to WeWork, including new debt and recommitted equity, as well as a tender offer to partly cash out Neumann and other shareholders. 
In addition to providing more funds than JPMorgan, the SoftBank deal resolved what some WeWork directors privately referred to as the company's ""corporate governance problem"" - Neumann's controlling grip. 
SoftBank's deal would strip Neumann's voting power and remove him from the board. Neumann was blamed by other WeWork investors such as Benchmark Capital and China's Hony Capital, for the company's precipitous decline, some of the people said. 
His erratic management style, combined with WeWork's lack of a clear path to profitability, alienated potential IPO investors. 
The problem was that Neumann could still wield power over the company even after he quit as CEO on Sept. 24 because, as WeWork's founder, each of his shares had 10 voting rights. Others had only one vote for every share.
It was clear to SoftBank, as well as to a special board committee formed to consider the financing plans, that Neumann relinquishing control would come with a price tag, three of the people said.
CLAURE AND NEUMANN NEGOTIATE
In meetings in New York between Neumann and SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, the contours of a side deal came together. SoftBank would provide a $500 million credit line to refinance Neumann's personal borrowings made against WeWork's stock, as long as he used proceeds from cashing out up to $970 million of his shares to repay SoftBank for that loan first. 
SoftBank's latest offer valued the company at as little as $5.9 billion based on the repricing of warrants it was already committed to exercise, according to Bernstein research, a far cry from the $47 billion it had assigned to WeWork in January.
Neumann's special pay-off did not stop there. He negotiated with SoftBank a four-year non-compete agreement with a $185 million ""consulting fee"" in return for stepping down from WeWork's board. He would now only get to observe board proceedings instead of participating.
WeWork's special board committee members expressed concern that Neumann's bailout would cause outrage among many WeWork employees whose stock options had a much higher strike price than the valuation in SoftBank's tender offer, some of the people said. 
The committee declined to comment for this article.
SoftBank's offer to buy up to $3 billion of WeWork stock from employees and existing shareholders would value the company at about $8 billion, higher than the new valuation based on the warrants.
Neumann attempted to push up the valuation of the tender offer in his negotiations with SoftBank, one of the people said.
SoftBank stood firm. Anticipating criticism from its own shareholders for possibly throwing good money after bad, it wasn't prepared to pay more.
Most WeWork directors wanted Neumann off the board, and many minority shareholders, which the special committee was formed to represent, wanted to cash out, the people said. 
JPMorgan had not pursued raising additional money for shareholders, in part because WeWork only tasked the bank with delivering $5 billion of debt financing. 
JPMORGAN'S COVENANT
When the bank submitted the debt package on Monday, only private equity firm Starwood Capital Group, run by real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht, had committed to join JPMorgan in sharing the financing burden. 
JPMorgan agreed to provide the rest and transfer the money by Thursday. But the deal also included a condition, known as a covenant, that would trigger a debt default if SoftBank did not make good on $1.5 billion that it had already committed to provide when warrants came due next April, the people said.
JPMorgan wanted to ensure SoftBank would honor its financial commitment, which would lessen the risk for investors holding debt that would one day need to be repaid.
But SoftBank told WeWork's board that it would not pay the $1.5 billion if its financing offer was rejected, two of the people added. 
The problem from SoftBank's perspective was that those warrants were based on January's $47 billion valuation of WeWork. It wanted to change the pricing radically to reflect WeWork's dramatic fall in value. 
JPMorgan dealmakers, on the other hand, believed WeWork's contract with SoftBank prevented the telecommunications and technology giant from reneging on that earlier commitment, other people familiar with the matter said.
In the end, the risk that SoftBank wouldn't fulfill its commitment if the JPMorgan financing package was chosen helped swing the special committee's deliberations in favor of SoftBank's offer, they added.
SoftBank had made WeWork an offer it had to accept. 
On Tuesday, SoftBank unveiled a deal that increased its ownership of WeWork to 80% from 30%, but sought to avoid having to consolidate WeWork's liabilities on its balance sheet by not taking full control of the expanded board. SoftBank will only have 5 of the 10 seats.
But unless SoftBank can turn WeWork around quickly, it could be a pyrrhic victory. 
WeWork has burned through almost $2.5 billion of cash since the end of June, and Claure will have to cut costs quickly, including slashing thousands of jobs and helping the company to find a way to get out of expensive leases. Otherwise, the new cash injection may not last long enough to stabilize the business.
As predicted, Claure is also facing some staff anger over the size of Neumann's payout. He told employees on Wednesday that it was the ""price"" that had to be paid to get rid of Neumann's voting rights. Otherwise, he said, ""Adam could do whatever he wanted.""

(Reuters) -  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter profit and revenue on Friday, as the largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers signed up more mobile phone customers who pay a monthly bill.
The company's strategy of focusing on the core wireless business has often been contrasted with that of AT&T (N:T), its next largest competitor, which has invested in media content to grow the company.
Meanwhile, rivals T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) and Sprint Corp (N:S) have been locked in a lengthy merger process.
Verizon in the quarter launched four new pricing plans for its unlimited packages starting from $35, in a strong push to add more subscribers.
The company is also preparing to roll out 5G in more than 17 cities by the end of the year, as wireless carriers seek to expand aggressively to dominate a mobile technology that promises movie downloads in a few seconds.
By 2021, the number of 5G connections is forecast to reach between 20 million and 100 million, according to research firm Statista.
In the third quarter, Verizon added 615,000 postpaid customers, above analysts' estimates of 527,000, according to research firm FactSet.
Analysts pay attention to postpaid customers, or those with a recurring bill, because they are more valuable to carriers and tend to remain with the company longer than prepaid customers.
Revenue in Verizon's media unit slipped 2% to $1.8 billion from a year earlier.
Verizon recently sold social media platform Tumblr as part of efforts to revamp the unit, Verizon Media, which also houses Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA), HuffPost and TechCrunch.
Net income rose to $5.34 billion, or $1.25 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $5.06 billion, or $1.19 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, Verizon earned $1.25 per share, edging past analysts' average estimate of $1.24, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Total operating revenue rose nearly 1% to $32.89 billion, beating the estimate of $32.75 billion.
The company's shares were marginally higher in premarket trading."

Even as earnings rose, the amount set aside for compensation declined by almost 1% and bonuses in the second half of 2019 will depend heavily on revenue growth, according to the report.
Profitability in the securities industry has grown for three straight years, but growth in net revenue has slowed, reflecting weakness in certain business activities.
""Volatile markets, global trade tensions, and political turbulence have sown economic anxiety and slowed global economic growth,"" state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said.
In addition to uncertainty around U.S.-China trade talks, big companies are worried about how Brexit will affect Britain's standing with the rest of Europe, plus violent protests in Hong Kong and more recent threats from the White House about sanctions against Turkey for its invasion of Syria.
Third-quarter results from big U.S. banks showed weakness in their market-related businesses. Consumer business, however, remained strong, helping the banks beat market expectations for profit.
The securities industry, which accounts for 17% of New York City's economy, has added 15,400 jobs in the city in the past five years. However, job gains in the early part of 2019 have been erased in recent months, the report said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Makers of airless tires such as Japan's Bridgestone Corp. hope driverless cars will herald a breakthrough for their niche technology, which is more than a decade old but underperforms standard tires in every way except resistance to puncture.
Autonomous driving - and the eventual introduction of self-driving taxis - could mean greater demand for puncture-resistant tires as greater usage of vehicles exposes them to more flat tires.
""In the past, a car would be driven about 20% of the time and spend the other 80% in the garage,"" Atsushi Ueshima of Bridgestone said at the biennial Tokyo Motor Show on Thursday. 
""In the age of shared, autonomous vehicles, it will be the opposite, and preventing breakdowns will be a top priority.""
France's  Michelin  (PA:MICP) pioneered the technology, showcasing the first prototype in 2005 on a wheelchair. The commercial launch came in 2012, but uses have so far been mostly limited to ride-on lawnmowers and golf carts, along with construction machinery, where the chance of a puncture is high.
Toyota Group truckmaker Hino Motors Ltd used the motor show to display a vision of the future where electric, modular, people-to-parcel movers run on airless tires of its own design. Toyota Motor Corp showed a hydrogen-powered concept car fitted with Sumitomo Rubber Industries prototypes at the previous event in 2017.
Michelin and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) have announced a joint research agreement aiming to have airless tires on passenger cars by as early as 2024. Testing starts this year on the Bolt electric vehicle in Michigan. 
For electrified vehicles (EV) in particular, the tires' design - a band of rubber encircling polymer spokes around an aluminum hub - allows for motors to be fitted directly inside the wheel, opening up space in the chassis to extend leg room or expand the trunk.
EV manufacturers also hope that airless tires will in the future weigh less than their standard cousins, allowing crucial extra kilometers of driving range given consumer concerns about running out of power far from the nearest charging station.
So far though, making them more lightweight has proved difficult. Sumitomo Rubber says it has been able to reduce weight slightly by changing the shape of the polymer spokes, but the heft of the rubber tread still makes it a little heavier than current conventional tires.
Structurally, too, there are challenges. Sumitomo Rubber has been able to increase the size of its prototypes somewhat since the last motor show, but it is still far from making them big enough and strong enough for a bus or truck.
""There will definitely be demand for airless tires for commercial vehicles in the future, but making something than can support that weight is a really huge obstacle,"" Hiroshi Ohigashi, of Sumitomo Rubber, said at the motor show. 

Manufacturing costs are also a little higher than for pneumatic tires, but both Sumitomo Rubber and Bridgestone expect an eventual move to mass production would solve that.

1112,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2019 07:57AM ET</span>","Indonesia report on 737 MAX crash faults Boeing design, says Lion Air made mistakes","By Bernadette Christina Munthe and Jessica Damiana
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA), acting without adequate oversight from U.S. regulators, failed to grasp risks in the design of cockpit software on its 737 MAX airliner, sowing the seeds for a Lion Air crash that also involved errors by airline workers and crew, Indonesian investigators found.
The fatal crash, followed less than five months by another at Ethiopian Airlines, led to a global grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX and a crisis for the world's biggest planemaker, which this week ousted its commercial airplanes chief.
In its final report into the Oct. 29, 2018, Lion Air crash that killed all 189 people on board, Indonesia made recommendations to Boeing, the airline, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other agencies. 
A copy was seen by Reuters and it is due to be released publicly later on Friday or on Saturday, an investigator said.
Indonesian regulators criticized the design of the anti-stall system known as MCAS, which automatically pushed the plane's nose down, leaving pilots fighting for control. 
""The design and certification of the MCAS did not adequately consider the likelihood of loss of control of the aircraft,"" the report said.
Boeing has been working on a redesign of MCAS although it has yet to certified by the FAA.
The report also said ""deficiencies"" in the flight crew's communication and manual control of the aircraft contributed to the crash, as did alerts and distractions in the cockpit.
The accident had been caused by a complex chain of events, Indonesian air accident investigator Nurcahyo Utomo told reporters at a news conference, repeatedly declining to be drawn on providing a single dominant cause.
""From what we know, there are nine things that contributed to this accident,"" he said. ""If one of the nine hadn't occurred, maybe the accident wouldn't have occurred.""
During the flight, the first officer was unable to quickly identify a checklist in a handbook or perform tasks he should have had memorized, it said, adding that he had also performed poorly in training exercises. 
The captain did not properly brief the first officer when handing over control just before the plane entered a fatal dive, it also said.
The report noted that according to the cockpit voice recorder, the first officer told the captain the flight was not in his initial schedule and he had been called at 4 a.m. to be informed of the revision, while the captain said he had the flu.
A critical angle of attack (AOA) sensor providing data to the MCAS anti-stall system had been miscalibrated by a company in Florida and that there were strong indications that it was not tested during installation by Lion Air maintenance staff, the report said.
Lion Air should have grounded the jet following faults on earlier flights, it said, and added that 31 pages were missing from the airline's October maintenance logs.
A Lion Air spokesman said the crash was an ""unthinkable tragedy"" and it was essential to take immediate corrective actions to ensure a similar accident never occurred again. 
Boeing said in a statement that it was addressing Indonesia's safety recommendations and taking actions to enhance the safety of the 737 MAX.
The FAA said it welcomed the report's recommendations and would carefully consider them and all others as it continued to review Boeing's proposed changes to the 737 MAX.
Indonesia may require pilots receive simulator training before the plane returns to service as earlier computer-based training covering differences between the 737 MAX and prior 737 NG model was insufficient, Director General of Civil Aviation Polana Pramesti said on Friday.
INVESTIGATIONS
Boeing faces a slew of investigations by regulators, U.S. Congress, and the Department of Justice over its development of the 737 MAX, its previously best-selling workhorse for short-haul travel.
Boeing last month settled the first claims stemming from the Lion Air crash, a U.S. plaintiffs' lawyer said.
Three other sources told Reuters that families of those killed would receive at least $1.2 million each.
The manufacturer is facing nearly 100 lawsuits over the Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10 which killed all 157 people on board the flight from Addis Ababa to Nairobi.
Indonesia has offered to aid Ethiopian authorities in their investigation into that crash but to date there has been no response, said Soerjanto, the head of Indonesia's accident investigator.
Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said this week the company was making ""daily"" progress on testing the final software fix for the 737 MAX and developing related training materials. The FAA has said it would need at least several more weeks for review.
The Indonesia report said that Boeing's safety assessment assumed pilots would respond within three seconds of a system malfunction but on the accident flight and one that experienced the same problem the previous evening, it took both crews about eight seconds to respond.
It called for the systems to be designed not just for highly skilled test pilots but also for regular commercial airline pilots.
The FAA had delegated increasing authority to Boeing to certify the safety of its own aircraft, Indonesian investigators said in the report, recommending that all certification processes received adequate oversight.

A panel of international air safety regulators this month also faulted Boeing for assumptions it made in designing the 737 MAX and found areas where Boeing could improve processes.

OSLO (Reuters) - European power exchanges operating in Britain plan separate day-ahead interconnector capacity auctions from Nov. 1 if the UK exits the bloc at the end of this month without a divorce deal, operator Nord Pool said on Friday.
In the event of a no-deal Brexit, Britain would no longer be coupled to European power markets. That means capacity allocations via power interconnectors that connect Britain to mainland Europe would be made in a common bidding zone only until Oct. 31 for delivery the next day.
Britain's two market operators are Nord Pool and EPEX SPOT.
The first separate auction for day-ahead capacity will take place on Nov. 1, Nord Pool said.
""The solution foresees the removal of the GB bidding zone and lines connected to it from SDAC (Single say-ahead coupling),"" Nord Pool said.
""The Single Electricity Market (SEM), which encompasses the island of Ireland, would remain within the implicit day-ahead market coupling with the SEM bidding zone operated in an isolated mode,"" it added.
A separate, or ""explicit"", auction is held when the transmission capacity on an interconnector is auctioned to the market separately and independently from the marketplaces where electrical energy is auctioned.
With an ""implicit"" auction, the day-ahead transmission capacity is used to integrate the spot markets in the different bidding areas in order to maximize the overall social welfare in both, or more, markets.
The solution planned by market operators and grids was successfully tested during September.
Despite having set a plan for a no-deal scenario, Nord Pool said in a separate statement that it was still concerned about the prospect.
""Nord Pool remains concerned about the future of the GB day-ahead shared order book and the ability to retain a single reference price, in the absence of any agreement between the two GB Nominated Electricity Market Operators,"" it said.
""While Nord Pool continues to engage with all GB stakeholders on this, some parties are proving slow to respond at a time when we feel rapid action is needed if we are to retain the integrity and efficiency,"" said Nord Pool.
It added that there is concern that market participants may be exposed to additional risk as a result of a possible creation of multiple index prices and fragmented liquidity.
EPEX SPOT was not immediately available for a comment."
1114,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2019 07:16AM ET</span>",Biogen's secret campaign to bring its Alzheimer's drug back from the ashes,"By Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Biogen Inc's (O:BIIB) shock decision this week to bring its experimental Alzheimer's drug back from the scrap heap was born out of “top secret"" meetings, non-disclosure agreements and six months of hashing over trial data with scientists, regulators and statisticians, researchers told Reuters.
Biogen had announced in March that it would terminate two large clinical trials of aducanumab because they were likely to fail. Within weeks, a group of company researchers set out to understand what went wrong.
As they studied data from a larger pool of patients who received the drug, they began to question that conclusion.
In the months that followed, Biogen kept its own trial investigators and committee overseeing the trial in the dark about the possibility that some patients had benefited from high doses of the therapy, researchers told Reuters.
The company said it brought in outside Alzheimer's experts and statisticians to help it parse the new findings, and sought feedback from U.S. regulators on whether it could be considered for approval.
The result, made public on Tuesday, was an astounding reversal. Biogen will seek U.S. approval for the therapy early next year, once again raising hopes for patients suffering from the brain-wasting disease. Biogen shares gained 27% on investor hopes for a multibillion-dollar blockbuster.
The risks for Biogen remain high. Wall Street analysts cast doubt on whether Biogen's analysis would pass muster with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration without an additional years-long trial to confirm the findings.
Several Alzheimer's researchers questioned why one trial appeared to succeed, while another with the same design failed.
Many experts say they are reserving judgment until Biogen presents more detailed data in December.
Company executives are reluctant to characterize their interactions with the FDA, but said they worked closely with the agency until they were confident in the findings.
Biogen was only willing to move forward with seeking approval for aducanumab after meeting twice with FDA. The final decision was made immediately after the second of those meetings, which took place on Monday, Biogen officials said.
For the FDA ""to say it's reasonable to file an application after two extensive discussions with them, formal meetings as well as a number of informal discussions, I think it's significant,"" Biogen research chief Al Sandrock said in an interview.
A NAIL IN THE COFFIN
Biogen's earlier decision to terminate the trials was viewed as the final nail in the coffin for the so-called ""amyloid hypothesis"" - the theory that removing a protein associated with Alzheimer's could stave off this fatal form of dementia. Many similar drugs had previously failed.
Globally, 131 million people are expected to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's by 2050, up from 50 million today. Any successful treatment could be worth $10 billion or more in annual sales, industry analysts say.
The March announcement also raised concerns about a second therapy, BAN2401, that works in a similar way. Biogen is partnering with Japan's Eisai on both drugs.
Ivan Cheung, Eisai's chief executive, said in an interview that he expects aducanumab's revival will energize enrollment in a late-stage study of BAN2401, with results expected in 2022. Patients taking the highest dose of BAN2401 showed some encouraging results in a midstage trial last year.
""That's why in the Phase III trial, we are only studying the highest dose,"" Cheung said.
The two aducanumab trials - Engage and Emerge - started a month apart in 2015. Each had about 1,640 patients. As they progressed, the company made changes in the trial that expanded the number of patients who received a higher dose.
As part of a planned ""futility analysis,"" outside monitors reviewed half of the data as of December 2018 to determine whether the drug had a reasonable chance of success.
""So many of us felt that this might be the drug that would cross the finish line,"" said Dr. Sharon Cohen, director of the Toronto Memory program, who led one of the studies. In March, she received the answer: the therapy looked like a dud.
However, patients continued to receive treatment in the interim. Cohen believes the fact that some patients got a higher dose for longer helped swing results in the Emerge study, which ultimately showed a benefit.
A CONTRADICTION
A month after announcing the failure, Biogen began analyzing results from both trials, including additional data from patients who later completed treatment.
By the time Biogen had its first FDA meeting in mid-June, the company knew that one of the studies had succeeded, and understood that dose was important, said Samantha Budd Haeberlein, who runs Biogen's Alzheimer's program.
""We did a great deal of analysis in close contact with the FDA to really understand what occurred in these trials,"" Haeberlein said. ""It took several months to work through that.""
During that entire stretch, Cohen said she and fellow investigators were waiting to hear why the drug had failed. They expected a presentation in July during the Alzheimer's Association annual meeting, but none came.
""I was completely unaware of what had been discovered until last Sunday,"" said Dr. Anton Porsteinsson, a principal investigator for the trials from the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. Porsteinsson said Biogen asked him to sign a non-disclosure agreement before sharing the new analysis.
Cohen said she first reviewed the new data on Monday in what she called a ""top secret"" meeting. She said the company wanted a few investigators to hear the findings ahead of Tuesday's announcement, but had concerns about insider trading.
Many still question why only one trial succeeded.
""The signal from the positive trial was kind of convincing,” said Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's expert Dr. Ronald Petersen, who has been a paid adviser for Biogen. It showed a 23% reduction in a key measure of cognitive decline.
""But the other study, which was meant to be identical, didn't show it,"" he said. ""That's the challenge there."""
1115,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2019 07:11AM ET</span>",Wall Street Weekahead: Bond fund managers see risk Fed cuts rates to zero,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Speculation the Federal Reserve will continue cutting interest rates well past its policy meeting next week is pushing some bond fund managers into assets ranging from short-term Treasury bills to half-paid off 15-year home mortgages.
They're betting that short-term U.S. interest rates will once again return to near zero for the first time since the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.
The market is already pricing in a 93.5% chance the U.S. central bank cuts short-term interest rates by at least 0.25% at its October 30th policy meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool, continuing a rate-cutting cycle that began earlier this year and helped lead to bull markets in both bonds and equities.
The probability of such a cut was just 64.1% in late September.
Yet fund managers and analysts from firms including First Pacific Advisors, Columbia Threadneedle, and Brandywine Global say the market is still underpricing the possibility the Fed will continue cutting rates well into next year, essentially taking short-term interest rates back to where they were before the central bank began lifting rates in 2015.
""We think the Fed's precautionary cuts continue and the market isn't anticipating that scenario and is priced for a soft landing next year,"" said Edward Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle.
As a result, shorter duration Treasurys up to 2-year bills are becoming more attractive, as well as emerging market bonds that are priced in dollars, he said.
""We're looking for opportunities to add in risk assets that are sensitive to U.S. rates,"" he said, expecting gains will come more in the form of price appreciation than yields.
The Fed's likely efforts to steepen the yield curve by continuing to cut rates past the market's expectations will also make short duration high yield debt attractive, said Gary Herbert, head of global credit at Brandywine Global, an affiliate of Legg Mason with $75 billion in assets under management.
""There's a higher probability of a recession than we thought at the beginning of this year, and the Fed may need to return more significantly to unorthodox monetary policy like quantitative easing,"" he said, referring to the bond-buying program the Federal Reserve instituted as an emergency response to the financial crisis. ""It's not unthinkable to expect a recession in the next year, it's one stupid tweet away.""
At the same time, Herbert is buying investment grade corporate bonds that mature in approximately 3 years. He is focusing on companies such as  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and  General Electric  Co (N:GE) that have strong balance sheets yet are struggling due to issues including a corporate turnaround and the grounding of the 737 MAX airliner.
""Even if they were to be downgraded, they would be able to tender that debt to create better liquidity,"" keeping their strong balance sheets intact, he said.
Tom Atteberry, portfolio manager of the $7.3 billion FPA New Income fund, said negative bond yields in Europe and Japan are prompting more foreign investors to pick up U.S. debt, which will continue to push yields lower throughout the market.
He is finding opportunities in bonds backed by prime-rated auto leases, loans for equipment ranging from cell phones to service fleets, and 15-year mortgage pools that originated in 2012 and 2013, he said. Each category offers yields between 1.90% and 2.25%, compared with the 1.73% yield the benchmark 10-year Treasury offered Thursday, and should continue to do well if interest rates fall.
""You should have higher yields, but you've got two large economic blocs with negative yields and central bank interventions on an ongoing basis,"" he said. ""It's almost an unnatural time."""

(Reuters) - More than half a million homes and businesses in California could lose power this week as utilities including Pacific Gas & Electric (N:PCG) and Southern (NYSE:SO) California Edison (A:SCE_pe) cut off electricity as a preventive measure against wildfires.
Over 308,000 customers in seven counties, including Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Ventura in southern California, are under the Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) consideration, Southern California Edison said.
Shutoffs from SCE could start early Thursday.
Meanwhile, PG&E has shut off power in 15 counties, affecting about 178,000 customers in those areas. The company said additional power shutoffs for parts of San Mateo County and Kern County were expected to begin at about 1 a.m. (0800 GMT) on Thursday, affecting more than 1,000 customers.
San Diego Gas & Electric Co has also identified more than 41,000 customers under PSPS consideration, but has not implemented any power shutoffs on Thursday.
Forecaster Marc Chenard said the worst of the winds would arrive on Thursday afternoon and into Friday.
""It looks like at its worst, southern California will see wind gusts of 55 mph. Down in some of the coastal areas the winds could reach 75 mph later today,"" he said.
Power lines could be knocked down and start fires among dry trees and vegetation, according to earlier forecasts.
Bankrupt Californian power producer PG&E cut off electricity to more than 730,000 homes and workplaces in northern California earlier this month to try to reduce wildfire risks posed by extremely windy and dry weather.
Chenard added that northern California could experience dangerous wind gusts of up to 45 mph. ""This is not going to abate until at least this weekend.""
Wildfires were also growing through the night in Sonoma County, about 65 miles north of San Francisco, which is popular with tourists visiting wine-producing areas in California.
Evacuation warnings were issued before midnight in some communities as the wind-driven fires moved toward the tourist towns of Healdsburg and Geyserville, officials said."

1122,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2019 06:33AM ET</span>","SoftBank to write down minimum $5 billion for WeWork, other losses: Bloomberg","By Rocky Swift and Junko Fujita
TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank has ample funds to endure the pain from its massive bailout of WeWork, analysts said, even as it is reportedly set to write down at least $5 billion due to a slump in the value of the U.S. office sharing startup and some other top holdings.
SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) agreed to offer a $9.5 billion lifeline to WeWork this week to take control of the U.S. office-space sharing startup, now valued at $8 billion.
The deal, which comes on top of more than $10 billion investment SoftBank has already committed, is set to strain the Japanese investment firm's bottom line.
Citing people with knowledge of the matter, Bloomberg said SoftBank would announce the writedown along with its second-quarter earnings on Nov. 6.
A SoftBank spokesman declined to comment on the report. The company's shares fell 1.2% in Tokyo.
Since spinning off its namesake telecom unit SoftBank Corp (T:9434), analysts now view SoftBank as a financial holding company. More akin to a bank, the company is taking on more debt and relying on cash flows from its operating units to pay the interest.
""From a leverage standpoint, SoftBank has some cushion to take on additional debt,"" said Moody's analyst Motoki Yanase.
Although SoftBank has an army of retail investors in yield-strapped Japan willing to buy its junk bonds, it already holds about 5 trillion yen of net debt on its balance sheet - more than half its 9 trillion yen market capitalization. 
Both Moody's and S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) rate SoftBank below investment grade. That means the company has to pay higher interest on its bonds and loans. The company's weighted average cost of debt is 3.7%, the seventh-highest among all companies on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average, according to Refinitiv data.
Even so, SoftBank retains huge holdings in listed companies that could be sold off if the company needs cash, said S&P analyst Hiroyuki Nishikawa.
Portfolio companies backed by SoftBank and its $100 billion Vision Fund include British chip designer ARM,  Slack Technologies Inc  (N:WORK), and ride-hailing firms such as  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER), Grab and Didi.
Jefferies downgraded SoftBank stock to hold from buy on Friday, saying that WeWork rescue sets an ""undesirable precedent"" for the group's private investments.

An imposition of trade barriers would hamper the ability of BMW's largest car factory, based in Spartanburg, South Carolina to export around 70% of its produce across the globe, the German executive said.
""If they do this, then we are all losers,"" Zipse said of his discussions, speaking at an automotive conference in Stuttgart on Friday. ""I have the impression they are listening carefully. The export model sustains many jobs in the United States.""
The Spartanburg plant has not had to reduce production capacity so far but any additional barriers to global trade could change that, he said."

TOKYO (Reuters) - In Japan, trucks are being designed for a driverless future with no cabin and interchangeable container areas that would allow vehicles to be highly customized for parcel delivery or even serve as mini-hotels or beauty salons.
At the Tokyo Motor Show this week, Hino Motors (T:7205), the truckmaking arm of Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), showcased the futuristic ""Flatformer"", which had no driver's cabin and where the low-riding bed is fixed but the cargo or container section can be swapped out.
On display was a concept battery-electric model with a cargo hold divvied up into stacked storage boxes that would help parcel delivery companies to sort, load and deliver goods more efficiently.
""The idea is to produce a standardized truck bed upon which customers can customize according to the services they offer,"" said Atsuyuki Hanazawa, manager of the design division at Hino's future projects group.
Explosive growth in online shopping and increased demand for same-day deliveries have heaped pressure on courier companies and their drivers - particularly in Japan where the sector has borne the brunt of a worsening labor shortage.
In 2016, video footage of a courier in Japan kicking and tossing parcels in apparent frustration due to overwork went viral, sparking widespread public criticism.
Toyota's minivehicle brand Daihatsu also showed off its ""Tsumu Tsumu"" model with a removable cargo hold - one that can be adapted to suit the needs of farmers transporting vegetable harvests, or as a food truck, or for businesses that need to deliver food to restaurants.
Such flexibility may be critical for the future of minitrucks in Japan, given that the number of farmers - a core customer base for Daihatsu's no-frills, affordable vehicles - is dwindling as the country ages rapidly.
""The needs of people who use minitrucks are changing, so we need to start thinking about products beyond what we've been offering and which enable multi-functionality,"" said Daihatsu designer Osamu Iwanami.
While production versions of the Hino and Daihatsu models are likely years away, Toyota has also said it is developing production models of ""e-Palette"" shuttle bus-sized, self-driving multi-purpose vehicles that can be used, for instance, as mobile restaurants or offices."

Investing.com -- When the world economy slows down and times get tough, do you want to be in the business of selling low-cost comforts to the masses, or high-end puffer jackets and handbags to the fortunate few?
Friday’s results from around Europe suggest the latter: Anheuser Busch Inbev (BR:ABI), the world’s largest brewer, fell 9.5% after it cut its forecasts for the performance of its newly-spun-off Asian unit in response to falling shipments in China, while it noted that its U.S. division also weakened.
The development will give some grim satisfaction to investors who baulked at Inbev’s original price for the unit when it first tried to sell it earlier this year. That forced the giant brewer into carving out its Australian assets into a separate business before finally selling it at the bottom of a revised range second time around.
The third-quarter results led AB Inbev to cut its full-year earnings growth forecast to ‘moderate’ from ‘strong’.
It was quite a different story at Gucci owner   Kering   (PA:PRTP), whose shares leapt 6.5%, putting it at the top of the Euro Stoxx 50, after it said strong sales elsewhere more than compensated for the hit to sales at its Hong Kong boutiques in the three months to September. Kering’s sales in the Asia-Pacific region were still up nearly 17% on the year.
Kering’s shares hit their highest since July and are now only 4% short of the all-time high they hit earlier this year.
Likewise, fashion group Moncler (MI:MONC), famous for its expensive puffer jackets, rose 8.1% to its highest in six weeks after posting a 10% rise in currency-adjusted sales in the third quarter – despite a 40% drop in sales in Hong Kong. The Asia and the rest of the world region accounts for 40% of the group’s revenue as a rule.
Luxury names were the main prop to Europe’s big boards on Friday, as markets retreated from the week’s highs against a backdrop of fresh political uncertainty in the U.K. By 5:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the benchmark Euro STOXX 600 was down 0.3% at 396.28, while the FTSE 100 was down 0.4%.
The German DAX performed slightly better after the closely-watched Ifo business climate index stayed unchanged in October, adding to evidence that Europe’s largest economy may be bottoming out."

BERLIN, (Reuters) - H&M (ST:HMb) opened a boutique-like store in a trendy neighbourhood in Berlin on Friday that offers yoga classes, a cafe with a garden and space for other brands as the Swedish budget chain seeks a new look to revive flagging sales.
H&M first piloted the idea of a smaller, more upmarket store in its home town of Stockholm last year and is now bringing the concept to its biggest market of Germany, where it runs 462 of its 4,972 stores worldwide.
The move comes as H&M invests heavily and tries new concepts after years of falling profits and growing inventories due to slowing sales at its core budget stores, recently posting its first rise in quarterly pretax profit in more than two years.
The Berlin store is about a fifth of the size of regular H&M stores and features clothes selected to appeal to local tastes, as well as perfumes, ""vegan"" cosmetics, handbags and second-hand garments from partner brands.
""We need stores closer to where people hang out. We are not used to operating in smaller spaces,"" said Anna Bergare, head of business development at the H&M Lab, which is testing new concepts and technology.
The new store stocks a limited range of mostly casual womenswear, but also features a few men's jackets and T-shirts and yoga gear aimed at customers attending classes in the store.
It offers innovations such as buttons shoppers can press in changing rooms linked to devices worn by staff and screens in the cafe area where they can search the full H&M range.
Bergare said the store is an attempt to respond to the rise of ecommerce and to tap into a tendency for people to spend more time and money on experiences rather than possessions.
She admitted that the new concept was demanding in terms of staff training and event management but said its success should not just be measured by its sales, but in terms of how it builds relationships with customers, who might later buy online.
""We see the potential to have this in other places as well,"" she said. ""There are a lot of these hubs that are very creatively driven that could benefit from these stores."""

(Reuters) - European shares fell for the first time this week on Friday, as a 10% slide in shares of brewing giant  Anheuser-Busch InBev  sent a shiver through investors worried about the outlook for growth and the prospect of months more wrangling over Brexit.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) dipped 0.2%, but was still on track to end a busy week of corporate earnings higher after a handful of industry heavyweights topped low market expectations.
The food and beverage sector (SX3P) led losses on Friday, however, after Anheuser-Busch InBev (BR:ABI) came in below analysts' forecasts for quarterly profit and cut its forecasts for improvement in its bottom line this year.
Shares of German telecoms operator 1&1  Drillisch  (DE:DRIG) and its parent company  United Internet  (DE:UTDI) also tanked after the former' s request to review prices under an agreement with rival  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) Deutschland (DE:O2Dn) was rejected.
""Today's moves seem to have trimmed some of the progress we have seen on the week,"" said Ken Odeluga, an analyst with City Index in London.
""You have a mechanical effect from that 10% decline in AB InBev but you can't really generalize. We may not see a stellar earnings season but with expectations so low there will be more beats for sure.""
On the bright side, France's CAC 40 (FCHI) outperformed as Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) jumped 8%, while Italian jacket maker Moncler (MI:MONC) rose 7%. The companies joined other luxury labels in easing fears of a major third quarter sales hit from the protests in Hong Kong.
Limiting those gains was a 20% fall in shares of entertainment company  Ubisoft  (PA:UBIP), which lost roughly a quarter of its value after cutting its 2020 earnings guidance.
Among banks, Spain's Banco Sabadell (MC:SABE) and Britain's  Barclays  (L:BARC) both rose after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings.
BREXIT PANGS

1129,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 25, 2019 04:24AM ET</span>",Barclays Sees Challenging 2020 Even as Investment Bank Rallies,"(Bloomberg) --   Barclays   (LON:BARC) Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley warned that low interest rates and Britain’s Brexit-hit economy will make it tougher to meet the bank’s targets next year, even as his traders outperformed most of Wall Street in the third quarter.
“The outlook for next year is unquestionably more challenging now than it appeared a year ago, in particular given the uncertainty around the U.K. economy and the interest rate environment,” Staley said in a statement on Friday.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) joins other British lenders such as Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS), which has blamed the domestic economic environment for putting its targets at risk.
The corporate and investment bank’s third-quarter total income jumped 17% from the same period last year as revenue from fixed income and equities both advanced, Barclays said in the statement. Barclays outperformed its U.S. peers, whose trading income rose an average of 6.4%, according to Bloomberg calculations.
Barclays aims to boost return on tangible equity, a key measure of profitability, above 9% this year and then raise it past 10% in 2020. While Staley didn’t revise those targets,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). analysts have said 7% is a more realistic goal in the near term. To have any hope of meeting the targets, the American-born CEO must maintain a tight grip on expenses.
Staley repeated that Barclays plans to reduce expenses beyond its previous guidance, which had a lower bound of 13.6 billion pounds ($17.5 billion). The CIB unit’s revenue of 2.62 billion pounds beat the 2.42 billion-pound consensus analyst estimate.
According to the bank’s first-half results, Barclays shed about 3,000 jobs in the second quarter and cut variable compensation by more than 20%. Staley’s brake on costs has come at the expense of executive tumult: in a dispute over bonus cuts, he ousted his hand-picked head investment banker, Tim Throsby, and took direct control of the unit last spring.
The stock has lost almost 25% since Staley took the top job in December 2015. That sluggish performance led activist Edward Bramson to launch a campaign against the CEO’s strategy last year, arguing that the bank should redeploy capital from its investment bank to higher-returning businesses like retail banking and credit cards. Bramson has repeatedly said the lender is following a “destructive strategy."""
1130,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 25, 2019 04:18AM ET</span>",AB InBev’s China Slump Wipes Out $20 Billion in Market Value,"(Bloomberg) -- The Asian unit that Anheuser Busch Inbev SA NV (BR:ABI) partially spun off to investors last month with the promise of tapping into China’s growth is now weighing on performance of the world’s largest brewer.
AB InBev fell as much as 11% in early European trading, lopping off more than $20 billion of market value, after a drop in beer shipments in China and the U.S. caused profit growth to stumble in the third quarter. The Budweiser brewer lowered its full-year earnings forecast, saying Friday that it expects “moderate” gains, down from “strong” previously.
The results paint a souring picture of Asian consumer confidence and could signal bigger trouble ahead after China’s economy slowed to the weakest pace since the 1990s. Chief Executive Officer Carlos Brito has reported earnings below analysts’ estimates in four of the past eight quarters, and last year he cut the brewer’s dividend payout in half amid sluggish progress in debt reduction.
AB InBev’s report underlines a recent pattern, with Chinese demand weakening for drinks like Pernod Ricard's (PA:PERP) Cognac and mass-market consumer items from Nestle (SIX:NESN) and   Unilever   (LON:ULVR), while fashion giants   Hermes International   (PA:HRMS) and LVMH (PA:LVMH) are still enjoying strong growth in the world’s key luxury market.
AB InBev’s earnings were flat on an adjusted basis, missing analysts’ estimates for 3% growth.
New restrictions in China curbing the sale of alcoholic drinks after 2 a.m. have weighed on the industry. AB InBev’s earnings growth in that market slowed to 11% from 24% in the second quarter. Last month, the company raised $5.8 billion selling a stake in its Asian business, Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd.
The company said the picture isn’t so bleak, as its highest-priced beers in China, which include Corona, had shipment growth that exceeded 10%.
‘Growth Is There’
“Our China business remains intact,” Chief Financial Officer Felipe Dutra said on a call with reporters. “Growth is there.”
Last year, Heineken (AS:HEIO) bought a $3.1 billion stake in the parent of China Resources Beer Holdings Co., the maker of the country’s best-selling Snow brand. Carlsberg (CSE:CARLb) has also been performing well in China, where its revenue rose 19% in the first half even as the overall market shrank.
In the U.S., the emergence of hard seltzers is eroding consumption of beer, so the company is expanding in that segment with brands such as Bon & Viv and an upcoming Bud Light Seltzer.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:
“AB InBev’s volume collapse shows the inherent risk of its business model, with a focus on higher prices and margin allowing competition a chance to flourish.”
-- Duncan Fox, BI consumer-staples analyst
AB InBev Asian Volume Collapse a Concern If M&A a Goal: React
Other factors that hit the brewer in the quarter were higher raw-material costs, the timing of shipments, adverse currency swings and declines in volume in South Korea and Brazil. The brewer reversed price increases in the Asian country after they drove consumers away. Earnings in Brazil dropped 17%.
AB InBev said that the second half of 2019 poses more challenging comparisons. Last year, most marketing spending occurred in the first half, linked to the World Cup soccer games, while this year it’s more spread out."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's biggest shared workspace provider Ucommune has filed a confidential prospectus with the U.S. securities regulator as it seeks an initial public offering (IPO) before the end of the year, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Ucommune’s decision to explore a listing has surprised investment bankers given the similarities between its business and that of embattled U.S. rival WeWork, which this week had to be bailed out in a $10 billion deal after investors soured on an IPO plan.
Beijing-based Ucommune, which was valued at $2.6 billion about a year ago, has appointed  Citigroup  (N:C) and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) to work on a listing, while Bank of America (N:BAC) has a minor role on the deal, the sources said.
A prospectus was lodged with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in late September, they said, and the company has held preliminary meetings to sound out investors before the formal public marketing process begins.
A decision to go ahead with the IPO will depend on the feedback provided by potential investors, the sources said.
A deal before the end of the year is still the company’s target, they said.
Ucommune did not respond to several calls and emails from Reuters seeking comment on its IPO ambitions. Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Bank of America declined to comment on the transaction.
The sources declined to be identified because the information had not been made public.
WeWork accepted this week a rescue package put together by major shareholder SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) that gives the Japanese investment giant control of WeWork and sharply cuts its valuation to $8 billion from about $47 billion at the start of the year.
Ucommune has shared workspaces in 200 locations across 37 countries, led by Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Los Angeles and New York, according to its website.
In November last year, it finalised its fourth private funding round when it raised $200 million and said it would expand to 350 locations within the next three years."

PARIS (Reuters) - French carmaker Renault's (PA:RENA) group revenue fell in the third quarter, weighed down by a drop in production at partners Nissan and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) as declining demand for diesel engines added to the effects of a slowing global market.
The company, which owns 43.4% of Japanese manufacturer Nissan (T:7201), said  Renault  group revenue fell 1.6% to 11.296 billion euros. It also said the group's third-quarter sales by volume were down 4.4% to 852,198 vehicles.
Renault had already flagged the weaker revenue in a profit warning last week, which sent its shares falling. On Friday it offered explanations for the worse-than-expected numbers.
Besides selling Renault-branded vehicles, the company also uses its plants to manufacture vehicles for its partner, Nissan, and for Daimler (DE:DAIGn), and it is a specialist in making diesel engines for other automakers.
Sales of the vehicles it makes for partners have slowed, with a knock-on effect on Renault's revenues, while demand for diesel engines in Europe has declined.
Renault said those effects were compounded by the closure of the Iranian market since last year as a result of U.S. trade sanctions.
Renault has been trying to regain momentum after the November 2018 arrest in Japan of Carlos Ghosn, the head of the Renault-Nissan alliance, on financial misconduct charges that he denies.
Earlier this month, Nissan appointed a new chief executive and days later Renault CEO Thierry Bollore -- who had been appointed under Ghosn -- was pushed out, to be replaced on an interim basis by Renault finance director Clotilde Delbos.
Issuing its quarterly results on Friday, Renault revised downwards its forecasts for the growth of the global auto market, saying it expected a year-on-year decline in 2019 of around 4%, compared to around 3% previously.
In its profit warning last week, Renault had said sales were likely to drop between 3% and 4% this year, compared with its previous forecast for a similar outcome to 2018. 

The company also said last week its operating margin was set to come in at 5%, versus a previous 6% goal, as it struggles to keep a lid on research and development costs.

  Barclays   (LON:BARC) upheld its profitability targets for 2019 and 2020, despite taking a 1.4 billion pound ($1.81 billion) charge for PPI mis-selling that pushed it to a loss of 292 million pounds in the quarter.
Advertising group WPP PLC (LON:WPP) said revenue from continuing operations rose 5.2% in the third quarter to 3.29 billion pounds, although the gain was a more modest 1.9% when adjusted for currency swings.
The group, which was profoundly shaken by the disorderly exit of long-standing CEO Martin Sorrell last year, said all of its geographical regions improved compared with the first half, although the adjusted revenue the key North American market was still down 3.5% on the year.
Restructuring under new chief executive Mark Read has brought net debt down to 4.48 billion from 5.10 billion a year ago. That will fall further when the company books an expected 3.1 billion from the sale of a 60% stake in market research group Kantar, which shareholders approved on Thursday.

Operating income at 5.08 billion pounds was up 4.2% from a year earlier. Earnings per share of -1.7 pence were below forecasts for 6p, while revenue of 5.54 billion pounds was comfortably ahead of the 5.2 billion consensus.
The bank said it’s still aiming for a return on tangible equity of over 9% this year and over 10% for 2020, but it warned that “global macroeconomic uncertainty and the current low interest rate environment” make it “more challenging to achieve these targets, particularly with respect to 2020.”


 Glencore  (LON:GLEN) shaved its production forecasts for zinc and copper. It now expects to produce about 1.01 million tons of copper this year from its non-African business, compared to an earlier forecast of about 1.025 million tons.
It also cut its zinc output forecast for this year by 7% to 1.11 milion tons.
Coal production rose 8% to 1.04 million tons year-to-date thanks mainly to last year’s acquisitions.

Tesla is also in the process of obtaining a key certification needed to sell China-made cars in the country, it told local media, though it is unclear when the government will grant it sales clearance.
The U.S.-made Model 3 has so far fared well in China, the world's biggest car market. Sales likely surged more than three fold to 10,542 cars in the quarter ended Sept. 30, according to research firm LMC Automotive.

In its first earnings report since it went public in September, Budweiser announced that its profits fell 22% in the third quarter. Volumes dropped 6.5% during the quarter due to “softness“ in its nightlife channel in China. 
Hong Kong’s economy has been hit by anti-government protests and civil unrest this year, while the ongoing U.S.-China trade war also weighed. 
“We are confident that our strong commercial plans, unparalleled brand portfolio, robust route-to-market and, most importantly, our talented people, position us well to deliver long-term sustainable growth in Asia-Pacific,” the company’s chief executive Jan Craps said.
Budweiser’s share prices were down 2.0% at HK$29.900 as of 1:14 AM ET (05:14 GMT). "

Lee returned to court Friday to answer bribery charges that could land him in jail, only to sit through a lecture about how he can better run Korea’s largest company.
Lee should study how U.S. companies establish systems to prevent crime and take inspiration from how Israeli businesses drive innovation through reform, said Chung June Young, the judge presiding over the case. The heir apparent to the world’s largest maker of smartphones and chips listened attentively but didn’t take the stand. Dressed in a somber black suit with a gray tie, the tech mogul leaned toward the podium as the judge delivered his comments to a packed courtroom in Seoul.
Three years after explosive allegations of graft and corruption brought down the government of Asia’s fourth-largest economy, South Korea’s chaebol culture has again come under the microscope. The retrial of Korea’s best-known billionaire over expanded corruption charges reboots a landmark case that led to the impeachment of then-president Park Geun-hye and inflamed popular anger over the power of Korean conglomerates, also known as chaebols. The charges, which Samsung and Lee have previously denied, threaten to potentially throw Lee back in jail.
“If only Samsung’s internal compliance system was such that even the company’s leader would fear it, then not only the defendant but also President Park and Choi Seo-won could not have thought of the crime,” the judge said, referring to a confidante pf Park’s who became central to the case. “As the head of a company representing our country, I hope you will feel responsible and humbly accept the results of this trial.”
The latest chapter in the legal drama is kicking off at a sensitive time for the half-century-old tech behemoth. Samsung is confronting heightened uncertainty from a lingering trade war between the U.S. and China as well as a spat between South Korea and Japan, both of which complicate its outlook and supply chain. A rising tide of technology like fifth-generation mobile networks and artificial intelligence is also opening up new opportunities for eager Chinese rivals, who are spending lavishly to catch up to Samsung and its cash-cow businesses of semiconductor and display manufacturing.

The appeals court that decided to release Lee in 2018 from jail, where he’d spent about a year after his initial arrest, will decide his final sentence over the course of the next few months. Prosecutors and Lee’s attorneys will fight over whether there was a succession plan in place for Samsung -- a key point that prosecutors say was a motivation behind the alleged bribes. Lee’s lawyer said he will mainly focus on the extent of defendants’ sentences.
Unless new evidence emerges during the retrial, the appeals court is expected to rule in line with the decision of Korea’s Supreme Court, which found that Lee had used three horses and additional funds, via an intermediary, to bribe President Park while seeking political support for his succession as Samsung chief. This would mean altering Lee’s presently suspended prison sentence.
The total amount of alleged bribery determined by the top court, including all three equines, carries a minimum sentence of five years, which cannot be suspended in the same way that Lee’s existing sentence has been. Media coverage in Korea, however, has centered on Article 53 of the Korean Criminal Act, which stipulates there could be a discretionary mitigation of the punishment “when there are extenuating circumstances.” In Lee’s case, the damage to Samsung -- crucial as it is to Korea’s economy -- could be presented as grounds to keep him out of prison.
Even in the event of an unfavorable ruling, the 51-year-old Samsung scion would still be able to appeal to the Supreme Court one more time, which could take another year. To avoid such a protracted legal battle, people in and out of Samsung have expressed hope that the court may reduce the punishment and slash the sentence to a suspended 30-month term.
Samsung Billionaire Heir to Cede Board Seat Before Legal Probe
Samsung, the world’s largest memory chip and smartphone maker, has an army of senior managers who can run its day-to-day operations, according to Park Ju-gun, president at corporate research firm CEOScore. Lee could continue his management even in prison and come back as a leader when he’s out, emulating the example of his chaebol peers including SK Group chairman Chey Tae-won and CJ Group chairman Lee Jay-hyun, who today are active leaders of their conglomerates in spite of having spent years in jail.
Under pressure, Lee gave up on extending his three-year term on the Samsung board, which is set to expire on Saturday. Although he’s keeping his title as vice chairman, it will be the board that drives overall management decisions, according to people familiar with the matter. Board Chairman Lee Sang-hoon and Samsung President Chung Hyun-ho -- who’s managing Samsung’s business task force and is known to be an ally of Lee’s -- are likely to take the lead in management in the absence of the heir."

The suspension follows an order from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration earlier this month for aircraft operators to inspect older Boeing 737 NGs for structural cracks.
Boeing on Oct. 11 said inspections of 810 of the planes globally had led to 38 requiring repair.
South Korea said it found nine planes with cracks among 42 planes examined.
Among the nine grounded planes are five operated by Korean Air Lines (KS:003490), according to the transport ministry.
The 737 NG is the third-generation 737 and version before the now-grounded 737 MAX, which is not impacted by the cracking issue.
A Korean Air spokesman said the carrier has 18 737 NG aircraft and will replace the five short-range airplanes with other jets."

To reduce net emissions of carbon to zero, the world would have to eradicate the equivalent of 53.5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide a year, according to the report, which identified renewable energy, electric vehicles, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and biofuels as the key technologies that could help meet the target.
Carbon emissions from fossil fuels hit a record last year, but estimates vary of how much it would cost to meet the Paris target of keeping the global temperature rise to within 2 degrees. The International Renewable Energy Agency says $750 billion a year is needed in renewables over a decade. United Nations scientists say $300 billion spent on reclaiming degraded land could offset emissions to buy time to deploy zero-carbon technologies.
Here are Morgan Stanley’s estimates for the five key technology areas and some of the 33 companies it says are set to benefit.
Renewables
Renewable power generation will require $14 trillion by 2050, including investments in energy storage.Renewables would need to deliver about 80% of global power by then, up from 37% today, meaning an additional 11,000 gigawatts of capacity, excluding hydro-power.Solar energy’s rapidly falling cost will make it the fastest-growing renewable technology over the coming decade with a 13% compound annual growth rate.Stocks that could benefit include: CGN New Energy Holdings Co., China Resources Power Holdings Co. and China Suntien Green Energy Co.,  NextEra Energy Inc  (NYSE:NEE).Electric vehicles
With passenger cars currently pumping out about 7% of greenhouse gas emissions, some $11 trillion will be needed to build factories, expand power capacity and develop the batteries and infrastructure needed to switch to electric vehicles.With increased investment, annual EV sales could grow from 1.3 million units in 2018 to 23.2 million in 2030, lifting the total number of electric vehicles to 113 million by 2030 and 924 million by 2050.Some of the companies to watch: Beijing Easpring Material Technology Co., Rohm Co., Daimler and Panasonic Corp.Carbon capture and storage
Almost $2.5 trillion would be needed for technologies that capture carbon and store it.While it currently costs about $700 million to capture a million tons of carbon a year, the cost of building CCS plants is expected to drop 30% by 2050.With more than 200,000 megawatts of new coal-fired generation capacity under construction, CCS is the only option to offset the emissions of these plants, Morgan Stanley says.The bank’s top picks include  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP) SA and Bloom Energy Corp.Hydrogen
About $5.4 trillion is needed for electrolyzers to make the gas, which can help provide clean fuel for power generation, industrial processes, vehicles and heating.In addition, $13 trillion would be required to increase renewable energy capacity to power the plants.Another $1 trillion would be needed for storage, with additional investment for transportation and distribution.Leading players include:  Johnson Matthey  (LON:JMAT) Plc and Air Liquide SA.Biofuels
Almost $2.7 trillion should go into biofuels like ethanol, which are currently mixed with petroleum products but will spread eventually to areas such as aviation.About 4% of global transportation fuel will be biofuel in 2030.Ethanol, the most-used biofuel at the moment will grow at about 3% a year, while a type of biodiesel called hydrotreated vegetable oil will achieve must faster growth, quadrupling production by 2030.Companies invloved include Neste Corporation and Sao Martinho SA.(Adds company names throughout)"
1142,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 11:05PM ET</span>","Citi names Fraser as president, putting her in line to be first female CEO","By Imani Moise and Sumeet Chatterjee
(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) has promoted Jane Fraser to head of its global consumer bank and president, putting her in a position eventually to become the first female chief executive of the U.S. bank.
Fraser is replacing Stephen Bird as head of the consumer business, the bank said in a statement on Thursday, adding Bird is leaving Citi after more than 20 years to pursue an external opportunity.
Citi's current CEO, Michael Corbat, said the move did not suggest an imminent change at the top of the bank.
However, promoting someone into a president role typically means that person is being groomed for the top spot. That position has been vacant since former head of Citi institutional clients group, Jamie Forese, left the bank earlier this year.
""I remain committed to leading our firm in the coming years and look forward to working even more closely with Jane in her new roles,"" Corbat said in the statement.
Fraser, 52, has been seen as a rising star on Wall Street, and was recently reported to be among the candidates  Wells Fargo  & Co's (N:WFC) board was considering for its next CEO. That bank settled on another executive.
    A 15-years veteran at Citi, who first joined to run client strategy in the investment bank, Fraser had been running the bank's Latin America business, including its Citibanamex division in Mexico, for the past few years.
She ran Citi's private bank and its troubled mortgage business, and is credited internally with helping the bank recover after the financial crisis, when it had to take $45 billion in taxpayer funds to survive.
    Before then, Fraser was a McKinsey consultant, and has spent much of her career hopping between countries and regions developing a global approach to business strategy.
She will be succeeded in Latin America by Ernesto Torres Cantu, who had been CEO of Citibanamex.
Bird, the outgoing Citi global consumer business head, was last month reported to be one of the shortlisted external candidates for the role of  HSBC Holdings  Plc's (L:HSBA) chief executive.
A HSBC spokesman in Hong Kong declined to comment on the move on Friday.
HSBC, which makes more than 80% of its profit in Asia, began a search for a new chief executive in August after ousting John Flint following just 18 months in that role. The bank appointed its global commercial banking unit head Noel Quinn as interim CEO.
HSBC Chairman Mark Tucker said in August that the search for a new chief executive, which will include both internal and external candidates, could take up to a year. 
London-headquartered HSBC will report its third-quarterly results on Monday.
Before becoming head of global consumer banking at Citi, Bird was chief executive of the U.S. bank's Asia Pacific business, responsible for all of Citi's consumer and institutional businesses across 17 markets in the region.

Prior to joining Citi in 1998 in Singapore as the bank's Asia Pacific head for operations and technology, Bird - who was also a Citi executive management team member - held senior management positions in GE Capital and British Steel in the U.K.

SAN FRANCISCO/BENGALURU (Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) posted worse-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit on Thursday, plagued by technical issues that hurt its advertising, and unusually low demand over the summer, sending its shares down about 20%.
Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal said the company's ad platform encountered bugs, or glitches, that hindered its ability to target ads and share data with partners.
""These issues were in our control and we will work to do better,"" said Segal on a call with analysts.
Twitter's revenue rose 9% from a year earlier, but fell short of Wall Street expectations as total advertising revenue missed estimates.
Twitter's efforts to clean up abusive content and make the platform more user-friendly appear to have driven up use, addressing longstanding concerns about growth of customers, and Twitter has also rolled out new video ad products that attract brands.
The ad problems were, however, a major, unexpected issue and come as the holiday buying season, the most important for ads, gets underway. Twitter cut its fourth-quarter revenue forecast to below Wall Street estimates.
Twitter said that it was working on a total fix for the ad problems but that it was not yet in place. Analysts tracking Twitter said the company's financials would take at least a few more quarters to stabilize, with a quick turnaround looking increasingly unlikely.
""Not expecting a quick rebound in Twitter's financials for at least a few quarters, as shortfall likely will carry into 2020,"" said analyst Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners.
On the conference call with analysts, Segal said Twitter had turned off some ad settings, which limited how the company could target ads to people or show advertisers how effective their ads were. It acted after finding two bugs that inadvertently shared certain data even if users opted out of sharing it.
""So we stopped doing that and although we're working on remediation, there isn't remediation yet in place and so the effects of that will continue into Q4,"" said Segal.
Twitter expects revenue in the fourth-quarter, which will include Black Friday and the December holidays, to be between $940 million and $1.01 billion. Wall Street on average expects $1.06 billion.
The social media platform did manage to record a rise in daily users who see ads on the site, beating analyst estimates.
Twitter has stopped disclosing its monthly active users figures, instead reporting monetizable daily active usage (mDAU), a metric it created to measure users exposed on a daily basis to advertising through the site or Twitter applications that are able to show ads.
Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said growth in mDAU was driven by product improvements, including making the site easier to navigate and more proactively identifying abusive content to remove.
The company's average mDAU hit 145 million, beating analyst expectations of 141 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. This alternative metric was up 17% year-over-year.
In July, Twitter launched a more personalized desktop Twitter.com as part of a plan to make the platform better for conversations. It has also experimented with the ability to follow topics and has recently expanded testing for a feature to hide replies.
Recently, the company made a six-second video bidding available for global advertisers and it has continued to expand its live and on-demand video partnerships, including deals with NBC Olympics and Eurosport for coverage of the 2020 Tokyo Games.
Third-quarter net income was $37 million, or $0.05 per share. In the same period last year, the firm reported net income of $789 million, or $106 million when adjusted to exclude certain items.
Analysts had expected net income of $161.5 million.
Total operating expenses, including cost of revenue, rose by 17% year-over-year to $780 million, partly due to plans to hire more employees.
Twitter shares closed down 20.8%."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Democrats on the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee on Thursday introduced legislation to mandate numerous aviation safety recommendations in the wake of two fatal Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people and led to the plane's grounding in March.
Senator Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the committee, and Senator Tammy Duckworth introduced the measure that would require the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to address automation in the cockpit and assumptions about pilot response.
""We want the FAA to develop tools and methodologies here ... and we want this to be considered in the design certification process,"" Cantwell said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. ""This is the next stage of aviation safety.""
The bill's introduction comes days before Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg is set to testify on Tuesday before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee on the fatal crashes.
An FAA spokesman declined to comment on the bill but FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said on Tuesday that the FAA and airplane manufacturers need to better scrutinize the interface between pilots and machines. He added the FAA and manufacturers must improve processes to ensure ""we don't have fragmented communications"" on certification.
Congress and independent panels have been looking at the performance of a key anti-stall safety system tied to the two fatal crashes known as MCAS. Boeing is making a series of safeguards to the system as part of its effort to get the plane airborne again, which could come by the end of 2019.
The bill would order the FAA to require Boeing to ensure the 737 MAX system safety assessments that ""assumed immediate and appropriate pilot corrective actions in response to uncommanded flight control inputs, from systems such as the MCAS, consider the effect of all possible flight deck alerts and indications on pilot recognition and response.""
It would also require Boeing to incorporate design enhancements -- including flight deck alerts and indications -- including ""pilot procedures, and training requirements, where needed, to minimize the potential for and safety impact of pilot actions that are inconsistent with manufacturer assumptions.""
Boeing did not immediately comment.
The bill would direct the FAA to adopt recommendations made by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the Transportation Department's Inspector General and ICAO.
The NTSB in September said the FAA should address assumptions Boeing made in designing software systems to react to emergencies, and decide whether systems should be revised to account for varying pilot reactions to cockpit alarms.
The bill would also create an FAA Center of Excellence dedicated to studying flight automation and human factors in commercial aircraft."

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday forecast revenue and profit for the holiday quarter below expectations, as it faces fierce competition and rising costs from its plan to speed up delivery times globally.
Shares fell 7%, as revenue growth for the company's lucrative cloud computing business also slowed down in the third quarter, missing analysts' estimates. Amazon beat expectations on overall third-quarter revenue, posting a sales rise of 24% to $70 billion.
The news underscores the big investment Amazon is making to cut delivery times to one day for its Prime loyalty members, a way to outmaneuver rivals such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc that have marketed two-day shipping without subscription fees.
Costs for that program will nearly double to $1.5 billion during the holiday season, from what Amazon spent on one-day delivery during the second quarter, the company's Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with analysts.
Expenses rose because the company has to move inventory closer to customers and beef up its last-mile transportation footprint to make the plan work, Olsavsky said. The company also is giving up the fees that shoppers used to pay for one-day shipping and is still learning what the long-term cost structure of the program will be, he said.
Amazon's rising headcount reflects its delivery ambitions. It hired nearly 100,000 full and part-time workers in the third quarter, bringing its staff size to over 400,000 in the United States and 750,000 globally.
""By and away the biggest driver this time is the people that we're adding for fulfillment and transportation roles,"" Olsavsky said.
Still, Amazon is betting that fast shipping will spark sales growth, a strategy that over years has helped it become the world's largest online retailer.
""Amazon will not necessarily be spooked by the increase in costs,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of research firm GlobalData Retail. ""Indeed, it sees the higher shipping expense as an investment in the Prime platform and as a way to retain the loyalty of its shoppers.""
Amazon said earlier this year that it now delivers some 10% of its 100 million-plus Prime-eligible goods in one day in the United States. The Seattle-based company did not provide an updated number on Thursday.
DARKENING CLOUD?
Weak holiday quarter guidance has added to worries that the U.S.-China trade spat may be hurting the U.S. retail industry, and that one-day shipping might not be as big a boost as Amazon anticipates.
There was ""hope that this investment would lead to a further revenue acceleration in the holiday quarter, whereas the company has guided to the opposite,"" said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell.
Holiday sales typically generate a large share of retailers' revenue and profit. Amazon's forecast of $80.0 billion to $86.5 billion in sales came short of $87.4 billion that analysts were expecting, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company also said it expects holiday-quarter operating income to be between $1.2 billion and $2.9 billion, while analysts were expecting $4.19 billion, according to research firm FactSet.
Olsavsky attributed some of the weakness to the timing of events outside the United States, which pushed revenue into the third quarter. For instance, the company saw customers in Japan pre-order goods before a rise in consumption tax went into effect on Oct. 1, he said.
Olsavsky declined to comment to reporters on regulatory scrutiny the company is facing over alleged foul play with merchants on its platform, saying later that the company only succeeds if its sellers succeed. Sales such as fulfillment services for merchants, as well as ad and other sales to merchants, beat analysts' estimates in the third quarter.
Olsavsky also downplayed concerns about a slowdown in growth for one of the company's profit centers, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The unit, which handles data storage and computing operations for other enterprises, increased revenue 35% to $9.0 billion, the second quarter in a row in which its rate of growth was under 40%.
""It's hard to predict the pace of some of the sales cycles and the enterprise migrations that companies are willing to make,"" he said. ""But we are having great success, and we're adding a lot (to) the sales force.""
Not all analysts saw a risk-free future, particularly as the unit's operating expenses jumped 46% to $6.7 billion in the third quarter. Operating income was $2.3 billion.
""The 'problem' is spending,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. There is ""a lot of investment in AWS infrastructure... The company makes these investments without really explaining them in detail, and investors are left on their own trying to figure out when Amazon will start delivering outsized profits again."""

(Reuters) - Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's chief financial officer on Thursday said costs for its one-day shipping program will spike to around $1.5 billion during the holiday season as the online retailer speeds up free delivery to woo shoppers and fend off rivals like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT)
Amazon's fourth-quarter cost for one-day shipping will be nearly double the $800 million the company spent during the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters. The company began rolling out free one-day delivery with no minimum purchase early in the second quarter. 
Carriers like  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) charge more for faster delivery, but that is only one component of the cost increase at Amazon, which ships around 10 billion packages per year.
Another is ""foregone shipping revenue,"" Olsavsky said.
""Now that it is free, people don't pay to get product in one day,"" he said. Before, ""you had to pay an additional fee to get one day or faster"" shipping. 
Logistics experts, who noted that volumes surge during the holiday season, took Amazon's shipping cost forecast in stride.
""That is to be expected,"" said ShipMatrix founder Satish Jindel, who added that Amazon saw a similar spike in costs when it rolled out free two-day shipping for Prime members in 2005.
Amazon's volume increases 50-60% in the fourth quarter versus the second quarter, and more packages mean higher costs, Jindel said.
Based on the guidance and historical trends, Amazon's fourth-quarter shipping costs ""will easily surpass $10 billion, perhaps coming close to $11 billion,"" said Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of Logistics Trends & Insights.
That will be felt on Amazon's bottom line, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note. 
""Significant investments tied to the rollout of one-day shipping will depress Q4 profits,"" Sebastian wrote.
Olsavsky's comments came on the heels of Amazon's third-quarter earnings report, where the company said overall shipping costs surged 46% in the third quarter. 
Amazon spent $9.61 billion on shipping in the third quarter, up from $6.57 billion the year earlier.
""Customers love the transition of Prime from two days to one day — they've already ordered billions of items with free one-day delivery this year. It's a big investment, and it's the right long-term decision for customers,"" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement. 
Amazon recently made low-cost items like deodorant, bars of soap and dental floss eligible for free shipping - contributing to its costs.
""Whether all the extra investment will be worth it in the end is perhaps open to question, especially given the lacklustre sales guidance for next quarter,"" said  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Nicholas Hyett. 
Meanwhile, Amazon's faster shipping push is boosting the Next Day delivery business at UPS.

HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) -  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA) and  Standard Chartered  Plc (L:STAN) are set to show early signs of strain from anti-government protests in Hong Kong, the single-biggest profit center for the two banks, when they report quarterly earnings next week.
Five months of political turmoil in the Chinese-ruled territory are set to weigh on the two London-headquartered lenders' credit growth and asset quality in the near to medium term, people with knowledge of the matter said. 
HSBC will report its third-quarter earnings on Monday, and StanChart on Wednesday. 
Hong Kong accounted for 52% of HSBC's profit before tax in the first-half of this year, while it brought in a third of StanChart's income in the same period, as per the banks' financial filings.
The two, which were already facing uncertainty created by the bruising U.S.-China trade war, lower interest rates and Brexit, flagged the potential risks posed by the protests in their half-yearly earnings reports published in August.
Both have now started seeing the impact of the protests on their retail and commercial banking businesses in the last couple of months, albeit in a small way, said the people with knowledge of the matter, declining to be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media.
The retail banking business of the lenders are set to take a hit from sluggish demand for wealth management products, mainly insurance, due to a sharp drop in mainland visitors who are big buyers of foreign currency-denominated products, they said.
With the city's all important tourism and retail sectors hit by the protests and many businesses forced to close, the banks' commercial banking revenues are also expected to see a slowdown in growth in the medium-term, the people said.
""Even credit card transactions, which are a decent source of fee income, are down 15% to 30% across major banks here in the last two months as all major retail markets are closed on most weekends,"" said one of the people.
""The bigger worry is the asset quality, which probably will kick in with a lag of couple of quarters and as bankruptcy filings rise.""
Bankruptcy petitions presented by debtors in Hong Kong rose by nearly a fifth in the September quarter of this year to 1,945 from the same period a year earlier, according to government data.
Two separate persons close to the lenders, however, said it might be too early for the disruption to have had a material impact on the banks' overall earnings.
The banks, along with the government, are also rolling out supporting measures for the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in a bid to lighten the burden of the protests on the wider corporate sector and the economy.
""HSBC was the first bank to announce measures ... to support SMEs in Hong Kong,"" the bank said, referring to initiatives including six-month interest rebate on loans under two government SME loan schemes announced in August. 
HSBC did not comment on the impact to earnings from the measures. StanChart, which is also among banks in Hong Kong that have unveiled such initiatives, declined to comment.
HSBC is expected to post a drop of 11% in its third-quarter pre-tax profit to $5.3 billion, according to average analysts' estimates compiled by the bank. StanChart's quarterly profit forecast was not yet available.
'STRESS TESTS' 
Hong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade as increasingly violent protests continue.
Underscoring concerns about the outlook for corporate profits, both HSBC and StanChart have started conducting ""stress tests"" on some of their local clients, the people said.
""Given the huge importance of the Hong Kong market to HSBC's profitability, should the current protests continue, it will inevitably drag on earnings,"" said Ali Miremadi, investment director at GAM, who currently does not hold the lender's stock.
The protests have also resulted in global banks, especially HSBC, given its large presence in China and Hong Kong, having to undertake a delicate balancing act as a result of heightened scrutiny of their stances on the unrest.
Internally, senior managers at HSBC have been informally told to be very sensitive in talking about or dealing with the team on issues related to the protests, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Beijing has long used different methods to punish foreign corporations that offend it.
""HSBC has absolutely no option but to go along with the government. Anything different would risk their licence to operate. Just look at what has happened to the NBA after a single tweet,"" Miremadi of GAM said.
The National Basketball Association (NBA) was plunged into controversy earlier this month after Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy demonstrators. 

The incident has already cost the league substantial financial losses in China, a market worth an estimated $4 billion for the league.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Luxury retailer Barneys New York Inc is close to being sold to licensing firm Authentic Brands Group LLC after a competing bid from a trade show executive failed to qualify for a bankruptcy auction, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Authentic Brands had agreed with Barneys to be its so-called stalking horse buyer, setting the floor for other offers. Now that a bid from Israeli businessman Samuel Ben-Avraham has failed, Barneys plans to cancel an auction scheduled for Monday, the people said.
Barneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ben-Avraham, who owns fashion trade shows and was a co-founder of streetwear retailer Kith, declined to comment.
An eleventh-hour bidder may still show up, the sources said, asking not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
Authentic Brands' $271 million offer for Barneys is expected to close on Oct. 31, the brand development company said in a prepared statement. Its plan for Barneys includes shops within existing Saks Fifth Avenue locations.
""We look forward to proceeding with our plans for Barneys as we continue the closing process,"" Authentic Brands said. ""Our goal is to preserve and build upon Barneys' legacy and evolve it for the future.""
Authentic Brands, which owns Nine West and Juicy Couture, will also keep certain Barneys brick-and-mortar locations open depending on negotiations with landlords.
A cultural touchstone for generations of New Yorkers and followers of fashion, Barneys faced the possibility of having to wind down its business altogether.
The retailer filed for bankruptcy in August citing rent hikes as a factor. The chain is one of the most high-profile victims of distress in brick-and-mortar retail, which face significant competition from e-commerce websites."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is investigating whether the popular heartburn drug Zantac causes carcinogens to form in the bodies of users, in an effort to fully understand the risks posed by the already recalled drug, the agency's spokesman said on Thursday.
The issue of whether ranitidine, commonly known as Zantac, causes levels of the probable carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) to rise in users' bodies has been raised previously by Valisure, an online pharmacy that originally flagged the potential contamination of ranitidine to the FDA.
Zantac, sold over-the-counter in the United States by French drugmaker Sanofi SA (PA:SASY), and some of its generic versions, have been recalled due to possible NDMA contamination of pills that had not yet been consumed. The FDA said earlier this month it found unacceptable levels of NDMA in drugs containing ranitidine.
But FDA spokesman Jeremy Kahn said the regulator is now ""working to understand what happens to NDMA levels in the body, after ranitidine has been exposed to acid in the stomach.""
Zantac has been on the market for more than 35 years and was originally sold by Glaxo Holdings Ltd, now a part of GlaxoSmithKline PLC. (L:GSK) At one point it was the top-selling drug in the world.
Representatives of GSK and Sanofi were not immediately available for comment.
Valisure's Chief Executive David Light said it was important that the FDA is investigating the issue because the company's data suggests the NDMA levels that can be formed in the body ""are many magnitudes of order higher than what's been talked about in the contamination.""
""This is one of the main red flags we've raised the whole time -- not just contamination but the fact that this is happening in the human body,"" Light said.
Sanofi said last week it would recall the drug in the United States and Canada. Other drugmakers including GlaxoSmithKline and  Novartis  (S:NOVN) have recalled or halted distribution of their versions of the drug.
Retailers including Walmart Inc (N:WMT), CVS Health Corp (N:CVS), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA) and  Rite Aid Corp  (N:RAD) have stopped selling ranitidine.
The FDA said on Wednesday that early tests of alternatives to Zantac such as Pepcid, Tagamet, Nexium, Prevacid and Prilosec have not been found to contain NDMA.
NDMA had previously been found in some blood pressure medicines from a class of drugs known as angiotensin II receptor blockers. Those impurities are believed to have been introduced by recent changes in the manufacturing process."

Virgin also said that it had received approval from Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) to buy back the 35% of Velocity that it does not already own from private equity group Affinity Equity Partners for A$700 million ($477.33 million).
The purchase, announced last month, will give Virgin greater control over a division that generates positive cashflow as the airline seeks to boost revenue after reporting its seventh consecutive annual loss.
Velocity is Australia's second-largest airline loyalty programme, behind that of rival Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN), with 9.8 million members as of June 30.
Virgin said the U.S.-dollar denominated five-year notes were priced on Thursday, New York time, and were due to be settled on Nov. 7. It did not give details of the pricing.
IFR News reported the launch was increased from a planned $400 million to $425 million, priced at 8.125%."

Hotel occupancy rates are at an all-time high, one of the most visible signs that Singapore is gaining as unrest deters visitors to Hong Kong. There’s also been a pick up in luxury home sales, gold storage and foreign currency deposits -- all of which could increase substantially depending on how long the protests drag on.
While the estimated $4 billion that moved over to Singapore from April to August is “very miniscule” compared with Hong Kong’s $1.7 trillion in total deposits, the “trend will likely continue as the situation worsens in Hong Kong,” said Ju Ye Lee, a Singapore-based economist with Maybank Kim Eng Securities Pte Ltd.
The extra cash is welcome news for Singapore, whose economy is slowly slipping toward a recession as speculation grows that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will announce an election well before one is due in April 2021. This month he said Singapore would be “lucky” to see positive economic growth in 2019 as exports continue to slump.
“Whenever there is political instability in the region, money always flows into Singapore,” said Bilveer Singh, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore who wrote a book on the country’s politics. “Politically, it makes the government look very good, like they are the ones creating political stability for the world, that they are the good guys. Even if it will have a minimal impact on the economy the government will say it has done well.”
Downplaying Gains
So far, the government has downplayed any gains. Indranee Rajah, a minister in the Prime Minister’s Office, said she hasn’t seen any “significant shifts yet” in terms of economic benefits.
“We feel very much for Hong Kong,” Rajah said in an interview. “We hope they will be able to resolve their situation.”
Some capital has moved to Singapore, although there hasn’t been a flood of inflows from the former British colony, according to Singapore’s central bank. The city state’s banks have seen an uptick in those inquiring about how to re-allocate assets, which is reasonable to expect, Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said in an interview Tuesday.
It may be only a matter of time before more business heads to Singapore. Some 23% of companies with an office in Hong Kong are considering moving business functions from the city, and nine in 10 of those see Singapore as the best option, according to a poll of 120 companies by the American Chamber of Commerce.
Already, Singapore’s Swissotel The Stamford is busier than usual. Bookings have increased compared with the same period last year, according to Marcus Hanna, general manager of the Swissotel as well as Fairmont Singapore. He noted the company was also getting more inquiries looking to move meetings over to Singapore from Hong Kong.
Service providers to some of Asia’s wealthiest families say they are fielding a rising number of calls about shifting from Hong Kong, with some already moving money to Singapore-based banks.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). analysts said this month the debate on Hong Kong outflows “will remain active” after modest withdrawals so far.
‘Untenable to Stay’
“You have expats who have been there for a long, long time with families and those are the ones who are first in line to move,” said Hong Kong-based global affairs analyst Michael Bociurkiw. “They want to stay in the region but more and more they find it untenable to stay in Hong Kong, so you’re going to see a talent train” to Singapore.
Singapore has seen demand for gold storage rise in recent months, according to J. Rotbart & Co., which helps customers buy, store and transport precious metals. The bullion house, which services high net-worth individuals from Hong Kong, saw requests skew to around 75% for Singapore and 10% for Hong Kong, compared with a split of about 50-35 previously.
Lagging investment in Hong Kong has also helped spur on hotel transactions in Singapore, which are set to close out the year at a record high S$2.5 billion ($1.8 billion) with a number of deals now in the pipeline, according to a report released last month by Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL). According to data from Colliers International Group Inc., the Hong Kong protests may have helped edge luxury residential sales in Singapore to their highest levels since 2008 amid sudden interest from Chinese nationals looking for an alternative market.
“Recent events in Hong Kong have also induced demand into other gateway markets, with Singapore being seen as one of the key beneficiaries,” the JLL report states.
One reason for the shift in investment to Singapore is its similarities to Hong Kong as a developed financial hub. With a firm footing on legal and regulatory issues, the city-state has also earned a reputation as a safe haven, said Song Seng Wun, a private banking economist with CIMB Bank.
“This is when Singapore’s neutrality and political stability comes in pretty handy,” he said. “People being people, they go where they feel most secure. It’s nice and safe here, whether it is for your physical health or monetary health.”"

(Reuters) - Three major U.S. retailers, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT), are removing all 22-ounce bottles of Johnson & Johnson's baby powder from their stores, following the healthcare conglomerate's recall last week of some bottles due to possible asbestos contamination.
CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) said on Thursday it would remove the bottles from its online store as well, out of caution and to prevent customer confusion. The pharmacy chain said all other sizes of the talc would remain on its shelves.
Rite Aid had informed its stores to pull all 22-ounce bottles of Johnson's Baby Powder from shelves on Oct. 18 and store them in a secure location, company spokesman Chris Savarese said. ""Additionally, we've applied a point of sale system block for this product to prevent it from being sold.""
Late Thursday, CNBC reported https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/24/cvs-pulls-all-jj-22-ounce-baby-powder-from-shelves-after-fda-finds-sub-trace-levels-of-asbestos.html that Walmart, the world's largest retailer, had also removed and blocked all of the recalled baby powder. The company did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
J&J (NYSE:JNJ), which is facing thousands of lawsuits over a variety of products, said last week it was recalling around 33,000 bottles of baby powder in the United States after U.S. health regulators found trace amounts of asbestos in samples taken from a bottle purchased online.
The move marked the first time J&J recalled its iconic baby powder for possible asbestos contamination, and the first time U.S. regulators announced a finding of asbestos in the product.
Asbestos is a known carcinogen that has been linked to deadly mesothelioma.
The voluntary recall was limited to one lot of Johnson's Baby Powder produced and shipped in the United States in 2018, J&J had said. The company added that testing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as recently as a month ago found no asbestos in their talc.
""It's not important at all in terms of the dollar figure to either CVS or J&J. What it tells you is that retailers are being extra cautious with how they are dealing with J&J's voluntary recall,"" Jefferies healthcare analyst Jared Holz said.
Commenting on CVS's move, J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz said, ""It's temporary ... They are doing it storewide because they don't have the resources to go through at the store level and check all the SKUs (stock keeping units), check all the lot numbers.""
Other retailers are expected to remove the product from their shelves as they want to avoid liability, said Eric Schiffer, chief executive officer of private equity firm Patriarch Organization.
""It wouldn't surprise me to see Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other online retailers do the same,"" he added.
J&J has known for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc, Reuters reported last year. Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos.
Company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it, while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public, Reuters found.

J&J has repeatedly said that its talc products are safe, and that decades of studies have shown them to be asbestos-free and that they do not cause cancer.

1156,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 06:39PM ET</span>",Intel data center rebound eases U.S.-China trade war worries,"By Munsif Vengattil and Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) on Thursday beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue and profit and raised its full-year revenue forecast, powered by sales to data centers and easing concerns about slowing demand during the U.S.-China trade war.
The chipmaker's shares rose 3.5% to $54.08 in extended trading.
The results came as a relief to the industry after dour forecasts from major chipmakers Texas Instruments Inc (O:TXN) and  Xilinx Inc  (O:XLNX) earlier this week.
After years of acquisitions outside its core area of processing chips under previous leaders, Intel under Chief Executive Bob Swan has reined in spending, slowing investments in areas like memory chips and shedding struggling businesses.
Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, has doubled down on its core markets such as personal computers and data centers, both of which beat analysts' third-quarter expectations.
Chief Financial Officer George Davis said Intel anticipated most of the year's data center spending would come in the second half because many customers bought chips in 2018 and took time to install them.
""Data center came back much more strongly than even we anticipated this quarter,"" Davis said in an interview. ""Cloud customers actually grew year over year, and last year was an extraordinary year.""
Cascend Securities analyst Eric Ross said Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TW:2330), which supplies some of Intel's rivals, had also forecast strong data center demand, suggesting a broader market recovery.
""We've finally seen another major semiconductor company that sees the data center returning as a major driver, as we've seen in our measurements, and the electronics supply chain sees,"" he said.
Intel has also been contending with a U.S.-China trade war that led to tariffs on its chips. About $200 million of Intel's third-quarter revenue came from Chinese data center owners purchasing chips sooner than they otherwise would have, likely out of trade concerns, Davis said.
But analyst Kinngai Chan of Summit Insights Group said he suspected much more of Intel's results were driven by sped-up buying because of tariffs and that could slow sales during the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020.
""We think this could result in the supply chain inventory digestion"" as Intel's customers work through the chips they have bought, he said.
Intel, which is racing against rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co to make smaller chips, said the move to the newer process, called 10-nanometer, was on track and it would have its next-generation, 7-nanometer, chips by 2021.
Swan also said Intel was ""well down the engineering path"" for even more advanced 5-nanometer chips.
Revenue in Intel's client computing business, which caters to PC makers and is the biggest contributor to sales, fell 5% to $9.7 billion, but still beat FactSet estimates of $9.60 billion.
Davis said revenue could have been higher but Intel was unable to make enough chips for entry-level PCs.
""Demand has just outstripped our ability to add capacity,"" Davis said. ""In some ways it's a good problem to have, but anytime you can't satisfy your customers, that's not a good outcome.""
Asked by an analyst on a conference call whether Intel would consider turning to an outside foundry to make central processing units, or CPUs, to alleviate shortages, Swan noted that Intel had used outside suppliers in the past and would evaluate the option.
""We're investing to recapture process leadership going forward. At the same time, we're going to be extremely open-minded about, 'How do we ensure that we're building the best products?'"" Swan said. ""Where we build them is something that we'll always evaluate.""
Revenue from its higher-margin data center business rose 4% to $6.4 billion in the quarter, while analysts were expecting revenue of $5.62 billion, according to FactSet.
Intel forecast fourth-quarter revenue of $19.2 billion, and adjusted earnings of $1.24 per share.
Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $18.82 billion and a profit of $1.21 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
For the full year, the company expects revenue of $71 billion, up from its earlier forecast of $69.5 billion. That came in above analysts' estimate of $69.43 billion.
Intel said net revenue was steady at $19.19 billion, beating estimates of $18.05 billion.
Excluding items, the company earned $1.42 per share, above estimates of $1.24 per share."

“Year after year a huge upper middle class is getting out of universities, reaching the job market, and getting discretionary money,” Bulgari’s Chief Executive Officer Jean-Christophe Babin told Bloomberg Television in an interview.
Owned by the LVMH group, Bulgari is joining other luxury goods makers in expanding its footprint in mainland China to tap the world’s biggest consumer pool. Deterred by a weak yuan, protests in Hong Kong and geopolitical tensions with the U.S., Chinese shoppers are shifting their luxury spending back home instead of buying overseas.
“There are 5-10 cities where we are not yet present, and where in the next five years it will make a lot of sense to have the brand standing so that Chinese can physically experience wearing a Bulgari necklace,” said Babin, adding that this will help the brand build closer connections with its consumers.
Cities such as Wuhan, Chongqing, and Shenzhen are being considered for opening additional stores by the jeweler which also sells premium watches, perfumes and bags.
Silver Lining
The luxury retailer intends to retain its four boutiques in Hong Kong despite business having been hit by ongoing street protests, according to Babin.
The disruption in Hong Kong in fact has come with a silver lining. The sales decline in Asia’s financial hub was offset by stronger demand in mainland China, Japan and other nations in Southeast Asia, he said, mirroring the trend in its parent’s latest quarterly earnings.
Growing in China, however, is fraught with risks for western brands as they learn to navigate the country’s political sensitivities. The National Basketball Association is facing a broadcast blackout in China, two weeks after a league official posted a tweet in support of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and triggered a crisis.
Christian Dior SE, also part of the LVMH group, came under fire this month for slighting Beijing’s One China policy when it made a presentation at a university and didn’t include Taiwan in a map of China.
When asked about the heightened risk this presented for businesses, Babin said it wasn’t “necessarily different” in the U.S. or Japan as every culture has some hot-button issues.
“Our organization is very clear in mirroring our respect for Chinese sovereignty,” said Babin, adding that Bulgari focuses on building strong local teams. “We know that knowing, feeling, perceiving local sensitivities is important. This doesn’t prevent you occasionally from making some mistakes.”"

The so-called GridMod plan, developed with federal, local and private sector input, targets repair and reconstruction measures designed to strengthen the network and ensure its resilience against natural disasters like the devastating hurricanes that struck Puerto Rico in 2017, according to a statement from Governor Wanda Vázquez Garced's office.
""The GridMod Plan will provide the safe, modern and resilient electricity network that our communities need and deserve,"" the governor said, adding that an improved power network will help boost the island's economy.
Puerto Rico and its electric power authority known as PREPA filed for bankruptcy in 2017 just months before hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated the power grid.
Federal funding would cover about $13 billion of the plan, which also calls for private investment, according to the governor's statement.
The plan recommends a transformation to a decentralized electricity network, incorporating renewable energy and micro-networks to improve reliability and avoid blackouts during catastrophic events."

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence criticized China’s actions against protesters in Hong Kong while calling for greater engagement between the world’s two biggest economies, delivering a long-anticipated critique of Beijing’s human rights record as the two nations try to resolve their trade war.
“Beijing has increased its interventions in Hong Kong and engaged in actions that curtail the rights and liberties that Hong Kong’s people were guaranteed through a binding international agreement,” Pence said Thursday in a speech at the Wilson Center in Washington.
Addressing the demonstrators, Pence said: “We stand with you.”
Pence’s speech comes at a crucial time in the U.S.-China relationship as the two countries remain locked in a trade war and jostle for military and commercial dominance in the Pacific. White House officials have debated for weeks how critical Pence should be, underscoring the stakes of his remarks, which come just a day before negotiators talk about progress toward agreeing on a phase one agreement over trade.
The vice president was careful to balance his criticism with an olive branch. Rather than “decoupling” the two countries, the U.S. “seeks engagement with China and China’s engagement with the wider world,” he said. “Despite the great power competition that is underway and America’s growing strength, we want better for China.”
Pence’s most stinging criticism of China was indirect, in remarks targeting  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE). and the NBA.
“Nike promotes itself as a so-called ‘social-justice champion,’ but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door,” Pence said.
Representatives for Nike and the NBA didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Delayed Speech
He accused the NBA of “siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech.” The league apologized after an executive of the Houston Rockets issued a tweet supportive of Hong Kong protesters, outraging Chinese authorities and many NBA fans in the country.
“The NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime,” Pence said.
Pence was originally supposed to deliver the speech on June 4, which marked the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) massacre. The administration ultimately delayed the speech in the hopes that President Donald Trump would land a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 leaders’ summit in Osaka later that month.
Trump is aiming to sign a limited trade deal with Xi next month, and a weakening American economy is chipping away at the U.S.’s leverage.
Meanwhile, pressure is building from Capitol Hill to stay firm, highlighting White House moves this month to sanction Chinese entities accused of connections to the surveillance and imprisonment of Muslim Uighurs in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.
National Security
Unrest in Hong Kong has underscored the heated tensions as many U.S. lawmakers are pressing for legislation to support pro-democracy protesters despite a threat of retaliation from China.
Leland Miller, chief executive officer of China Beige Book, said the administration is engaged in somewhat of a good-cop, bad-cop approach to China.
“Markets tend to assume the administration’s China policy is monolithic, swinging either hawkish or dovish based on the president’s moods, but that’s not really the case,” Miller said. “Since late August the White House has certainly turned more dovish on trade, but on the national security side, hawks continue to run the show.”
Analysts say it’s hard to predict how the Chinese will react but caution it’s unlikely that Beijing will hit back at the vice president directly, if they don’t agree with elements of the speech.
Trade Pact
Under the terms of the partial trade arrangement reached earlier this month, Chinese spending on U.S. farm goods will scale to an annual figure of $40 billion to $50 billion over two years, according to the White House. China would also agree to certain intellectual-property measures and concessions related to financial services and currency.
In exchange, the U.S. delayed a tariff increase scheduled for Oct. 15 -- to 30% from 25% on about $250 billion of Chinese imports. More duties on Chinese products, targeted for Dec. 15, haven’t yet been called off.
While the limited agreement may resolve some short-term issues, several of the thorniest disputes remain outstanding. U.S. goals in the trade war center around accusations of intellectual-property theft, forced technology transfer and complaints about Chinese industrial subsidies.

1160,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 06:27PM ET</span>",Franklin’s Desai Sticks to 3% Yield Call That’s Elusive as Ever,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s been a tough year for investors predicting higher Treasury yields, with the 10-year rate tumbling 100 basis points and the world’s biggest bond market on track for its best annual performance since 2011.
The consensus on Wall Street is for 10-year yields to remain below 2% until mid-2021, as expectations for global growth sag and traders brace for a likely third straight Federal Reserve rate cut next week.
But Sonal Desai, chief investment officer of Franklin Templeton’s fixed-income group, is sticking by her forecast for the yield to surge to 3%, a level not seen since December, and up from about 1.75% at present.
She now sees that 3% mark in 12 months, rather than her prior call for the end of 2019. She reiterated that year-end view in July, just before the rate started its dive to a three-year low amid escalating trade friction. For Desai, the case for higher yields comes down to ballooning deficits, the prospect of stimulative fiscal and monetary policy, and her view that inflation is set to rise on job-market strength and accelerating wage growth.
“At the start of this year, I misread how much the Fed would be swayed by the markets, and that makes it much harder to call,” Desai, who oversees $155 billion from San Mateo, California, said in an interview. When asked about her 3% yield forecast, she said: “Do I think 3% is out of bounds for 12 months from now? Absolutely not, I think it could happen based on what I see.”
She’s hardly alone in her bearish target for Treasuries, which looks even more elusive than when she voiced it back in April. A bet against Treasuries by her colleague Michael Hasenstab went wrong in a big way in the third quarter. And back in September, after a ferocious bond rally drove yields in the world’s biggest markets to record lows, some investors were saying that’s as low as they’d go.
For Desai, the looming 2020 U.S. election plays into her outlook.
Both major political parties have “embraced very loose fiscal-policy agendas, so regardless of the outcome of next year’s election, I expect fiscal deficits to widen, boosting Treasury supply and outstripping demand,” she said. “This will cause prices to fall as we move further down this path of incredibly easy fiscal policy, hand in hand with very easy monetary conditions.”
Fed Call
When the year started, Desai had expected Fed rate increases in 2019. At the time, many were betting the central bank wouldn’t raise rates at all this year, and traders were upping wagers on a 2020 cut. The Fed then lowered rates in July and September amid weak global growth, uncertainty about the trade war and subdued inflation.
In February, she predicted an even higher yield level, saying the 10-year might reach 3.5% to 4% in the medium term.
She’s been less pessimistic on the U.S. and global outlook than some prognosticators. She sees global growth moderating and the U.S. poised to expand by 2% to 2.25% this year, with no signs of imminent recession.
Before assuming her current post in December, the Indian-born Desai worked as a portfolio manager with Hasenstab. She now oversees a different set of funds, including the $4.7 billion Franklin Total Return Fund. Its 2019 return of 8.4% puts it in the middle of its peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Another fund, the Franklin Strategic Income Fund, has gained 7.9% this year, besting about 70% of its peers, Bloomberg data show. She says it’s gotten increasingly difficult to find opportunities in credit markets, but that she’s finding some in higher-rated collateralized loan obligations.
Years of easy monetary policy and low rates have forced investors into ever-riskier assets, and financial stability is an issue that’s “front and center” in her mind, she said.
She expects the Fed to lower rates next week. But she doesn’t expect an extended easing cycle and says it would be “wise for policy makers to start guiding markets away from anticipating continual cuts at every meeting.”
With the U.S. jobless rate at a 50-year low, she says she’s “heartened” to see some Fed officials recognize the financial-stability risk that comes from low rates.
“The Fed essentially exchanged volatility at one point for unknown volatility at another, and has not responded to the underlying economy,” she said. “Markets have been going along for the ride, and I definitely don’t see yields being permanently lower.”"

Demand for lithium, a key component of batteries used in cell phones, electric vehicles and other consumer goods, is widely expected to spike by 2025.
But global trade tensions, the scaling back of electric vehicle subsidies in China and increased production have pressured prices in recent months.
The company now expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.00 to $6.20 in the year, compared with its previous estimate of $6.25 to $6.65.
Albemarle also trimmed its 2019 net sales forecast range to $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion, from $3.65 billion to $3.85 billion.
The company also reported preliminary third quarter adjusted profit of $1.53 per share hit by weakness in its lithium unit, which offset results from its bromine and catalysts units.
Analysts on an average expect the company to report an adjusted profit of $1.63, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company said lithium unit sales volume in the quarter was lower than expected mainly due to Typhoon Tapah, in late September, that caused lithium shipments from ports in Shanghai to be delayed into October.
Overall lithium pricing was flat to slightly up in the third quarter versus prior year with continued price pressure on lithium sales in China hitting its core earnings by about $5 million.
""Despite one-time items impacting our third quarter results and challenging market conditions heading into 2020, we remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of lithium,"" said Chief Executive Officer Luke Kissam."

Basel-based Roche, the biggest maker of cancer drugs, said in February that it would buy the U.S. company, acquiring a portfolio that includes a blindness treatment that has U.S. and European approval and other projects for neurodegenerative disorders like Huntington's disease. One of its projects is a gene therapy treatment for hemophilia.
The FTC staff had focused on hemophilia treatments since Roche markets Hemlibra, the report said.
Following the staff's recommendation, officials at the top of the FTC's Bureau of Competition must weigh in. The next step would be a vote by the FTC chairman and four commissioners.
The deal must also win approval from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority, which said this week that it had a deadline of mid-December for a Phase 1 decision. A Phase 2 probe would be more in-depth and detailed.
Roche, Spark and the FTC all declined comment."

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's shares sky-rocketed on Thursday after the electric car maker surprised investors with a rare quarterly profit, and delivered a record number of cars while keeping a lid on costs.
The news also helped the stock cross $300 for the first time since March 1 and surpass General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) as the most valuable car company in the United States.
The following six graphs offer an illustration of Tesla's progress in key areas.
DELIVERIES
The company said it was ""highly confident"" in exceeding the low end of its 2019 forecast range.
""Not only were the numbers good, the group confirmed it is ahead of schedule for the Model Y as well as the new plant in Shanghai. The group has had its fair share of setbacks over the years, but now it seems to be moving up a gear,"" CMC Markets analyst David Madden said.

OPERATING EXPENSES
The carmaker, which is trying to keep a lid on costs, said it had cut expenses 16% on a year-on-year basis, citing improvements in operating efficiency and a reduction in manufacturing and material costs.
""Stronger than anticipated 3Q results highlight progress in operational efficiencies; however, we see several items during the quarter as unsustainable on a near to mid-term basis,"" Cowen analysts said, pointing to operating and capital expenses.

GROSS MARGINS
Tesla's gross margins, an important profit indicator for investors, surpassed expectations in the third quarter.
JP Morgan analysts said they were not certain about the quality of the gross margin beat in the third quarter, though.

FREE CASH FLOW AND DEBT:
The electric carmaker expects generally to be cash flow positive and said it was now self-funding. Some on Wall Street were skeptical.
""We believe Tesla has been deferring Shanghai capex payments into 2020, so cash flow could get hit further,"" RBC analyst Joseph Spak said.

SHARE REACTION TO QUARTERLY REPORTS:
A year ago, Tesla gave a quarterly report that similarly smashed investors' expectations, igniting a rally that sent its shares 31% higher over the next two months, only to see the stock decline through much of 2019 over worries about corporate governance, profitability and demand for the Model 3.
""As Musk talks the talk and usually has not consistently delivered, last night Elon & the team walked the walk in strong fashion as Q3 looks to be an inflection point quarter for the Tesla story that will cause a historic short covering this morning in shares which have languished this year,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said.

CASH POSITION
Investors have been worried about the automaker's cash burn. Tesla's balance sheet now appears extremely healthy, Baird analyst Ben Kallo said.
""Bears may argue Tesla is underinvesting, though we believe current and historical CapEx and R&D investments should continue to support an attractive top-line growth profile"".

1164,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 05:49PM ET</span>",Day Ahead - Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com – Here's a preview of the top 3 things to watch.
1. How will traders react to Amazon's earnings miss?
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) will likely weigh on the broader market ahead of trading after earnings and guidance, released after Thursday's close, disappointed Wall Street. Shares fell more than 7% after hours.
Amazon blamed the earnings miss on investments it's making to be able to deliver products free to Amazon Prime customers in a day. 
The company has made no secret of its spending plan, but the size of the earnings miss was a shock. 
Amazon shares were up 1.1% in regular trading. If the postmarket decline carries through to Friday, the shares would fall to about $1,660, its lowest level since March and down 18.5% from its 52-week high reached on July 11.
But tech stocks should get some support from chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel reported strong numbers and offered an upbeat fourth-quarter outlook, taking some of the sting away from Texas Instruments' (NASDAQ:TXN) weak results on Wednesday.
Intel said it earned $1.42 a share in the quarter, a bit higher than a year ago and 15% better than the consensus estimate of analysts tracked by Investing.com. Revenue was up slightly from a year ago at $19.2 billion.
2. Consumer Confidence Update Due
There’s little top-tier economic data on the calendar tomorrow, with just consumer confidence numbers due.
The University of Michigan releases its final measure of October consumer confidence at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
Consumer sentiment is expected to improve to a reading of 96.0, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The expectations component is forecast to show a reading of 84.8.
The data comes as many are searching for clues to whether the U.S. consumer can continue to prop up the economy after recent weakness in retail sales stoked worries that consumers were turning frugal.
3. Verizon Calls in Q3 Report
Verizon (NYSE:VZ) reports earnings before the opening bell on Thursday, with many keen to assess whether the wireless carriers’ efforts to rope in more subscribers have paid off.
In August the carrier replaced its Go, Above and Beyond/ unlimited plans with four cheaper replacements: an entry-level Start Unlimited, Play More Unlimited, Do More Unlimited and high-end Get More Unlimited.
The wireless carrier has boosted growth by lowering the price of some of its data, which has led to some growth.
Verizon is expected to report earnings of $1.24 per share on revenue of $32.74 billion.
Earnings aside, investors will also be eager for an update on the company’s 5G wireless network rollout."
1165,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 05:38PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Software under scrutiny in Airbus A220 engine failures,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - A U.S.-led investigation into a series of engine failures on Airbus's smallest jet, the A220, is studying whether a software change allowed unexpected vibrations that tore parts and forced three emergency landings, several people familiar with the case said.
The airline Swiss halted its fleet of A220 jets for more than a day on Oct. 15 after a third flight in as many months was forced to divert or return to base with engine damage. Engine maker Pratt & Whitney has urged checks on similar engines worldwide.
Investigators are focusing their attention on a recently revised version of engine software that may have allowed parts inside the engine to be set in a way that caused mechanical resonance or destructive vibrations, two of the people said.
Neither the A220 plane nor the engine has been grounded but Airbus and Pratt & Whitney have told pilots not to push engines above 95% of their maximum thrust when flying above 29,000 feet - a demanding configuration currently only required by Swiss.
The larger and more widely used A320 partly relies on the same family of Pratt engines but the version used for those jets is not affected by the software review.
On modern aircraft, engine settings are controlled by engine manufacturer software that interprets pilot commands and tells the engines what to do. The Swiss problems first arose following a recent update of the software, two of the people said.
A new version of the software should allow the flight restrictions to be lifted but may not be ready until the first quarter, the people said.
However, the underlying cause of the problem has not yet been confirmed and other scenarios have not been ruled out. Other previous causes of engine failures include defects in materials.
Airbus, which was starting a Pacific tour to promote the A220 on Thursday, declined comment on the investigation.
Officials at the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is leading an official investigation into the failures involving the U.S.-built engine, declined comment.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said it was monitoring the situation closely and coordinating with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.
The head of Pratt & Whitney parent United Technologies (N:UTX) said earlier this week it was working on finding the cause and remained confident in the new fuel-saving engine.
""Clearly, any time you get an issue like this, we're on top of it. The guys are working through it,"" Chief Executive Greg Hayes told analysts on a conference call.
The company said on Thursday it was supporting the investigation and referred further queries to the NTSB.
Nobody was hurt in the three incidents, which all took place on the 750 km (470 miles) route between London and Geneva. 
But in one of the incidents, compressor debris punched a hole in the engine casing, and such ""uncontained"" engine failures are always investigated thoroughly. In the most recent event, parts escaped from the back of the engine when the diverted A220 landed in Paris, but the engine housing was left intact.
France's BEA air accident agency made a rare appeal for 150 volunteers to help look for a titanium part from one of those engines in the woods in eastern France in coming weeks.
Pratt & Whitney set off a chain reaction of new aircraft designs or upgrades when it announced its new Geared Turbofan engine in 2008, promising 16% fuel savings. But it has wrestled with a spate of performance or reliability problems and delays.

Formerly known as the CSeries, the 110-130-seat A220 was designed by Canada's Bombardier (TO:BBDb) and was one of the first to adopt the new Pratt & Whitney technology. Bombardier sold the program to Airbus last year because of heavy losses.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares soared 17% on Thursday after the electric carmaker surprised Wall Street by delivering on Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk's promise of a profit in the third quarter, even as doubts remained about its long-term prospects.
Trading at $298, Tesla's market capitalization was $53 billion, surpassing General Motors Co's (N:GM) $51 billion stock market value and making it the United States' most valuable car company. It has been the No. 1 U.S. car company by market cap before, but recently GM has had a substantial lead.
Tesla late on Wednesday reported a quarterly profit, citing improvements in operating efficiency and a reduction in manufacturing and material costs.
The strong report unleashed a bloodbath on traders shorting Tesla, the second most shorted U.S. company, after Apple Inc (O:AAPL), in terms of the overall amount of money shorted.
With $10.5 billion bet against Tesla, short sellers suffered paper losses of $1.4 billion on Thursday, erasing 70% of the profits they had logged in 2019, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm. Tesla's shares remain down 10% year to date.
Tesla's $1.8 billion junk bond due in August 2025 surged 3 points in price following the results, driving its yield to the lowest since March 2018.
""A strong step forward, yet Tesla will need to put together a string of similar data points to demonstrate the sustainability of results ... and its track record has been spotty on this,"" said analysts at brokerage  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
At least eight brokerages raised their price targets on Tesla shares, while the company's average rating on Wall Street remained ""hold"", with just 11 of 34 analysts recommending investors buy the stock.
Investors in the past have shown impatience with the company's serial failures to meet financial and production targets and shares in the company are still down more than a third from their 2018 peak of almost $390.
The company has been struggling with margins and a new Chinese factory is expected to be help on that front, but analysts said the jury was still out on whether it can sustain the push into profitability.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two former  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) traders will serve no prison time for conspiring to manipulate the Libor benchmark interest rate between 2005 and 2011, a federal judge ruled on Thursday, sharply criticizing U.S. prosecutors for treating the two men as ""proxy wrongdoers"" for a much larger scheme.
Matthew Connolly, who once led Deutsche Bank's pool trading desk in New York, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan to six months' home confinement, while Gavin Campbell Black, who worked on the bank's London desk, was sentenced to nine months' home confinement, which he will be allowed to serve in England.
McMahon also ordered Connolly to pay a $100,000 fine, and Black to pay a $300,000 fine.
The sentence is a setback for U.S. prosecutors in one of the few criminal cases to emerge from a sweeping probe of Libor rigging. The prosecutors had asked the judge to order ""substantial"" prison time for both men, saying federal guidelines called for close to 10 years, along with a $3 million fine for Connolly and a $2 million fine for Black.
McMahon, however, said the prosecutors were trying to hold Connolly and Black responsible for behavior throughout the financial industry.
""I do think it is fair to say that the government has used Mr. Connolly and Mr. Black ... as proxy wrongdoers,"" she said.
""We're pleased with the court's ruling,"" Kenneth Breen, Connolly's lawyer, said after the sentencing. Black's lawyer, Seth Levine, had no immediate comment.
A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment.
Libor, or the London interbank offered rate, underpins trillions of dollars of financial products and is based on what banks say they believe they would pay if they borrowed from other banks. It is to be phased out by 2021.
Investigations into whether banks manipulated Libor have led to billions of dollars in global settlements with financial institutions and U.S. and UK cases against several people.
Two former Rabobank traders were sentenced to prison in the United States, but their convictions were thrown out on appeal.
Connolly was the first U.S. citizen charged with Libor rigging. In a 2016 indictment, prosecutors said that from 2005 to about 2011, he, Black and others conspired to submit false estimates for U.S. dollar Libor rates to manipulate the rate for their own gain.
Deutsche Bank agreed in April 2015 to pay $2.5 billion to resolve U.S. and UK investigations of Libor rigging."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The benchmark S&P 500 edged higher on Thursday as strong results from  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and  PayPal Holdings Inc  (O:PYPL) offset dour results from 3M Co (N:MMM) and  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR).
The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose on the strength of Microsoft and PayPal shares, while a decline in 3M shares weighed down the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Microsoft shares gained 2.0% as the tech giant's outlook for cloud computing services surpassed analysts' expectations, while PayPal shares rose 8.3% on the payments company's strong full-year earnings forecast. Microsoft and PayPal were the top boosts to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.
Shares of 3M dropped after the industrial conglomerate missed third-quarter sales estimates and lowered its full-year profit forecast. The company's U.S. sales dropped 1.1%, and its Asia-Pacific sales fell 5% as industrial production slowed.
Twitter shares plummeted 20.9% after the social networking company's revenue and profit missed estimates, in part due to technical issues with its ad platform. The decline in Twitter shares capped gains on the S&P 500.
The results from 3M pointed to continued fallout from the U.S.-China trade dispute as tariffs have made business conditions uncertain for many companies, analysts said. Other companies, including  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) and Texas Instruments Inc (O:TXN), have attributed weak third-quarter results to trade-related issues.
""It's showing us that the tariff situation continues to be a major concern for companies in how to spend their money,"" said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.
A speech from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday underscored tensions between Washington and Beijing. Pence accused China of curtailing ""rights and liberties"" in Hong Kong but insisted that the United States does not seek to confront or to ""de-couple"" from its main economic rival.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 51.39 points, or 0.19%, to 26,782.56, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 2.54 points, or 0.08%, to 3,007.06 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 53.91 points, or 0.66%, to 8,173.70.
 Lam Research Corp  (O:LRCX) shares jumped 12.6%, hitting a record high, after the chip equipment maker forecast strong results for the December quarter. Lam Research was the top boost to the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index (SOX), which rose 2.2% a day after being pressured by losses in Texas Instruments shares.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) shares tumbled 6.5% after the automaker cut its profit outlook for the year. By contrast, Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares surged 17.1% after the electric car maker reported a surprise quarterly profit.
Dow Inc (N:DOW) shares advanced 3.9% after the chemicals company beat profit estimates, having cut costs to offset a sharp drop in global demand.
Of the 168 S&P 500 companies that have reported results, more than 80% have beaten profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.06-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.24-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 56 new highs and 48 new lows.

1181,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 03:11PM ET</span>",Bank of England aims to boost competition in lending,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England is proposing cuts to capital requirements for credit unions as part of efforts to remove barriers to stronger competition in lending, Deputy Governor Sam Woods said on Thursday.
Woods added that Britain's departure from the European Union would give UK regulators more room to simplify financial rules.
He said that while prior reforms have led to many new banks being created, none of the new lenders has grown big enough to take on HSBC,  Barclays  (LON:BARC), Lloyds (LON:LLOY) or Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS), the ""Big Four"" that dominate Britain's high streets.
After tackling barriers to entry for challenger banks, it was time to tackle the barriers to growth, said Woods, who is also chief executive of the Bank's  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (PRA), which regulates lenders.
Woods said the PRA had mapped out the barriers using a machine to sift through data and rules via text-search, with results cross-checked by humans, before taking a fresh look at capital requirements for credit unions.
Credit unions are member-owned, non-profit co-operatives that offer loans and savings products to members who are often less well off.
The sector is tiny but helps those who find it hard to open a bank account and might otherwise turn to loan sharks or other types of high cost loans.
The PRA is launching a public consultation on proposals to simplify capital requirements for credit unions, Woods said.
""The effect of these changes should be to reduce overall capital requirements for the credit union sector by roughly one quarter,"" Woods said in his annual speech to the City of London financial district.
There are over 400 credit unions in Britain with a total of 2 million members. Loans passed 1.5 billion pounds for the first time in 2018 when total assets rose to 3.3 billion pounds, according to BoE data.
Turning to banks, Woods said the current main threshold of 50 billion pounds or above in assets for banks having to meet the bulk of capital and other requirements ""feels about right"", Woods said.
He was seeking views of lenders on over 50 different thresholds for capital, reporting and remuneration, with 33 of them imposed by the BoE itself rather than under EU or global rules.
""Should we rationalise and harmonise any of these thresholds? We are now looking at that question and have an open mind on it.""
The machine-search also highlighted the complexity of rules that stretch longer than the Bible's Old Testament or Tolstoy's novel War and Peace.
""Small firms tell us that complexity is a real challenge and my instinct is that a simpler -- simpler, not weaker -- regime for small firms could benefit both our safety and soundness and competition objectives,"" Woods said.
""This is an area where we may have more room to manoeuvre following Brexit."""
1182,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 03:11PM ET</span>",UK watchdog hits back at critics over Woodford fund,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Regulators won't step in every time they see investors losing money or the price of assets tumbling, Britain's markets watchdog said after being accused of tardiness in handling the now closed Woodford equity fund.
Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said investing is inherently risky and he wanted to foster an environment where risk-taking occurs.
But in his annual speech on Thursday in the City of London financial district, Bailey also said the public needed to receive clear, meaningful disclosure on the risks they are taking, and should expect markets to work well.
""We want to see more transparency in the risks of non-bank investment so that investors get useful information,"" he said. ""That's why I have argued that there needs to be reform in the UCITS framework,"" he added, referring to EU mutual fund rules.
High-profile stockpicker Neil Woodford was required to comply with these rules in the operation of his equity fund but breached them twice.
Bailey, a candidate to replace Mark Carney as Bank of England governor in January, said the FCA was aware of the need to balance suitable investor protection and supporting the economy.
""We will always seek to act to strike this balance and in doing so we may rarely appear popular, but it is a balance that has to be struck,"" Bailey said.
The Woodford fund promised daily redemptions but was suspended in June because it was unable to sell assets fast enough to raise cash to give back to investors.
The FCA has opened an investigation into the Woodford debacle that has trapped thousands of investors.
Bailey has described the UCITS rules as ""flawed"".
The watchdog and the Bank of England will in December give an update on the better matching of how easy it is to sell assets in a fund with the redemption terms offered.
Britain's departure from the European Union could help its regulators tweak the UCITS rules that have been put into UK law as part of Brexit preparations."

1184,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 02:01PM ET</span>",Saudi Arabia faces reality check as Wall Street heads to Riyadh,"By Davide Barbuscia, Saeed Azhar and Stephen Kalin
DUBAI (Reuters) - Wall Street's heavy hitters are back in Saudi Arabia but the terms of engagement have changed.
The CEOs of  Citigroup  (N:C) and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN), as well as the heads of fund managers BlackRock (N:BLK) and BlackStone (N:BX) will be among those gathering in Riyadh next week for a glitzy investment conference, an event not attended by top financiers last year after the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. 
SoftBank (T:9984) founder and CEO Masayoshi Son will also attend the Oct 29-31 conference, two people familiar with the matter said, as the Japanese company seeks to raise funds for a second technology fund. The Saudi sovereign wealth fund contributed $40 billion to Softbank's first technology fund. 
But the buzz around the Future Investment Initiative (FII) has faded since the conference was first launched in 2017, when it was heralded as Davos in the desert, a nod to the annual gathering of world leaders and corporate bosses in the Swiss Alps.
Then, Saudi Arabia was being feted for its investment opportunities and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was hailed as a force for change.
Now, fallout from Khashoggi's killing and the stop-start process towards the long-awaited stock market listing of state-run energy giant Saudi Aramco have shifted the mood.
""It's not seen as a must-do event like Davos,"" said one banker at an international bank.
The country has struggled to lure foreign investment to fund projects outside the oil sector, including manufacturing, meant to create millions of jobs for Saudis, as investors hesitate over the commercial viability of projects and Riyadh's human rights record.
Proceeds from Aramco's initial public offering will boost the Saudi wealth fund's ability to back domestic mega-projects including the $500 billion futuristic city NEOM, announced at FII in 2017.
But there has been little progress on NEOM so far other than construction of royal palaces and an airport. A NEOM company spokesman said it continues to engage with a ""wide range of potential foreign and local investors"".
Saudi Arabia has managed to sign some multi-billion dollar deals last year at the conference, but it was Aramco that clinched most of them.
""Signing commercial agreements is great for PR, but what Saudi Arabia really needs is for many of its national development initiatives to move from the conceptual stage to implementation with foreign, private-sector partners,"" said Robert Mogielnicki, resident scholar at Washington-based Arab Gulf States Institute.
ARAMCO'S ALLURE
Aramco's IPO, for which Prince Mohammed is seeking a $2 trillion valuation, remains the biggest draw in Saudi Arabia for investors.
The company was due to announce plans on Oct. 20 for an initial 1%-2% flotation on the Saudi stock market, a listing that could be the biggest ever depending on the valuation. 
But this has been delayed. An adviser told participating banks that Aramco wanted to wait until its third-quarter results were published to bolster investor confidence following attacks on the company's plants last month which halved Saudi Arabia's crude output.
Sources also told Reuters more time was needed to lock in cornerstone investors for the listing.
The country's privatization drive looks far from reaching a target of 35-40 billion riyals ($9.33 billion-$10.66 billion) in non-oil state revenues by 2020 based on deals so far.
A spokesman for Saudi National Center for Privatization & PPP said five public-private partnership infrastructure deals were closed since last December that involve more than 13 billion riyals in new investment in the next two to three years.
""The opportunities to date are largely in listed equities and direct investment, and the privatization or IPOs have been limited to the oil and gas sector,"" said Richard Segal at Manulife Investment Management.
Prince Mohammed has courted Silicon Valley with visits to companies including Facebook (O:FB) and Microsoft (O:MSFT) in 2016 and 2018. He has not visited a Western capital since Khashoggi was killed.
Apple (O:AAPL) and Amazon (O:AMZN) were in talks in 2017 to set up a presence in Saudi Arabia, sources said at the time, but no deals have emerged. 
Asked if they would attend next week's conference, Facebook and Apple declined to comment. Google (O:GOOGL) and Amazon did not respond to a request to comment.
The CEO of German conglomerate  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) will not attend due to other commitments, a company spokesman said. South Korea's Samsung (KS:005930) will be represented by its CEO and will sign a memorandum of understanding with Saudi entertainment resort Qiddiya at the event, Qiddiya said.
The White House, which has resisted pressure to punish Riyadh over human rights abuses citing its strategic importance, is sending its U.S. energy and treasury secretaries Rick Perry and Steven Mnuchin and senior adviser Jared Kushner.
While last year's event was dominated by leaders from Asian and Arab countries, next week's gathering will include Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
David Malpass, the head of the World Bank - which did not attend last year - will also be there. 
""FII may be an immediate reality check, but the real test of investor confidence in Saudi Arabia will involve a longer-term assessment of foreign direct investment trends, commercial regulations, and transparency measures,"" Mogielnicki said.

(Reuters) - 3M Co (N:MMM) on Thursday became the latest U.S manufacturer to signal American corporations are suffering from the trade war with China, after it reported quarterly revenue well short of Wall Street estimates and cut its full-year profit forecast.
Shares of the company, which gets nearly a third of its annual sales from Asia, fell as much as 5.4%. The stock is the third biggest percentage loser on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) this year to Wednesday, with an 11% drop.
China was the worst performing market, the company said, with sales plunging 9% excluding the impact of currency changes. 
The world's second largest economy expanded at its weakest pace in almost three decades in the third-quarter as the bruising trade war hit factory production, with auto sales slumping for the 15th straight month in September. 
This squeezed demand for 3M's automotive products such as sound absorption materials and thermal insulation pads used in batteries.
So far this week, industrial bellwether  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) reported weak demand in Asia, including a 29% plunge in construction equipment sales, while toymaker  Hasbro Inc  (O:HAS) highlighted a hit from the tit-for-tat tariffs.
Overall, 3M's sales in Asia-Pacific, its biggest market outside the United States, fell 5%. In the United States adjusted sales dropped 1.1% and also came in below the expectations of some analysts.
""We're seeing a broader impact on industrial production, broader manufacturing,"" in the United States due to the slowing economic growth, said Chief Executive Officer Mike Roman.
3M, known for Scotch tape and Post-it notes, earlier this year announced plans to reduce production and cut 2,000 workers as its sales slowed.
""We believe investors anticipated a weak quarter and guide down. Operationally, this appears worse,"" Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch wrote in a note.
3M lowered its full-year adjusted earnings expectations to be between $8.99 and $9.09 per share, down from its prior outlook of $9.25 to $9.75.
Net income attributable to the company rose to $1.58 billion, or $2.75 per share, in the quarter, from $1.54 billion, or $2.64 per share, a year earlier, helped by a divestment gain.
Net sales fell 2% to $7.99 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $8.16 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

1192,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 12:01PM ET</span>",Fed's repo stress will ease but not disappear by year-end,"By Karen Brettell
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A cash shortage that has plagued crucial overnight lending markets during the past few weeks is likely to flare back up heading into year-end, although measures taken by the Federal Reserve to provide liquidity means the worst of the strains are probably over.
The Fed began daily repurchase agreements in mid-September, after the repo rate for overnight loans surged to 10%, the highest since the financial crisis and far above the Fed’s then maximum fed funds target rate of 2.25%.
The operations inject cash into the banking system, after demand for overnight loans from companies, banks and other borrowers overwhelmed supply.
Analysts said the need to settle large amounts of Treasury issuance and cash needs from companies to pay taxes were factors behind the cash crunch.
A reduction in excess bank reserves, cash held at the Fed that can be made available for loans, was also a large contributor, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in particular having cut the cash it holds on deposit at the Fed by 57% this year.
The Fed's repo operations will run until at least January.
Last week it also began purchasing Treasury bills, which will increase reserves in the system. When the Fed buys securities from a bank, it credits the bank’s reserve account.
Analysts and market participants say these moves helped stabilize the market, where there are around $2.2 trillion in outstanding loans.
But a jump in funding costs last week show that further bouts of volatility are likely to re-emerge. Banks and other large investors typically reduce risk-taking as they close their books for year-end, with fewer funds being made available for loans.
“It’s a step in the right direction and it really does help to fundamentally address some of these issues of there being too few reserves in the banking system,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in New York.
That said, “I just don’t think that year-end is going to be particularly clean. I think that we will see some additional repo volatility.”
The Fed began reducing its bond holdings in late 2017. Purchases after the financial crisis, known as quantitative easing, were designed to boost investment and economic growth.
GRAPHIC: U.S. Fed balance sheet - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7722/7653/BalanceSheet.png
MORE STEPS NEEDED
To reduce the risk of further disruptions, market participants say they expect more interventions from the Fed.
One issue with the Fed’s purchases of Treasury bills is that money market funds are a major holder of the debt and will be reluctant to give it up, knowing that new purchases will come with lower returns.
“Money funds just happen to be the largest owner and probably are not looking to sell, because whatever we reinvest would needless to say be lower than when we purchased it originally,” said Deborah Cunningham, chief investment officer for global liquidity markets at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh.
Money market funds hold around 20% of the $2.25 trillion in outstanding Treasury bills, according to Fed data.
Dealers own few bills compared to Fed demand. On average they have owned $22 billion in bills year-to-date, below the $60 billion the Fed plans to purchase each month, Cabana said.
If the Fed’s purchases disrupt liquidity in the bill market, which could occur in the coming months, the Fed may expand purchases to short-dated Treasury notes, which would be easier to source, Cabana said.
Dealers held $83 billion in notes with maturities up to three years this year, on average.

The most important fix to ensure there is not a repeat of September, however, would be for the Fed to introduce a standing repo facility.
The Fed has said it is looking at a permanent repo facility but has not yet committed to such a move."

1196,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 10:31AM ET</span>","SoftBank clinches WeWork takeover deal, bailing out co-founder","By Anirban Sen, Jessica DiNapoli and Jane Lanhee Lee
(Reuters) - SoftBank Group agreed to spend more than $10 billion to take over WeWork on Tuesday, doubling down on an ill-fated investment and giving a near $1.7 billion payoff to the U.S. office-space sharing startup's co-founder Adam Neumann to relinquish control.
The deal represents a stunning reversal of fortune for WeWork as well as its largest shareholder, SoftBank Group Corp, which has committed more than $13 billion in equity to a company that is now valued at just $8 billion.
The bailout comes as SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is seeking to convince investors to participate in the Japanese company's second mammoth Vision Fund, for which he is seeking to raise $108 billion.
To stem WeWork's bleeding, SoftBank will need to reverse its widening losses and find a way to make it profitable.
Shares in SoftBank dropped 2.5% on Wednesday in Tokyo, while the cost of default protection on the firm has risen, with the 5-year credit default swap jumping 17.7 points in a week to the highest level since January.
The rescue financing also marks a dramatic fall from grace for Neumann, who as recently as last month was preparing to take WeWork public as CEO after attaining a $47 billion valuation for it in January.
While WeWork employees now face the prospect of thousands of layoffs, Neumann has secured a $685 million side deal with SoftBank to step down from the board of WeWork's owner, The We Company, according to people familiar with the arrangement.
Neumann also has the right to sell $970 million of shares, according to one of the sources, as part of a tender offer in which WeWork will buy up to $3 billion in WeWork shares from existing investors and employees at a price of $19.19 each.
He currently owns a little over a fifth of WeWork, and is expected to retain a stake.
Neumann faced margins calls on his personal borrowings against WeWork's private stock as a result of the collapse of the company's valuation.
SoftBank has agreed to extend to him a $500 million loan to repay a credit line from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co, as well as pay him a $185 million fee for a four-year assignment as a consultant to WeWork, one of the sources said.
Neumann had drawn down $395 million on JPMorgan's credit line, another of the sources added.
Under the terms of the deal with SoftBank, he must use the proceeds from selling his stock to first repay the loan extended to him by SoftBank, according to the source.
Even though he will give up his board seat, Neumann will get two representatives on WeWork's board, one of the sources said. WeWork said in a statement that its board will be expanded and control how Neumann's shares are voted.
Reuters first reported on Monday that Neumann was negotiating stepping down from the board and would serve as an adviser.
""The consulting arrangement is mind boggling. It's terrible governance,"" said Nell Minow, vice chair of shareholder advisory firm ValueEdge Advisors. ""Why pay the guy who got WeWork into this mess for advice. It's adding insult to injury and a little more injury too.""
Nevertheless, some WeWork investors said they supported the deal.
""Adam is a visionary who has created an impactful company which has transformed the way many people work, live and think. We think he deserved to take some money off the table for his contribution to the company,"" said All Blue Capital managing partner Matt Novak.
He declined to say how big his firm's stake in WeWork is.
SoftBank said it will provide a $5 billion debt package to WeWork, comprising $1.1 billion in senior secured notes, $2.2 billion in unsecured notes, and a $1.75 billion letter of credit facility. WeWork picked SoftBank's offer over an alternative $5 billion debt package submitted on Monday by JPMorgan.
SoftBank said it will also accelerate a previous $1.5 billion equity commitment to WeWork in the form of warrants that are due in April at a new price of $11.60 per share.
SoftBank said it will own 80% of WeWork following the tender offer but will not be consolidating the company on its books because it will not hold a majority of voting rights. SoftBank will have four board seats on the company's expanded 10-member board, one of the source said.
SoftBank and its first $100 billion Vision Fund already owned about a third of WeWork through previous investments totaling $10.6 billion.
All of the Vision Fund's interests in regional joint ventures with WeWork outside of Japan will be exchanged for shares in WeWork at $11.60 per share, SoftBank said.
""We hope SoftBank can execute on this enhanced vision, through leveraging its strategic partnerships, or otherwise, and bring back value to WeWork's minority shareholders,"" said All Blue Capital's Novak, adding his firm will be holding on to its stake because it views SoftBank's tender offer price as too low.
WeWork abandoned its initial public offering last month, after investors questioned its large losses, the sustainability of its business model and the way it was being run by Neumann, who gave up his CEO title last month. He had retained his position as chairman of the We Company.
SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure will succeed Neumann and become The We Company's executive chairman.
""The new capital SoftBank is providing will restore momentum to the company and I am committed to delivering profitability and positive free cash flow,"" Claure said in a statement.
Artie Minson, previously WeWork's chief financial officer, and Sebastian Gunningham, who was a vice chairman at the company, are now serving as its co-chief executives.
POOR GOVERNANCE
While Neumann's investors were willing to entertain his eccentricities since co-founding WeWork in 2010, his free-wheeling ways and party-heavy lifestyle came into focus once he failed to get the company's IPO underway.
During the attempts to woo IPO investors last month, Neumann was criticized by corporate governance experts for arrangements that went beyond the typical practice of having majority voting control through special categories of shares.
These included giving his estate a major say in his replacement as CEO, and tying the voting power of shares to how much he donated to charitable causes. Neumann had also entered into several transactions with WeWork, making the company a tenant in some of his properties and charging it rent.
Neumann, 40, is not the first founder of a major startup to be forced to step down recently.
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc co-founder Travis Kalanick resigned as CEO of the ride-hailing startup in 2017 after facing a rebellion from his board over a string of scandals, including allegations of enabling a chauvinistic and toxic work culture.
""I view this as SoftBank's moonshot to get WeWork back on all fours,"" said Eric Talley, professor of law at Columbia Law School. ""They realize that Neumann's continued involvement in the company would be a continued impediment to that."""

(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) beat Wall Street profit and revenue estimates on Thursday, as the company added high-speed internet customers and lost more video subscribers than expected.
Comcast’s third quarter showed that its focus on the higher-margin broadband business - necessary to stream content - is helping to offset a decline in cable subscribers.
""Four things stood out as wrapped up the quarter: our incredible strength in broadband, the enduring popularity of our premium content, our strong global footing just one year after the Sky acquisition; and how the combination of these things puts us in a unique position to compete, including in the streaming market,"" said Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts.
Comcast shares were up 2.32% at $46.78 in premarket trading.
Revenue from the company’s high-speed internet business grew 9.3% to $4.72 billion with the gain of 379,000 subscribers in the quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of 344,000 net additions, according to research firm FactSet.
Comcast’s results also reflected the widespread “cord-cutting” across the cable business. The company lost 238,000 video customers in the three months ended Sept. 30, higher than the 224,000 it lost in the previous quarter, above the 203,000 loss estimated by research firm FactSet.
In September Comcast announced it will offer Xfinity Flex, its streaming media set top box, and a voice remote for free to its U.S. internet-only customers. It had previously charged those customers $5 per month for the service and remote. The product is meant to make it easier for subscribers of multiple streaming services to find shows.
The company's NBCUniversal business, which includes NBC Entertainment and Universal Pictures, reported revenue of $8.30 billion, down 3.5% from a year earlier. In April NBCUniversal is launching a streaming service called “Peacock,” which will be available as a subscription or with ads, stocked with 15,000 hours of content from the company’s library.
British pay-TV group Sky, which Comcast acquired after outbidding Twenty-First Century Fox last year, generated revenue of $4.55 billion, missing estimates of $4.75 billion. Comcast attributed that miss to tough macroeconomic conditions in the UK, Germany and Italy.
The Philadelphia company said revenue rose 21.2% to $26.83 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $26.77 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net income attributable to Comcast rose to $3.22 billion, or 70 cents per share, from $2.89 billion, or 62 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company earned 79 cents per share, ahead of estimates of 75 cents."

William Blair wrote that the company “continues to fire on virtually all cylinders,” and praised its “broad-based product strength.” Bloomberg Intelligence added that Microsoft is in “a stronger position” than its peers in the event that IT spending pulls back.
Multiple firms tweaked their price targets higher, although many of the quarter’s themes -- such as growing demand for Azure cloud-computing programs -- had been anticipated, meaning the quarter was viewed more as a confirmation of strength than a positive surprise.

“Microsoft is in a stronger position than cloud peers in the event of a pullback in IT spending.”
“No signs of a slowdown across its cloud or legacy offerings highlight Microsoft’s well-rounded portfolio and resilience in the face of a downturn.”

1202,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 09:13AM ET</span>","Challenged by electric cars, Brembo aims to put the brakes on noise","By Giulio Piovaccari
BERGAMO, Italy (Reuters) - Brembo's (MI:BRBI) distinctive colored brakes stop many of the world's fastest cars but when it comes to the electric vehicles of the future it faces a problem - traditional brakes are noisy.
Without the roar of performance petrol engines to drown out its brakes in action, they risk being a distraction for drivers enjoying the relative silence of their battery powered vehicles.
Developing quieter brakes is just one of the challenges the company faces as it looks to expand beyond its traditional businesses and outrun threats to legacy technology as the auto industry evolves for a digital age.
 Brembo  is developing lighter, electrical brake-by-wire mechanisms used in electric cars to replace traditional hydraulic brakes and faces a threat to its business from so-called regenerative braking systems that capture energy lost when cars slow down and pump it back into the battery.
""Electric engines make no noise, so the braking system could eventually be annoying for the passengers,"" said Brembo's Executive Deputy Chairman Matteo Tiraboschi.
""They might even be watching a movie in the future while sitting in their cars, thanks to autonomous driving, so our aim is also to make braking increasingly quiet,"" he told Reuters at Brembo's headquarters in Bergamo.
Founded in 1961 in a small workshop near the northern Italian city, the family-owned company believes an acquisition is the answer so it can expand into digital devices and keep pace with changes in how cars are designed and used.
Brembo is not alone. German auto parts maker ZF Friedrichshafen, for example, bought U.S. rival Wabco (N:WBC) for over $7 billion this year to strengthen its expertise in autonomous-driving technologies.
""Cars will be more and more a service,"" Tiraboschi said. ""People will look less and less into performance. A bulb's light is either on or off, all electric engines will immediately release they power.""
""What people will look at is interiors, comfort, infotainment,"" he said.
BEYOND BRAKES
Tiraboschi said the brake maker, which supplies premium brands such as  Ferrari  (MI:RACE), Tesla (O:TSLA), BMW (DE:BMWG) and Mercedes (DE:DAIGn) as well as several Formula 1 teams, was looking at the auto sector for acquisitions.
""We must complete the range of products we offer but that must be consistent with what we do,"" he said, adding that Brembo's search was focused on businesses including electronics, autonomous driving and infotainment.
Tiraboschi said in June the company, which has a market capitalization of 3.1 billion euros ($3.5 billion), was eyeing a target of ""significant size"" - even as big as Brembo itself. 
Earlier this year, the company approved a loyalty share scheme that allows its family owners to retain control even if their stake falls below 50% after an acquisition.
While Brembo's sales are expected to fall by about 2%-3% this year from 2.64 billion euros in 2018 due to persistent global weakness in the auto industry, Tiraboschi said he wants to double revenue in the coming years.
""It's hard to do it just with what we do today, as our market shares are already very high,"" he said. ""We must think of something different from braking systems.""
Andrea Balloni, an analyst at Mediobanca, said the revenue goal was ""challenging but doable through an acquisition"".
""However, it poses risks in terms of margin reduction and paying a high premium for the acquisition at a time when the whole automotive sector trades at very low multiples,"" he said. 
The shift towards regenerative brakes, which are connected to the electronic brain of electric cars, could also reduce the amount carmakers and consumers are willing to spend on the traditional callipers, pads and discs, analysts say.
Luca Testa at consultancy AlixPartners said he expected traditional brakes to lose relevance: ""So probably they will be smaller, cheaper and requiring less maintenance.""
Tiraboschi, however, said he was convinced electric mobility did not mark the end of traditional brakes, as high-performance braking systems would be fundamental for heavier cars.
""If you drive on a mountain road or need to brake suddenly, you'll need traditional brakes,"" he said. ""I cannot imagine you'll be able to safely brake just with an electric system - if you drive a high performance car.""

1203,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 09:01AM ET</span>",EU wary of Italy's plan to spare Monte Paschi from loan losses: sources,"By Valentina Za and Stefano Bernabei
MILAN (Reuters) - Italy wants to shield Monte dei Paschi (MI:BMPS) from bad loan losses as it prepares the bailed-out bank for a sale, but faces resistance from European Union competition authorities, two sources close to the matter said.
Italy's Treasury has a year-end deadline to present an outline of its strategy for getting out of the world's oldest bank, which was at the forefront of Italy's banking crisis until a 2017 state bailout was cleared by Brussels.
Under the terms of the bailout, Rome agreed to a tough restructuring plan for Monte dei Paschi and committed to liquidating its 68% stake in the bank by the end of 2021.
But despite disposing of around 30 billion euros in bad loans in recent years, the Tuscan bank still held 16 billion euros in soured debt at the end of June, or 16% of total loans.
This stands in the way of a merger with a rival, several sources familiar with the matter have said, and complicates the Treasury's re-privatisation efforts, with the bank's future central to the consolidation expected to kick off next year among Italy's second-tier lenders, which need to cut costs.
Sources have told Reuters the Treasury wants to lower the impaired debt ratio to 5% by spinning off some 10 billion euros in problem loans that would be merged with the assets of Treasury-owned bad loan manager AMCO.
The proposal entails Monte dei Paschi transferring the loans to AMCO without changes in their accounting value under a 'common control transaction', given that the Treasury controls both entities, four sources familiar with the plan said.
However, two of the sources said the EU Commission's initial reaction had not been positive, which could delay the latest clean-up to the first half of 2020.
The Commission declined to comment. 
LAWSUIT FEAR
EU state aid rules require that any transaction be carried out at market values, implying Monte dei Paschi would need to write down its loans in the event of an outright sale.
The proposed scheme shields Monte dei Paschi from writedowns thanks to an accounting arrangement, often used by private companies, whereby the loss would be booked by the Treasury. 
One of the sources said a sale would imply a 1.5 billion euro loss for Monte dei Paschi, hurting the bank's minority shareholders but not the Treasury, which would benefit from the lower transfer price since its controls 100% of AMCO.
The Treasury fears this could expose it to possible lawsuits from Monte dei Paschi's minority shareholders, leaving the transfer at book value as the only option, the source said.
Monte dei Paschi values debts unlikely to be repaid in full at just over half their nominal value and its worst performing loans at 38%.

That compares with an estimated average price of 27% of nominal value for soured loan transactions in Italy this year, a Banca IFIS report states.

1204,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 08:32AM ET</span>","Norwegian Air shares jump as fleet deal, earnings ease pressure","By Victoria Klesty
OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) unveiled higher-than-expected earnings and a deal to offload 27 new Airbus (PA:AIR) jets, sending its shares sharply higher on hopes that the low-cost carrier can avoid becoming the latest in a series of airline collapses.
The carrier on Thursday posted third-quarter net income of 1.67 billion crowns ($183 million), raised its 2019 savings goal and outlined plans to cut capacity while increasing operating profit by 4 billion crowns over two years. Its stock surged as much as 23%.
Under a long-awaited joint venture, Norwegian will sell its A320 NEO planes on order from Airbus to a new leasing company 70% owned by China Construction Bank (SS:601939), generating a much-needed cash profit on each aircraft due in 2020-2023.
""This company is pulling out all the stops to get better,"" said Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska, who warned last week that Norwegian was approaching a key debt default threshold.
""With a potential gain of up to $10 million per aircraft, it could remove some of the pressure on the equity covenant,"" Roeska said in a note to clients. 
European airlines are braced for a tougher-than-usual winter marked by weakening demand and higher dollar-denominated fuel costs - factors that have already contributed to bankruptcies including Thomas Cook's failure last month.
Norwegian Air's six-year push into transatlantic and Asian routes shook up the long-haul market but led to heavy losses as the carrier expanded too fast.
The airline has slammed on the brakes this year as it raised new capital and postponed debt repayments, but remains burdened by orders placed with Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus for dozens of jets. It canceled five A320 orders earlier this month, according to Airbus data. 
Norwegian has also been punished by problems with Rolls-Royce (L:RR) engines on Boeing's 787 and the grounding of its 737 MAX after two deadly crashes with other operators - forcing their substitution by less efficient models on expensive leases.
CAPACITY CUT 
Norwegian's net income was up 28%, beating the 1.47 billion crowns expected by analysts, according to a Refinitiv poll. 
The carrier also said on Thursday it expects to cut capacity by 10% in 2020 as it drops less profitable destinations yet to be announced. Investors will be updated on the details of its recovery plan in February.
""There will be tough decisions and we will be criticized for closing down routes or doing other things,"" Chairman Niels Smedegaard said, without elaborating on any potential job losses. ""There is no way around it.""
While the company cannot rule out another share issue, Smedegaard told Reuters, ""it's not our main focus.""
The turnaround will also be driven by improved services, pricing and technology, Norwegian said, a week after it announced a partnership with U.S. carrier JetBlue to offer passengers connecting flights on a single booking.
More planes are likely to be transferred to the leasing venture in future, Norwegian said. The 27 Airbus aircraft earmarked so far will save $1.5 billion in capital expenditure, helping to reduce its 61.7 billion crown debt.
The airline cut its spending guidance by $200 million this year and raised it by $100 million for 2020 as it adjusts to the grounding of the 737 MAX, expected to return to service in March at the earliest, according to Chief Executive Geir Karlsen.

Full-year cost cuts will amount to 2.3 billion crowns, beating an earlier 2 billion target, the company predicted. It also narrowed its operating profit goal to between 6.1 and 6.5 billion crowns from 6 to 7 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and restructuring.

The U.S. airline, which has extended cancellations of 737 MAX flights through Jan. 15, had previously said its 2019 pre-tax income would take a $400 million hit because of flight cancellations.
The 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March after two deadly crashes together killed 346 people within five months.
In the latest quarter, American said it took a $140 million hit to its pre-tax income from the ongoing grounding.
The U.S. airline also cut the top end of its 2019 adjusted profit forecast to $5.50 per share. The company had previously forecast a range of $4.50 to $6 per share.
American said net income rose to $425 million, or 96 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $372 million, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier.

(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) reported a 7.2% rise in third-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by strong travel demand and higher fares following flight cancellations due to the grounding of its Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jets.
Shares rose 2% TO $54.25 in premarket trading.
Southwest, the world's largest 737 MAX operator, said it took a $210-million hit to operating income in the quarter from the ongoing MAX safety ban, which followed two deadly crashes on Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines within five months.
Without the MAX, Southwest has fewer seats to sell, pushing up fares when planes are flying near capacity and driving the closely-watched metric of revenues per available seat mile, or unit revenues.
Unit revenue grew 4.2% in the quarter ended Sept. 30, with average fares up 1.7%.
Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said he expects unit revenue growth in the fourth quarter as well, based on current bookings and trends in customer demand, but warned that damages from the MAX groundings would continue to rise into 2020.
Airlines have been negotiating compensation with Boeing but Southwest said no settlement has yet been reached and the company did not include any settlement amounts in quarterly results.
Southwest said it would save some money on the delay in deliveries of more MAX jets, which remain frozen during the grounding, cutting its projected 2019 capital expenditure to between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion from a prior range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. 
That was based on the assumption that Boeing will meet its target of gaining regulatory approval for a MAX return to service in the fourth quarter.
Unit costs excluding fuel and profit-sharing expenses rose 7.6 percent and are expected to grow between 4 percent and 6 percent in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the MAX.
""The non-fuel unit cost outlook is better than previously forecast as the company is executing well despite the MAX grounding,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a note. 
Southwest has said it will need one to two months after 737 MAX regulatory approval to ready its 34 jets for flight and retrain its pilots. As of now it is scheduling without the MAX until Feb. 8.
Net income rose to $659 million, or $1.23 per share from $615 million, or $1.08 per share, a year earlier. Analysts' on average had expected the company to post a profit of $1.08 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Total operating revenue rose 1.1% to $5.64 billion.

1208,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 07:39AM ET</span>",Several states wary of $48 billion opioid settlement proposal,"By Tom Hals and Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - Several U.S. states that have been ravaged by the opioid epidemic are pushing back on a proposed $48 billion settlement framework that would resolve thousands of lawsuits against five drug companies accused of fueling the addiction crisis. 
The proposal would bring an end to all opioid litigation against AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC),  Cardinal Health  Inc (N:CAH) and McKesson Corp (N:MCK), drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Inc (TA:TEVA) (N:TEVA), and Johnson & Johnson (J:JNJ). 
The companies have proposed paying $22.25 billion cash mostly over 18 years, while services and drugs to treat addiction valued at $26 billion by the companies would be provided over the coming decade, mostly by Teva.
Officials in states such as Ohio, New Hampshire and West Virginia -- all hard hit by the deadly drug addition crisis -- voiced concerns about the proposal.
James Boffetti, the associate attorney general for New Hampshire, said in an interview he was troubled that payments were stretched over many years.
""The concern is, I think, the states need money now to create the infrastructure for treatment,"" he said. 
Small states fear the money will be divvied up by population rather than need.
""Any global opioid settlement that doesn't reflect the unique and unprecedented damage imposed on West Virginia through the opioid epidemic should be DOA,"" West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said on Twitter on Tuesday. 
Some 400,000 U.S. overdose deaths between 1997 and 2017 were linked to opioids, according to government data. Roughly 2,600 lawsuits have been brought nationwide by states, local and tribal governments.
The three distributors in a joint statement said they were committed to finalizing a global settlement and would continue working with the other parties on the details of the framework. Teva declined to comment. 
J&J said in a securities filing on Wednesday the deal would lower third quarter profit by $3 billion.
The proposal, announced on Monday, was hammered out by the companies and attorneys general in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas. 
It will need broad support among state attorneys general and will have to overcome opposition from the lawyers representing local governments that sued. Those lawyers declined to sign on when presented the proposal last week.
Under the settlement framework, money for each state would be divvied up, with 15% going to the state treasury, 15% for local governments that filed lawsuits and 70% going to a proposed state fund aimed at addressing the crisis.
Boffetti predicted it would takes weeks for states to determine whether they back the settlement framework.
North Carolina's attorney general, Josh Stein, acknowledged that a detailed term sheet needs to be developed.
""There are a lot of details and mechanics that need to be added to it,"" Stein told Reuters in an interview. ""That will happen in the coming weeks."" 
The proposal did win a major supporter on Tuesday. Tom Miller of Iowa, the longest-serving attorney general, publicly backed the proposal, calling the framework ""an important step in addressing the crisis.""
Colorado's attorney general, Phil Weiser, called it a ""very promising development.""
The lawsuits accuse distributors of failing to flag and halt a rising tide of suspicious orders and drugmakers of overstating the benefits of opioids while downplaying the risks.
The companies have denied any wrongdoing. Drugmakers say their products carried government-approved labels that warned of the addictive risks of opioids, while distributors argue their role was to make sure medicines prescribed by licensed doctors were available for patients. 
The proposed deal has widened a fault line between attorneys general and local governments.
Cities and counties generally hired private attorneys to bring their cases, and attorneys general want to limit the amount of the settlement that goes to pay private lawyers. The attorneys for local governments also generally opposed Teva contributing opioid treatment drugs to the settlement, instead of cash, in part because of concerns that the framework placed an inflated value on those drugs. 
Last week's talks failed to reach a global deal, and on Monday, the three wholesale distributors and Teva struck a last-minute $260 million settlement with two Ohio counties, averting the first federal trial over opioids.
North Carolina's Stein said he looked forward to resolving concerns about the proposal and warned that settling lawsuits individually was unsustainable.

""If we proceed on the current path and each county and city brings their case and extracts whatever amount they may be able to get from these companies, the companies will end up bankrupt,"" he said. ""The opioid crisis is a national problem that demands a national solution.""

(Reuters) - Dow Inc (N:DOW) beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter profit on Thursday as its efforts to cut costs helped offset weaker prices for its chemicals used in making plastics.
An oversupply of ethylene and polyethylene as well as the impact of U.S.-China trade tensions on demand for chemicals had forced Dow to forecast lower-than-expected third-quarter revenue and cut full-year spending in July.
Dow, which makes chemicals used in paints, cosmetics and plastics, said it saved about $1.37 billion as part of a cost reduction program, while cutting additional $40 million in expenses in the latest quarter. 
Dow, created in April from DowDuPont's three-way split and still one of the world's biggest makers of chemicals, is wrestling with a slowing global economy that has hit demand for much of the end-products made using its materials.
Larger rival Germany's BASF (DE:BASFn) reported a 24% drop in operating income for the July-September quarter on Thursday.
Dow's sales volumes fell 2% in the third quarter, while prices declined 12%, the company said in a statement. 
While the recent attack on Saudi oil major Aramco and outages in the United States were expected to boost prices, additional capacity from China and Korea as well as low demand amid trade tensions have dampened the impact.
Dow said it had taken measures to boost prices, adding that prices for polyethylene had risen in September. 
Sister companies DuPont (N:DD), which makes chemicals used in the automotive and electronic industries, and Corteva , which makes pesticides and insecticides, are set to post their quarterly reports on Oct 31.
Dow's net income available to shareholders fell to $333 million, or 45 cents per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30 from $1.01 billion, or $1.36 per share, a year earlier. 
Excluding items, Dow posted operating earning of 91 cents per share, beating estimates of 73 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Net sales fell 15.2% to $10.76 billion, marginally beating analysts' estimate of $10.74 billion.

Dow shares have fallen nearly 15% since it started trading on April 2 to Wednesday's close.

The carmaker is now reaching out to potential buyers for its factories in the UK and Spain, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. (https://bloom.bg/2MGjklx)
""At this time, we have no plans to sell those plants in Europe,"" the company said in an email statement.
Nissan is likely to axe its Datsun brand, drop some unprofitable products and close a number of assembly lines worldwide, as it seeks to boost profits by getting smaller, Reuters reported on Wednesday citing two company sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
All markets with factories except China were being looked at for possible reductions in production capacity, one of the sources told Reuters on Wednesday. However, there were no plans to close an entire plant or withdraw completely from any country, the source added.

(Reuters) - More than half a million homes and businesses in California could lose power this week as utilities including Pacific Gas & Electric (N:PCG) and Southern (NYSE:SO) California Edison (A:SCE_pe) cut off electricity as a preventive measure against wildfires.
Over 308,000 customers in seven counties, including Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Ventura in southern California, are under the Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) consideration, Southern California Edison said.
Shutoffs from SCE could start early Thursday.
Meanwhile, PG&E has shut off power in 15 counties, affecting about 178,000 customers in those areas. The company said additional power shutoffs for parts of San Mateo County and Kern County were expected to begin at about 1 a.m. (0800 GMT) on Thursday, affecting more than 1,000 customers.
San Diego Gas & Electric Co has also identified more than 41,000 customers under PSPS consideration, but has not implemented any power shutoffs on Thursday.
Forecaster Marc Chenard said the worst of the winds would arrive on Thursday afternoon and into Friday.
""It looks like at its worst, southern California will see wind gusts of 55 mph. Down in some of the coastal areas the winds could reach 75 mph later today,"" he said.
Power lines could be knocked down and start fires among dry trees and vegetation, according to earlier forecasts.
Bankrupt Californian power producer PG&E cut off electricity to more than 730,000 homes and workplaces in northern California earlier this month to try to reduce wildfire risks posed by extremely windy and dry weather.
Chenard added that northern California could experience dangerous wind gusts of up to 45 mph. ""This is not going to abate until at least this weekend.""

1222,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 06:44AM ET</span>",Here’s What Wall Street Is Saying About Tesla’s Surprise Profit,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares surged in late trading after the electric-car maker posted its first profit in almost a year. Tesla now has to live up to this performance and show progress in coming quarters too, according to analysts.
Elon Musk defied the expectations of those who doubted Tesla could return to profitability and meet aggressive timelines, delivering a result that few saw coming and declaring he’s ahead of schedule on a new plant and the Model Y crossover. Tesla earned $1.86 a share in the third quarter, exceeding the most optimistic projection by a wide margin and beating the consensus estimate for a 24-cent loss.
Still, while welcomed by investors, the positive numbers didn’t dispel some analysts’ doubts, such as concerns around the sustainability of strong gross margins, according to brokers including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), which said it’s “not sure this is the breakout quarter claimed.”
Piper Jaffray (overweight)
Tesla’s share gain in after-hours is “justified” as it posted “a surprising profit,” the broker said, adding that “it’s getting harder to poke holes in the TSLA thesis”While skeptics had “legitimate concerns” in the past, the company is now building cash, winning market share and boosting margins, while readying to launch products in untapped segments and regions“Even considering all the EV-related fanfare from competitors, it’s hard to see how other auto companies can catch up with Tesla -- at least in the next 3+ years”Believes investors underestimate Tesla’s ability to consolidate the automotive marketRoth Capital (neutral, PT up to $249 from $224)
Tesla posted “robust” EPS on gross-margin strength in the third quarter; the carmaker’s volatile quarterly EPS progression should have investors “closely scrutinizing sustainable profit levels, and credible growth rates in an increasingly competitive environment”Projects that decelerating deliveries growth in 2020 will drive multiple compression and is cautious at current levelsCiti (sell)
More positives than negatives as Tesla posts a quarterly beat driven by higher gross margins, lower operating expenses and higher “other-income”While an initial positive stock reaction is “understandable” given the underperformance this year and the clear progress in margin and free cash flow, Citi’s impression is that it “won’t necessarily resolve all prevailing bull/bear debates seeing that earnings quality was less than ideal”RBC Capital (underperform, PT $220 from $190)
Third-quarter results were better than expected, but the stock reaction seems overdone and valuation is still stretched; the stock “seems to be discounting a lot of good already”While total and automotive revenue fell from a year earlier and sequentially, the auto gross margin ex. credits came in at 20.8% vs consensus of 18.3%; “no growth, but cost control -- sounds like an automaker”JPMorgan (underweight, PT up to $220 vs $200)
While highlighting the magnitude of the beat in the quarter, JPMorgan says it’s “unsure that this is really the breakout quarter that is likely to be claimed by the bulls”3Q gross margin beat at 20.8% vs JPMorgan estimate of 18.7% and consensus at 18.3%; says it’s not certain about the quality of this beat, while noting that a gross margin-driven beat suggests that Tesla is making progress on this frontOddo BHF (not rated)

1223,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 06:36AM ET</span>",Saudi Arabia's new bankruptcy law faces key test in the courts,"By Stephen Kalin
RIYADH (Reuters) - The merit of Saudi Arabia's new bankruptcy law, part of efforts to help the kingdom attract investors, should become clearer in about a year after courts handle initial cases, a World Bank representative and senior government official told Reuters.
A lack of modern bankruptcy regulations had created difficulties for struggling companies seeking to restructure debt with creditors since the 2009 global financial crisis and the more recent dip in oil prices.
Legislation introduced in 2018 is part of broader efforts to overhaul the economy of the world's top oil exporter to entice foreign investment, create jobs for young Saudis and diversify into non-oil industries.
""They have started on insolvency,"" said Simeon Djankov, World Bank senior research director and founder of the Doing Business report, which on Thursday ranked Saudi Arabia's business climate the most improved over the previous year.
""The law has been passed, secondary legislation was already passed. Now we need to see whether the courts actually understand how to implement it.""
Djankov said only three cases had been settled and around a dozen others are currently in the courts. Several dozen more, expected to be resolved over the next year, should provide enough evidence to evaluate the law's success, he added.
The two main open cases involve conglomerates Saad Group, owned by indebted billionaire Maan al-Sanea, and Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi and Brothers (AHAB), which defaulted on about $22 billion in combined debt in 2009.
Resolving insolvency was an area of improvement for Saudi Arabia, climbing 30 places to 62nd in the World Bank report which showed sharp improvement in other Gulf countries and a lag in Latin America.
Eiman al-Mutairi, who heads Saudi Arabia's National Competitiveness Center, said she expects further advances next year as the bankruptcy law and other reforms come fully on line, including a building code law and planned amendments to licensing regimes.
""Are we there yet? No. Do we want to do more? Absolutely,"" said Mutairi, who is one of the highest-ranking women in the Saudi government. ""Hopefully this is only the beginning.""
She attributed the jump in Saudi Arabia's standing to authorities' efforts to cater their reforms to the private sector's concerns.
""Maybe we've worked with investors many years ago but sometimes we just don't listen to them,"" she said. ""Let’s face it: we did not listen to the investor."""

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's  Hyundai Motor  pledged to boost sales of electric vehicles (EV) to over half a million by 2025 as part of a bid to focus on new technologies and catch up with rivals, but some analysts saw the target as conservative and warned of the costs. 
The announcement by Hyundai (KS:005380), the world's fifth largest car maker along with affiliate Kia Motors (KS:000270), underscores the accelerating strategy shift under Euisun Chung who became the motor group's executive vice chairman last year.
Hyundai announced a $35 billion investment last week in mobility and other auto technologies by 2025, less than a month after unveiling a $1.6 billion deal to develop self-driving vehicle technologies with Aptiv (N:APTV).
The firm said on Thursday it plans to launch 16 EV models by 2025 to boost sales of such vehicles 17-fold to 560,000 by that year.
Still, that would be equivalent to just over 10% of its projected global sales this year.
The projection compares with more bullish forecasts offered by its bigger rivals. Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) expects to make 22 million EVs over the next decade, while General Motors (N:GM) aims to sell 1 million EVs annually by 2026.
""That is not an ambitious target. If Hyundai fails to boost volumes fast enough, costs of electric cars will weigh on profitability,"" Lee Jae-il, an analyst at Eugene Securities & Investment. 
Hyundai said, that the EV market would face intensifying competition and oversupply soon and automakers failing to meet toughening European emissions regulations will face heavy penalties and suffer a serious blow to their reputation.
""EV supply is expected to surpass demand from the second half of next year,"" Ka Suk-hyun, vice president of Hyundai Motor, told an earnings conference call.
QUALITY ISSUES
Hyundai's third-quarter net profit rose 59% to 427 billion won ($365 million), well below the average 684 billion profit estimate of analysts based on Refinitiv data, due to 600 billion won provisions it earmarked to address potential engine defects in the United States and South Korea. 
Quality issues have been a major drag in Hyundai's attempt to steer a recovery from six consecutive annual profit declines and constrained its financial firepower to invest in future technologies. It is still under investigation by U.S regulators and prosecutors over potential faulty engines in some models.
Total retail sales fell 3% in the third quarter, as higher U.S. sales, led by a favorable South Korean won and strong demand for sport utilities vehicles, were offset by drops in China and South Korean sales. 
Hyundai's passenger car sales in China fell 7% in the third quarter, after Hyundai closed one of its factories in Beijing.
Hyundai expected its profitability to improve in the current quarter thanks to the launches of new models such as its first premium SUV under its new Genesis brand, as well as higher production of Palisade SUVs. 
Hyundai heir Chung also faces challenges in shoring up investor confidence as he prepares a new proposal to revamp the ownership structure of parent Hyundai Motor Group, of which the car maker is the flagship, as part of a succession plan. 
The group's previous proposal was scrapped last year following opposition from U.S. hedge fund Elliott. 

Hyundai shares rose 0.8% after the earnings announcement, versus the wider market (KS11) which rose 0.2%. The shares are up about 2.5% in 2019 after slumping 24% last year.

1228,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 06:01AM ET</span>",Asian currencies benefit from Sino-U.S. trade deal hopes: Reuters poll,"By Aby Jose Koilparambil
(Reuters) - Sentiment toward most Asian currencies picked up in the past two weeks, a Reuters poll showed, amid positive signals that trade tensions between the United States and China waning.
Hopes of a resolution gained momentum after U.S. President Donald Trump said a deal could be signed by the time Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings take place in Chile in mid November.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer tempered the expectations, saying that the administration was aiming to finalize a deal on the first phase of the agreement in time for the APEC meetings.
Tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the world's two biggest economies on each other's goods have roiled financial markets for more than a year now and fueled worries about an economic downturn, with the International Monetary Fund forecasting global growth to weaken to 3% in 2019, the slowest pace in a decade.
""The rationale behind the trend (of recent strengthening in regional currencies and prospective further firmness) is the de-escalation of China-U.S. trade tensions to some extent,"" said Mitul Kotecha, senior emerging markets strategist at TD Securities.
The dollar has come under significant pressure in recent times and that has turned beneficial for the emerging market currencies, Kotecha said.
Investors turned bullish on the Singapore dollar for the first time since April end, and switched to long positions on the Philippine peso since early August.
Bullish bets were back on Indonesia's rupiah as well, after going short in the previous two polls.
Underpinning the broader positive sentiment, investors scaled back short positions on the Chinese yuan , the Korean won , the Indian rupee and the Malaysian ringgit , according to a Reuters poll of 15 respondents.
Short bets on the yuan and the Indian rupee are at their lowest since mid July and mid August respectively, while bearish bets on the won are at the weakest level since switching from long positions in January.
""The central banks (in Asia) keep on easing policy and with inflation remaining low, the inflows into the region will strengthen and that will benefit the currencies,"" Kotecha added.
On Thursday, Indonesia's central bank cut its benchmark rate for a fourth time since July, as it seeks to spur growth in an economy that is likely to slow this year.
A couple of weeks back, Singapore's central bank eased monetary policy for the first time in three years, as widely expected, while South Korea has kept the door open and Malaysia too might opt for another cut.
Other factors have also contributed to the positive sentiment, with the rupiah slated to appreciate further on expectations of continued fiscal discipline after Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati retained her position in the new cabinet.
The Reuters survey is focused on what analysts believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the yuan, the won, the Singapore dollar, the rupiah, the Taiwan dollar , the Indian rupee, the Philippine peso, the Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht .
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3.
A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long on U.S. dollars. The figures included positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs)."

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Vattenfall (VATN.UL) has applied for a new license to build a 350-400 megawatt offshore wind farm in southern Sweden, a plan that could pave the way for investment in a cross-border cable to share power, its chief executive told Reuters.
The farm, which had been granted a now-expired license, is the Swedish part of a larger park called Kriegers Flak to be shared with Denmark and Germany.
Vattenfall is currently building the Danish side, a 600 megawatt project, that has already been licensed.
The company will decide whether to proceed with the Swedish farm after a decision on the license. If approved, the wind farm would be Vattenfall's first in its home country, a market where it has faced opposition on a second project that the military rejected earlier this week.
""We are looking at the possibility to actually connect both (farms) to the German side and to the Danish side. If that is a possibility we think that it will be a good idea via a new interconnector,"" Vattenfall CEO Magnus Hall said, referring to the cross-border power cable.
Building cables is not Vattenfall's main activity and the firm may initially invest in building the link and later sell it, Hall added.
The cable would not be online by 2025, as Vattenfall sees offshore wind projects developing in Sweden only after that year, when demand for more electrification will rise.
Hall urged clarity around regulations after Vattenfall and  Wallenstam  (ST:WALLb) had to call off efforts to develop a joint offshore 300 MW wind project in Sweden, after the armed forces rejected a revised plan to build fewer but higher turbines.
""We need to make sure that we have this discussion about the connection to the military and plan out the rules. How is it going to look and where can we really build. To have much more of a clear view going forward,"" he said.
""Now we need to take this discussion on a high level basis with the Swedish military.""
Vattenfall is also doing some preparatory work for potential projects in other locations in Sweden, Hall said."

Investing.com -- Has the German economy touched bottom?
The stock market thinks so: the DAX index rose to its highest since May last year Thursday after upbeat earnings from market heavyweights   Daimler   (DE:DAIGn) and BASF (DE:BASFN) gave rise to hopes that the worst of a two-way squeeze from Brexit and the U.S.-China trade war may be over. That helped the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 rise 0.5% to its highest since January last year. It's now less than 1% away from the 400 level.
Meanwhile, the purchasing managers’ index for German manufacturing rose moderately in October as uncertainty over Brexit lifted – although the indicator (like the Brexit saga) has provided a few false dawns this year.
Daimler’s numbers – the first to be presented by new chief executive Ola Kallenius - were particularly eye-catching: the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars and vans posted an 8% rise in revenue in the quarter, as sales of its vans rose by over 10% from a year earlier, while car sales rose 8%. That offset a weak performance by its truck division, reflecting the sharp slowdown in global business investment this year.
Daimler’s shares rose 4.6% to a five-month high. They’re now up 30% from the six-year low that they hit less than two months ago. That’s despite another warning on Thursday that there will be further legal costs arising from the Dieselgate scandal. The third-quarter numbers were hit by an 870 million-euro ($970 million) diesel-related fine.
Daimler’s woes have been partly homegrown but also partly due to external circumstances. The outlook for the next few quarters, for example, will no longer be burdened by distortions from the front-loading of vehicle registrations last year to get around new emissions rules in the EU.
However, the global auto market remains depressed, with both the Chinese and U.S. markets misfiring. The threat of U.S. sanctions on EU car imports remains, even if President Donald Trump’s track record of backing down is likely to extend itself as he tries to keep the economy on track in the year leading up to the next presidential elections. Some analysts say that 2018’s sales levels won’t be seen again until 2022.
The auto industry, naturally, has a heavy weighting in the DAX. As such, it matters that sentiment towards the sector appears to be turning after a long period of underperformance. In the last month, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) shares have gained 13%, while BMW (DE:BMWG) has risen 9%. Components group Schaeffler (DE:SHA_p) is up 15%, while companies such as materials group Covestro (DE:1COV), which relies on the sector for a large part of its sales, has risen 5%.
Elsewhere Thursday on a busy day for earnings, the U.K. FTSE 100 rose 0.7%, helped by strong updates and raised guidance from pharma group AstraZeneca (LON:AZN) and miner   Polymetal   (LON:POLYP)."

BERLIN (Reuters) - German sportswear group Puma (DE:PUMG) cautioned on Thursday that it would take a hit from U.S. tariffs on China in the fourth quarter but still raised its sales forecast and narrowed its profit target after a strong third quarter in all regions.
""So far everybody is eating the tariffs in their margins,"" Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden told journalists, adding that he expected rivals to increase U.S. prices, but Puma would not hike first as it is not the market leader.
Instead, Puma would seek to shift even more production for the U.S. market from China to countries like Vietnam and Indonesia, Gulden said. 
Production in China for the U.S. market has already been cut to about 20% from more than 50% five years ago, he said.
That has incurred extra costs as some styles are now produced in two places. However, it has not led to reducing production in China because the domestic market there is growing so fast and has absorbed volume previously destined for the United States. 
""The fourth quarter will be the first quarter where the U.S. tariffs on China will have an impact. Currently, without price increases, this is putting pressure on EBIT, at least in the short term,"" Gulden said.
Puma said its third quarter sales rose by a currency adjusted 17% to 1.48 billion euros ($1.65 billion), beating average analyst forecasts for 1.45 billion, while operating earnings were up 25% to 162 million euros, in line with analyst expectations.
Inventories rose 28% to 1.14 billion euros as Puma front-loaded products for the United States to beat the tariff rise.
Puma's shares, which have risen by almost three quarters in the last year, were down 2.8% at 0842 GMT, the second biggest loser on the German mid-cap index <.MDAX>.
The company's growth has been outpacing rivals like Adidas (DE:ADSGn) and  Nike  (N:NKE), which recently reported that its quarterly revenue and profit beat market expectations as a push to sell sneakers direct to consumers gained pace, boosting margins.
Puma said it now expects currency-adjusted sales to rise around 15% for the full year, up from a previous forecast for 13%, while operating earnings will come in at 420 million euros to 430 million euros, versus a previous 410-430 million range.
In the third quarter, Puma's sales rose 28.5% in Asia/Pacific and 17.9% in the Americas and recovered in Europe, the Middle East and Africa to 9.7%.
Growth in the Americas was powered by Puma's return to selling basketball products, while the European market was holding up well despite the lack of a major soccer tournament, Gulden said.

(Reuters) - European shares gained on Thursday as upbeat results from German companies offset a dour profit forecast from Nokia and a mixed bag of business sentiment indicators ahead of the European Central Bank's October policy meeting.
The pan-European stock index (STOXX) rose 0.3% by 0815 GMT, on track to reach its highest level this month with German stocks (GDAXI) driven by robust earnings from  Daimler  and a confirmation from chemicals giant BASF of its annual outlook.
""Companies like BASF and Daimler which had reduced earnings earlier this year today said they aren't cutting their outlook any further,"" said Chris Bailey, European strategist at brokerage Raymond James. 
""Even though that is not brilliant what you want to see as an investor is an end to the downgrades."" 
Daimler (DE:DAIGn) jumped 4.7% after higher sales of its Mercedes-Benz cars boosted operating profit for the third-quarter, helping the sub-index of auto stocks (SXAP) reach its highest since early May. 
BMW (DE:BMWG) and PSA Group (PA:PEUP) both gained over 1%, lifting some of the gloom surrounding the sector after last week's poor results from  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Volvo (ST:VOLVb). 
Healthcare stocks (SXDP) were also higher after AstraZeneca (L:AZN) gained 3.2% on a strong set of numbers that spurred another hike in its product sales forecast. 
European markets entered the third quarter earnings season this month in nervous form, with signs that Germany was heading into recession weighing on expectations for growth across the region. 
ECB chief Mario Draghi holds his last meeting on Thursday after eight years at the helm with monetary policy appearing to have reached its limits for the euro area. His successor Christine Lagarde is expected to ask member governments for fiscal support to help energize growth.
On a sour note, Nokia (HE:NOKIA) was on track for its worst day since 2001, plummeting 21% after cutting its 2019 and 2020 profit outlook as the company faces pressure from rivals in the 5G industry.

The telecom maker's report dragged tech stocks (SX8P) lower for a third straight day, and weighed on Helsinki-listed stocks (OMXHPI), which fell 2%.

DUBAI/ABU DHABI/RIYADH (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) founder and CEO Masayoshi Son will attend an investment conference in Saudi Arabia next week, two people familiar with the matter said, as the Japanese company seeks to raise funds for a second technology fund.
Attending the Saudi Future Investment Initiative (FII) on Oct. 29-31 could offer Son a chance meet delegates from the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, major investors in Softbank's first $100 billion technology fund.
Riyadh's Public Investment Fund (PIF) contributed $40 billion to the Softbank Vision fund and Abu Dhabi's Mubadala committed $15 billion.
Mubadala has said it was considering investing in Softbank Vision 2 and sources have said PIF held talks on the issue, but neither have announced any decision.
SoftBank was not immediately available to comment on the visit by Son, who also travelled to the kingdom last year.
SoftBank Group agreed on Tuesday to spend more than $10 billion to take over WeWork, doubling down on an ill-fated investment in the office-space sharing startup that has racked up losses.
PIF and Mubadala have not commented on Softbank's bailout of WeWork. Sources close to the two funds said they were not too concerned about the WeWork investment, saying the two funds were focused on all 80 or so firms the Softbank vehicle invests in.

1234,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 04:41AM ET</span>",India Orders Wireless Carriers to Pay $13 Billion in Dues,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s top court ordered eight telecom carriers, including   Bharti Airtel   Ltd. (NS:BRTI). and   Vodafone   (LON:VOD) Idea Ltd (NS:VODA)., to pay the government as much as 920 billion rupees ($13 billion) in past dues, dealing a blow to the businesses already struggling to make profits and pare debt.
The Supreme Court, in a ruling read out by a two-judge bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra, said it will decide on the timeline for payments. Thursday’s decision possibly puts an end to the two-decades-old legal dispute over airwaves fees owed to the government.
The operators have disputed for years over how authorities calculate their annual adjusted gross revenue, a share of which is paid as license and spectrum fees. With the ruling, the court upheld the government’s method, while rejecting the companies’ plea to exclude revenue from non-telecommunications businesses.
The court order is the latest shock to an industry that has piled on billions of dollars in debt to roll out 3G and 4G networks in the past decade, even as intense competition for users led to a brutal tariff war, weighing on earnings. Bharti, controlled by tycoon Sunil Mittal, and billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s venture with Vodafone (LON:VOD) have a combined net debt of almost $28 billion.
The worst hit are the operators who have been in the business for more than 10 years, while it is far less consequential for Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., which entered in 2016 and owes the least among all -- 130 million rupees.
Shares of  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) Idea plunged as much as 23% to a record low, while Airtel tumbled as much as 9.7%, the biggest intraday loss since October 2012.   Reliance Industries   Ltd (NS:RELI), the parent of Jio, rose 1.5%.
Stay Afloat
Since Jio disrupted the market with free calls and cheap data, the incumbents have struggled to stay afloat. Two have entered insolvency in the past two years, while some have merged to combine forces, like Vodafone’s local unit with  Idea Cellular  Ltd.
For the government that runs perennial budget deficits, the court ruling comes as a fiscal bonanza. On Wednesday, Telecommunications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad revealed a $6 billion spending plan to revive two money-losing state-run carriers.
The government had raised a total demands of around 920 billion rupees against all telecom operators, including defunct ones, according to filings in the court.
In the past two years, two of India’s biggest telecom operators -- Malaysian tycoon T. Ananda Krishnan’s Aircel Ltd., and Anil Ambani’s Reliance Communications Ltd. -- went into bankruptcy. The huge demands can also disrupt their resolution process scaring away potential buyers.
High capital spending, dividends and spectrum costs have resulted in neutral or negative free cash flow for telecom companies in South and Southeast Asian countries including India, according to a Moody’s Investors Service note on Oct. 23. Moody’s expects these trends to continue through at least 2021, and doesn’t expect telcos will generate enough cash to pay down debt.
The leading telcos in India pay the largest share of their aggregate revenue for spectrum at 7.6%, followed by Thailand at 7.3% and Bangladesh at 7%, Moody’s said.
The legal dispute dates back to the 1999 telecom policy that mandated license and spectrum fee to be paid by operators as a share of their revenue. Telecom companies have argued that only core income accrued from use of spectrum should be considered for calculation of adjusted gross revenue, while the government has argued that revenue from all operations must be included.
A lower court had ruled in favor of telecom companies but the federal government’s department of telecommunications challenged the ruling in the top court and kept adding to demands, including penalties for all the years."
1235,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 04:08AM ET</span>","Daimler third-quarter operating profit up 8%, boosted by Mercedes sales","FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) reported a slight rise in third-quarter operating profit on Thursday boosted by sales of Mercedes-Benz cars, sending its shares higher, but announced cost cuts and warned legal provisions tied to diesel litigation could rise. 
Group earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) rose 8% to 2.69 billion euros, up from 2.49 billion euros in the year-earlier period, boosted by an 8% rise in sales of luxury cars and solid cashflow. 
Daimler shares were 5.4% higher in early trading.
Daimler said it would review costs after the margin at Mercedes-Benz Cars dropped to 6%, down from 6.3% in the year-earlier period due to production problems with the Mercedes GLS and because cars were being fitted with costly anti-emissions filters. 
""In order to master the transformation in the next few years, we need to increase our efforts considerably: we have to significantly reduce our costs and consistently strengthen our cash flow,"" Chief Executive Ola Kaellenius said, without elaborating.
Philippe Houchois, analyst at Jeffries who has an underperform rating on Daimler, said third-quarter results revealed disappointing margins at Mercedes cars and weaker than expected profit at the trucks division but solid cashflow. 
Daimler is due to give a detailed presentation on strategy and costs on November 14 and Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm said investors should not expect a strategy U-turn.
Daimler reiterated that it expected group earnings before interest and taxes to be significantly lower than last year, and warned it now sees revenue at the trucks division to be at the year-earlier level instead of expecting slight revenue growth. 

Daimler said current legal proceedings tied to diesel emissions may result in additional expenditures which may hit profits at Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans.

1236,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 03:45AM ET</span>",South Korea to start Samsung heir Lee's bribery trial on Friday,"By Heekyong Yang and Ju-min Park
SEOUL (Reuters) - A bribery trial involving the heir of South Korea's Samsung Group will start on Friday after the country's top court ruled earlier this year that the case should be reviewed by a lower court, raising the possibility of a tougher sentence.
The Supreme Court overturned in August part of an appeals court bribery conviction against Samsung's de facto chief Jay Y. Lee, who had been given a two-and-a-half-year suspended sentence for seeking favor from South Korea's former president Park Geun-hye.
The court said the interpretation by the Seoul High Court on what constituted bribes by Samsung to Park was too narrow.
""The Seoul High Court is unlikely to make a decision within this year, because prosecutors and his lawyers are fighting harder in this round,"" said Jun Ji-hyun, a lawyer who is not involved in the case.
Lee, 51, is expected to attend Friday's hearing, which is required by law for defendants in criminal cases, according to legal experts.
The case against Lee centered on whether three horses donated by Samsung Group (SAGR.UL) should be considered bribes aimed at winning Park's favor in the conglomerate's succession planning. The horses were given to the daughter of Park's confidante, Choi Seo-won, a professional equestrian. 
The Supreme Court said the appeals court erred in not recognizing the horses as bribes given by Samsung to win favors, raising the possibility of Lee returning to jail.
Lee, vice chairman of the group's crown jewel Samsung Electronics Co (KS:005930), has already served one year of detention but walked free last year after the appellate court halved a lower court's five-year jail sentence and suspended it for three years.
Samsung declined to comment officially.
""We hope to see the end of this uncertainty as soon as possible,"" said a company source who requested anonymity, referring to the legal procedures.
The trial comes as South Korea's President Moon Jae-in seeks help from big business leaders to resuscitate a fragile economy, which data showed on Thursday slowed more than expected in the third quarter.
Moon thanked Lee for Samsung's commitment at a ceremony this month unveiling an $11 billion investment in display technologies.

The Supreme Court last week closed a separate bribery case involving Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin, allowing him to stay out of jail with a suspended jail sentence.

Pharma group AstraZeneca (LON:AZN) raised its sales guidance for the year after reporting a strong third quarter driven by 30% revenue growth in China.
It now expects sales at constant exchange rates to rise ""by a low to mid-teens percentage"", having earlier guided for just over 10%. Reported earnings per share fell 15% in constant exchange rates due to a one-off gain last year. Stripped of that factor, EPS rose by 38 to $2.61. 
The company's cancer drugs performed particularly strongly, with sales rising 67% at constant exchange rates.
""With AstraZeneca growing at pace, our sales guidance has been upgraded for the second consecutive quarter. Another strong performance from our new medicines accompanied impressive results in our key markets, most notably in China, the US and Japan,"" CEO Pascal Soriot said in a statement. ""The performance reinforces our confidence in delivering sustainable earnings growth.""

Royal Bank of Scotland PLC (LON:RBS) swung to a net loss of 315 million pounds ($409 million) in the third quarter, due mainly to a 900 million pound charge for PPI claims. The bank's core lending and markets businesses also suffered, with NatWest Markets swinging to a loss of 193 million pounds due to falling interest rates around the world, while the net margin on its loan book fell by 5 basis points to 1.97% due to intense competition in the U.K. mortgage market.
The PPI charge is at the top end of the range provided for by the bank last month.

Publishing and events group Relx (LON:REL) reported underlying revenue growth up 4% in the first nine months of 2019, noting ""some improvement in underlying metrics compared to the first half across all four business areas"" but still predicting only modest sales growth for the year.


Russian-focused gold and silver miner   Polymetal   (LON:POLYP) said revenue rose 43% to $656 million on the back of higher sales volumes and prices. It also said it's likely to exceed its predicted full-year output of 1.55 million ounces by as much as 50,000oz.

Gold equivalent (""GE"") production grew by 7% year-on-year to 476,000oz, driven by the new Kyzyl mine, which contributed 94,000oz. 
Kyzyl is now producing 11% more concentrate on a steady state basis than originally designed. 
The company output mix shifted in favor of gold as silver output from its older Dukat mine declined as planned


Investment platform  AJ Bell  (LON:AJBA) said customer numbers increased by 17% on the year to 232,066, while total assets under administration rose 13% to 52.3 billion pounds. 


Platform customers increased by 34,956 to 218,169, up 19% on the year. Underlying platform inflows were 5.4 billion pounds, just above last year's 5.2 billion. Transfers from defined benefit pensions added a further £0.9 billion.
 



Software group AVEVA (LON:AVV) said it achieved low double-digit revenue growth on a proforma constant currency basis in the first half.


""This growth reflects a continuation of the strong sales execution seen in Q1, and further benefited from the early renewal of a large EPC contract and a moderate increase in revenue from multi-year contracts,"" the company said in a brief statement
It added that the numbers were boosted by the drop in sterling in the quarter.

1241,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 01:45AM ET</span>",Tesla Packs Profit Report With Positivity as Musk Breaks Mold,"(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk flipped the script on those who doubted Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. could return to profitability and meet aggressive timelines, delivering positive earnings few saw coming and declaring he’s ahead of schedule on a new plant and product.
The electric-car maker earned $1.86 a share in the third quarter, exceeding the most optimistic projection by a wide margin and beating the consensus estimate for a 24-cent loss. On top of that, Musk peppered investors with positive updates: Tesla’s new factory in China is already starting production, the Model Y crossover will launch months earlier than expected next year and the long languishing energy business is showing signs of life.
It all added up to a report that broke the mold for Musk, 48, who’s notorious for setting stretch goals that take longer to pull off than he plans. Tesla still faces challenges: quarterly revenue fell for the first time since 2012, and the company has posted the occasional profit in the past that it’s been unable to sustain. But after reporting reined-in expenses that padded gross profit margins, the shares climbed in late trading to levels last seen in February.
“If you look at the margins and the profitability, that’s the major feather in the cap for the bulls,” Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said on Bloomberg Television. “If they can maintain this, this could be a potential game changer for them going forward.”
Tesla shares climbed as much as 21% to $308.50 in late trading. The stock was down 23% this year through Wednesday’s close. The company’s 5.3% bonds rose 2 cents on the dollar to 93.75 cents, according to Trace, the highest level since March 2018.
Trial output of the Model 3 is underway at the factory Tesla began building early this year on the outskirts of Shanghai. Producing the sedan locally enables Musk to charge less for the car by avoiding import duties. The factory “opens up a whole new market” for the company, said Gene Munster, a managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures.
Production and deliveries of the Model Y, which shares underpinnings with the Model 3, will start in the summer of next year, rather than the fall. Musk -- never one to back down from outlandish predictions -- said the crossover could outsell the Model S, X and 3 combined.
Elon Musk Set Up China Plant in Record Time—Now the Hard Part
A new Tesla pickup, which Musk has teased on Twitter and said could be unveiled next month, is the company’s “best product ever,” he told analysts on the earnings call.
‘Niche Products’
The CEO was as candid as he’s ever been about the extent to which Tesla is no longer focused on the high-priced Model S and X, both of which can sell for six figures, calling them “really niche products.”
“To be totally frank, we’re continuing to make them more for sentimental reasons than anything else,” he said. “They’re only of minor importance to the future.”
For all of Musk’s nonchalance, the pivot toward lower-priced cars at the expense of pricier models has been financially taxing. Revenue fell to $6.3 billion in the third quarter, missing analysts’ estimates and dropping from $6.8 billion a year ago.
Earnings improved in part thanks to the company recognizing about $30 million of deferred revenue based on Musk making a controversial addition to its suite of drive-assistance features known as Autopilot. Smart Summon, which allows Tesla owners to tap their smartphone and remotely call for their car to pick them up, was rolled out to customers through an over-the-air update days before the end of the quarter.
“The business model is slowly shifting to high-margin software,” Loup Ventures’ Munster said.
Musk has been charging customers for performance features that Tesla vehicles aren’t actually capable of yet. At the end of June, the company said it expected to recognize $567 million of deferred revenue in the following 12 months. It’s now anticipating the release of almost $500 million tied to the rollout of Autopilot and “Full Self Driving” features, according to the statement, which doesn’t give a time frame.
Tesla’s gross margin in the third quarter was 22.8%, down from a year ago but a 3.9 percentage point improvement from the prior three months.
“The balance sheet is good, demand’s good and gross margins beat expectations across the board,” said Ben Kallo, an analyst at Robert W. Baird who recommends buying Tesla shares. In the coming days, he predicted, “you’ll also see a lot of short covering.”"

The company announced that operating profit came in at 473 billion won ($404.68 million), which was a 93% plunge as compared to the previous year’s quarter, but higher than the estimated 418 billion won.
 
The drop in profits was mainly due to declining prices of memory chips for smartphones, the company said, adding that the amount of money set aside for investment in 2020 would be “considerably lower than this year.”
 
""DRAM prices remain weak during the quarter, leading to a 16 percent drop in the average selling price,"" SK Hynix said.

Ghosn's legal team in a press release on Thursday said they had submitted two court filings ahead of a planned pre-trial meeting the same day that list cases of ""misconduct"" by prosecutors and ""factual defences"" that show Ghosn is innocent of financial wrongdoing.
""The prosecution against him resulted from unlawful collusion between the prosecutors, government officials at METI (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry), and executives at Nissan, who formed a secret task force to drum up allegations of wrongdoing,"" the lawyers said in the release.
Since his first arrest in November, Ghosn has been charged four times on allegations he underreported his Nissan salary, temporarily transferred personal financial losses to Nissan's books and authorised payments to car dealers with the purpose of enriching himself.
Currently on bail in Japan, Ghosn is not allowed to contact his wife or use the internet unsupervised and has had to submit to surveillance of his movements. Japanese courts have dismissed several appeals by Ghosn to ease those restrictions that his lawyers have argued violates Japan's constitution and international law on family separation.
In September, Ghosn and Nissan agreed to settle claims from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision over false financial disclosures related to Ghosn's compensation. Nissan agreed to pay $15 million, while Ghosn agreed to a $1 million civil penalty and a 10-year ban from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded U.S. company.

Courts in Japan have yet to fix a schedule for his prosecution to begin, with local media reporting that his first trial may start in March. Ghosn's defence team of 13 lawyers includes four lawyers in Japan who will defend him in the upcoming trials.

WASHINGTON/RIYADH (Reuters) - Gulf countries sharply improved their rankings in the World Bank's latest Doing Business report, while Latin American countries largely lagged in reforms and New Zealand took the top spot for the fourth year in a row.
The report released in Washington late Wednesday night ranks countries on their business climates, and found that the most improved countries over the previous year were Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Togo, Bahrain, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Kuwait, China, India and Nigeria.
Saudi Arabia climbed 30 places to 62nd, while Jordan climbed 29 to 75th, driven by reforms aimed at building more economic diversification, the World Bank said.
The World Bank said Saudi Arabia's reforms included establishing a one-stop shop for business registration, introducing a secured transactions law and an insolvency law, improving protections for minority investors, and measures to bring more women into the workforce.
""Something clearly is happening in the Gulf which has not happened before,"" Simeon Djankov, World Bank senior research director and founder of the Doing Business report, told Reuters in Riyadh.
""Everybody here in this region figured out we better diversify the economy in some direction and I think this is actually why the reforms are happening now.""
Two to three years ago when countries started work on some of these reforms, oil prices were unstable, Djankov added.
The report coincides with the scheduled appearance of World Bank President David Malpass at a Saudi investment conference next week, a year after his predecessor pulled out of the same event amid a global outcry over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
The World Bank confirmed Malpass's attendance at the Future Investment Initiative, which aims in part to showcase Saudi Arabia as a business destination. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and presidential adviser Jared Kushner would also attend the conference after canceling last year, U.S. officials said.
""Removing barriers facing entrepreneurs generates better jobs, more tax revenues, and higher incomes, all of which are necessary to reduce poverty and raise living standards,"" Malpass said in a statement.
Critics however say the report is too heavily weighted in favor of deregulation.
""This is a pure measure of deregulation. This index takes a fairly extreme position on market fundamentalism,"" said Justin Sandefur, a fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington.
NEW ZEALAND NO.1
The top 10 rankings in the survey were largely unchanged from a year ago, with New Zealand holding its top spot, followed by Singapore, Hong Kong, Denmark, South Korea, the United States, Georgia, Britain, Norway and Sweden.
China saw its ranking climb 15 places to 31st, a move Djankov attributes to domestic reforms prompted by trade tensions with the United States.
Pakistan and Nigeria also made big jumps as a result of internally focused reforms in the face of trade difficulties.
Latin American countries lagged in the rankings, with Argentina falling seven places to 126th, and Mexico, the region's highest-ranking economy, falling six spots to 60th. The World Bank said that for the second year in a row, Mexico made no major business climate improvements.
Chile fell three places to 59th. The South American commodity exporter was at the center of a controversy in January 2018 over changes to the study's methodologies, which former World Bank chief economist Paul Romer said may have been biased against the country's socialist president at the time, Michelle Bachelet.
Romer left the bank shortly after airing his views in a Wall Street Journal interview. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-worldbank-economist-romer/world-bank-economist-paul-romer-quits-after-chile-comments-idUSKBN1FD38Y"
1248,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2019 08:39PM ET</span>","WeWork's new chairman defends payouts to founder, says company will survive","By Sheila Dang and Carrie Monahan
(Reuters) - WeWork's new Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure on Wednesday defended huge payouts to the office-sharing company's founder Adam Neumann and said there is now ""zero risk of the company going bankrupt,"" according to an audio recording of a meeting he held with employees that was reviewed by Reuters.
The meeting took place a day after WeWork's largest shareholder, SoftBank Group Corp, provided a $9.5 billion lifeline and took over the company, including payments to Neumann to give up control.
In response to a question from one WeWork employee, Claure said Neumann was like any shareholder of the company who deserved the right to sell his shares. 
""There's a level of gratefulness that we're going to have for Adam, because he's the one who built this business,"" Claure said.
Neumann has the right to sell his stake in the company for as much as $970 million, sources previously told Reuters, as part of a tender offer in which SoftBank will buy up to $3 billion in WeWork shares from investors and employees. He currently owns a little over one fifth of WeWork. 
SoftBank has also agreed to extend him a $500 million loan to repay a credit line from JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), as well as pay him a $185 million fee for a four-year assignment as a consultant to WeWork, one of the sources said.
'SURREAL TO CRAZY'
WeWork cofounder Miguel McKelvey had kicked off the meeting by introducing Claure to the staff at the company's New York headquarters and addressed the tumultuous few weeks WeWork had experienced.
""I think I've run out of words to describe what's been going on from surreal to crazy to unbelievable to...bonkers,"" McKelvey said.
In August, WeWork filed for a splashy initial public offering. This week, it was struggling for survival as it has been quickly burning through the cash on its balance sheet.
The IPO was abandoned in September as investors balked at sky-high valuations - a deal in January had tagged its worth at $47 billion. The rescue by SoftBank now values it at just $8 billion.
Investors also questioned both whether its business model was sustainable given big losses it was suffering and the way that Neumann was running the company, triggering his resignation as CEO. 
Claure, who was previously CEO of U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp, set an upbeat tone during the hour-long meeting at which he encouraged questions.
""My goal is to be part of one of the most amazing comebacks in history and to build jointly with you guys,"" said Claure, who is also the chief operating officer at SoftBank. 
Claure said that the new cash injection meant WeWork was not going to struggle to survive. 
However, it was going to focus very differently, he said. ""Make no mistake, the world has changed. The growth stories don't sell any more,"" he said. Adding that the challenge was to ""build a company that has an amazing product, that delights our customers, but also makes money.""
And that meant deciding which of the markets around the world ""makes sense for us to be in, which market doesn't,"" he said. According to its website, WeWork has 856 office sites in 123 countries that are open or about to open. 
Claure said he did not know how many layoffs would take place as WeWork looks to ""go back to basics."" Sources close to the company have mentioned a range of figures for possible layoffs in recent weeks, from as few as 2,000 to as many as 5,000 out of its 12,500 employees.
Claure said that despite the turmoil, WeWork's landlords were ""eager to find different models of working with us.""
WeWork had $18 billion in long-term lease obligations as of the end of June, according to its most recent public financial disclosure. It also had $1.3 billion in net debt.
The company is closing or selling a number of businesses outside of the main office-sharing operations. It recently announced it would close the WeGrow private school in New York City after the current school year.

WeWork did not respond to requests for comment.

1250,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2019 08:35PM ET</span>",Tesla shares soar 21% as surprise profit answers skeptics,"By Tina Bellon and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) on Wednesday surprised investors with a quarterly profit that sent its shares soaring, as Chief Executive Elon Musk promised a 2020 rollout of a cheaper SUV and more self-driving technology to stay ahead of larger rivals rushing into the premium electric vehicle market he created.
Shares rose nearly 21% to $307.12 after hours on the unexpected news, crossing $300 for the first time since March 1 after record deliveries and cost cuts ensured a profitable third quarter.
Tesla on Wednesday posted a cash balance increase to $5.3 billion and reported a profit of $1.86 per share, shattering analyst expectations for a loss of 42 cents per share.
The third-quarter results are an important milestone for Tesla and redemption for Musk who had to step down as chairman after a series of scandals and investor doubts about Tesla's ability to withstand competition from larger, better capitalized global rivals.
Tesla's gross margins, an important profit indicator for investors, surpassed expectations and Tesla said it was ""highly confident"" in exceeding the low end of its yearly global vehicle delivery goal.
But Tesla has yet to prove that it can be consistently profitable while managing the start of production for Model 3 sedans at its new factory in Shanghai and for Model Y sport utilities next year.
""Given the breakneck speed of expansion, Tesla will face significant demands on its cash pile,"" said Nicholas Hyett, an analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
The company on Wednesday said production in Shanghai and for Model Y are ahead of schedule, with the latter expected to launch by the summer of 2020.
Tesla also has to contain costs as it develops a gigafactory in Europe, a Semi truck, an electric pickup truck, a new generation of the Tesla Roadster and automated driving features.
The carmaker said it had cut costs 16% on a yearly basis, citing improvements in operating efficiency and a reduction in manufacturing and material costs. Musk said on a conference call that operating costs were the lowest since Model 3 production started.
Margin expectations are higher for Model Y than Model 3, while productions costs are roughly the same as Model 3, said Zach Kirkhorn, Tesla chief financial officer.
Model 3 vehicles made in the Shanghai factory will have roughly the same margins as those made in Fremont, California, he said.
Tesla also expects to generally be cash flow positive as it has grown to the point of being self-funding. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2MF6HHq)
That will allow the company to invest in divisions focusing on sustainable energy, including launching the third version of its solar roof tile this week.
""For about a year and a half we stripped Tesla energy of resources,"" Musk said. ""Now that Model 3 production is in a good place and headed to a great place we have restored resources to Tesla storage and solar. That's going to be really crazy growth.""
Musk also said Tesla is open to supplying batteries and other components to other automakers.
With Wednesday's after-hours surge, Tesla's stock has reduced its loss year-to-date to 8% and added about $9 billion to its market capitalization.
But Tesla rallies have been short-lived before.
A year ago, Tesla gave a quarterly report that similarly smashed investors' expectations, igniting a rally that sent its shares 31% higher over the next two months, only to see the stock decline through much of 2019 over worries about corporate governance, profitability and demand for the Model 3. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2PgxXgT)
Investors in the past have shown impatience with the company's serial failures to meet financial and production targets. Earlier this month, Tesla shares slumped after the company reported delivering 97,000 vehicles for the third quarter, only 2% ahead of the previous quarter.
But Tesla on Wednesday exceeded promises by billionaire Musk, who in July said Tesla would break even in the third quarter and turn a profit by the end of 2019.
The company has said it plans to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles for all of 2019, and on Wednesday said it was ""highly confident in exceeding 360,000 deliveries this year.""
Analysts have questioned how rapidly Tesla's vehicle sales will grow as government subsidies for electric vehicle purchases dwindle in the United States, China and other markets.
Kirkhorn on Wednesday said Tesla saw growing order rates in all markets, with current quarter orders exceeding those of the past three months.
Tesla has said it aims to produce at least 1,000 Model 3 cars a week at the new Chinese factory by the end of this year, but it is unclear when it will meet year-end production targets due to uncertainties around orders, labor and suppliers.
Revenue fell nearly 8% to $6.30 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts had expected revenue of $6.33 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Tesla on Wednesday said it would gradually release nearly $500 million of accumulated revenue tied to its ""full self-driving capabilities"", which customers can buy for $6,000 even though fully automated driving is not available.
Kirkhorn on Wednesday said deferred revenue would also be released as Tesla expands its ""Smart Summon"" feature, which allows customers to operate a Tesla from 200 feet (60 meters) away using a smartphone app.
Federal safety regulators are looking into the feature after videos began appearing online showing driverless Teslas hitting obstacles or nearly hitting other vehicles.
Musk on Wednesday said software updates over the coming weeks would improve Summon."

But they soon recovered.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) said it earned $1.38 a share in the quarter, up 21% from a year ago and ahead of the $1.24 a share estimate of analysts tracked by Investing.com.

Revenue was up 14% to $33.1 billion, ahead of the analyst estimate of $32.14 billion. 

The company said results were driven by gains in its Intelligent Cloud, Office, LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) and Server products and services. Surface and Xbox revenues were flat.

(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) on Wednesday forecast sales for its cloud computing services that topped analysts' estimates, even as quarterly growth slows for its Azure business.
Microsoft said it expected ""intelligent cloud"" revenue of $11.25 billion to $11.45 billion for its fiscal second quarter, above analysts' consensus of $11.2 billion, IBES data from Refinitiv showed.
Revenue from Azure grew 59% in the fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30, well below the 76% in the year-ago period and slightly short of analysts' estimates.
Microsoft also expects ""double-digit"" percentage growth in both revenue and operating income for its fiscal 2020, company executives said on a conference call.
""The guidance is strong,"" said Mark Moerdler, managing director of global software and senior analyst with Bernstein. ""There were a number of people surprised that their numbers were so good for the full year.""
The results sent Microsoft shares, which were up 34% for the year before the report, up 0.45% to $137.86 in after-market trading.
Since Chief Executive Satya Nadella took over in 2014, Microsoft has been diversifying from its Windows operating system software, and has focused on its cloud services, which allow customers to move their computing work to data centers managed by Microsoft.
Worldwide spending on cloud infrastructure services grew nearly 38% year-on-year in the calendar second quarter to $26.3 billion, according to data from research firm Canalys. Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Amazon Web Services still dominates the market with a 31.5% share, followed by Microsoft with 18.1%.
Strength in the cloud business powered Microsoft's market value past $1 trillion for the first time in April. However, the business faces intense competition from Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) AWS and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google.
Microsoft beat Wall Street expectations for its overall revenue and its intelligent cloud segment, which contains Azure, marking $33.1 billion in overall sales and cloud unit sales of $10.8 billion.
Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said Microsoft's results ""were strong across the board with nearly all key metrics beating consensus.""
But Azure was the key metric that missed slightly, said Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company.
""Azure came in at 59% (revenue growth) and consensus was at 60%,"" he said. ""Other than that, it was a good quarter, but if you want to throw rocks at it, that is how you would do it.""
Interactive graphic on Microsoft's cloud unit: https://tmsnrt.rs/2BzkJ75 
Microsoft also beat expectations in other segments. It forecast sales from a division that includes LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) and Office software to range from $11.3 billion to $11.5 billion, in line with analysts' consensus estimate of $11.4 billion.
The technology company's personal computing division accounted for the largest share of its first-quarter revenue posted on Wednesday, rising 4% to $11.13 billion. The unit includes Windows software, Xbox gaming consoles, online search advertising and Surface personal computers.
Windows results were boosted by 19% revenue growth for business computers, which was offset by a 7% decline for consumer PCs.
Mike Spencer, head of investor relations for Microsoft, said Google Chromebooks continued eat into Windows revenue for entry-level laptops.
But Microsoft forecast current-quarter revenue of $12.6 billion to $13 billion for the personal computing division, below analysts' consensus estimate of $13.38 billion.
Net income rose 21% to $10.68 billion, or $1.38 per share, while total revenue rose 14% to $33.06 billion. (https://

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Israeli businessman Samuel Ben-Avraham said on Wednesday he has submitted an offer for Barneys New York Inc, challenging a $271 million bid for the bankrupt luxury department store from brand developer Authentic Brands Group LLC.
The retailer, which filed for bankruptcy in August, had been seeking proposals to best Authentic Brands. A deadline for competing bids was set for Wednesday evening.
It was not immediately clear that Barneys had deemed the offer a so-called qualified bid, meaning that it meets certain thresholds to be considered in a bankruptcy court auction set for Monday, the people said.
Ben-Avraham told Reuters he lined up investors to back his bid and has work to complete before the auction. The entrepreneur launched a social media campaign featuring images from TV shows ""Sex and the City"" and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" as part of his proposal.
Barneys and Authentic Brands did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Ben-Avraham owns trade show companies and is also an investor in fashion label Kith, his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile shows. Additional details on his bid could not immediately be determined.
The sources could not be identified because they were not authorized to speak on the matter. Women's Wear Daily first reported on Ben-Avraham's offer.

DEARBORN, Mich. (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) on Wednesday cut its forecast for operating profit for the year after a disappointing third quarter that Chief Executive Jim Hackett blamed on higher warranty costs, bigger discounts and weaker than expected performance in China.
Investors sold off Ford shares, which fell 2.5% to $8.98 in after-hours trading while shares in electric car maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) surged more than 20% on better than expected results.
In a conference call with analysts, Hackett said Ford ""experienced more headwinds"" than expected in the quarter.
""As a result, we will not grow adjusted EBIT this year as we intended,"" Hackett said, referring to earnings before interest and taxes.
The disappointing financial results are a setback for Hackett, the former CEO of office furniture maker Steelcase, who took over Ford in May 2017 after the abrupt ouster of Ford veteran Mark Fields.
For two years, Hackett has been asking investors to be patient with a methodical restructuring that has made progress, including a wide-ranging alliance on electric vehicles with Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and the sale of money-losing operations in India to a venture controlled by Indian automaker Mahindra & Mahindra (NS:MAHN). 
But by Ford’s own reckoning, most of the restructuring work has yet to be done. It has booked only $3.3 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take for the global restructuring, up from $2.2 billion at the end of the second quarter.
The company also suffered a bumpy introduction of the redesigned Ford Explorer and all-new Lincoln Aviator in the quarter, said Joe Hinrichs, Ford's president of automotive.
""We were disappointed in the overall performance,"" he told analysts, referring to the uneven vehicle launch and production ramp-up at an aging Chicago assembly plant.
""We took on too much,"" said Hinrichs, citing the difficulty of launching the Explorer and Aviator simultaneously while it was breaking in a new assembly line at the 95-year-old Chicago plant. ""We have plenty of inventory now at dealers,"" he added. 
The third quarter included $1.5 billion in costs for the company's global restructuring, $800 million of which was related to the formation of a joint venture in India with Mahindra. 
Ford's ongoing restructuring includes cutting costs and overhauling its product lineup in key global markets like China and Europe.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker still faces the prospect of negotiating a new four-year labor agreement with the United Auto Workers following the union's more than month-long strike against General Motors Co (N:GM), which cost GM about $2 billion according to analysts.
Ford reported a third-quarter net profit of $425 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with $991 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Excluding one-time charges, Ford earned 34 cents a share, above the 26 cents analysts had expected according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Revenue in the quarter fell 2% to $37 billion, above the $33.98 billion expected.
Virtually all of Ford's third-quarter pretax profit came from North America - its most lucrative market - where highly profitable pickup trucks drive margins for the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker and its Detroit rivals, GM and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV. (MI:FCHA)
Ford said Wednesday it now expects a full-year adjusted operating profit in the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion, compared with $7 billion last year. In July, it had forecast an increase in the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion.
Ford also said it expects adjusted earnings this year in the range of $1.20 to $1.32 a share. Previously, the high end of its forecast had been $1.35. Analysts expect $1.26 a share.
Ford's third-quarter operating profit in North America was just over $2 billion. Its U.S. sales in the quarter fell 4.9%, but demand for lucrative pickups remained strong with an increase of almost 9%.
China revenue in the quarter slid about $300 million to $900 million and Ford's share in that market fell to 2.3% from 2.9% last year.
Ford's third-quarter sales in China fell 30% as it continued to lose ground in its second-biggest market. Ford has been struggling to revive sales in China since its business began slumping in late 2017.

In September, Moody's downgraded Ford's credit rating to junk status - below what it rates larger rival GM - citing Ford's operating and market challenges, and weak cash generation due to its global restructuring.

""(J&J) has to disclose it now - and take the accounting hit. Later they can come back and adjust the impact on an actual payment/settlement on their goodwill when the actual cost of the settlement comes into focus,"" Brian Quinn at Boston College Law School said.
Reuters reported last week citing sources that drug distributors McKesson Corp (N:MCK), AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC) and  Cardinal Health  (N:CAH) have offered to pay $18 billion in cash over 18 years, while drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) would pay $4 billion in cash.

The drug industry faces roughly 2,600 lawsuits brought by state and local governments, hospitals and other entities seeking to hold drugmakers and distributors responsible for the toll of opioid abuse.

LONDON (Reuters) - Four in five coal plants in the European Union are unprofitable and utilities could face losses of nearly 6.6 billion euros ($7.3 billion) this year, a report by think tank the Carbon Tracker Initiative said on Thursday.
Lower costs for renewable energy and cheaper natural gas prices are increasingly competitive versus coal in power generation.
More expensive technology will also need to be installed on many existing coal plants to meet stricter EU air quality standards from 2021 and rising carbon permit prices could increase costs too, the report said.
Several EU countries have announced plans to phase out coal completely over time to comply with international emissions reduction targets. But some are still reliant on coal for the majority of their power generation, such as Poland.
Many coal plant operators say coal will be needed for decades to provide stable energy supplies because renewable energy is intermittent.
Carbon Tracker analysed the operating economics of every coal plant in the EU.
It found that hard coal generation, which has the highest carbon content, had fallen 39% this year from a year earlier.
Some 84% of lignite generation, which also has a high carbon content, and 76% of hard coal generation, is unprofitable, resulting in losses of 3.54 billion and 3.03 billion euros respectively.
Across the EU, 79% of coal plants are running at a loss.
""EU coal generators are haemorrhaging cash because they cannot compete with cheap renewables and gas and this will only get worse. Policymakers and investors should prepare to phase out coal by 2030 at the latest,"" said Carbon Tracker's Matt Gray, co-author of the report.
German utility RWE faces the biggest losses this year of 975 million euros, which is 6% of its market capitalisation, according to the report.
Central European energy group EPH, which has assets mainly in Germany and the Czech Republic, could lose 613 million euros, and PPC in Greece could lose 596 million euros, it said.

Coal plants that will continue to turn a profit include those in Poland, which receive quite high subsidies, efficient units in Germany and the Netherlands and some plants in Italy, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, which benefit from high wholesale power prices, the report said.

(Reuters) -  Xilinx Inc  (O:XLNX) on Wednesday forecast current-quarter and full-year revenue below Wall Street estimates, the second major chipmaker this week to flag the impact of a prolonged U.S.-China trade dispute on its business.
The company said the forecast takes into account the impact from the U.S. government's restrictions on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and assumes no revenue from the Chinese telecommunications firm.
Xilinx, which has resumed some sales to Huawei since the ban in May, said the U.S. government has not approved its license applications to permit shipping more products to Huawei.
Shares of Xilinx, which makes programmable chips used in data centers, were down nearly 2% in extended trading.
The bleak outlook spooked investors and analysts alike, with ""Huawei"" finding 35 mentions in Xilinx's post-earnings call, as brokerages scrambled to figure out the breadth of what Xilinx Chief Executive Officer Victor Peng described as a ""significant impact"".
""We really hope that the governments can come to agreement and resolve this structural issue so we can continue to engage with Huawei,"" Peng said.
On Tuesday, chipmaker Texas Instruments Inc's (O:TXN) current-quarter revenue forecast also missed Wall Street targets, as it blamed the trade war.
Trade uncertainty is causing some customers to exercise caution in ordering, Peng noted, echoing similar concerns from Texas Instruments a day before.
Xilinx said it expects third-quarter revenue of between $710 million and $740 million, well below analysts' average estimate of $844.9 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""We believe that third quarter will be our low point and we expect to see a return to sequential revenue growth in our fourth quarter,"" the company said.
Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan said the tepid forecast takes away any further risks related to Huawei.
Xilinx expects fiscal year 2020 revenue of between $3.21 billion and $3.28 billion, below estimates of $3.4 billion.
The company's board, which on Wednesday approved a share buyback plan of up to $1 billion, is looking for a new financial chief after CFO Lorenzo Flores said last month he is stepping down to pursue another executive opportunity. On the call, the company did not provide any update on the CFO transition.

Shares of the company fell 2.73% to $38.13 in extended trading as the holiday quarter typically generates a majority of its annual sales and profit.
EBay forecast fourth-quarter adjusted profit from continuing operations in the range of 73 cents to 76 cents per share and net revenue of $2.77 billion and $2.82 billion.
Analysts on average had expected a profit of 76 cents on revenue of $2.85 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The results follow the exit of Chief Executive Officer Devin Wenig last month, who cited differences with the company's revamped board, which is looking to sell some of its businesses amid pressure from activist investors.
Hedge funds Elliott Management and Starboard Value have been pushing the e-commerce company to improve profitability through a wide-ranging review.

1261,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2019 05:59PM ET</span>",U.S. FAA must restore 'public confidence' in plane certification -inspector general,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) must work to restore ""public confidence"" in aircraft certification efforts after two deadly Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes, the U.S. Transportation Department's inspector general said on Wednesday in a public report.
The long-standing practice of delegating certification tasks to aircraft manufacturers has come under criticism from lawmakers and others after the two crashes in October 2018 in Indonesia and March 2019 in Ethiopia, which killed 346 people.
The report, reported by Reuters before its public release late Wednesday, said the FAA faces a ""significant oversight challenge"" to ensure that companies conducting those tasks ""maintain high standards and comply with FAA safety regulations."" 
The report said that by March 2020, the FAA plans to introduce ""a new process that represents a significant change in its approach to overseeing"" aircraft designation efforts.
The FAA did not immediately comment. 
U.S. Transportation Department Secretary Elaine Chao in a Aug. 12 memo to FAA Administrator Steve Dickson made public Wednesday said the crashes ""prompted important questions about the certification of the 737 MAX, the FAA's aircraft certification and oversight processes generally and the receptiveness of FAA's leadership to critical feedback from within its ranks.""
Chao in August ordered Dickson to address those questions and said ""continued excellence requires rooting out problems and embracing opportunities for improvement.""
Dickson said Tuesday that the FAA and airplane manufacturers need to better scrutinize the interface between pilots and machines. He added the FAA and manufacturers must improve processes to ensure ""we don't have fragmented communications"" on certification.
The 58-page report also laid out other management challenges the FAA and Transportation Department face, including cybersecurity, airspace modernization, integrating drones into the air space, air carrier safety oversight and preparing for emerging vehicle automation technologies.
The report added that ""the new process will include identifying critical system elements and developing new evaluation criteria. While revamping FAA’s oversight process will be an important step, continued management attention will be key to ensure the agency identifies and monitors the highest-risk and safety-critical areas of aircraft certification.""
Congress is mulling changes to how the FAA delegates some certification tasks to manufacturers for new airplanes. In the 737 MAX certification it initially delegated 40% of the work to Boeing and later shifted more work to Boeing, including work on a key safety system tied to both deadly crashes known as MCAS.
The Inspector General's office has an ongoing investigation into the activities that resulted in the certification of the Boeing 737 MAX that is not expected to be completed until next year.
The Transportation Department in a letter to Congress Wednesday said it had turned over 33,000 pages of documents on the 737 MAX, including 5,000 pages of emails, and let congressional investigators interview numerous FAA employees. It denied that documents from a former Boeing pilot made public Friday were evidence of ""coziness"" between the FAA and manufacturer.
A report from the Joint Authorities Technical Review (JATR), a panel of international regulators commissioned by the FAA and released earlier this month, faulted the review of MCAS and Boeing for assumptions it made in designing the airplane.

The JATR recommendations said the FAA’s longstanding practice of delegating ""a high level"" of certification tasks to manufacturers, such as Boeing, needs significant reform to ensure adequate safety oversight. It also questioned the limited FAA staffing of oversight and qualifications of some FAA employees overseeing Boeing and said there were signs some Boeing employees conducting FAA tasks reported feeling ""undue pressure.""

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) is conducting trial production runs at its new $2 billion China factory for the past several weeks and will sell some of the first cars from the plant to its employees, sources told Reuters.
Whether billionaire Elon Musk's flagship company can start mass production quickly enough to hit stated targets is the question investors will want an answer to when Tesla announces third-quarter results on Wednesday.
The U.S. electric vehicles maker is under pressure to ramp up output globally, and the Shanghai plant's production schedule is crucial if it wants to reach its ambitious target of an annualized production rate of 500,000 vehicles by the end of the year.
Tesla last week obtained the certificate it needs to start manufacturing cars in the country. But analysts contend that uncertainties around labor and suppliers make it a challenge to start mass production.
""There is a lot in the equation that is not in their control,"" said Tu Le, analyst at China-based research firm Sino Auto Insights.
""There are some things that just need time in order to complete, like qualifying new manufacturing processes, a new battery supplier, getting the tooling shipped and set up, as well as setting up all the suppliers. Any parts that have to be imported need to go through customs, which also could mean delays,"" he said.
Tesla is also in the process of obtaining a key certification needed to sell China-made cars in the country, it told local media, though it is unclear when the government will grant it sales clearance.
Tesla did not reply to an email seeking comment.
It said in April it aims to produce at least 1,000 Model 3 cars a week at the new factory by the end of this year.
Analysts, though, are doubtful that Tesla will hit this target, given its patchy production record.
Delays and quality issues have marred the launches of Tesla's Model S and Model X vehicles in the past, and Tesla struggled to start https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-production-idUSKBN1ES1Z4 making the Model 3 at its California factory in 2017.
The company took six months longer than originally forecast to hit a target of 5,000 Model 3 cars per week, achieving that pace about a year after launching production.
Still, Tesla is taking steps to ensure a smooth launch of production, including trying to diversify its battery supplier base, sources have said.
It recently bought Maxwell Technologies, whose technology could help the car maker produce batteries that last longer.
At hiring events in Shanghai in August and September, attended by Reuters journalists, Tesla interviewed hundreds of candidates from mainstream car makers in China.
It also advertised on social media for battery-related production and software system engineers in Shanghai, and delivery managers in big Chinese cities.
FURTHER LOSSES?
China, for its part, is helping speed up things at the Shanghai factory - the country's first fully foreign-owned car plant, a reflection of Beijing's broader shift to open up its auto market.
State-owned construction companies have arranged extra workforce and banks are offering cheap loans, while the government said it will exempt Tesla cars from its purchase tax, a concession made amidst trade tensions with the United States.
The Model 3 has fared well in China, the world's biggest car market.
Tesla sales in China likely surged more than three fold to 10,542 cars in the quarter ended Sept. 30, according to research firm LMC Automotive.
The company expects to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars this year globally.
Analysts expect Tesla's third-quarter revenue to decline 7% from the year-ago quarter, according to Refinitiv data. They predict a loss of 42 cents per share, excluding one-time items, in contrast to Musk's promises that the company would break even in the quarter.
Gross margins likely shrank to 15.6% from 22.3%.
""The biggest overhang around the story is the ability to hit profitability and to achieve its ambitious unit guidance for 2019,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a pre-earnings research note."

1266,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2019 04:46PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Mexico taps banks, oil major as it nears end of 2020 oil hedge - sources","By Devika Krishna Kumar and Stefanie Eschenbacher
NEW YORK/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's finance ministry has completed a majority of its annual oil hedging program, working with at least four top investment banks and oil major Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), sources said, after challenges slowed the world's largest oil financial deal this year.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS),  BNP Paribas  SA (PA:BNPP) and Shell are among those the finance ministry tapped to execute the hedge, two sources familiar with the deal said this week.
Over the past two-three years, oil majors Shell and  BP  (L:BP) began participating in the highly coveted program, challenging the traditional role of banks in the operation.
It was not immediately clear what volumes Mexico had hedged or what price protection it had secured. One Wall Street source estimated that the program was nearly complete while another put it at about 75%.
The Mexican finance ministry declined to comment because of the sensitive nature of the negotiations. Spokespersons for the banks and Shell declined to comment.
The oil hedge program runs from December to November the following year. In it, Latin America's second-largest economy buys as much as $1 billion worth of financial positions, mostly options, in a series of highly anticipated oil trades.
These options give the finance ministry the right to sell its oil for predetermined price and are designed to protect the government's revenues from oil sales for the coming year against price falls.
This year, the finance ministry faced a number of unusual challenges in kicking off the program, including price volatility and the overhaul of its crude oil formulas that underpin its export sales and the program.
Mexican Deputy Finance Minister Gabriel Yorio said on Tuesday that the government was sticking to $49 per barrel as its estimate to calculate government income in the 2020 budget, which is currently being debated and still needs to be voted on.
""This is a price at which we can control the risks of a fall in the oil price and, obviously, if the price is higher, we'll have higher income,"" he told Congress. ""So I believe we are covered against the downside risk.""
The Mexican finance ministry typically seeks to hedge its entire export volume at the price laid out in the budget. However, documents related to past deals show not all of it is always covered using options.
In some years, the finance ministry has tapped a dedicated budget revenue stabilization fund to protect a share of its export volume that is not covered through options sold by banks and oil majors.
""This year, I believe they'll do something similar to what we did back in 2017,"" said former finance ministry official Julio Ruiz, adding that probably some would be covered ""using resources from the budget stabilization fund.""
Negotiations between the Mexico and Wall Street on the hedge have long been notoriously secretive and limited to a few participants as both sides attempt to secure the best terms in a highly competitive deal for banks.
Reuters reported last month that Mexico had requested the quotes from Wall Street banks ahead of the country presenting the budget for 2020 in which it confirmed that it would seek the protection."

Facebook shares advanced 2.1% after Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg sought to reassure U.S. lawmakers about the company's planned digital currency, Libra.
 Nike  Inc (N:NKE) shares fell 3.4% after the sportswear company announced late on Tuesday that Mark Parker, its long-time CEO, would step down next year. Nike tapped John Donahoe, chief executive of ServiceNow Inc (N:NOW), as Parker's successor. ServiceNow shares fell 3.6%.
Shares of medical device maker Boston Scientific Corp (N:BSX) and laboratory equipment maker Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (N:TMO) jumped after both companies reported strong results. Boston Scientific shares ended 5.0% higher and Thermo Fisher shares closed up 5.7%.

1277,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2019 03:46PM ET</span>",Blackstone special situations executive Geiling leaves firm - sources,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - A senior Blackstone Group (N:BX) executive who oversaw special situations investments at the private equity giant's hedge fund unit Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, has left the firm, two people familiar with the matter said.
Greg Geiling was a senior managing director and Head of the Hedge Fund Solutions Special Situations Investing Group, which oversees the Blackstone Strategic Opportunity fund.
He resigned from Blackstone earlier this year and left the firm last week, the sources said. It could not be learned which firm he plans to join next.
Geiling declined to comment, as did Blackstone.
During his nine years at Blackstone, Geiling, 47, helped launch the Strategic Opportunity fund, which invests more than $10 billion on behalf of public and private pensions and sovereign wealth funds.
The fund made waves in the hedge fund industry by investing alongside some of the industry's best known hedge fund managers in their best ideas.
Hedge funds are often unable to super-size their favorite investments because such big bets could overstep their own risk requirements. Big investors liked the idea of putting money to work in this way and have allocated cash to the Blackstone fund which has largely made credit-oriented bets and put money into private, less liquid investments over the years.
Geiling joined Blackstone in early 2011 after having worked for prominent macro investor Stanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Capital hedge fund.
Since early 2018, Blackstone has made some changes to its most senior ranks. Jon Gray, the firm's former real estate chief, was promoted to president in 2018 and John McCormick (NYSE:MKC) took over the reins at the hedge fund unit, which invests more than $80 billion, from long-time chief Tomilson Hill last year."
1278,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2019 03:10PM ET</span>",Teva’s proposed opioid settlement could cost drugmaker pennies on the dollar,"By Michael Erman and Nate Raymond
NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd's proposed $23 billion drug giveaway to settle thousands of U.S. opioid lawsuits will likely cost the company a fraction of that figure due to how it has valued those medicines, according to a Reuters review of pricing data and industry analysts.
When Teva (TA:TEVA) announced the value of the donated medicine - a generic version of opioid addiction treatment Suboxone - it based the figure on the drug's list price, which does not account for significant discounts routinely provided by the drugmaker.
If based on the estimated cost to manufacture the drugs, the value could be as low as $1.5 billion, drug pricing consultants and industry analysts say. A Teva spokeswoman declined to comment on the cost analysis for generic Suboxone, a combination of buprenorphine and the opioid reversal agent naloxone.
In interviews with Reuters, lawyers representing local governments in the opioid litigation said the figure proposed by Teva inflates the real value of the drugs. They said the proposal will not be enough to address a nationwide addiction crisis that has claimed some 400,000 lives over the last two decades. 
The deal is ""overvalued to make the settlement look better,"" said Hunter Shkolnik, a lawyer on the plaintiffs executive committee that is managing more than 2,300 federal lawsuits consolidated in the U.S. District Court in Cleveland. 
""I don't believe a no-cash payment from Teva, one of the largest generic manufacturers in the world, is appropriate,"" he told Reuters. Israel-based Teva is looking to reach a nationwide settlement over its role in selling opioid painkillers, together with drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and the three largest U.S. drug distributors, AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC),  Cardinal Health  Inc (N:CAH) and McKesson Corp (N:MCK).
Negotiations between these companies and four state attorneys general leading the talks on behalf of their counterparts have focused on a total settlement value worth about $48 billion, including cash and free medicines. 
On Monday, Teva signaled progress in talks over its contribution aimed at directly helping addiction victims of this major public health crisis. Attorneys general of the four states had agreed on a proposed settlement under which Teva would provide $23 billion worth of generic Suboxone and pay $250 million in cash over 10 years, the company said. 
Teva said the donated drugs should meet most of the currently estimated U.S. patient need for the next decade.
The free drugs in lieu of cash would also help Teva avoid adding new debt to its balance sheet at a time that it is struggling to return to growth.
Teva shares rose 8% after it disclosed details of the proposed settlement. The company denies any wrongdoing in its sale of opioids, saying it did not actively promote its generic versions of the painkillers with doctors. Many of the current lawsuits accuse drugmakers of aggressively marketing the medicines in a way that downplayed their potential addiction risk.
INFLATED LIST PRICES
Scrutiny of Teva's proposed settlement followed the company's disclosure on Monday that it would use a benchmark called “wholesale acquisition cost” (WAC) to determine the value of the drugs provided for free. 
WAC - frequently referred to as the list price of a drug - does not include discounts or rebates and is often several times higher than what patients actually pay at the pharmacy. 
""WAC cannot be trusted as a pricing benchmark for generic drugs,"" said Eric Pachman, founder of pharmaceutical consultancy 3 Axis Advisors. 
According to 3 Axis data, Teva's list price for its generic Suboxone ranged from 3 to 5 times what retail pharmacies paid, on average, for it in August. And that price represents a premium over the company's manufacturing costs. 
Jefferies analyst David Steinberg estimated that the cost of the donated drugs would be around $1.5 billion, while Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal suggested they could cost about $2.3 billion to produce. JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott's estimate of manufacturing costs for generic Suboxone was higher, ranging from $5.75 billion to $9.2 billion, still a long way from the company's projected $23 billion value. Avoiding significant cash costs is important for Teva, which is working to pay down nearly $27 billion in net debt, a legacy of its ill-timed 2016 purchase of Allergan Plc's (N:AGN) generic drugs business  Actavis  generics. The profit margin for generic drugs has fallen sharply since. 
Ori Hershkovitz, an independent consultant to pharmaceutical companies, previously held a mostly short position in Teva while at Nexthera Capital, a New York-based healthcare-focused investment firm. 
Teva's proposed settlement, if accepted, should help allay investor concerns over the opioid cases, Hershkovitz said. But he still doubts the company will be able to correct its most fundamental problems. 

""The high debt load and the situation in the generics market will make it impossible to repay this debt,"" he predicted. ""They might have won the opioid battle but they are going to lose the overall war.""

1279,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2019 02:34PM ET</span>","Brazil narrows field to China, Russia, France for Angra 3 nuclear partner","By Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's state nuclear power company Eletronuclear plans to complete its long-delayed Angra 3 plant by partnering with either China's National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), France's EDF (PA:EDF) or Russia's Rosatom, its president Leonam Guimaraes told Reuters.
Eletronuclear will decide by the end of the year whether to create a subsidiary joint venture or if the foreign partner will become a minority shareholder in the state company, which would entitle it to a stake in its existing Angra 1 and 2 nuclear power plants, Guimaraes said.
Speaking in an interview on Tuesday, he said the partner would require deep pockets, as completion of Angra 3 will require 15 billion reais ($3.7 billion) on top of the 9 billion reais already invested.
""We are looking for an international partnership to invest in the completion of Angra 3 and that partner would own part of the plant until the end of its life,"" he said.
Under Brazilian law, the partner must have less than 50% of the voting capital.
In June, Eletronuclear sounded out market interest in a partnership for Angra 3 with invitations to 10 foreign firms, Guimaraes said. Seven replied but the most interested are CNNC, EDF and Rosatom, he said.
CNNC executives visited Angra 3 in June and reaffirmed their interest in completing it and building future plants in Brazil.
U.S. company Westinghouse, which is owned by Toshiba Corp (T:6502), and France's Framatome, majority owned by EDF, were also interested. However, they are suppliers of nuclear technology and Eletronuclear is looking for a partner to help build the rest of Angra 3, Guimaraes said.
South Korea's Kepco Engineering and Construction and China's State Power Investment Corporation also showed interest in Angra 3, located on the coast south of Rio de Janeiro, but seemed less committed to exploring a partnership, he said.
The plant was first planned in the 1980s but dropped due to lack of finance. Building restarted in 2010, but Eletronuclear was hit by a corruption scandal in 2015 and stopped paying contractors such as French company Areva, which was installing the Siemens-designed reactor technology now owned by Framatome.
Angra 3 is 70% finished and 80% of the nuclear reactor equipment has been bought, Guimaraes said. Eletronuclear spends 25 million reais a year on upkeep and insurance for the construction site and nuclear technology, he said.
That does not include interest payments on 10 billion reais in loans from national development bank BNDES to build Angra 3.
Eletronuclear is a subsidiary of state-run electric utility Eletrobras , which the government plans to privatize, although the nuclear power unit will be spun off and remain under state control.
President Jair Bolsonaro, who took office in January, has pledged to complete Angra 3 and study new plants in a push to expand the contribution of nuclear power to Brazil's electricity output, from 3% currently.
Guimaraes said two potential sites for future plants have been identified, one in the northeastern state of Pernambuco and another in southeastern Minas Gerais state.
Brazil has had to buy uranium concentrate for Angra 1 and 2 on the global market, mainly from Canada, Russia and Kazakhstan, due to a halt in output over licensing at the only domestic mine in operation, in Bahia state, Guimares said.
A new open pit mine in Bahia near the first mine should be licensed by year-end, he said."

A group representing 12 oil worker unions said in a statement on Wednesday they were fighting for their rights and that Petrobras was proposing a yearly raise that was below the expected annual inflation. Another group representing another five oil worker unions said their members would also strike.
The number of workers and business units that observe union strikes tends to vary at Petrobras, as do the subsequent effects on the company's operations.
Petrobras did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

Walmart's deals on items like toys, electronics and gaming products will begin on Oct. 25.
Thanksgiving, which falls on Nov. 28 this year, is a week later than last year's Nov. 22, leaving retailers with six fewer days to drive sales. 
The last two months of the year are critical for retailers, when they book an outsized portion of their annual sales and profits.
The National Retail Federation has said it expects holiday retail sales to increase between 3.8% and 4.2% this year. 
The group also cautioned against uncertainty from trade tensions between the United States and China as a potential drag on the season.

1285,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2019 12:50PM ET</span>",Boeing hit with new industrial setbacks as 737 MAX crisis deepens,"By Ankit Ajmera and Eric M. Johnson
(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Wednesday it still expects U.S. regulatory approval for its grounded 737 MAX in the fourth quarter, sending its shares higher despite a slump in quarterly profit.
The world's largest planemaker also said it was cutting production of its flagship Dreamliner, delaying plans to step up output of its money-spinning 737 line, and also delaying the arrival of a successor to its 777 mini-jumbo.
These fresh industrial setbacks heaped pressure on a newly rejigged senior management team fighting to repair trust with airline customers and passengers shaken by an eight-month safety ban on its 737 MAX https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-airplane/boeing-faces-crisis-with-worldwide-grounding-of-737-max-jetliners-idUSKBN1QU15W following two deadly crashes.
Boeing did not take fresh charges on top of the estimated $8 billion price tag for the MAX crisis, but warned of pressure on its cash flow until deliveries and production resume at normal levels. 
The planemaker separately faces a slew of investigations by regulators, U.S. Congress, and the Department of Justice over its development of the 737 MAX, its previously best-selling workhorse for short-haul travel.
Despite these risks, Boeing shares were up nearly 1% at $340.28 in midday trading as its steady estimate of a 737 MAX return in the fourth quarter appeared to eclipse the downside of the 787 production cut due to a drought of orders from China amid trade tensions, an analyst said.
""The 787 cut appears to be mostly tied to China trade negotiations, which at least have the potential to improve over the next 12-months,"" said Seaport Global analyst Josh Sullivan.
On Tuesday, the company ousted the top executive of its crucial commercial airplanes division, Kevin McAllister, in an unexpected management shakeup related to the MAX crisis that senior industry sources say puts Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg squarely in the firing line in the event of further revelations or if the company fails to recover from the MAX crisis.
Muilenburg, set to testify before U.S. lawmakers over two days in Washington next week, was stripped of his board chairman title earlier this month.
REGRET
On a conference call with analysts, Muilenburg expressed regret over instant messages, first published by Reuters on Friday, in which a former Boeing pilot describes erratic simulator behavior of software now linked to both crashes. 
The 2016 messages, sent months before the aircraft entered service, plunged Boeing into a media firestorm as the FAA and lawmakers demanded explanations on their content and delayed release.
Boeing's timeline of a fourth-quarter MAX return compares to a January target from European regulators, while major U.S. carriers United, Southwest, and American were all drawing up schedules without the MAX until next year.
Muilenburg said the company was making ""daily"" progress on testing the final software fix for the 737 MAX and developing related training materials, though the FAA said on Tuesday it would need at least several more weeks for review.
Noting that the MAX's already-delayed return was at the mercy of regulators, Muilenburg said the company could consider cutting or halting 737 production if regulatory approvals are further delayed, though there was no immediate announcement of job cuts.
On Wednesday, the U.S. manufacturer reported a 53% drop in quarterly profit and a negative free cash flow of $2.89 billion in the quarter, compared with a positive free cash flow of $4.10 billion a year earlier.
Core operating earnings fell to $895 million or $1.45 per share, from $1.89 billion or $3.58 per share, a year earlier.
NEW SETBACKS
The MAX crisis, which has consumed the company, has eclipsed work on a potential new mid-market airplane codenamed NMA, and other industrial setbacks broadened pressure on the company's new commercial leadership. 
On Tuesday, Boeing named veteran executive Stan Deal, who had been running its two-year-old Global Services Division, to the top job at commercial airplanes. 
Deal's challenge is to get the MAX back into service globally while simultaneously handling new aircraft deliveries and boosting 737 production. That's seen as one of the most formidable logistical challenges in the industry's history.
After the 737 MAX safety ban in March, Boeing cut 737 monthly production from 52 aircraft to 42 and halted deliveries, cutting off a key source of cash and hitting margins. 
Boeing's previous schedule to hit a record manufacturing rate of 57 single-aisle jets per month by June 2020, after incrementally returning to pre-crash levels, was now delayed until late 2020, the company said. 
Muilenburg also said  General Electric  (N:GE) was making ""good progress"" addressing problems with its GE9X engine for the 777X twin-aisle, and the aircraft was still on track for a first flight in early 2020. 
But Boeing was now targeting early 2021 for the first delivery of the 777X, and sees 3 total 777-program deliveries per month in 2020, verses 3.5 per month in 2019, Muilenburg said.
With the 777-8 and 777-9, Boeing aims to maintain its grip on the 'mini-jumbo' market by leap-frogging rival Airbus' (PA:AIR) 365-seat A350-1000 and scooping up fresh orders following the demise of the A380 superjumbo.
Citing global trade tensions and a lack of orders from China, America's largest exporter was also reducing the 787 Dreamliner production rate to 12 airplanes per month for approximately two years beginning in late 2020.

Boeing faced additional uncertainty over future production rates for its Dreamliner earlier this month from lost business, theoretically putting a hole in production after Boeing increased its build-rate to 14 aircraft per month from 12 at twin U.S. factories.

The Millenium Challenge Corporation (MCC), a U.S. government foreign assistance agency, agreed in 2014 to provide $498 million in funding to Ghana's power sector to help stimulate further private investment.
The initiative, launched in 2013 by then president Barack Obama and aiming to bring electricity to tens of millions of households in Africa, was the largest by the United States under Power Africa.
One reform under the agreement involved handing over operations at state-run Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) in March to Ghana Power Distribution Services (PDS), a consortium led by Philippine electricity company Meralco (PS:MER).
But Ghana's finance minister informed U.S. officials on Saturday that the government was cancelling the 20-year concession it had signed with PDS, saying payment guarantees provided were not satisfactory.
In a statement on Tuesday, the U.S. embassy said the decision to terminate the contract was unjustified and that the MCC was therefore cancelling $190 million in grants.
The remaining $308 million will still be disbursed.
""The United States underscores the importance of contract sanctity as essential to a conducive investment climate and a pre-condition for inclusive economic growth,"" it said.
Ghana's Information Minister Kojo Oppong Nkrumah told reporters on Wednesday that the U.S. announcement did not represent ""a crisis of confidence"" between the two governments.

Meralco did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
1291,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2019 12:17PM ET</span>",Caterpillar cuts profit outlook as China construction sales slump,"By Rachit Vats and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - Industrial bellwether  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) reported a drop in sales in the United States and China in the third quarter, leading it to cut its outlook for the year and adding to evidence that the global economy is firmly on the decline.
The Illinois-based machinery maker, famous for its black and yellow diggers and earthmovers, also said the impact on its business from Beijing and Washington's tit-for-tat trade tariffs would now be lower than previously forecast. 
However, it said that cuts in the inventory carried by the network of retailers who sell its products would accelerate further in the fourth quarter and see continued ""moderate"" pricing for its range of goods next year.
Sales in Asia-Pacific, its third biggest market, fell 13% as it faced falling demand in China and competition from cut-price domestic rivals, while revenue in its main developed world market in North America fell almost 3%.
That drove an initial slide of 5% in the company's shares, now only marginally higher this year, and left analysts predicting little immediate improvement. 
""While inventory reduction should set the company up for easier comparisons in 2020, trends in all three end markets continue to decelerate, raising the question of how far ahead the market is willing to discount the shares,"" said Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann.
The company's third-quarter profit for shareholders of $2.66 per share was well short of Wall Street estimates and the number for the same period a year ago - both set at $2.88 per share.
CONSTRUCTION SLUMP
Caterpillar said the slump in Asia was led by a 29% plunge in construction equipment sales and Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby said he expected overall demand in the fourth quarter to be flat.
Total sales and revenue for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 fell 5.6% from a year earlier to $12.76 billion.
""Sales in Asia/Pacific were lower across most of the region primarily due to lower demand in China, including unfavorable changes in dealer inventories, amid continued competitive pressures,"" the company said.
Caterpillar sales have improved since the company managed to halt a four-year slide in 2016, but Wall Street analysts have been warning that demand in more than half of its end markets had peaked. 
Finance chief Andrew Bonfie said dealers had reduced the value of stock they were holding by $400 million in the third quarter and were likely to cut by another $900 million in the final three months of the year, a stark contrast to an $800 million ramp-up in the third quarter a year ago.
The company is seen as one of Wall Street's clearer gauges of the state of Chinese demand and its impact on big western multinationals.
Caterpillar said the impact of tariffs imposed on its goods as a result of President Donald Trump's trade war with Beijing would now be lower than the $250 million to $350 million range it gave earlier this year. 
But it also cut its 2019 expectations for profit to between $10.90 and $11.40 per share compared with a prior estimate of $12.06 to $13.06. 

Profit attributable to common stockholders fell to $1.49 billion in the third quarter from $1.73 billion, or $2.88 per share, a year earlier.

1292,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2019 11:39AM ET</span>","Head of international 737 MAX review, NTSB chair to testify before Senate","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chair of a panel of international regulators that harshly criticized the Federal Aviation Administration's certification of the now grounded Boeing 737 MAX will testify Tuesday before a Senate committee.
Christopher Hart, a former National Transportation Safety Board chair who oversaw the review, will speak before the Senate Commerce Committee alongside current NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt, the panel said in a statement Wednesday. 
They will appear after the testimony of  Boeing Co  (N:BA) chief executive Dennis Muilenburg and John Hamilton, who is vice president and chief engineer for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Muilenburg will then testify before a U.S. House panel on Wednesday.
The testimony will take place on the first anniversary of the crash of a Lion Air 737 MAX jet that killed all 189 on board. On Wednesday, Indonesian investigators told victims’ families that mechanical and design issues contributed to the crash.
Contributing factors to the crash included incorrect assumptions on how an anti-stall device, called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), functioned and how pilots would react, slides in the presentation showed.
Congress is mulling changes to how the FAA delegates some certification tasks to manufacturers for new airplanes. In the 737 MAX certification it initially delegated 40% of the work to Boeing and later shifted more work to Boeing, including MCAS.
The report from the Joint Authorities Technical Review (JATR), commissioned by the FAA, faulted the review of MCAS and Boeing for assumptions it made in designing the airplane.
On Friday, Boeing turned over to the FAA instant messages from November 2016 from a former Boeing technical pilot to another pilot that it had withheld for months, raising questions about what the company knew about MCAS. Boeing has suggested the messages raised concerns about the simulator and not MCAS itself. FAA demanded an immediate explanation for why the messages were not turned over earlier.
The JATR recommendations said the FAA’s longstanding practice of delegating ""a high level"" of certification tasks to manufacturers needs significant reform to ensure adequate oversight. The FAA failed to ""to provide an independent assessment of the adequacy"" of Boeing's MCAS certification activities.
On Tuesday, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said the agency had received the ""final software load"" and ""complete system description"" from Boeing on the 737 MAX, but added it is going to be several more weeks before a key certification test flight. Major U.S. airlines have canceled 737 MAX flights into January and February.

(Reuters) - SoftBank Group agreed to spend more than $10 billion to take over WeWork on Tuesday, doubling down on an ill-fated investment and giving a near $1.7 billion payoff to the U.S. office-space sharing startup's co-founder Adam Neumann to relinquish control.
The deal represents a stunning reversal of fortune for WeWork as well as its largest shareholder, SoftBank Group Corp, which has committed more than $13 billion in equity to a company that is now valued at just $8 billion.
The bailout comes as SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is seeking to convince investors to participate in the Japanese company's second mammoth Vision Fund, for which he is seeking to raise $108 billion. 
To stem WeWork's bleeding, SoftBank will need to reverse its widening losses and find a way to make it profitable.
Shares in SoftBank dropped 2.5% on Wednesday in Tokyo, while the cost of default protection on the firm has risen, with the 5-year credit default swap jumping 17.7 points in a week to the highest level since January.
The rescue financing also marks a dramatic fall from grace for Neumann, who as recently as last month was preparing to take WeWork public as CEO after attaining a $47 billion valuation for it in January. 
While WeWork employees now face the prospect of thousands of layoffs, Neumann has secured a $685 million side deal with SoftBank to step down from the board of WeWork's owner, The We Company, according to people familiar with the arrangement.
Neumann also has the right to sell $970 million of shares, according to one of the sources, as part of a tender offer in which WeWork will buy up to $3 billion in WeWork shares from existing investors and employees at a price of $19.19 each. 
He currently owns a little over a fifth of WeWork, and is expected to retain a stake.
Neumann faced margins calls on his personal borrowings against WeWork's private stock as a result of the collapse of the company's valuation. 
SoftBank has agreed to extend to him a $500 million loan to repay a credit line from JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), as well as pay him a $185 million fee for a four-year assignment as a consultant to WeWork, one of the sources said.
Neumann had drawn down $395 million on JPMorgan's credit line, another of the sources added. 
Under the terms of the deal with SoftBank, he must use the proceeds from selling his stock to first repay the loan extended to him by SoftBank, according to the source. 
Even though he will give up his board seat, Neumann will get two representatives on WeWork's board, one of the sources said. WeWork said in a statement that its board will be expanded and control how Neumann's shares are voted. 
Reuters first reported on Monday that Neumann was negotiating stepping down from the board and would serve as an adviser.
""The consulting arrangement is mind boggling. It's terrible governance,"" said Nell Minow, vice chair of shareholder advisory firm ValueEdge Advisors. ""Why pay the guy who got WeWork into this mess for advice. It's adding insult to injury and a little more injury too."" 
Nevertheless, some WeWork investors said they supported the deal.
""Adam is a visionary who has created an impactful company which has transformed the way many people work, live and think. We think he deserved to take some money off the table for his contribution to the company,"" said All Blue Capital managing partner Matt Novak. 
He declined to say how big his firm's stake in WeWork is.
SoftBank said it will provide a $5 billion debt package to WeWork, comprising $1.1 billion in senior secured notes, $2.2 billion in unsecured notes, and a $1.75 billion letter of credit facility. WeWork picked SoftBank's offer over an alternative $5 billion debt package submitted on Monday by JPMorgan.
SoftBank said it will also accelerate a previous $1.5 billion equity commitment to WeWork in the form of warrants that are due in April at a new price of $11.60 per share.
SoftBank said it will own 80% of WeWork following the tender offer but will not be consolidating the company on its books because it will not hold a majority of voting rights. SoftBank will have four board seats on the company's expanded 10-member board, one of the source said. 
SoftBank and its first $100 billion Vision Fund already owned about a third of WeWork through previous investments totaling $10.6 billion.
All of the Vision Fund's interests in regional joint ventures with WeWork outside of Japan will be exchanged for shares in WeWork at $11.60 per share, SoftBank said.
""We hope SoftBank can execute on this enhanced vision, through leveraging its strategic partnerships, or otherwise, and bring back value to WeWork's minority shareholders,"" said All Blue Capital's Novak, adding his firm will be holding on to its stake because it views SoftBank's tender offer price as too low.
WeWork abandoned its initial public offering last month, after investors questioned its large losses, the sustainability of its business model and the way it was being run by Neumann, who gave up his CEO title last month. He had retained his position as chairman of the We Company. 
SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure will succeed Neumann and become The We Company's executive chairman.
""The new capital SoftBank is providing will restore momentum to the company and I am committed to delivering profitability and positive free cash flow,"" Claure said in a statement.
Artie Minson, previously WeWork's chief financial officer, and Sebastian Gunningham, who was a vice chairman at the company, are now serving as its co-chief executives.
POOR GOVERNANCE
While Neumann's investors were willing to entertain his eccentricities since co-founding WeWork in 2010, his free-wheeling ways and party-heavy lifestyle came into focus once he failed to get the company's IPO underway.
During the attempts to woo IPO investors last month, Neumann was criticized by corporate governance experts for arrangements that went beyond the typical practice of having majority voting control through special categories of shares.
These included giving his estate a major say in his replacement as CEO, and tying the voting power of shares to how much he donated to charitable causes. Neumann had also entered into several transactions with WeWork, making the company a tenant in some of his properties and charging it rent. 
Neumann, 40, is not the first founder of a major startup to be forced to step down recently. 
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc co-founder Travis Kalanick resigned as CEO of the ride-hailing startup in 2017 after facing a rebellion from his board over a string of scandals, including allegations of enabling a chauvinistic and toxic work culture.

""I view this as SoftBank's moonshot to get WeWork back on all fours,"" said Eric Talley, professor of law at Columbia Law School. ""They realize that Neumann's continued involvement in the company would be a continued impediment to that.""

1298,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 23, 2019 09:55AM ET</span>",Stocks Near Record Highs Send False Signal,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- From U.S. Treasury securities to gold and the shares of utility and healthcare companies, it’s been a great time for financial assets that provide a hedge against an economic slowdown. And as the latest U.S. economic reports show, it’s too soon to abandon so-called defensive assets even though the stock market has rebounded and is back near a record high.
The most important takeaway from last week’s data, especially the drop in retail sales and industrial production, is that Main Street has joined Wall Street in anticipating the slowdown in economic growth to continue, and possibly lead to a recession. This confluence warrants a more rapid shift in allocation from higher risk assets, such as equities like those in the technology sector whose valuations are dependent on rapid growth, to more defensive holdings.
The unexpected 0.3% decline in retail sales for September is an ominous development ahead of the holidays when seasonal factors should be boosting spending and suggests consumers are increasingly concerned about the trade wars that President Donald Trump is waging with China and Europe, and how that could eventually affect U.S. workers’ employment and wages.
Retail sales often serve as a leading indicator of overall consumer spending, which accounts for around 70% of gross domestic product. Rather than an isolated event, the drop in sales last month followed declines in consumer sentiment and confidence measures. Since weak consumer spending cannot be offset by other components of aggregate expenditures such as capital spending or government outlays -- they collectively account for less than a third of GDP – it carries a lot of weight in determining economic growth.
Industrial production dropped 0.4% in September, much worse than the 0.2% increase that was forecast. Although a portion of the decline was due to a strike by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). workers, the adverse impact on suppliers to the automaker appears to have continued in October -- as does the strike. That could have a negative impact on economic growth in the final quarter of the year.
None of this is a surprise to those who deal in the market for Treasuries securities, which has been flashing yellow for some time. The difference, or spread, three-month bill rates and 10-year note yields was consistently negative from May until just recently due to speculation the Federal Reserve will aggressively lower interest rates in response to a slowing economy.
An inversion in this part of the yield curve has been a reliable predictor of recessions the past several decades. And although Larry Kudlow, Director of the National Economic Council, suggested on Thursday that the return to a positive yield spread presaged a growing economy, history suggests otherwise. An inversion of the yield curve for several months, followed by a steepening to positive spread levels before the recession begins, has been the pattern in the two most recent recessions, from March 2001 to November 2001, and from December 2007 to June 2009.
How do we explain the inversion reversing even before a recession begins? An inversion heralds a recession some nine to 12 months ahead of its inception, so the switch to a positive spread looks beyond the recession in anticipation of the subsequent recovery.
The recent steepening of the yield curve should not be a source of comfort. Rather, the focus should be on the convergence of factors from the financial and real sides of the economy that is heightening the probability that a recession is in the cards."

(Reuters) - Higher deliveries of Gulfstream jets boosted revenue at U.S. aerospace and defense company General Dynamics Corp (N:GD), which reported a 7.3% rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday, but shares were flat in premarket trading after gaining 2.5% a day earlier.
Revenue from its aerospace unit jumped 23% to $2.5 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 29, as new Gulfstream deliveries, a key metric for investors, increased to 38, from 27 a year earlier.
The company delivered some of its first G600 jets to customers in August.
Net earnings climbed to $913 million, or $3.14 per share, in the quarter, from $851 million, or $2.85 per share, a year earlier. Wall Street analysts estimated earnings per share of $3.06, according to Refinitiv data.
Revenue rose 7.3% to $9.76 billion.
On Monday, General Dynamic's Gulfstream division unveiled its widely expected G700 long-range jet, in a challenge to Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) flagship Global 7500 aircraft.
Profit margins at the aerospace unit fell nearly three percentage points to 15.8% from 18.5% in the same quarter last year as the company invested in G600 and G700 jet production.
Operating earnings from the Marine Systems unit, which makes ships and submarines for the U.S. Navy, rose to $209 million, a 24% increase compared to the same quarter a year ago.
Combat systems, which makes tanks, saw its revenue go up 14% from last year to $1.7 billion. In July, the U.S. State Department approved the possible sale to Taiwan of 108 of General Dynamics' M1A2T Abrams tanks, angering China.
Also in July, General Dynamics won a $2 billion contract to continue supporting global security, engineering and supply chain missions for the U.S. Department of State.
Total backlog at the end of third quarter 2019 was $67.4 billion, compared with $67.7 billion at the end of the second quarter."

At least six brokerages raised price targets on the parent company of photo messaging app Snapchat, with JP Morgan one of two brokerages to boost its recommendation for the shares to ""overweight"" from ""neutral"".
After a period when the social media company and its trademark disappearing messages have struggled to compete with Facebook's (O:FB) Instagram, JPM analysts said they expected Snap to capture greater advertising spending.
Many also emphasized Snap's estimate that it would reach profitability in the fourth quarter, as measured by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).
Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said that Snap's potentially conservative forecast and accelerated path to profitability also gave him more conviction in Snap's story, although he was disappointed by its fourth-quarter revenue forecast.
""Jefferies is positive fundamentally (on Snap), but would wait for a pullback to get constructive,"" Thill said.
Snap estimated fourth-quarter revenue at $540 million to $560 million, the midpoint of which was below analysts' estimate of $555.4 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said Snap was still one of the most innovative platforms in the social media space and highlighted that the company was ""arguably more investible now than at any point in its public trading history"".
""The last couple quarters suggest premium growth resilience and a more credible path to profitability (for Snap),"" Mahaney said.
Shares of the company were up nearly 4% at $14.55 in early morning trading on Wednesday, having fallen around 5% following the results on Tuesday.
Up to Tuesday's close, Snap shares are up more than 150% this year."

Some of the most prominent engines of the global economy are showing signs of trade war fatigue. The next big concern is that the drivers will grow weary, too.
Just ask those at ground zero of U.S. trade with China.
“Clearly for the last year there certainly has been indecision, uncertainty in the industry,” Mario Cordero, executive director at the Port of Long Beach in California, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “You’re now seeing actually the impact.”
The latest examples:
  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), a bellwether of the world’s industrial economy, just reported a 6% drop in third-quarter revenue compared with a year earlier. Jim Umpleby, CEO of the Illinois-based maker of construction machinery,  said that in the final three months of the year, “we now expect end-user demand to be flat and dealers to make further inventory reductions due to global economic uncertainty.” Hasbro shares tumbled 17% on Tuesday after the Rhode Island-based toy maker reported weaker-than-expected profit largely blamed on tariffs that aren’t even in place yet. “If the December 15th tariffs were to go into effect, we would take pricing to again protect our gross margin, and those price increases would be passed along to consumers,” CEO Brian Goldner said. “We don’t see tariffs being enacted two weeks before Christmas is giving the consumer the optimal holiday season.” Harley-Davidson said tariffs were a $21.6 million drag on third-quarter earnings, almost double the impact of a year ago. The Wisconsin-based motorcycle maker is on track to start producing bikes in Thailand that will be shipped to the European Union, a workaround the company started putting in motion last year. CFO John Olin said “we’re looking at our business with the abundance of caution necessary in an environment like this.” Polaris, the Minnesota-based maker of off-road vehicles, motorcycles, snowmobiles and boats, has implemented about 60 tariff-mitigation initiatives that have combined to reduce the impact on its bottom line by about $5 million this year, CEO Scott Wine said. He cited efforts to shift sourcing of some parts out of China and negotiate with suppliers as examples.As U.S. companies try to cope, worries are growing that household spending will be next to suffer if the tariff fights drag on.
“Going forward, it’s going to be the impact on the American consumer, because again, consumption is what drives our GDP,” said Cordero, who oversees one of the busiest ports in the U.S. “If that’s impacted, then of course we are going to see an impact on the economy.”
Charting the Trade War
Brent crude has fallen by a fifth since April. Bloomberg Economics estimates that weak demand — linked to the impact of the trade war — accounts for 70% of the decline.

The maker of the Impossible Burger filed an application to market soy leghemoglobin, the iron-containing molecule made with a genetically engineered yeast, according to the EU’s food safety authority. The ingredient, known as heme, is a key additive for helping replicate the richness of meat flavors.
Genetically-modified foods and labeling are tightly regulated in the EU, unlike the U.S., which could mean approval could take time. If it gets the green light, the Impossible Burger will join an increasingly crowded market for faux meat in Europe. Beyond Burger has already made inroads in supermarkets on this side of the Atlantic, and is featured at racing-driver Lewis Hamilton’s new plant-based burger chain.
Nestle SA (SIX:NESN), the world’s biggest food company, has also just accelerated efforts to tap demand for faux meat. The Swiss firm recently rolled out a plant-based burger in the U.S., but had previously been focusing on its Garden Gourmet vegetarian products, including the Incredible Burger, in Europe.
Demand has boomed as consumers seek out foods they see as healthier and more environmentally friendly than beef. Imitation meat could reach 9% of the estimated $2.7 trillion global meat market by 2040, Jefferies analyst Simon Powell forecasts, from less than 1% now.
The EU application from Impossible Foods was filed Sept. 30 with the Dutch government under the EU’s regulation on genetically modified food and feed, and passed onto the European Food Safety Authority, filings show.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (N:AIG) said on Wednesday it is preparing to launch a new business through Lloyd's of London Ltd [SOLYD.UL] that will serve U.S. high net worth clients.
The business, which will operate as part of the Lloyd's of London global insurance marketplace, will support AIG's Private Client Group and provide additional new coverages to those clients, AIG said.
AIG expects the business, dubbed ""Syndicate 2019,"" to generate up to $1 billion in gross premiums to the Lloyd's market, the company said. The business is set to start writing coverage effective Jan. 1, 2020, subject to regulators' approval, AIG said.
The move comes as Lloyd's, a 330-year-old insurance market, is undergoing an effort to modernize its operations and expand its U.S. reach under chief executive John Neal, who took charge of Lloyd's in 2018.
Lloyd's kicked off its U.S. strategy in June at a New York dinner for top insurance and brokerage executives. The company had planned to meet with AIG and other major insurers that week about potential opportunities for selling more of their insurance products through Lloyd's, Neal told Reuters at the time."

1307,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2019 08:26AM ET</span>",How will Amazon deliver in its second biggest market?,"By Emma Thomasson and Riham Alkousaa
MANNHEIM, Germany (Reuters) - Every half an hour, 50 vans sweep into Amazon's distribution center in Mannheim, Germany and sweep out again with up to 200 parcels and a precise delivery plan in each.
The tightly choreographed morning operation is designed to maximize speed and minimize costs, preconditions for the success of Amazon's rapid expansion in its biggest international market.
But contractors which hire delivery people say that finding drivers is increasingly difficult.
Salem Ahmad runs a small logistics company which recently won a contract to deliver parcels for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the city of Bochum. An Iraqi who has lived in Germany since 2001, he is struggling to find around 50 to 60 new drivers.
Many migrants with families calculate they will get more in benefits than the average 1,600 euros a month Ahmad can pay them, he said. ""They think, why bother and work in such demanding job if it won’t benefit them financially.""
Raising salaries could help attract more drivers, Ahmad said: ""But at the current rates we have, it's not easy to solve this problem.""
Amazon sends almost a third of the 1.4 billion parcels delivered to private customers in Germany each year, said Horst Manner-Romberg, head of logistics consultancy MDU. He estimates the parcel delivery sector overall is short of as many as 9,000 drivers.
In Munich, where Amazon launched its own delivery service for Germany in 2015, it has recently begun hiring drivers directly. An Amazon spokeswoman said there is usually a shortage of drivers in the city during the Christmas shopping peak.
Bernd Gschaider, Germany director for Amazon Logistics, which covers deliveries from distribution centers, denied there was shortage of delivery drivers in Germany. ""Of course we are competing for the best workers as in many other sectors but we believe we offer our drivers - and those of our partners - a good package,"" he said.
""HARD LABOR""
Several drivers currently or formerly employed by contractors told Reuters working conditions were punishing.
""The days were difficult: hard labor in every sense of the word,” said one of them, Ihsan Hardan, a 35-year-old father of four from Syria who spent seven months delivering parcels for a subcontractor driving for Amazon until he quit in May.
Working days were as long as 12 hours, some drivers said, because there was no way they could deliver so many parcels in a standard eight-hour shift. A few drivers said they had to turn up at the depot well before they started driving and return undelivered parcels.
""You have 180 stops, 180 times to get out of and in the car, 180 times you have to find parking, 180 times knocking on client house, sometimes they are there, sometime they aren't,"" Hardan said, declining to name the subcontractor which hired him. 
Amazon says it designs routes to fit a regular shift and that contractors should bring in relief drivers if they find they cannot deliver within the time.
Yves Delmas, chief operating officer Europe for parcel delivery firm DPD, owned by France's La Poste, noted DPD's turnover of workers is as much as 40 percent a year in Germany. ""Home delivery will become more and more expensive,"" he said.
The other two major logistics companies in Germany which both deliver for Amazon -  Deutsche Post  DHL (DE:DPWGn)and Hermes - have both hiked prices for parcel deliveries in the last year - citing the need to pay more to attract drivers.
PRICE RISES
Melanie Kreis, finance chief of Deutsche Post DHL, said recently that few delivery staff are prepared to work for the German minimum wage of 9.19 euros ($10.24) per hour. DHL pays its employee drivers at least 13.37 euros per hour.
Amazon said it will pay the drivers it has begun employing directly in Munich 12.80 euros per hour. Reuters did not interview any drivers working directly for Amazon.
Hermes plans to increase parcel fees for contractors so they can eventually hike hourly pay to 12 euros from 9.50 euros now.
""Shortage of personnel is a massive challenge,"" a Hermes spokeswoman said. ""We are convinced that the job of parcel couriers needs to be financially more attractive.""
A German law is expected to pass by the end of the year making companies responsible for ensuring their contractors pay social security for their employees.
Kira Falter, a labor expert with German law firm CMS, said companies will have to hire controllers to ensure their contractors make those deductions, pay workers properly and stick to working time regulations.
""The latest amendments will result in significant additional costs, which will either be borne by the e-commerce company itself or by the customer through higher prices,"" Falter said.
Amazon's Gschaider said its auditors already perform spot checks to ensure contractors comply with working time and other rules so the changes would not affect its business.
The company's sales in Germany rose 17% in 2018 to almost $20 billion, or 9% of the group total. 
Overall, Amazon missed analyst expectations for profit for the first time in two years in July as it ramps up spending on one-day delivery and its own network. https://tmsnrt.rs/2o8SqJy
Amazon reports third quarter results on Oct. 24, with analysts predicting a fall in earnings per share to $4.60 from $5.75 a year ago, Refinitiv data shows.

The online retail giant plans to almost double its number of distribution centers in Germany this year, to 24, and open another warehouse, bringing its staff total to more than 20,000 across more than 35 sites.

1308,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 23, 2019 08:13AM ET</span>",Caterpillar Cuts 2019 Profit Outlook as Global Growth Hampers Demand,"(Bloomberg) --   Caterpillar   Inc (NYSE:CAT) lowered its earnings forecast as it reported the first decline in quarterly profit in almost three years, adding to worries over a slowing global economy that have weighed on sales of its signature yellow machines.
The largest maker of mining and machinery equipment reported a 5.2% drop in sales and expects demand to be flat in the fourth quarter. Its shares fell.
The profit outlook suggests the deterioration in Asia that the company flagged in July has worsened. Caterpillar said in July that it was counting on dealers to work through an inventory buildup to help meet earnings targets, but Wednesday’s results signal the glut remains.
“Our volumes declined as dealers reduced their inventories, and end-user demand, while positive, was lower than our expectations,” Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby said in the statement. “In the fourth quarter, we now expect end-user demand to be flat and dealers to make further inventory reductions due to global economic uncertainty.”
Shares tumbled 4.3% to $127.96 in premarket trading at 6:45 a.m. in New York.
The company said third-quarter earnings fell to $2.66 a share, trailing the $2.87 average estimate of analysts. Revenue in the period slipped to $12.8 billion from $13.5 billion a year earlier.
Machine sales growth at the economic bellwether has slipped in Asia and the U.S. on weaker orders in construction industries, just as the company has been trying to raise prices.
The report comes a week after the International Monetary Fund cut its 2019 global growth forecast to a decade low, citing a broad deceleration across the world’s largest economies as trade tensions undermine the expansion.
For the individual units:
Mining total sales were $2.31 billion in the third quarter of 2019, a decrease of $327 million. Many analysts have looked at the segment as a business that would be growing as some other sales would be slowing.Oil and gas-related revenue was down 9% in the quarter. Caterpillar cited the drop in reciprocating engines, units that are used in fracking. That decline was only partially offset by increased sales of turbines.For construction, Caterpillar saw North American sales increase but revenue from Asia was hit primarily because of lower demand in China, competitive pressures and dealer inventories."

LONDON (Reuters) - World stock markets struggled on Wednesday, as hopes faded that a Brexit deal would be wrapped by next week and a profit warning from Texas Instruments pulled down technology shares.
It was hard to pick which was weighing on sentiment more in European trading. The pound was yanked down to $1.2850 from $1.30  after UK lawmakers put the brakes on the government's Brexit plans again on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Europe's tech sector (SX8P) fell as much as 1.4% as STMicroelectronics (MI:STM), Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) and Infineon (DE:IFXGn) all dropped after Texas Instruments slumped 10% (O:TXN) in after-hours Wall Street trading. (EU)
Major Asian chipmakers, including Taiwan's TSMC (TW:2330) and South Korea's SK Hynix (KS:000660), had fallen overnight too on worries the industry was being squeezed both by a downturn in global demand and by the U.S.-China trade war. 
""When there are tensions in trade and obstacles to trade, what do businesses do? They become more cautious. And they pull back,"" Rafael Lizardi, Texas Instruments' chief financial officer, said after the company's results.
With investors seeking out safer assets again, the Japanese yen climbed to a one-week high of 108.25 per dollar  and the Swiss franc  gained early in Europe. 
Adam Cole, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said Brexit was driving a ""general risk-off tone."" Others pointed to the growing likelihood British Prime Minister Boris Johnson would now push for a snap election.
""Things could change very quickly today, depending on the EU response,"" Cole said, referring to how much EU leaders would be prepared to extend the Brexit deadline beyond Oct. 31. 
But he added he didn't see ""much downside"" risk for sterling now, with a no-deal Brexit off the table.
The pound has surged 4.5% this month which, if it holds the gains, will be its best month since January last year. 
Receding worries about a no-deal Brexit also underpinned the euro at $1.1122 (EUR=), just below a two-month high of $1.1180, though it was also down to the dollar staying subdued before an expected third U.S. interest rate cut of the year next week.
In a mirror image of the pound and euro, October is on course to see the biggest monthly fall in the dollar index (DXY) since January 2018. It has only fallen for six of the months during that period too.
CAT WARNING
Equities on Wall Street looked set for another sluggish start. Hopes for forgetting Texas' woes were already dashed as digger giant  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) blamed a weak global construction market as it cut its profit forecast after a hefty 13.5% fall in third quarter profits.
In commodity markets, oil prices fell after data showed U.S. crude inventories grew more than expected last week. But prices generally held firm after China signaled hopes for progress in upcoming trade talks with the United States and OPEC and its allies considered deeper cuts in production.

LONDON (Reuters) - Intense dialogue between British and European Union financial regulators must start now or London risks being cut off from the bloc after Brexit, a top banking lobbyist said on Wednesday.
Banks, insurers and asset managers in Britain currently have unfettered access to customers across the EU but this will end after Britain leaves the bloc.
Future EU access for UK financial firms will almost certainly be based on ""equivalence"", whereby Brussels deems that a foreign firm's home rules are aligned enough with those in the bloc to protect financial stability and customers.
Simon Lewis, who stands down as chief executive of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) this month after a nine-year stint, said that for equivalence work, good regulatory links were needed.
""You need to have structures in place like the EU-U.S. dialogue, and they probably need to go beyond that,"" he said.
""They need to get on with that. That work hasn't started. The sooner we can have that discussion about how equivalence is going to work and be adapted, the better.""
EU and UK markets watchdogs are, however, at loggerheads over whether swathes of trading in euro-denominated shares can continue in London if there is a no-deal Brexit.
There is also tension over how much EU regulators should be allowed to regulate UK clearing houses with EU customers.
Close regulatory dialogue would help clear up ""misunderstandings"" and avoid equivalence decisions ""going the wrong way"", Lewis said.
While few jobs or activities have moved so far from London to new EU hubs, it was ""early days"".
""Banks are looking at how they can minimize the cost of moves by where possible local hires or deferring decisions,"" he said.
Much could hinge on what asset managers in London do, with many having opened hubs in Dublin and Luxembourg.
""If over time the asset managers physically move from London, then that will make quite a difference.
""It's a golden rule of any business that you should be close to your customers. That again is not entirely clear how that is going to play out,"" Lewis said.
Banks also need to rebuild public trust shattered by taxpayer bailouts during the financial crisis a decade ago.
""The industry has been seen to have overlobbied on certain issues and there was a degree of distrust about that,"" Lewis said.
""There was a feeling that the industry was taking it for granted that its voice would always be heard. The rebuilding of trust in the industry will take quite a long time."""

Exchange operators have been trying to expand beyond their core trading business into high-growth segments such as information services which help traders make investment decisions, and trade in stocks and other exchange-traded products.
Revenue from information services, its biggest non-trading business, jumped 10.6% to $198 million in the quarter, and that from market technology surged 23.5% to $84 million.
Net income attributable to Nasdaq fell to $150 million, or 90 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $163 million, or 97 cents per share, a year earlier.
Nasdaq said it incurred a pre-tax restructuring charge of $30 million in the quarter, and expects to take another $35 million to $45 million in charges over a two-year period.
Revenue, excluding transaction-based expenses, rose 5.3% to $632 million.

The drugmaker is one of the three main providers of insulin products and had agreed earlier this year to offer a half priced version of its insulin injection Humalog in response to intensifying pressure from politicians to lower drug costs for consumers. 
Sales from both versions of the insulin injection fell 2.4% to $648.9 million, but narrowly beat analysts' average estimate of $645.33 million, according to three analysts polled by Refinitiv.
The drugmaker now expects 2019 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range $5.75 to $5.85, up from the prior range of $5.67 to $5.77. 
Net income rose to $1.25 billion, or $1.37 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $1.15 billion, or $1.12 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, Lilly earned $1.48 per share. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.41 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Revenue rose 3.2% to $5.48 billion in the quarter but missed Wall Street expectation of $5.50 billion, largely due to flat overall sales in the United States.

Samsung issued an apology via its customer support app Samsung Members and told its Galaxy phone users to update their biometric authentication to the latest software version.
A British user told The Sun newspaper that a bug on her Galaxy S10 allowed it to be unlocked regardless of the biometric data registered in the device.
Samsung has said the issue can happen when patterns appearing on certain protectors that come with silicon cases are recognized along with fingerprints.
""Samsung Electronics takes the security of products very seriously and will make sure to strengthen security through continuing improvement and updates to enhance biometric authentication functions,"" the company said on its Korean app.
Once touted as a revolutionary feature by Samsung, its ultrasonic fingerprint sensors were fooled by tech reviewers.
Videos on tech community websites show Galaxy devices can be unlocked through silicon protectors using a persimmon or a small doll.
Samsung said it would send notifications for software updates to Galaxy S10 and Note 10 users who have registered their biometric data.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -  Heineken  (AS:HEIN), the world's second-largest brewer, forecast profit this year would be at the bottom end of its previous guidance after an unexpected dip in third-quarter sales in the Americas partly offset strong growth in Asia.
The Dutch maker of Heineken, Europe's top-selling lager, as well as Tiger, Sol and Strongbow cider, said on Wednesday that operating profit before one-offs would rise by about 4% on a like-for-like basis in 2019.
It had previously forecast mid-single-digit percentage growth, although market expectations had shifted to the bottom of that range after operating profit barely grew in the first half of the year.
Heineken Chief Executive Officer Jean-Francois van Boxmeer also warned of increasing volatility across a number of markets and said this was likely to continue for the rest of the year.
Heineken shares were down 2.4% at 94.42 euros at 0950 GMT, although they were still up more than 20% in the year to date.
Analysts said the new guidance was behind the weakness, even if expectations had declined at the half-year mark, with markets on edge for negative news.
Otherwise, the Amsterdam-based brewer reported a mixed bag of beer sales figures, with a stand-out performance from its Asian business, better than expected sales in Europe, only weak growth in Africa and an unexpected decline in the Americas.
Overall, consolidated beer volumes rose by 2.3% year-on-year in the third quarter, exactly in line with expectations in a company-compiled poll.
MIXED FORTUNES
The Asia-Pacific region was the clear outperformer, with a 13.9% increase. Vietnam, Heineken's second most profitable market, was strong as the company pushed deeper into the country. Cambodia was even stronger.
By contrast, beer sales in the Americas unexpectedly fell, by 0.5%. There was a sharp decline in the United States, where its Mexican lager Tecate slid further.
There was also a slight decline in Brazil, where Heineken became the second largest player in 2017 by buying the loss-making operations there of Japan's Kirin (T:2503).
Heineken said sales of cheaper beers there had declined after a price rise, while volumes of higher-priced beers such as Heineken, Amstel and Devassa grew by a double-digit percentage.
Economic growth has been erratic in Brazil, with a contraction in the first quarter. The country's central bank last month raised its growth forecast for 2019 to 0.9%, albeit with a high degree of uncertainty.
In Mexico, the company's largest market, sales were up by a low single-digit percentage, helped by the launch of low calorie Amstel Ultra. However, the company is now facing competition from rival AB InBev (BR:ABI) in the nationwide OXXO supermarkets where its brands were previously the only beers on sale.
Heineken's beer sales in Europe, where it is the market leader, grew by 1.6%, against expectations of a decline a year on from the soccer World Cup and drinking boosted by good weather.
Growth in Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe was also 1.6%, but below expectations with unrest in Ethiopia leaving volumes flat there."

YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd is likely to axe its Datsun brand, drop some unprofitable products and close a number of assembly lines worldwide as it seeks to boost profits by getting smaller, two company sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Known internally as the ""performance recovery plan"", the proposed steps mark a sharp break with Nissan's strategy under ousted leader Carlos Ghosn, who pursued ambitious vehicle sales targets in the United States and other major markets.
The plan is the Yokohama-based automaker's latest attempt to pull itself out of crisis after Ghosn was arrested for financial misconduct - charges he denies. The scandal has further strained an already dysfunctional alliance with  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and thrown Nissan into disarray as it finds itself on course to book its lowest operating profit in 11 years.
The sources said Nissan will likely kill loss-making variants for the Titan full-size pickup. Unprofitable variants include the single-cab and diesel versions. 
A planned shuttering of underutilized production lines will most probably hit plants in emerging markets building Datsun and other small cars hardest, they added. 
""We need to chart a recovery but the rot goes deep,"" one of the sources said of the many problems facing Nissan.
The second source said all markets with factories except China were being looked at for possible reductions in production capacity. That source also said, however, that there were no plans to close an entire plant or withdraw completely from any country.
In the United States, one of Nissan's biggest markets, the plan calls for fresh efforts to weed out the practice of buying market share by selling vehicles to rental car and other fleet operators at heavy discounts - a practice which destroyed profitability and undermined Nissan's brand image.
""We're trying to clean up what had happened in the past,"" one of the sources said, adding that under Ghosn, Nissan sought to meet sales objectives at any cost, including ""practically giving away cars"" to fleet customers.
A team led by Jun Seki, a senior vice president and incoming vice chief operating officer, is expected to unveil the wide-ranging plan this month though some aspects are still being finalised, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak to media and declined to be identified.
Nissan declined to comment.
Seki is part of a new management team that will see Makoto Uchida, Nissan's head of China operations, take the helm - an appointment that is expected to take effect by Jan. 1.
The new steps follow plans unveiled in July to cut headcount by 12,500 globally by early 2023 and which also flagged cuts to production capacity. At the time, then-CEO Hiroto Saikawa said 14 facilities would be affected.
EMERGING MARKET WOES
Overall, the plan's aim is to free up resources to focus more on the United States and China, the sources said.
To that end it will roll back an aggressive expansionist strategy Ghosn set in motion under a five-year plan called Power 88 which aimed to raise profit margins and global market share to 8 percent by fiscal 2016 - goals which were never achieved.
The Datsun brand - revived for emerging markets under Ghosn after being phased out in the 1980s - will likely bear the brunt of the restructuring. The models are manufactured in Indonesia, India and Russia.
The sources said problems emerged after Nissan began deploying the no-frills cars in 2014 in small markets such as Indonesia, India, Russia and South Africa where it also sells vehicles under its mainstay Nissan brand.
In Indonesia, for example, after a relatively good start, Datsun cars soon began eating into Nissan sales.
""We ended up pushing two mainstream brands in a market where you have a one or two percent market share. You cannot do that,"" one of the sources said, adding that there had been similar outcomes in India, South Africa and Russia.
In its bigger markets, a steady supply of new or significantly redesigned models – starting with the redesigned Altima which was launched in the United States late last year – is expected to help Nissan reset the way it prices its vehicles.
""Still, it takes about a year to get any sort of tangible results,"" one of the sources said, adding that until then the Japanese automaker would continue to see sales by volume fall in the U.S. market.

1324,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2019 05:44AM ET</span>",Making do with less: Mexican media bruised by president's austerity,"By Noe Torres
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office in December promising to reduce public spending to free up more resources for the poor. But his austerity drive has left media outlets reeling, and raised questions about whether Lopez Obrador is trying to influence coverage. 
Between January and August, Lopez Obrador's government spent 88 million pesos ($4.6 million) on advertising, just 3.6% of the sum spent in the same months of 2018 by his predecessor Enrique Pena Nieto, Public Administration Ministry (SFP) data show.
Though such spending usually rises towards year-end, the eight-month outlay is the lowest in at least seven years, and well under budget. The reduction in government publicity, which had accounted for 10% or more of advertising revenue for many outlets, has sparked layoffs and the suspension of projects in an industry still suffering disruption from the shift to the internet.
Everyone is feeling the pain, from regional newspapers, to marquee broadcasters such as Televisa and TV Azteca. Televisa's profit fell by 20% in the first quarter and by 79% in the second.
With the media desperate for funds, some critics fear the administration could lean on them for favorable coverage.
""If the president's goal is to regulate the flow of investment in advertising, I would celebrate it,"" said Ruben Arnoldo Gonzalez, a media expert at Puebla's Benemerita Autonomous University. ""But I wouldn't be surprised if the spending cuts are also a way to pressure the press.""
The government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In news conferences this year, Lopez Obrador has denied his goal was to weaken the media. 
Lopez Obrador's relationship with the media has long been rocky, and during the daily news conferences he has frequently attacked critical outlets such as newspaper Reforma, calling it an arm of the ""conservative"" opposition.
Nor has he hidden his preference for sympathetic voices.
""The best journalists in Mexico's history ... all took sides,"" the president said in July.
The field appears to be thinning.
Though there is no official figure for how many media operate in Mexico, the number of newspapers and magazines on the national register - those considered viable for government advertising - had by Sept. 25 fallen to 833 from 1,590 at the end of 2018, according to interior ministry data.
Quantifying Lopez Obrador's impact on editorial independence is difficult, but the media are becoming friendlier to him, said Fernando Dworak, a Mexico City-based political analyst.
""It's a loss of plurality, and we don't exactly know if it's due to financing, to public pressure or for their convenience,"" he said, noting it could be all of the above.
What is clear, Dworak added, is that Lopez Obrador's 7 a.m. news conferences, which can last more than two hours, have made major media dedicate more air time to the government line.
Latin America is no stranger to such situations. 
Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori used cash to sway newspapers and television channels in his favor.
In Venezuela, almost three-quarters of newspapers closed by mid-2018 after five years of recession. A shortage of paper for printing presses and the government's refusal to renew TV and radio broadcasting licenses, has left coverage largely in the state's hands.
""LESS IS MORE""
During its six-year term, the Pena Nieto administration purchased some $2.5 billion in advertising, favoring big contracts with media conglomerates Televisa and TV Azteca.
Lopez Obrador budgeted for around $250 million in advertising this year, compared with $485 million spent by Pena Nieto in 2018, according to SFP figures.
    ""We care about keeping spending down,"" Lopez Obrador said this month. ""We need moderation, because less is more."" 
Mexican media's steady flow of government funds has long insulated them from changing times, according to a report by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.
""The new political arrangements are having repercussions on the news media, which have become accustomed to having the government as their principal advertiser,"" the report said.
Televisa, which Lopez Obrador accused of complicity in an establishment plot to deny him the presidency in 2006, for years was an ally of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated Mexico for most of the past century.
Headed by tycoon Emilio Azcarraga, the company said its second quarter drop in income was partly due to lower government spending on advertising. In 2018, the final year of Pena Nieto's PRI administration, government spending on advertising made up 11% of Televisa's total advertising revenue.
The story is virtually the same at other media firms.
TV Azteca's sales plummeted 29% in the second quarter and its stock is trading near a historic low, while Grupo Radio Centro suffered a 24% drop in sales and its shares are hovering around a 15-year low.
Media have cut back on coverage, laid off employees and sometimes found themselves unable to pay workers.

Investing.com -- Semiconductor stocks held Europe’s stock markets back Wednesday on a day when most indexes struggled to make headway after yet another parliamentary defeat for the U.K. government kept Brexit uncertainty alive and kicking.
A weak third-quarter report and outlook from bellwether Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) after the closing bell on Tuesday pushed German chipmaker Infineon Technologies (DE:IFXGn) down 2.3%, while STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) fell 2.1% and Dutch-based ASML (AS:ASML) fell 1.1%. Other sectors were largely in a holding pattern.
The decision of U.K. lawmakers to vote down a government motion trying to ram Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s withdrawal bill through parliament means that there will be no time to formalize exit terms with the EU before the Oct. 31 deadline.
The EU is currently considering a request for an extension to the deadline and has the choice of either accepting (for which it needs unanimity among its other 27 members) or of rejecting. While the latter would lead to a disorderly Brexit on Oct. 31, it seems unlikely given the EU’s recent public statements.
What is unclear is whether the EU would grant just enough time for the bill to be scrutinized, or for the U.K. to hold a general election if that was the preferred option of the U.K. An election could either return a majority government under Johnson, or another “hung” parliament with no overall control.
Either way, the pound’s decline overnight on the back of the developments made the FTSE 100 the best performing index of the morning, gaining 0.4% by 5:15 AM ET (0915 GMT). The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.2% at 394.00, unable to break through a resistance level where it has stalled on no fewer than five occasions since May 2018.
Germany’s DAX index was flat, while the French CAC 40 was down 0.4% after a bigger-than-expected drop in business confidence, as reported by Insee. Support came from carmaker   Peugeot   (PA:PEUP), which rose 2.1% after its third-quarter results avoided a repeat of Renault’s horror show last week.
In London, meanwhile,   Fresnillo   (LON:FRES) fell to the bottom of the FTSE 100 after reporting a drop in third-quarter output and warning of another dip in the fourth quarter due to lower ore grades.   Antofagasta   (LON:ANTO) gained after reassuring that it only faced a modest hit to output at its mines in Chile from the civil unrest there in recent days."
1326,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2019 05:01AM ET</span>","Huawei launches foldable phone in China at prices starting from $2,400","SHENZHEN, China/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd started taking orders on Wednesday in China for its eagerly awaited foldable smartphone, as it ramps up marketing at home to make up for weak overseas sales amid U.S. trade sanctions.
The launch of the 5G Mate X smartphone has been delayed twice this year, as Huawei, the world's No.2 smartphone maker, was forced to deal with tech supply disruptions caused by a U.S. trade blacklist imposed on the firm in May.
The move has dealt a blow to Huawei's smartphone sales in Europe, its key overseas market, but the company saw its third-quarter revenue rising 27% thanks to solid sales in China and higher shipments of models launched before the May ban.
The new smartphone, a competitor to Samsung Electronics Co's (KS:005930) Galaxy Fold which went on sale last month, will be launched officially on Nov. 15 in China at prices starting from 16,999 yuan ($2,403), a Huawei spokesman said.
Its global launch plan remains under review, Huawei said.
Washington alleges that Huawei, also the world's biggest telecoms gear maker, is a national security risk as its equipment could be used by Beijing to spy - something the Shenzhen-based company has repeatedly denied.
Still, the ban has meant that Huawei has not been able to license the latest version of Android from Google, the Alphabet (O:GOOGL) unit, which has impacted its latest Mate 30 smartphone range that it launched in September.
He Gang, head of Huawei's mobile phone division, said on Wednesday the company has already sold more than 200 million phones so far in 2019, hitting that milestone more than two months earlier than it did in 2018.
Huawei's 5G Mate X was originally set for a June launch but the company delayed it, saying that it was running certification tests with various carriers.

(Reuters) - European shares dipped for the first time this week on Wednesday, as warnings from Texas Instruments raised concerns about the global microchip industry, while UK lawmakers hit the pause button on Britain's exit from the European Union.
European tech stocks (SX8P) were set for their worst day in two weeks, dragged down by chipmakers Infineon (DE:IFXGn), Dialog (DE:DLGS) and STMicroelectronics (MI:STM), as sector proxy Texas Instruments (O:TXN) forecast a 10%-17% drop in current-quarter revenue.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) fell 0.1% as the Brexit saga hit another snag after British lawmakers rejected Prime Minister Boris Johnson's timetable.
""We don't think the chances of a no-deal Brexit have increased, but the chance of a delay has definitely soured the mood,"" said Hubert de Barochez, markets economist at Capital Economics.
European stock markets have been rattled in the past few months by geopolitical concerns, a prolonged U.S.-China trade war and a manufacturing recession in the bloc's biggest economy, Germany.
After solid gains in the first quarter, the benchmark index lost steam in the second and third. It kicked off October with its smallest quarterly increase this year.
With the focus now squarely on corporate earnings, analysts expect a drop of as much as 5.3% in third-quarter profit, worse than the 3.7% fall expected a week ago, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
 Heineken  (AS:HEIN) shares lost 2.3% after the world's second largest brewer said operating profit this year would be at the lower end of its previous forecast.

Overall orders fell 1% to a lower-than-expected $6.69 billion in the third quarter, according to a statement Wednesday. Growth at three of ABB’s four divisions was muted by a sharp 16% drop at the robotics and discrete automation unit.
“The outlook remains mixed,” Vontobel analyst Mark Diethelm wrote in note. The shares rose as much as 4.1%.
As a supplier of factory gear, Zurich-based ABB is exposed to the manufacturing slowdown that’s been gathering steam in recent months. At the same time, the company is undergoing an overhaul and top management shuffle, with the expected arrival March 1 of mining-equipment executive Bjorn Rosengren as the new CEO.
The results painted a blend of shrinking demand in some sectors and regions and growth in others. While orders were lower in Europe overall, including in Germany, and China, they rose in India and Japan, according to the statement. Revenue dropped in two divisions and rose in the other two.
“If you look at the overall market in robotics and discrete, we don’t see a significant change in that market at the moment,” Chief Financial Officer Timo Ihamuotila said on a call. “On the other hand, on some of our longer-cycle businesses we continue to see a strong pipeline, also in China.”
Global manufacturing has been shrinking for months, with the slump particularly pronounced in Germany, Europe’s largest economy. With a trade war between the U.S. and China still raging, industry executives from Germany to Japan and Russia have also complained of contracting business.
Chairman Peter Voser has taken over as interim CEO, and is overseeing a revamp of the business, including the sale of the bulk of the power-grid division to Hitachi Ltd. for about $6.4 billion and integration of a business acquired from  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co.

1329,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 23, 2019 04:43AM ET</span>","‘Flight Shame’ Is Real, Will Make Carbon Big Business, Citi Says","(Bloomberg) -- “Flight shame” -- flyers feeling guilty about their carbon footprint -- is a real phenomenon and will raise costs for airlines, consumers and companies, while catapulting emission offsetting into a big business,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). predicts.
The cost of offsetting planes’ carbon emissions could become as much as 10 times higher than the airline industry currently estimates, Citi analysts including Mark Manduca said in a note on Wednesday. For economy seats alone, the cost could balloon to $3.8 billion a year by 2025, hurting airlines’ earnings, they said.
Groups such as Greenpeace and Extinction Rebellion and activists like 16-year-old Swedish environmentalist Greta Thunberg are fueling the flight-shame movement by highlighting aviation’s role in global warming. People shunning planes in favor of more climate-friendly alternatives or abstaining from traveling altogether has already had an impact on passenger numbers in parts of Europe.
“The so-called winners of this generational shift will likely be the rail operators, governments, forest owners and carbon schemes,” the Citi analysts said. “If the flight shaming gathers pace, carbon is likely to become a ‘big business’ in its own right.”
While the automobile industry has made strides in using cleaner fuel, the aviation industry continues to warn that reducing carbon emissions will take years, if not decades, given technological limitations and expansion of air travel to an ever-wider slice of the global population. Meanwhile, regulators around the world are considering levying taxes on carriers to offset the environmental impact, and high-speed rail systems are emerging as rivals to airlines.
Every 1% increase in average fares due to higher aviation taxes could curb airline passenger volumes by 0.65%, the analysts wrote.
Many flyers are opting to spend on carbon offsets, or certificates that mitigate their emissions by reducing greenhouse gases elsewhere in the world. The money passengers pay on top of their ticket goes to low-carbon or clean energy projects such as planting trees, installing solar panels or handing out cleaner cooking stoves. Some airlines offer offsets directly when the buyer pays for the ticket, while dozens of online companies advertise personal certificates tailored to each flight."
1330,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 23, 2019 04:36AM ET</span>",U.K. Banks Emerge From PPI Scandal With Better Times Ahead,"(Bloomberg) -- With the costliest U.K. banking scandal fading into memory, a Brexit deal looking more plausible than it once did and trading likely to surprise on the upside, British lenders are going into earnings season with the wind in their sails for once.
That doesn’t mean the numbers won’t have ugly spots. Third-quarter results, which kick off this week, are expected to show damage from the most recent casualty in corporate Britain -- Thomas Cook Group Plc -- and a stretched consumer that’s pulled back in the run-up to Brexit. That’s likely to be most negative for the two big domestically-focused lenders, Lloyds Banking Group PLC (LON:LLOY) and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (LON:RBS). Rock-bottom interest rates don’t help either.
Then, there are the unexpectedly massive final charges for mis-sold payment protection insurance. However, banks disclosed most of the damage in the days after the Aug. 29 deadline for customers to claim redress, and it’s likely priced into their stocks. And in a positive omen for   Barclays   PLC (LON:BARC), many of Wall Street’s trading giants posted better-than-expected revenue from equities and fixed income -- but Jes Staley’s British investment-banking flagship will have to show expenses are under control.
“Net interest margin pressures and shrinking interest income revenues, coupled with stagnant non-interest income, remain the key challenges for U.K. banks,” said Jonathan Tyce, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “The obvious solution continues to be further cost cutting.”
Asian Tensions
The sudden geopolitical crisis facing   HSBC Holdings   PLC (LON:HSBA) and   Standard Chartered   PLC (LON:STAN) in 2019 was not Brexit, but the unrest in Hong Kong. For both Asian-focused lenders, the territory is their biggest single market.
The banks have both played down the financial impact of the protests, and have also sought to assuage concerns that the wider U.S.-China trade war has had on their businesses. Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters will also be hoping to show further progress in cutting costs.
Brexit
All of the banks have repeatedly said they are ready for any Brexit scenario, and some have taken provisions to prepare for a surge in bad loans in the event of a departure without a deal. However, an official in U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s office has said if the European Union agreed to a request from the British Parliament that Brexit be delayed until Jan. 31, then the prime minister would call an election instead.
David Herro, chief investment officer for international equities at Harris Associates in Chicago, holds shares of U.K. banks. “Any deal is better than no deal” for those lenders, he said on Bloomberg Television.
Some of the damage is already done, though. Unemployment has stayed low in Britain, but consumers have restrained their spending amid Brexit worries. While that wasn’t the only factor that doomed Thomas Cook, the storied travel company, it didn’t help.
Bad Loans, PPI
About 17 lenders, including RBS, were involved in Thomas Cook’s bankruptcy talks, and investors expect losses to be spread over those banks. Lloyds, for its part, said in its second-quarter report that its impairments grew, partly due to two specific companies that it didn’t name. The bank also pointed to potential trouble in car loans, booking an additional impairment as used-car prices weakened.
“Hopefully impairments are going to be low,” said Eric Moore, a portfolio manager at Miton Group who holds U.K. bank shares. “There has been less growth than expected, and lending has been very hard.”
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Lloyds (LON:LLOY) put aside as much as 3.4 billion pounds more for the PPI scandal, which saw customers sold insurance they didn’t want or need for years. At Barclays, “the PPI charge will be the biggest drag on capital and tangible net asset value generation this quarter,” analysts at   Deutsche Bank   AG (DE:DBKGn) said.
Barclays Trading
JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s (NYSE:JPM) corporate and investment bank had its best third quarter in three years.   Goldman Sachs Group   Inc (NYSE:GS) had a more mixed picture, but still beat estimates in equities. Those results are good news for  Barclays  (LON:BARC), and to a lesser extent for HSBC, the sprawling global lender that’s paring back its own trading operations.
Barclays should post a 4% income increase at its corporate and investment bank, analysts at Jefferies said, while Deutsche Bank AG analysts are also expecting good results from the division -- which has been the focus of a sustained critique from activist investor Edward Bramson.
At Barclays, “the focus will be squarely on cost control and ability to deliver on the adjusted 2019 goal,” analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence said. Other key businesses for Barclays include credit cards and payments, where Deutsche Bank analysts predict a positive performance.
Earlier this month, Barclays published estimates for the corporate and investment bank for the first time in three years. Analysts surveyed by the bank expect 2.4 billion pounds in revenue and profit before tax of 714 million pounds, both showing an increase from the same quarter of last year.
Leadership Changes
HSBC’s results will be the first outing for acting CEO Noel Quinn after the ouster of John Flint. Investors might also hear from Nigel Higgins, the veteran Rothschild & Co. rainmaker who became Barclays’ chairman in May. RBS’s Ross McEwan is departing for Australia, replaced by Alison Rose as CEO on Nov. 1. At Lloyds, William Chalmers, the new finance chief, faces reporters and analysts for the first time.
The new executives are facing a new decade, free of some of the issues that bedeviled their predecessors but still hampered by others.
“Banks are set to enter 2020 with PPI and Brexit -- two areas that have impacted earnings, capital and suppressed valuation -- behind them,” said Joseph Dickerson, an analyst at Jefferies."

The company maintained its guidance for full-year output of 750k-790k ounces of copper. It said next year’s output will drop to 725k-755k ounces due to lower grades at Centinela, before rising again in 2021.


  Rio Tinto   (LON:RIO) said it will review it 79% interest in the Tiwai Point aluminum smelter in New Zealand, which it said is suffering from high energy costs and global overcapacity. Options include closure. It will make its decision in the first quarter of next year. The plant's other shareholder is Sumitomo Chemical.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea on Wednesday advised people to stop using liquid e-cigarettes due to growing health concerns and vowed to speed up an investigation into whether to ban sales, a move likely to hit major producers such as Juul and local tobacco company KT&G.
While long-term health impacts from vaping remain largely unknown, e-cigarettes were viewed as a healthier alternative that could help users quit smoking when they were first launched a few years ago.
But countries around the world have been pulling electronic cigarette products from markets and restricting advertising as vaping faces increased scrutiny.
""The current situation is considered as a serious risk to public health,"" South Korea's health minister Park Neung-hoo told a briefing, citing cases of lung injuries associated with e-cigarette use in the United States.
U.S. health officials have so far reported 33 deaths and 1,479 confirmed and probable cases from a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping.
A pneumonia case of a 30-year old South Korean e-cigarette user was reported this month, the health ministry said.
""Children, juveniles, pregnant women, and people with pulmonary diseases, never use liquid e-cigarettes. Non-smokers, too, never use liquid e-cigarettes from now,"" Park said.
Park said the government would speed up its own studies to determine if there was a scientific basis to ban sales of liquid e-cigarettes, which vaporize liquid containing nicotine.
A rival technology, which heats but does not burn tobacco, has been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has avoided much of the recent regulatory crackdown globally.
REGULATORY CRACKDOWN
South Korea's health ministry vowed to tighten regulations on vaping products such as strengthening customs procedures for imported liquid of e-cigarettes.
The South Korean office of U.S. e-cigarette maker Juul Labs said in a statement their products had no harmful substances. Juul, 35% owned by  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc, began selling its devices in South Korea in May.
KT&G Corp, a South Korean tobacco maker which sells Lil Vapour e-cigarettes, said it would cooperate with the government's policies after results of the ongoing probe came out.
Since smoking was banned indoors at places like restaurants and cafés in 2015, South Korea become less tolerant of smokers. But e-cigarettes have been gaining popularity in the country's $16 billion tobacco market since 2017.
E-cigarettes accounted for 13% of South Korea's tobacco market by sales as of June, according to government data.
South Korea is the world's No.2 market of heated vape products after Japan, worth $1.7 billion, according to Euromonitor, but liquid e-cigarettes are less popular.
The United States has already announced plans to remove flavoured e-cigarettes from stores, citing alarming growth in teenage use of the products
India also discontinued the sale of e-cigarettes in September, warning of an ""epidemic"" among young people."

The document that was circulated to some organizations for comment pledges greater recourse when intellectual property rights are violated and allows foreign firms to interact with local governments and also participate in the drafting of standards and government procurement, U.S.-China Business Council Vice President Jake Parker said in an e-mail. It also emphasizes that government officials can’t compel the transfer of technology from foreign companies, he said.
“However, the draft falls short of specifying the types of disclosures of trade secrets that will be prohibited and clarifying the types of administrative organs to which the provisions on technology transfer apply,” Parker said.
The new law aims to level the playing field by treating both foreign and domestic firms equally, and promises to do more to protect overseas companies’ technology and know-how. The law was passed in March and the government is now circulating draft regulations on how it will be implemented to foreign firms and chambers of commerce, looking for feedback.
The draft was sent around by the State Council, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the Ministry of Justice, with a deadline for feedback at the end of the month, according to Adam Dunnett, Secretary-General of the EU Chamber of Commerce.
“The law is intended to address many of the long-standing issues that we’re constantly talking about,” Dunnett said in an interview on Tuesday. “It’s going to come down to how it’s implemented in practice, and that’s how people will determine their overall view on this in the longer run.“
As part of the process, the Commerce Ministry and other agencies also consulted with foreign businesses on the law at a summit for multinational companies in Qingdao over the weekend, according to state-run newspaper China Daily.
National Security
“We look forward to additional details on the national security provisions to ensure that national security is clearly defined and applied only in specific circumstances and as narrowly as possible,“ the U.S. Council’s Parker wrote.
Parker welcomed the discussion in the draft about providing equal access to government procurement for both foreign and domestic firms, although he noted that there was no definition of “domestic content.” Both Parker and Dunnett said that often, this was interpreted as meaning goods made in China by Chinese firms, putting foreign companies at a disadvantage, even if they manufacture in China.
However, since the draft was released, China has made a new offer to join the World Trade Organization’s agreement on government procurement. Joining would limit the ability of China’s government to favor domestic firms, and would allow foreign firms to use the WTO system for recourse if they were blocked from government contracts in China, according to Parker.
China joined the WTO in 2001 and was granted observer status to the procurement agreement in 2002. This new offer is the seventh it has made.
The EU Chamber’s Dunnett struck a cautious note about the new law, even as he praised the added transparency, better technology protection and talk about giving foreign companies access to standards-setting bodies.
“The laws and regulations in this country are by-and-large very good,“ he said. “The problem is when it comes to implementation, and people at different levels will interpret it in different ways.

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 11:56PM ET</span>","Malaysia, Goldman discuss smaller penalty over 1MDB scandal: Bloomberg","KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia has discussed a $2 billion to $3 billion settlement with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) over the U.S. bank's alleged role in the 1MDB scandal, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, less than half the sum the Southeast Asian nation had demanded earlier.
Investigators in Malaysia and the United States say about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from the now-defunct state investment fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad, set up in 2009 by former Prime Minister Najib Razak who has been slapped with several charges.
Last year, Malaysia filed criminal charges against Goldman over its role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB. Prosecutors in August filed criminal charges against 17 current and former directors at Goldman's units.
Malaysia's finance minister said in January the government would be ready to discuss dropping the charges against Goldman if it agreed to pay $7.5 billion in reparations. Goldman has not commented on any figure but said last year it had set aside $1.8 billion to cover potential losses related to 1MDB legal proceedings.
Citing people with knowledge of the matter, Bloomberg said Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was keen to reach a deal with Goldman this year itself as the government grapples with a high debt burden.
Goldman declined to comment on the report. A spokesman for Mahathir had no immediate comment.
The country's attorney-general said recently that they had a strong case against Goldman and were very confident of winning, but that criminal charges and settlement negotiations were taking place in parallel.
The bank said last week it was in discussions with governmental and regulatory authorities on the possibility of a resolution of investigations relating to 1MDB.
Najib, who lost a general election last year, is now facing dozens of graft and money laundering charges over allegations that he received about $1 billion in 1MDB funds. He has pleaded not guilty.
Attorney-General Tommy Thomas said at a trial on Tuesday in one of Najib's cases that the former premier acted like an ""emperor"" who orchestrated massive fraud at a former unit of 1MDB. Najib's lawyer is expected to rebut the prosecution’s case on Wednesday.
A ruling on whether to acquit Najib or call for him to enter his defence will be delivered on Nov. 11.
Separately, Lebanese jeweler Global Royalty SAL withdrew on Tuesday a civil suit against Najib's wife Rosmah Mansor, their lawyers said. The firm had sought more than $14 million in jewelry that it said were in her possession.
Global Royalty would instead focus on intervening in the government's forfeiture proceedings against the owner of a property from which jewelry were seized by police, its lawyer told local media https://www.edgeprop.my/content/1601747/lebanese-jeweller-suddenly-withdraws-rm60m-suit-against-rosmah.
Najib and Rosmah were barred from leaving Malaysia soon after his surprise election loss last year, and their lifestyle came under scrutiny especially after the discovery of nearly $300 million worth of goods and cash at properties linked to him."
1340,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 11:01PM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley elbows out rivals for plum role in $1.5 billion IPO relaunch: sources,"By Scott Murdoch and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) has usurped rivals including  Deutsche Bank ,  Citigroup ,  Credit Suisse  and Goldman Sachs to lead the relaunch of a $1.45 billion IPO - Hong Kong's second-largest this year - in an unusually brutal shuffling of banks' roles on a big deal.
The Wall Street bank was approached by ESR Cayman (HK:1821) and its main backer, Warburg Pincus, in August to develop a rescue plan for ESR's initial public offering (IPO), according to two sources involved in the transaction, after the industrial property investor was forced to pull its original planned float in June.
The sources declined to be identified because the discussions were not public.
Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, CLSA, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the shuffling of banks working on the deal. Warburg Pincus and ESR also declined to comment.
Banks worldwide jostle fiercely for top billing on IPOs, decided by which ones are listed at the top and which are listed first, or to the left, of each category. Position matters for publicity as well as league-table credit - and is usually reflected in the fees each bank will take.
Although Morgan Stanley had no role in the first IPO attempt, it has usurped its rivals and is now leading the relaunched offering as the so-called 'lead left' JGC.
""It's very rare to see a bank not working on a deal at first get a senior role as JGC (joint global coordinator) - not to mention in ESR's case, the new bank is actually leading the relaunched deal,"" said one senior equity capital banker not involved in this transaction.
The top-ranked banks in a Hong Kong IPO are known as sponsors, who carry legal liability for the accuracy of the prospectus. Under them are joint global coordinators. The bottom rung are joint bookrunners (JBRs), who collect orders from would-be investors but do not usually play a bigger role.
""It's certainly not common in the Hong Kong IPO market,"" said one source involved in the transaction. ""Several existing banks couldn't sell the deal as well as the issuer and its main backer expected, due to the high target valuation last time.""
The June deal was led by Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) and CLSA as the lead sponsors with Citigroup (N:C), Credit Suisse (S:CSGN), DBS (SI:DBSM) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS) listed as joint global coordinators.
This time however Morgan Stanley is leading investor meetings for the deal in London on Wednesday, continuing a roadshow which has already taken in Singapore and Hong Kong and will head to New York on Thursday.
Only Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank analysts are producing research on the deal - typically also a sign of which banks are leading the transaction.
Both Deutsche Bank and CLSA retain their official roles as sponsors because changing sponsors would have involved restarting the entire IPO application process, said two sources.
While Deutsche Bank is also still listed as a JGC, CLSA has been dropped to a bookrunner role.
ESR Cayman made the decision to pull its deal in June on the day it was due to price, citing ""market conditions"". Sources at the time told Reuters that the company had targeted a relatively aggressive valuation that had made the deal a hard sell in volatile markets. [nL4N23K1LK]
""ESR and Warburg Pincus were not happy with some of the banks and wanted to kick some of them out last time. But to have a smooth relaunch of the deal as soon as possible, they have brought in Morgan Stanley and kept these banks,"" said the same source involved in the deal.
In its second attempt, ESR is seeking to sell shares worth up to $1.45 billion, giving it a market capitalisation of as much as $6.74 billion - the same as it sought in June."

1342,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 10:03PM ET</span>",Lori Loughlin among those facing new charges in U.S. college admissions scam,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - Actress Lori Loughlin is facing a new bribery charge after federal prosecutors on Tuesday said they brought additional charges against 18 wealthy parents, university athletic officials and others accused of participating in the largest U.S. college admissions scam ever uncovered.
The ""Full House"" star is one of 11 parents hit with new charges. Federal prosecutors in Boston say Loughlin conspired to bribe University of Southern (NYSE:SO) California employees to secure the admission of her two daughters.
She and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, were previously charged with conspiring to commit honest services fraud and money laundering. They now face a new charge of conspiring to commit federal programs bribery.
The new charges contained in the revised indictment filed against them and the other parents adds to the potential maximum prison terms they each face if convicted. In Loughlin's case, it jumped from 40 to 45 years, though she would likely get far less.
All 11 parents have previously pleaded not guilty.
""Our goal from the beginning has been to hold the defendants fully accountable for corrupting the college admissions process through cheating, bribery and fraud,"" U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said.
Defense lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.
Prosecutors have charged 52 people with participating in a vast scheme in which wealthy parents conspired with a California college admissions consultant to use bribery and other forms of fraud to secure the admission of their children to top schools.
William ""Rick"" Singer, the consultant, pleaded guilty in March to charges he facilitated cheating on college entrance exams and helped bribe sports coaches at universities to present his clients' children as fake athletic recruits. 
The 35 parents charged since March include ""Desperate Housewives"" star Felicity Huffman, who last week began serving a 14-day prison term after pleading guilty.
Prosecutors allege that Loughlin and Giannulli agreed with Singer to pay $500,000 to have their two daughters named as recruits to the University of Southern California (USC) crew team, even though they did not row competitively.
At an Aug. 27 hearing, William Trach, their attorney, argued that ""zero evidence"" existed to support the allegations, saying they believed they were providing legitimate donations to USC.
The new charges came a day after USC confirmed the couple's daughters, Olivia Jade Giannulli and Isabella Rose Giannulli, were no longer enrolled at the school.

Four other parents, including former Pimco Chief Executive Douglas Hodge and Hercules Capital Inc founder Manuel Henriquez, pleaded guilty on Monday after prosecutors agreed to not bring additional charges against them if they did so.

1343,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 10:02PM ET</span>",Boeing ousts senior executive as 737 MAX crisis grows,"By Eric M. Johnson and David Shepardson
SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co on Tuesday ousted the top executive of its commercial airplanes division, Kevin McAllister, marking the first high-level departure since two fatal crashes of its 737 MAX jets. 
The company said it named veteran Boeing executive Stan Deal to succeed McAllister effective immediately as president and chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA). Deal had led Boeing's Global Services division. 
The world's largest planemaker faces a growing crisis over the eight-month safety ban of its previously best-selling flagship single-aisle jet prompted by crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people. 
Tuesday's announcement, a day before the company was due to report quarterly financial results, shocked some Boeing employees, with one insider calling McAllister a ""scapegoat"" and pointing out that he came to the helm of BCA later in the 737 MAX development. 
It ends a relatively unusual experiment at Boeing of handing an outsider a prominent position, and places the crucial commercial airplanes division in the hands of a long-serving Boeing insider who has formed relationships with some important customers, such as Singapore Airlines.
McAllister, a regular figure at industry conclaves, had formed deep relationships with key airline customers forged during his previous position selling services for  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co. 
McAllister was also credited in part with boosting Boeing sales in tandem with sales chief Ihssane Mounir. The sales momentum slowed significantly when the MAX was grounded worldwide in March.
McAllister could not be reached for comment. 
MAJOR CHALLENGES AHEAD
One person familiar with the matter said McAllister's departure had been described to staff as a ""separation,"" a clear indication that he had been fired. 
Another person said Boeing had asked McAllister to leave, giving no explanation other than saying it was the right move at the right time for the company's leadership. He added that the decision was not purely related to the MAX.
Deal joined Boeing in 1986 and in 2017 was tabbed to lead the company's new Boeing Global Services unit, which sells analytics, parts and training services for airline customers. 
Deal's major challenge is to get the MAX back into service across the world while simultaneously handling deliveries of new aircraft and boosting production of the money-making single-aisles. That is seen as one of the most formidable logistical challenges in the industry's history.
Beyond that, Deal will have to make decisions about a potential new mid-market jetliner code named NMA, which has been eclipsed by the MAX crisis. 
The management change was announced after Boeing's board met in San Antonio.
Earlier on Tuesday, Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Steve Dickson said Boeing was making progress toward winning approval to resume flights, but would need ""several weeks"" before a key certification test flight can take place.
Next week, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg, who was stripped of his title as chairman by the board this month, will testify before Congress for two days. 
""We're committed to delivering on our commitments and regaining trust with our regulators, customers and other stakeholders,"" Muilenburg said.
A deliberate decision was made soon after the MAX crashes to make Muilenburg the public face of the company during the crisis, sources said, although he has faced criticism for what some in the industry have characterized as a wooden and lawyer-driven response to concerns raised from the crashes. 
Senior industry officials said that McAllister's departure leaves Muilenburg squarely in the firing line in the event of any further unexpected revelations or if the company fails to recover from one of its worst-ever crises.

New Chairman David Calhoun said the board backed the decisions. ""Boeing will emerge stronger than ever from its current challenges and the changes we're making throughout Boeing will benefit the flying public well into the future,"" he said in a statement.

1344,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 09:57PM ET</span>",Johnson & Johnson CEO testified Baby Powder was safe 13 days before FDA bombshell,"By Chad Terhune, Lisa Girion and Mike Spector
LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facing off against a plaintiff’s lawyer for the first time about Johnson & Johnson’s Baby Powder, the company’s Chief Executive Alex Gorsky earlier this month insisted that the company’s iconic brand was safe.
“We unequivocally believe that our talc and our baby powder does not contain asbestos,” Gorsky testified in an Oct. 3 deposition in a case involving a retired Indiana college professor who alleges his cancer was caused by the Baby Powder he used for decades. The deposition has not been previously reported.
Gorsky, citing “thousands of tests and studies” to support his testimony, said: “I’m not aware of our baby powder or talc containing asbestos.”
That’s harder for him to say now. Last Wednesday, just 13 days after his deposition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration told the healthcare giant it had discovered asbestos, a known carcinogen, in a bottle of Johnson’s Baby Powder.
On Friday, a day after getting the full FDA test results, J&J (NYSE:JNJ) recalled 33,000 bottles of Baby Powder in the United States. It marked the first time the company has recalled Baby Powder for possible asbestos contamination and the first time U.S. regulators have announced finding asbestos in the product. 
The recall is the latest blow to a healthcare conglomerate that has for many years tried to project an image as a caring company. It is now facing thousands of lawsuits over a variety of products, including legal action by more than 15,000 consumers claiming its talc powders caused their cancers. 
Shares in J&J, which in February said it had received subpoenas from the U.S. Justice Department and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for documents related to the asbestos contamination allegations, dropped almost 6% on Friday after the recall was announced. The inquiries include a criminal grand jury investigation into how forthright J&J has been about the safety of its powders, according to people familiar with the matter. 
In the deposition, Gorsky was pressed again and again to say - without qualification - that the company’s powders were asbestos free. But in answering questions under oath for the first time in the talc litigation, he stuck to his statement that he “believed” J&J’s powders were clean.
The FDA finding will make it much more difficult for Gorsky and the company to continue saying that they ""believe"" the talc powders are free from asbestos, said Elizabeth Burch, a product liability expert at the University of Georgia School of Law. She said the test result and recall lend credibility to what plaintiffs have been arguing in court for months. 
J&J stands behind the safety of its talc and said it’s investigating the FDA test result. The company said it proceeded with the recall “out of an abundance of caution.”
In a statement on Sunday J&J said: “Thousands of tests over the past 40 years repeatedly confirm that our consumer talc products do not contain asbestos, including prior tests by the FDA as recently as last month.”
In a written response to questions from Reuters on Monday, J&J added that Gorsky had no knowledge of the FDA finding of asbestos at the time of his deposition. 
The company also said the FDA notified it on Sept. 20 that a test of its Baby Powder did not find any asbestos. Neither had the regulator detected asbestos during testing in 2010 using the “most sophisticated testing techniques available.”
COULD BE DEPOSED AGAIN
Gorsky’s testimony echoed statements he made after Reuters on Dec. 14 last year published an investigation that found J&J knew for decades asbestos lurked in its talc.
Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company’s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos, the Reuters investigation found. Company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it, while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public.
Jim Kramer, the lawyer who deposed Gorsky this month, said he plans to ask the New York state judge in the case to allow him to question the CEO a second time in light of the FDA’s findings and the recall.
J&J declined to comment on the possibility of a second round with Kramer or about its legal strategy following the FDA test result.
Gorsky faces at least one more deposition, this one ordered by a Missouri judge for Baby Powder cancer cases pending in that state. That has yet to be scheduled.
DISCUSSED DROPPING TALC POWDERS 
In his daylong videotaped deposition, Gorsky, a former Army Ranger, recounted his efforts to stem the growing controversy over one of the company’s signature products.
Sitting at the head of a conference table with the blinds drawn in the midtown Manhattan offices of a mediation firm, he testified that J&J considered dropping talc powders. 
“We had discussions internally along the way regarding should we leave … talc on the market or not,” Gorsky said at the deposition. 
In the end, however, Gorsky said the company, which also sells Baby Powder made from cornstarch, stuck with talc because it was confident about its safety and because many consumers liked its feel.
“We had the right testing procedures in place and so there was … no medical reason or safety reason to withdraw it,” he testified.
“There were in fact differences between cornstarch and talc-based baby powder in its feel, in its absorbency,” said Gorsky, who has been J&J’s CEO since 2012. The company “felt it was important to have different options on the market based upon different consumer needs.”
The plaintiff’s lawyer pressed the 59-year-old Gorsky on his use of the word “believe” when asked about asbestos in J&J’s talc. “My follow up is,” Kramer said, “can you not answer the question as I've presented it with a yes or a no?”
Gorsky, who said in the deposition he uses Johnson’s Baby Powder and had also used it on his son, didn’t budge. “I did not personally conduct every single test. I can only … gauge it based upon the data and totality that’s been presented to me.”
In its answers to Reuters questions on Monday, the company reiterated that “Mr. Gorsky is not a scientist and did not conduct the tests. He therefore relies on others to advise him.” 
Before the FDA test result, Gorsky’s focus on what he ""believed"" to be true was helpful to J&J's legal position, said Andrew Bradt, a Berkeley Law professor at the University of California. Many state laws require plaintiffs to prove companies knew a product was defective, and if Gorsky had unequivocally said talc does not contain asbestos then opposing lawyers could seek to undermine his declaration by contrasting it with the results of tests J&J knew about over the years suggesting otherwise.
However, in light of the FDA asbestos discovery, plaintiff lawyers could now make it sound like he was being hesitant in his deposition, Bradt said. 
'MAD MONEY’
Much of the testimony centered on Gorsky’s efforts to quell public and investor concerns raised by the Dec. 14 Reuters investigation and a story published hours later in the New York Times. The Reuters report had prompted a stock selloff that erased about $40 billion from the company’s market value in one day.
In the subsequent days, J&J tweeted, posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), ran a series of full-page newspaper ads, published a lengthy rebuttal to the Reuters investigation on its website and announced a $5 billion stock buyback.
In video posted in December and still featured on J&J’s website, Gorsky emphasized that regulators ""have always found our talc to be asbestos free.”
Jim Cramer, the host of the CNBC investing show “Mad Money,” gave Gorsky the chance to present his side of the story last December, according to copies of emails shown at the deposition.
Hours after the Reuters and New York Times articles were published, Cramer sent a message to Gorsky’s work email, saying: “Dear Alex, if you feel these talc stories are not truthful, I would love to know how to refute them! – all the best, Jim.”
And that evening, Cramer sent a followup: “Thank you, Alex. Do not be afraid to overwhelm me. I will work all weekend to tell the truth about your great company!!! -Jim.”
Gorsky appeared in person in the “Mad Money” studio the following Monday, Dec. 17. 
“We want to make sure that our trust and integrity that we’ve earned over the last 130 years is maintained for the next 130 years,” he told viewers.
“We unequivocally believe that our talc, our Baby Powder, does not contain asbestos,” Gorsky said on the broadcast.
In an email to Reuters, Cramer said his goal “was to get Alex Gorsky on CNBC first and to ask all the toughest questions … There were no ground rules and nothing was off the table.” At the end of the Dec. 17 broadcast, there was a disclosure that Cramer's charitable trust owned J&J shares. 
It still has a stake today, Cramer said.
TESTING ACCURACY
When the question of previous test results came up in the deposition, Gorsky said occasional findings of asbestos in talc haven’t held up under scrutiny. Such tests were subsequently found to be “incomplete or inaccurate,” he said.
A New Jersey judge overseeing thousands of talc lawsuits consolidated in a federal court is expected to rule soon on a J&J request to disqualify expert witnesses hired by plaintiffs, including the head of an asbestos testing lab who testified in earlier trials that he found the contaminant in the company’s powders.
In a filing Friday, plaintiffs’ lawyers drew the judge’s attention to the FDA finding of asbestos in the bottle of Baby Powder and said they have asked J&J to turn over documents related to the FDA test results and any communications with regulators.
In a brief conference call Friday with analysts and journalists, J&J officials called the FDA test results “extremely unusual,” and suggested the sample may have been contaminated by an outside source or come from a counterfeit bottle.
A few hours later, the FDA shot back with a defense of its laboratory analysis, saying it wasn’t aware of “any records pointing to counterfeit Johnson’s Baby Powder in the U.S. market.”

The FDA declined to provide further comment for this article.

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Gulfstream Aerospace Corp President Mark Burns said on Tuesday he expected regulators to ask for more details on software when the company certifies its new G700 long-range corporate jet, following two crashes involving the Boeing 737 MAX.
Gulfstream, a division of General Dynamics Corp (N:GD), unveiled its widely expected G700 on Monday in Las Vegas, as the biggest business jet show in the world kicks off.
In an interview, Burns said he believed the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other regulators would seek more information during the G700 certification, following the crashes, although did not expect any unreasonable requests. 
The process for certifying new aircraft in the United States has come under scrutiny following the fatal crashes of two flights involving the Boeing (N:BA) MAX in October 2018 and March 2019.
During the certification of its G600 business jet in 2019, Gulfstream received additional requests from the FAA on the aircraft systems, understanding how things worked and how they worked together, he said.
""I do think the FAA will take a different approach on software,"" he said on the sidelines of the National Business Aviation Association's annual show.
""I don't think it's anything that concerns us. I think that it will be probably very much like the G600 certification. I think it will be the same level of depth of system knowledge that they will want us to explain.""
Gulfstream's new G700 is a derivative of the planemaker's strong-selling G650 long-range business jet, but features a new Rolls Royce (LON:RR) Pearl 700 engine, cockpit and five-zone space including a crew-rest area.
The G700, which lists for $75 million, will compete against Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) flagship Global 7500. 
Burns said the aircraft's first flight would happen ""soon,"" but declined to specify when.
Gulfstream has already received 10 firm orders for the G700 from Qatar Executive, a division of Qatar Airways and Burns said the plane is sold out for more than a year. 

""You cannot get a 2022 airplane,"" he said.

1346,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 06:57PM ET</span>","Snap disappoints with fourth-quarter revenue guidance, sending shares down","By Sheila Dang and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) -  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP) on Tuesday forecast fourth-quarter revenue largely below Wall Street estimates, sending its shares down 5% in after-market trading.
The parent company of photo messaging app Snapchat estimated fourth-quarter revenue of $540 million to $560 million, the midpoint of which was below analysts' estimate of $555.4 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The outlook overshadowed Snap's third-quarter results released on Tuesday, which showed larger-than-expected growth in daily active users. Wall Street also glossed over Snap's estimate it would reach profitability in the fourth quarter, as measured by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).
On a conference call with analysts, Snap Chief Financial Officer Derek Andersen said the company's peak advertising demand period, which runs between the Black Friday and December holidays, had one fewer week this year, and was reflected as a ""headwind"" in the guidance.
Snapchat, popularized by its photo visual effects which allow users to change gender in photos or add a dog filter over their face, had 210 million daily active users in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, up from 203 million in the prior quarter.
It had 186 million users in the year-ago quarter.
The number, a widely watched metric by investors and advertisers, was above analysts' average estimate of 206.6 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Snapchat faces competition from several other apps for the coveted younger demographic, including Facebook Inc's (O:FB) Instagram and newer apps like TikTok, used to create and share short lip-sync, comedy and talent videos.
Investors are still cautious about Snap, given the company's tumultuous past and ""irregular user-engagement record,"" said Haris Anwar, an analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com.
""A slight miss on expectations would be enough to hurt the stock and revive the old memories,"" he said.
Revenue, which the company largely makes by selling advertising on the app, jumped about 50% to $446.2 million in the third quarter and beat an average analyst estimate of $435.05 million.

1347,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 06:21PM ET</span>",Nike's Parker hands over CEO role to former eBay chief,"By Nivedita Balu and Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) -  Nike  Inc's (N:NKE) long-time chief executive officer, Mark Parker, will step down next year and be replaced by board member and former eBay CEO John Donahoe, who will be tasked with strengthening the sportswear maker's online strategy.
Donahoe, who has been on Nike's board since 2014, will join the sneaker maker from cloud computing firm ServiceNow Inc (N:NOW), where he was CEO for more than four years. Prior to that, he led online retailer eBay (O:EBAY) for the seven years through 2015.
Nike's Parker had said last year he would remain CEO and chairman of the footwear maker beyond 2020, with his remarks coming in the midst of a series of executive departures and probes on workplace complaints.
The move comes days after the world's biggest footwear maker shut down its Nike Oregon Project training group, following the recent four-year ban of the center's founder and coach Alberto Salazar by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA).
Nike did not give any reason for Parker's exit from the top job. In an interview to CNBC, Parker said the change was unrelated to the Oregon Project or any other issues.
Parker joined Nike as one of its first footwear designers in 1979, and held several roles during his tenure at the company before taking charge as its top boss in 2006.
Credited with creating the popular Nike Air sneakers as well as other pioneering products, Parker, over the past few years, led Nike's shift to selling directly to customers online.
He will become executive chairman and continue to lead Nike's board after Donahoe takes over.
""We like that (Donahoe) comes from technology and that he comes from the digital space and we like that he is a strategist and a leader ... things that have made Nike positive have been because of those sort of strengths,"" Jane Hali & Associates analyst Jessica Ramirez said.
Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said Donahoe's e-commerce experience could help with Nike's online push, while Parker could focus more on product development, one of his key strengths.
Separately, ServiceNow said it appointed Bill McDermott as its CEO. McDermott helmed software maker SAP from 2014 until recently. ServiceNow shares fell about 16% on the news.
McDermott stood down earlier this month after a decade building up SAP (DE:SAPG) as the world's leading enterprise software company, handing the task of completing its transition to cloud computing to new co-CEOs Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein.
Earlier in the day, Nike rival  Under Armour  Inc (N:UAA) said its founder and CEO Kevin Plank would step down, giving his responsibilities to Patrik Frisk, a company insider, hoping a change in leadership will help battle brutal competition from Nike and Adidas (DE:ADSGN) in the United States."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors said on Tuesday they had charged six members of an insider trading ring who worked for firms including  Goldman Sachs Group  (N:GS), Moelis and Centerview Partners and allegedly booked tens of millions of dollars in illicit profits.
The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York has arrested three members of the international ring and unsealed four separate indictments in recent days.
The bankers and others all booked trading profits off nonpublic information related to deals including acquisitions, the prosecutors said in a statement.
They said Benjamin Taylor, formerly an employee of investment banking firm Moelis, and Darina Windsor, a former employee of boutique investment bank Centerview Partners, obtained and leaked nonpublic information about publicly-traded companies to securities dealers.
The bankers shared in the profits from the trades beginning in at least January 2013, authorities said in an indictment unsealed on Monday.
That included profits from buying shares of biotech firm InterMune Inc ahead of a 2014 announcement of an $8.3 billion acquisition by Roche Holding AG (S:ROG); profits from shares of Onyx Pharmaceuticals before news reports in June 2013 that it would be purchased by Amgen (O:AMGN) for $10.4 billion, and profits off shares of Pharmacyclics ahead of an announcement it would be purchased by  AbbVie Inc  (N:ABBV) for $21 billion in 2015.
Windsor and Taylor, who were romantically involved, ""repeatedly accessed internal electronic files"" of their employees, including files relating to business deals on which they were not involved, the authorities said.
A Moelis spokeswoman confirmed Taylor had been a ""junior employee."" A Centerview spokesman said Windsor, also a ""junior employee,"" was terminated nearly four years ago for misconduct.
Securities trader Joseph El-Khouri was arrested on Monday in the United Kingdom. He allegedly received leaked information from Windsor and Taylor, which he then passed along to journalists.
El-Khouri and an unnamed trader built up long positions in companies targeted for acquisition, court documents said. El-Khouri realized over $2 million in illicit gains trading securities of at least six different companies, according to the documents.
Bryan Cohen, a banker who worked for Goldman Sachs, was arrested on Friday.
Cohen shared inside information with a securities trader named Georgios Nikas, who is also an owner of a chain of Greek restaurants in New York, prosecutors said.
From December 2012 through 2017, Nikas and another trader obtained information from Taylor, Windsor and Cohen, prosecutors said.
They said Nikas also received information from Telemaque Lavidas, the son of a member of the board of directors at Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc. Lavidas was arrested on Friday.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a separate statement on Tuesday it had obtained an order freezing Nikas's assets. The SEC had filed an emergency action charging Cohen and Nikas on Oct. 18.
Nikas, Taylor and Windsor remain at large, the U.S. Attorney's office said. None of the defendants could be reached immediately for comment."
1349,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 05:58PM ET</span>",Former UAW official pleads guilty to federal charges,"By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - A former top official of the United Auto Workers union pleaded guilty on Tuesday to federal charges of financial misconduct while about 48,000 UAW members voted on whether to end a nearly five-week walkout at GM.
Jeffrey Pietrzyk, a former co-director of the UAW-GM Center for Human Resources, pleaded guilty to a charge of wire fraud and a count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, according to court documents. He is the latest in a string of former UAW officials to plead guilty to charges in a wide-ranging Justice Department criminal investigation of corruption within the union.
Federal agents last month raided the homes of the union's current president, Gary Jones, and former president Dennis Williams (NYSE:WMB). Neither Jones nor Williams has been charged with wrongdoing.
Pietrzyk was charged in connection with schemes to use funds from the UAW-GM Center for Human Resources to buy UAW logo jackets and watches, and then receive kickbacks from the vendors of those goods, according to court documents. On Sept. 4, former UAW official Michael Grimes pleaded guilty to wire fraud and money laundering charges in connection with misuse of Center for Human Resources funds, which were supposed to pay for worker training.
Federal prosecutors charged that Pietrzyk and an unnamed UAW official engineered use of $3.97 million in UAW-GM Center for Human Resources funds to buy watches that the manufacturer had said would cost $2.28 million. An unnamed UAW official then demanded a $250,000 kickback from the vendor for the watches, prosecutors charged. Pietrzyk also received kickbacks disguised as checks for antique furniture, prosecutors charged.
The watches ""were never distributed to UAW-represented GM workers and are currently being stored in a warehouse at the CHR,"" according to a court document.
Pietrzyk's sentencing is scheduled for March.
GM and the UAW agreed last week as part of a tentative contract to wind down the Center for Human Resources and sell the multi-story office building on the Detroit River that houses the organization.
The federal criminal probe of the UAW continues, and has cast a shadow over the union's efforts to bargain for new four-year contracts with General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA). Federal prosecutors have also accused former union officials of taking bribes from Fiat Chrysler executives, and using UAW funds to pay for lavish parties and winter stays at resorts in Palm Springs, California."

1. Tesla Drives in Q3 Earnings
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will roll up with its third-quarter report on Wednesday after the market close.
Following the electric car maker’s update on third-quarter deliveries earlier this month, investors will be keen to get a sense of how demand is holding for its fleet, particularly the Model 3, and guidance on future production. 
Beyond deliveries and production guidance, commentary on cash flow and profit will also come under scrutiny.
Tesla is expected to report a loss of 45 cents a share on revenue of $6.47 billion.
2. EIA Report on Tap
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) releases its weekly petroleum report at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT) Wednesday.
Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute released data, which often serves as an early indication of weekly government petroleum levels, showing crude stockpiles rose by 4.5 million barrels last week.
The EIA is expected to report that crude stockpiles rose by 2.23 million barrels last week.
Domestic crude supplies have been propped up by falling refinery activity and rising output, which continue to flirt with record highs at a time when many fret oil demand growth will taper as the global economy slows. 
But with many betting that OPEC will announce deeper cuts at its meeting in December, oil prices have steadied somewhat.
December crude oil futures rose 1.7% to settle at $54.43 a barrel.
3. Dow in Focus as Boeing, Caterpillar Roll out Earnings
  Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) report quarterly earnings before the bell. It is likely the Dow components will set the day's direction for the index.
Caterpillar is expected to report earnings of $2.91 a share on revenue of $13.4 billion.
The industrial equipment maker has had to contend with weakening construction equipment spending amid slowing domestic and international economic growth, particularly in Asia, owing to the U.S.-China trade war.
But some hope that increasing energy exploration activity, led by a rise in oil prices, may soften the blow.
Boeing, meanwhile, is expected to report earnings of $2.08 a share on revenue of $19.56 billion. But its earnings are likely to take a back seat to the ongoing 737 MAX saga.
With a string of revelations claiming concerns about the safety of the 737 MAX jets were raised as early as 2016 – some two years before the fatal 737 MAX crashes - investors are desperately seeking answers about the design and safety approvals of the maligned jets.
On Tuesday, Kevin McAllister was ousted as president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, the division that produces the 737 MAX and other Boeing (NYSE:BA) commercial aircraft. McAllister had had the job for three years after a long tenure at   General Electric   (NYSE:GE). He was replaced by Stan Deal, who had run Boeing's services division and is a long-time Boeing executive.
 
As well as the past, investors will be after more details about the MAX productions plans and and clues on the expected timetable for the return of the jets to operation.
Boeing trimmed production of the MAX to 42 jets a month from 52 in April. The plane is not expected to be recertified until next year."

1352,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 05:07PM ET</span>","What’s Next For Trudeau? A New Cabinet, Old Wounds and Fresh Risks","(Bloomberg) -- Justin Trudeau is still prime minister, but it’s going to be a rougher ride the second time around.
Trudeau eked out a victory in Canada’s election Monday, winning the most seats despite losing the popular vote. He fell short of a majority but should be able to pass legislation with the support of other parties, likely the leftist New Democrats.
Parliament’s return will force a change in strategy, and will likely reopen old wounds. Here’s how it could shake out.
Pick a Cabinet
Trudeau, as the incumbent, won’t see any gap or hiccup in his authority. He remains prime minister and has a wide-enough margin that he doesn’t have to bother with appointing opposition members to his cabinet. His first step will be to name a new cabinet, replacing and shuffling his ministers. He will also need to prepare a Speech from the Throne, outlining his legislative priorities. That speech could include clues of potential compromises with smaller parties.
He lost two ministers Monday, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale -- who’d, among other things, been handling the Huawei 5G file -- and Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi. Beyond that, others may be shuffled into new roles. Finance Minister Bill Morneau, for instance, spoke to BNN Bloomberg on Tuesday and gave no indication he thought it would be a slam-dunk that he’d stay in his role.
Haggle, Haggle, Haggle
Trudeau will start feeling out two parties for their priorities: the Bloc Quebecois and the New Democrats. Each have enough seats to support him in any particular vote, though neither will enter a formal coalition with the Liberals.
Among the subjects up for negotiation, parliament needs to set up committees and decide who will be on them. In a majority government, Trudeau would have had the most members on any given committee. Now, he’ll be more exposed to opposition-led proceedings, where lawmakers could more easily dig into his SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. affair.
It’s also unclear whether Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer will retain control of his party, though he’s making a bid to. If he’s turfed, Trudeau could also govern with support from -- or, more likely, a lack of opposition from -- the Conservatives on certain votes, since the party won’t want to head into an election against Trudeau without a new leader.
Short-Term Priorities
Trudeau is pressing to expand the Trans Mountain pipeline, a potential flashpoint with the NDP and the Bloc. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, however, hasn’t ruled out the pipeline’s construction, saying on Tuesday he wouldn’t negotiate the terms of his support for Trudeau in public. The Bloc has indicated it won’t get in the way of the project proceeding.
The U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact still needs to be passed by Canadian lawmakers, though the country will only be under pressure to move quickly if the U.S. also ratifies the deal. Trudeau and the Conservatives would likely both back it, more than enough to get it over the finish line.
Work will also begin on a federal budget, due typically early in the new year. Budget motions are confidence votes that could bring down a minority government; Trudeau will need to be sure his document has the support of either the NDP or the Bloc, as the Conservatives would be highly unlikely to support it.
How Long Can This Last?
It depends. The last few Canadian minorities have averaged just under two years, but each one is unique. In this case, the math of parliament means that either Trudeau’s own party, or Singh’s NDP, would need to vote against the government.
Each would only do that if they wanted to trigger an election. The NDP is broke, just lost seats from 2015 and was nearly wiped out in Quebec, a one-time power base -- and yet came away with the balance of power. That makes them unlikely to rock the boat any time soon.
Another factor: Canadian members of parliament are entitled to a pension after six years of service. That creates an incentive for individual MPs first elected in 2015 to leave Trudeau’s minority standing for at least two years. All that suggests Canadians won’t head back to the polls before late 2021, at the earliest."

The bonds have rallied to their highest since April 2018 as money managers turn more sanguine about the state oil firm following a $7.5 billion bond sale to refinance its debt, potentially staving off another ratings downgrade. Pemex’s dollar-denominated bonds maturing in 2027 jumped 14% from their November low to 105.4 cents on the dollar, climbing for an eighth consecutive day on Tuesday.
The world’s most indebted major oil company is at the center of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s battle to convince investors that his government will be fiscally responsible. Pemex is struggling to reverse more than a decade of production declines and reduce a debt burden of over $100 billion while balancing the need to finance Mexico’s budget, which relies on Pemex for nearly a fifth of its revenue. Still, in a low-yield world, not even Pemex’s challenges can deter investors.
“There’s a tremendous search for yield,” said Luis Maizel, a senior managing director at LM Capital Management in San Diego, who recently converted part of his Mexico sovereign debt into Pemex to take advantage of the high spread. “Here you have a paper that’s still part of the benchmark indexes, that’s still investment grade, and that’s paying a good coupon.”
Extra support for Pemex bonds came after Mexico’s finance ministry said earlier this month that Pemex’s total refinancing, including a $5 billion cash injection from the government, debt swaps and new bond issues, reached $20.13 billion. Pemex said it sold bonds at seven, 10 and 30 years for $7.5 billion to refinance short-term debt. It also repurchased and exchanged dollar-denominated bonds that expired between 2020 and 2025 for $8.7 billion and exchanged bonds in dollars maturing between 2041 and 2048 for $3.9 billion.
The success of the company’s refinancing has helped investors see past the risk of a downgrade. Fitch Ratings cut the company’s credit to junk in June, and a similar decision by either Moody’s Investors Service or S&P Global Ratings would push the bonds off investment-grade indexes, leading to a forced sell-off.
Last week, PMI -- Pemex’s trading arm -- sent new formulas for pricing the nation’s crude exports to refiners and other buyers, helping assuage clients’ concerns after the announcement was delayed last month. A disagreement within the company over an external review of the formulas sparked an exodus from PMI, according to people familiar with the matter. The formula underpins not only physical crude sales made by Pemex, but also Mexico’s annual sovereign hedge, the largest of its kind.
Pemex is expected to report a slight uptick in its refining output in its quarterly results on Monday. It has also said that crude oil production, which has declined every year for 14 years, is in a process of stabilization. Pemex’s oil production rose 0.7% in August compared with the previous month to reach 1.68 million barrels a day. Its six refineries processed 658,906 daily barrels of crude in August, a 0.3% increase from July, according to data from Mexico’s energy information agency.
If the company can show signs of turning production around in Monday’s report, it may calm investors and present a good argument for picking up high Pemex yields.
“Where else can you get this kind of yield if you’re a fund looking to bring in money?” said Maizel, who says he isn’t expecting downgrades anytime soon. “For a while, you can be in Pemex and be comfortable.”

“A combination of unattractive macro, with poor bottom-up options, rich valuations and now, added social-political instability, made us take profits on Chile,” JPMorgan strategists led by Emy Shayo Cherman wrote in a report Tuesday, downgrading the country’s equities to underweight from neutral.
Chile’s IPSA equity index had its worst day in almost two years Monday as a wave of riots and protests -- sparked by a four-cent hike to subway fares -- led to thousands of arrests and 15 deaths. After saying Chile was “at war,” President Sebastian Pinera has softened his tone and pledged the government would seek dialogue and work on social measures. The nation’s stocks and currency are trading slightly higher today.
The economic overhaul proposed by the government -- including changes to employment laws, taxes and pensions -- faces strong opposition in Congress, the JPMorgan team wrote. It said labor costs are likely to rise, citing a proposal by the Communist Party that JPMorgan estimates will lead to a 10% increase in corporate labor costs.
JPMorgan said that shares of shopping malls are particularly likely to suffer from the protests.
Meanwhile, JPMorgan also raised Peruvian stocks to neutral on attractive valuations. The bank has an overweight rating for Brazil and Colombia and is underweight Mexico and Argentina."

1356,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 05:05PM ET</span>","Bets Against Beyond Meat, Weed Boosted TD Ameritrade, CEO Says","(Bloomberg) -- TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.’s better-than-expected quarterly results were lifted by the company’s stock loan business, according to Chief Executive Officer Tim Hockey.
Investor skepticism toward Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc., cannabis stocks and a “relatively small number” of other companies created a scarcity of shares to short, boosting fees, Hockey said in a telephone interview. That’s something he can’t forecast for in the future, he added. TD Ameritrade shares rose as much as 3% on Tuesday to the highest intraday since Sept. 30.
According to S3 Partners, Beyond Meat continues to “lap the field” as the most expensive actively shorted stock. Tilray Inc. was third on S3’s weekly list of U.S. traded stocks with the most expensive stock borrow fees; Aurora Cannabis Inc. was number eight and Canopy Growth Corp. was in the top 20.
Earlier this month, Beyond Meat and cannabis short-selling had been seen by Sandler O’Neill analyst Richard Repetto as helping e-brokers. Repetto had noted  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp. and Interactive Brokers Group had reported a more than 60% sequential increase in securities lending revenue in the third quarter, which augured well for peers E*Trade Financial Corp. and TD Ameritrade.
On Tuesday, Repetto wrote that Omaha, Nebraska-based TD Ameritrade’s earnings beat was mostly due to its stock loan business. Repetto added that revenue across all lines were above Sandler’s expectations.
TD Ameritrade’s earnings-per-share was driven by “revenues in lower-quality buckets,” including Treasury gains, outsized securities lending and higher order flow, but “this quarter is all about the 2020 guidance,” Wolfe’s Steven Chubak wrote in a note. The 2020 update was “better than anticipated on both revenue and expense,” Chubak said, adding that it struck him as a “bit aggressive.”
“TD Ameritrade’s initial fiscal 2020 guidance may calm some nerves,” Bloomberg Intelligence’s David Ritter wrote, “but long-term effects of zero-trading fees will take time to play out.” Ritter said that “some brokers, perhaps including Ameritrade, will lose market share despite assertions to the contrary.”
Regarding going to zero commission, Hockey said, he was “quite excited,” even though it was “painful” to take a “one-time haircut.” He’d long been anticipating the drop, but “the day came faster than we thought.”
TD Ameritrade shares plunged 26% to $34.67 on Oct. 1, as Schwab said it would cut commissions on trades for stocks and exchange-traded funds to zero, followed on the same day by TD Ameritrade, and then ETrade the day after. Other firms announcing free trading options in recent weeks include Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., Raymond James Financial Inc. and Fidelity Investments, and there’s a test at  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ).
“The market is trying to figure out an earnings growth rate going forward,” Hockey said. Last year TD Ameritrade had about $6 billion in revenue; moving to zero commission means about $920 million will go away on an annual basis, he said. The company will still make about $5.1 billion, with “very healthy margins” of about 40%, instead of 50%, he added.
Hockey expects the online brokers will take even more share from traditional brokers. And the “value proposition” at companies which had been competing on the basis of price -- like Robinhood -- “went to zero,” he added.
There’s another topic Hockey gets frequent questions on: M&A. Asked about a possible deal, including speculation TD Bank may be interested, he gave the company’s “standard answer” that’s it’s their job to look at ways to increase value.
Regarding geopolitics, Hockey noted that trade is the only issue that’s been triggering market volatility. “If there’s a hint of a deal, markets react,” he said in regard to U.S. and China. On the other hand, things that used to boost volatility, like shifts in the Middle East and “presidential tweets,” have been having a “more muted effect,” he said.
Hockey has told the board he’ll step down by the end of February; he would transition to an advisory role sooner, he said, “depending on how the search” for a new CEO goes."

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Four days after leaked internal pilot messages set off a media firestorm for  Boeing Co  (N:BA), former colleagues have defended a former pilot who voiced concerns about unreported 737 MAX software problems two years before fatal crashes.
Chief Technical Pilot Mark Forkner described in the leaked messages how MCAS cockpit software, which has since been linked to crashes in Indonesia in 2018 and in Ethiopia in March this year, was ""running rampant"" during a flight simulator session.
The messages fueled speculation that either Boeing or Forkner or both knew about problems with the plane's flight control software well before the two crashes which killed a total of 346 people, sending its shares sharply lower.
But two former Boeing employees who either worked with Forkner at the time he wrote the messages or had direct knowledge of the simulator he used argued the erratic behavior he described likely referred to the software on the flight simulator he was using rather than evidence of risks in the aircraft's actual MCAS flight control system.
For example, Forkner had no way of recreating the crash scenarios - when MCAS triggered off data from a single faulty ""angle of attack"" sensor - because there was ""no technical way"" to shut off one of the two sensors in the simulator, said one of the people, a former test pilot with direct knowledge of the simulator Forkner used.
""It wasn't even something they would be looking for,"" headed.
The Seattle Times earlier reported that the problems were connected to the simulator rather than the plane itself.
Asked for comment about his former colleagues' appraisal of the exchanges, Forkner's lawyer David Gerger said: ""He would never put himself or his friends or a passenger in a plane if he thought it was unsafe.""
A Boeing spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Boeing had tried repeatedly to get Forkner to agree to talk to the company before it turned the messages over to FAA, a person briefed on the matter said. 
On Sunday, Boeing said it had not been able to speak to Forkner but that he had said through a lawyer that his comments reflected a reaction to a simulator program, not the MAX itself.
""In my opinion, the messages are no smoking gun,"" said the second former engineering colleague, Rick Ludtke. 
Forkner wrote on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) that he and Ludtke worked closely on several ""high visibility projects"" for the 737. 
""The people who knew him and understood his role could see that he wasn't talking about MCAS in a first-person, informed way,"" Ludtke said.
The instant message chain focuses on his work as a liaison between engineers - including those still fine-tuning MCAS in 2016 - and the technicians who calibrate the 737 MAX simulator software to identify and fix glitches and make it feel as much as possible like the aircraft itself. 
It remains unclear whether Forkner's systems knowledge at the time included MCAS' vulnerability to a single point of failure and other flaws pinpointed in the crashes, and whether he raised any concerns to engineers still developing the flight control law. 
At Boeing until 2018, Forkner was the lead technical pilot on a team of roughly six people working mainly from desks and inside simulators on a training and services team eventually folded into Boeing's new Global Services division. 
His group was not part of the Boeing Test and Evaluation group, whose pilots put the 737 MAX through hundreds of hours of test flights before the jetliner entered service, though Forkner would occasionally join flight and certification tests as an observer, one of the people said.
""WASN'T A LIE""
Forkner and his colleagues worked on the flight manuals airlines now used since the 737 MAX entered service in 2017, and fielded operations and systems questions from dozens of global airlines operating thousands of 737 aircraft globally, the former employees said. 
The former employees also said Forkner's language gave away that he was unaware of recent changes engineers made to the MCAS cockpit software, which was still being fine-tuned before FAA certification.
At another point in the conversations, Forkner says he ""basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly)"", to which a colleague responds, ""it wasn't a lie, no one told us that was the case."" 
The former employees said Forkner added ""unknowingly"" because the information he relayed to the FAA was based on what engineers had told him and that he appeared to be unaware of changes to MCAS' function at low speeds until he witnessed it in the simulator, rendering what he told the FAA incorrect. 
Before Boeing, he was an Instructor Pilot in the U.S. Air Force and First Officer at Alaska Airlines, according to LinkedIn. He currently works as a 737 First Officer for Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and did not respond to a request for comment.
The world's largest planemaker is eight months into a global crisis over the safety ban of its 737 MAX in the wake of the crashes. 
The messages between Forkner and a colleague discussing simulator software flaws, and another batch of Forkner's emails related to pilot training, have emerged as crucial issues in investigations into Boeing's development of the MAX.
The reaction to the messages was harsh and immediate, with Democrat Peter DeFazio, the chair of a U.S. House committee investigating Boeing, saying the ""outrageous"" messages suggest ""Boeing withheld damning information"" from the Federal Aviation Administration.
Boeing is making progress on getting the 737 MAX aircraft in the air again, but the FAA will need at least several more weeks for review, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said earlier on Tuesday.
Boeing shares rose almost 2% on Tuesday after it put out a lengthy statement defending its actions during the crisis.
Sam Graves, the top Republican on the House Transportation committee, said the leaked messages amounted to ""an incomplete snapshot in time"", saying they raised a number of questions. 

""Most importantly, what did Boeing do with the information?"" Graves said.

(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) missed Wall Street estimates for profit for the first time in two years on Tuesday as more investment to spruce up U.S. restaurants and speed up service weighed on the world's biggest fast food chain, sending its shares down 4%.
Rival fast-food chains in the United States have challenged its dominance with value meals and new menu items, including plant-based burgers and meat substitutes launched by rivals including Restaurant Brands International Inc's (TO:QSR) Burger King and Yum Brands Inc's (N:YUM) KFC. McDonald's is seen late in reintroducing chicken sandwiches and rival Wendys Co (O:WEN) has started serving breakfast. 
In the face of declining customer traffic, McDonald's has been remodeling its 14,000 U.S. restaurants to include digital ordering kiosks, mobile ordering as well as pay-and-pickup services, while partnering with app-based delivery services GrubHub Inc (N:GRUB), Uber Eats (N:UBER) and DoorDash.
Those investment led to a 2% rise in operating costs to about $3 billion, leading McDonald's to post a smaller-than-expected profit of $2.11 per share versus an average estimate of $2.21, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""The world is different than it was in 1955,"" Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook said during a call with investors.
""We're keenly aware we have to be ahead of these changes, investing, executing and growing with a deep sense of urgency and purpose,"" he said. 
U.S. traffic was negative - an industry-wide trend expected to continue through the end of the year, especially due to weakening economic conditions, according to TDn2K research.
Sales at U.S. restaurants open for at least 13 months rose 4.8% in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, below the 5.17% growth expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv data.
""Our gut tells us that McDonald's was outcompeted in the third quarter by Wendy's and Burger King,"" Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said in a note. 
Despite the U.S. miss, Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said sales ""continue to be among the best in the industry"" and that benefits from store renovations should build in future quarters.
Globally, the company reported better-than-expected comparable sales growth of 5.9% on strong performance in markets such as the UK and France.
Interest in plant-based burgers has jumped in North America, and consumers have been waiting to see if McDonald's will expand its test of a  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND) burger in Ontario, Canada, to the United States and other markets. 
Easterbook gave no clues other than saying they were interested in such products and wanted to get the flavor and marketing right.
""What we're interested in is really how best to position this, get a sense of the flexitarian customer,"" he said, referring to people who eat mostly, but not entirely, vegetarian diets.
Net income fell 2% to $1.61 billion in the quarter from $1.64 billion a year earlier. 
Total revenue, including both U.S. and overseas operations, rose to $5.43 billion, slightly below analysts' expectations of $5.49 billion.
The company also expects selling, general and administrative expenses for 2019 to rise between 1% to 2% excluding the impact of currency fluctuations.
McDonald's expects delivery to drive $4 billion, or roughly 4%, of global sales. 
The service is now available from about 23,000 McDonald's restaurants in over 80 countries. On average, guests spend twice as much on delivery orders as they do on in-store checks, Easterbrook said.

""Delivery remains a big frontier for our business, and we still have a long way to go,"" he said.

With women and millennials in its crosshairs, Levi's has “significant” opportunity to diversify its revenue base by geography, by channel and by gender, Macquarie suggested.
In the recent past, however, Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) has come under fire from some on Wall Street, who worry the company is vulnerable to the weaker backdrop for department stores, which brands like Levi’s rely on to flog merchandise. 
To wean itself off its department-store dependence, the demin maker has been spending big to accelerate its direct-to-consumer approach.
While Levi's shares are higher at $17.51, they're only 3% above their $17 IPO price. The company went public on March 21. After hitting $24.50 in April, they've been struggling. 
The company has beat estimates on earnings per share and revenue for the last two quarters."

HARROD, Ohio (Reuters) - After completing a credit review in a half-hour phone call, a BMO Harris Bank underwriter cleared $12 million in loans for Ohio corn and soybean producer Greg Kruger in 2013.
Kruger had initially asked for a $2 million loan to build a grain elevator. But the Chicago-based bank, one of the largest U.S. farm lenders, ended up selling him a $5 million loan for the elevator and another $7 million to finance crops, machinery and debt consolidation, according to documents in the Ohio foreclosure case the bank filed to seize Kruger's farm.
When Kruger offered to supply receipts of sold grain and other standard documentation, his loan officer told him not to bother. ""'Don't worry. We'll make the numbers work',"" Kruger, 67, recalled the officer saying.
Five years later, after aggressively expanding its U.S. farm loan portfolio, the bank called in Kruger's loans as corn and soy prices collapsed and the United States was starting a trade war with China. As the U.S. agricultural economy sours and farmers’ financial woes pile up, BMO Harris is leaving behind a trail of farmers such as Kruger who have lost nearly everything.
The bank, a subsidiary of Canada's Bank of Montreal, has struggled to recoup some of its investments through a slew of bitter legal fights, according to a Reuters review of court documents and bank regulator data, as well as interviews with dozens of U.S. farmers, bankers, and former and current BMO Harris employees.
""BMO Harris did push for growth, and they've had some of those deals blow up spectacularly in their faces,"" said John Blanchfield, founder of Agricultural Banking Advisory Services, a consulting firm.
The plight of BMO Harris and its customers reflects broader distress in the U.S. farm sector. Farmers are struggling to pay back their loans or obtain new ones. Shrinking cash flow is pushing some to retire early and a growing number of producers to declare bankruptcy, according to farm economists and legal experts. (For a graphic on rising farm-loan delinquencies, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2X3hbac )
BMO Harris may yet face more defaults, judging by its high level of delinquent loans. At the end of June, nearly 13.1% of its farm loan portfolio was at least 90 days late or had stopped accruing interest because the lender doubts the money will be paid back - compared to 1.53% for all U.S. farm loans at banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). BMO Harris had the highest rate among the 30 largest FDIC banks, according to a Reuters analysis of loan data the banks reported to the regulator.
Ray Whitacre, head of BMO Harris Bank's U.S. diversified industries unit, said in a statement that the bank's distressed loans do not represent ""the overwhelming majority"" of its borrowers' experiences. The Bank of Montreal and its U.S. businesses have been in farm lending for more than a century, he said. The bank takes a long-term view of helping farmers through ""all stages of the economic cycle,"" Whitacre said.
BMO Harris spokesman Patrick O’Herlihy attributed the high delinquency rates to the bank’s lending in the upper Midwest, where dairy and grain operators have faced serious financial challenges. Sam Miller, BMO Harris' managing director of agriculture banking, said the bank is keeping a closer eye on its customers with cash-flow shortages and lending to fewer mid-sized operators. ""We have to be more vigilant in underwriting the risk,"" Miller said in an interview. 
The bank declined to comment on any individual loans or borrowers, or on the prospect that it could face additional defaults based on its delinquency rates.
MISSING COLLATERAL
The bank's exposure to the farm sector reached a peak of $1.59 billion in 2018. Most other major banks have been scaling back their farm-loan portfolios since about 2015, as prices fell due to a global grains glut, according to the Reuters analysis of FDIC data.
Among the BMO Harris deals that went belly-up was $43 million in farm operating loans to McM Inc, run by Ronald G. McMartin Jr. in North Dakota. The farm filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2017.
BMO Harris secured a $25 million loan with McM's grain, cattle and other farm crops, along with other assets. McM agreed to use the sale of these crops to pay the bank back, according to a copy of the loan.
During the bankruptcy proceedings, BMO Harris' attorneys told the court it was unable to locate all the crops backing its loans, alleging that McM had sold some of the crops to pay other creditors first. Court documents also show the bank had not audited some of the farm's financial statements. An outside consultant later found McM's accounts receivable and inventory was overstated by at least $11 million, according to court filings. Neither McMartin nor his attorney responded to requests for comment.
Some experts and bankruptcy attorneys representing former BMO Harris customers say the bank issued too many loans for too long that farmers simply could not pay back. The problems, they said, stem from the aggressive practices of some loan officers and a lack of oversight by bank auditors.
Michael and Byron Robinson borrowed $2.5 million in an agricultural loan and another $2.5 million on a line of credit in 2013 through their Indiana businesses, court records show. The bank sued the Robinsons in federal court as part of its foreclosure process in 2016 and later sold the farmland at auction. The property brought far less than the value the bank had estimated the properties were worth to justify the original loans, said their bankruptcy attorney, Maurice Doll.
Michael and Byron Robinson did not respond to requests for comment. Doll said BMO Harris had loaded his clients up with far more debt than they could reasonably pay.
'DON'T WORRY. IT'LL BE FINE'
The Indiana-based BMO Harris banker working with the Robinsons and Kruger, Thomas ""T.J."" Mattick, found his customers through farm magazine advertisements, word of mouth, at church gatherings and from rural loan brokers who were paid a finder’s fee, according to interviews with 10 farmers and one loan broker.
""I thought I could trust him,"" Kruger said. ""We would talk about church and faith all the time.""
When the Robinsons were looking to expand their corn and soybean operations, Mattick convinced them to buy two new farms instead of one - with BMO Harris financing 100% of the deal, said Michael Morrison, the Robinsons' farm bookkeeper and a former agricultural banker.
Morrison told Reuters he was concerned by how the bank's underwriters valued the family's grain in storage, on the premise that its value would continue to rise - even as grain prices were starting to soften at the time.
""We used to say that T.J. never saw a loan he didn't like,"" Morrison said. ""I kept telling them, 'Don't do this. Don't take on the debt.' But T.J. kept telling them, 'Don't worry, it'll be fine'.""
Mattick, who no longer works for the bank, denied that he encouraged borrowers to take on more debt they could pay back. In written answers to questions from Reuters, Mattick said ""extensive underwriting and analysis"" were conducted on the loans for Kruger and the Robinsons, as with any other file.
Mattick denied telling Kruger that he would ""make the numbers work"" without standard documentation such as sold-grain receipts. And he said BMO Harris would not have given the Robinson's 100% financing on their farms unless they pledged additional collateral. BMO Harris declined to comment on Mattick’s statements regarding individual loans and bank policy, and Reuters could not independently verify them. 

""I worked with clients to help them determine what they could afford and never would have counseled them to incur debt beyond what they could afford,"" Mattick said.

1371,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 12:56PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Petrobras, Brazil's government near oil marketing deal - official","By Gram Slattery and Marta Nogueira
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's Petrobras could take over marketing of the government's share of crude from offshore oilfields, a government official told Reuters, adding significantly to the state-run oil firm's trading operations.
In an interview on Monday, the head of Pre-Salt Petroleum, better known by its Portuguese acronym PPSA, said it is close to inking a deal in which Petrobras' trading desk will manage the oil that Brazil's government receives from private sector firms.
The potential deal, being discussed ahead of a blockbuster season for oil bidding rounds in the South American nation, would significantly boost the volume of crude traded by Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the firm is formally known.
Petrobras declined to comment on the negotiations.
On Nov. 6, a who's who of international oil firms will compete to snap up prolific offshore oilfields in Brazil in a process expected to fetch some $25 billion for the government. The following day, firms will compete in a separate process expected to bring another $2 billion into state coffers. 
Following significant exploration work in the area, the fields are known to hold billions of barrels of untapped crude.
All winners will hand a significant chunk of that oil over to the government, via the PPSA, as is standard practice within Brazil's so-called ""pre-salt"" oil producing region.
Due mainly to the upcoming rounds, the oil that the PPSA manages could soar from just a few thousands barrels per day (bpd) last year to around 500,000 bpd by 2028 according to preliminary estimates, PPSA head José Eduardo Gerk said in an interview.
That compares with Petrobras' current exports of 583,000 bpd in the September quarter.
Last year, the PPSA sold its oil on the spot market and via auctions. But that is set to change as the agency closes in on the outsourcing contract with Petrobras, Gerk said. 
""Since I got here (in April), the negotiations ... with Petrobras have gone forward and we hope to be able to come to an agreement by the end of the year,"" he told Reuters.
With the oil it receives set to skyrocket in the coming years, the PPSA is also set to grow.

Currently a relatively sleepy agency of 44 employees located in downtown Rio de Janeiro, Gerk said the agency hopes to hire another 50 in-house employees by 2021.

1372,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 12:52PM ET</span>",Aramco listing was delayed to rope in anchor investors: sources,"By Hadeel Al Sayegh, Marwa Rashad and Rania El Gamal
DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - Oil giant Saudi Aramco's much-vaunted stock market listing was delayed after deal advisers said they need more time to lock in cornerstone investors, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
After a false start last year, preparations gathered momentum this summer with approaches to sovereign wealth funds, rich Saudis and large foreign fund managers as potential cornerstone investors only for plans to unravel for a second time.
The world's biggest oil company had been expected last week to launch the domestic sale of a 1-2% stake, but the signing up of marquee backers has been hampered by continuing valuation concerns exacerbated by recent attacks on Aramco's Abqaiq and Khurais plants.
Aramco was unable to answer valuation questions fully during initial talks with investors, said one Gulf institutional investor who has been involved in the discussions.
Sovereign funds in the oil-rich Gulf region typically shy away from energy exposure, he added, looking to diversify their investment portfolio.
Two of the sources said that an Aramco committee overseeing the planned flotation had therefore recommended to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman last Wednesday that the launch of an initial public offering (IPO) scheduled for Oct. 20 be postponed.
The prince, the kingdom's de facto ruler, has made the Aramco IPO a pillar of an ambitious economic reform drive. He wants the company to be valued at about $2 trillion, though bankers and company insiders put the value closer to $1.5 trillion.
Aramco declined to comment and the Saudi government media office did not respond to a Reuters' request for comment.
Banks involved in the offering received news of the delay on Thursday evening. An email from top advisers said that a call with bankers on Friday to discuss strategy to secure investors was canceled, as was the Sunday launch, said one banker who saw the email.
The rationale was that third-quarter results, which one of the sources said could come before the end of October, would bolster investor confidence after the Sept. 14 attacks initially halved Aramco's output and shook oil markets.
ANCHOR INVESTORS
Talks have taken place with Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Singapore's GIC and other funds, sources have told Reuters.
Newly appointed Aramco chairman Yasir al-Rumayyan, who also heads Saudi wealth fund PIF, is pushing banks to achieve the top valuation, said a fourth source familiar with the IPO plan.
Anchor, or cornerstone, investors such sovereign wealth funds are considered key to secure demand. In 2016 state-owned Postal Savings Bank of China sold 77% of its $7.4 billion IPO to such backers.
""They (Aramco) will want anchor investors to cover no less than 40% of the offering. Anything below that won't be enough,"" said one of the three sources close to the deal.
The latest delay in the plan to hold what could be one of the world's largest public offerings -- potentially raising upwards of $20 billion from the sale of 5% of Aramco in total -- has revived debate on whether Saudi Arabia can ever realize its valuation target given moribund oil prices.
""The current oil price environment is not favorable for the $2 trillion target,"" said Steffen Hertog, associate professor at the London School of Economics.
""Aramco expects the oil market to recover over the coming few years. Another longer delay would, however, test the patience of the market; the optics would not be ideal."""

1375,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 12:32PM ET</span>",U.S. companies facing worker shortage race to automate,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies are responding to the lowest unemployment rate in almost 50 years by increasing their focus on automation in order to maintain healthy margins as labor costs tick higher, a Reuters analysis of corporate earnings transcripts shows.
The attempt to save money through technology does not come down to just installing more robots in factories. Instead, companies appear to be confronting the lack of low-cost workers by investing in software and machines that can perform tasks ranging from human resources management to filling prescriptions. 
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), for instance, said that it is expanding its cloud infrastructure to replace routine tasks that used to require human labor. Health insurance company UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) told investors that its automation efforts should save the company over $1 billion next year. And Corona beer brewer Constellation Brands Inc (NYSE:STZ) said that its spending on automation should increase the efficiency in which it packs bottles in a variety pack, shaving costs.
Those investments are helping keep wage growth in line despite historically-low unemployment. Average hourly earnings were unchanged in October despite the unemployment rate falling to 3.5% from 3.7%, while the annual increase in wages fell slightly to 2.9%. 
""I'm not at all worried about margin pressure from wages"" because of increased productivity due to corporate spending on automation, said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equities strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities. 
Overall, companies have discussed automation on quarterly earnings calls more than 1,110 times since the beginning of the year, a 15% increase from this time last year and nearly double the mentions by this time in October, 2016, according to Refinitiv data. Corporate orders of robotics alone rose 7.2% over the first half of this year compared with 2018, totaling $869 million in spending, according to the Association for Advancing Automation. 
Fund managers and analysts say that corporate spending on automation is contributing to positive earnings surprises. Nearly 83% of companies in the S&P 500 that have release third quarter earnings so far have reported earnings above expectations, compared with an average 65% beat rate since 1994, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
""You're seeing companies benefit in ways that aren't easy to see when you look at the balance sheet, and all those investments start to add up and help protect margins,"" said Matt Watson, a portfolio manager at James Investment Research.
Watson said that he is now buying companies that are benefiting from the use of automation because they trade at much more attractive valuations than the companies that provide it, which he is steering clear of. 
FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX), for example, is investing in systems to both automate its shipping facilities and is testing robots that can handle some deliveries, he said. He is also buying shares of broker-dealer LPL Financial Holdings Inc, which is automating more of its client-relations platform to increase efficiency, he said. 
""You don't need to get into the nitty gritty when it's back-of-the-napkin obvious that these companies are saving money"" through increased productivity, Watson said. 
The fastest-growing sectors of automation are in logistics and healthcare, said Jeremie Capron, head of research at ROBO Global, the company behind the $1.2-billion Robo Global Robotics & Automation ETF. The firm's ETF is up nearly 20% for the year to date, in line with the performance of the benchmark S&P 500 index. 
Capron sees the greatest opportunity in companies like Zebra Technologies Corp, which makes radio-frequency identification device readers and real-time location systems that are used in hospitals and e-commerce fulfillment centers, he said. Shares of the company are up nearly 30% for the year to date. 
Declining costs and a new generation of smaller systems should continue to push revenue growth in the sector, he said. 

""We've hit the level where you don't need great engineering skills to deploy automation because the software has made it so much easier to use,"" he said. ""You're seeing not only large multi-national groups automate, but those technologies are increasingly available to smaller and mid-sized businesses.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. prosecutor on Tuesday called Turkey's Halkbank (IS:HALKB) a ""fugitive"" after it failed to make an initial court appearance in a criminal case accusing it of conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions against Iran.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Lockard said at a hearing in federal court in Manhattan that prosecutors had served a summons on the bank's U.S. lawyer, and that the bank was ""in contempt"" for not appearing. He said prosecutors would give the bank more time to respond, but might seek a fine if it continued to refuse.
Such a fine would be a penalty only for failing to appear in court, and would not reflect a finding that the bank was guilty of the charges against it.
U.S. District Judge Richard Berman, who is presiding over the case, said the bank would get another two weeks.
Andrew Hruska, Halkbank's U.S. lawyer, had said in a court filing Monday that he was not authorized to accept a summons or appear in court on behalf of the bank. Hruska could not immediately be reached for comment after Tuesday's hearing.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan brought the criminal charges against Halkbank on Oct. 16. The bank called the charges an escalation of Washington's sanctions on Ankara over its military incursion in Syria, while President Tayyip Erdogan called them an ""unlawful, ugly"" step.
Turkey agreed to a ceasefire in northern Syria last Friday following a visit by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence. He said he told Turkish officials that the charges against Halkbank were a matter for the New York federal prosecutors.
The charges were part of a criminal case that became public in 2016 with the arrest in Miami of Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader accused of playing a central role along with Halkbank in a scheme to help Iran evade U.S. sanctions using sham food and gold transactions.
Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a Halkbank deputy general manager, was arrested in New York the following year. Zarrab pleaded guilty and testified for U.S. prosecutors at Atilla's trial, accusing officials including Erdogan of taking part in the sanctions evasion scheme.
Erdogan at the time condemned the case as a political attack on his government.
Atilla was found guilty and sentenced to 32 months in prison. He returned to Turkey earlier this year after serving his sentence.
On Monday, Atilla was named general manager of the Istanbul stock exchange."
1381,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 11:01AM ET</span>","Boeing makes progress on 737 MAX, but FAA needs weeks to review","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is making progress toward getting its 737 MAX aircraft in the air again, but the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will need at least several more weeks for review, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said on Tuesday.
Boeing and the FAA are grappling to contain a crisis in the wake of two deadly 737 MAX crashes that have left 346 people dead, forced airlines to ground more than 300 aircraft, and put on hold Boeing deliveries worth more than $500 billion.
Boeing has said it hopes to resume 737 MAX flights later this year, although major U.S. and Canadian airlines have canceled MAX flights into January or February.
Dickson said at a conference of air traffic controllers in Washington that the agency had received the ""final software load"" and ""complete system description"" of revisions to the plane, which was grounded in March.
The FAA is currently using ""aircraft production software"" in the engineering simulator. The next step is to complete pilot workload management testing and have U.S. and international pilots conduct scenarios to determine training requirements before a key certification test flight. 
""It is going to be several more weeks before we go through all of that part of the process,"" Dickson said. ""We've got considerable work to do.""
Separately, Boeing said that last week it successfully conducted a dry-run of a certification flight test. Dickson told Reuters last month the FAA would need about 30 days from the time of the certification test flight before the plane could resume flights.
The system description is a ""500-ish page document that has the architecture of the flight control system and the changes that they have made,"" Dickson told Reuters last month.
'SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS'
Boeing shares rose on Tuesday after two sharp days of declines following the release of instant messages on Friday from a former Boeing pilot that the company had withheld from the FAA and which raised questions about what Boeing may have known about a key safety system known as MCAS. 
That prompted an immediate demand for an explanation from the FAA about why the messages were not turned over sooner.
Boeing said on Tuesday it had ""made significant progress over the past several months"" in its work to return the MAX to service.
The changes include an MCAS software update with new safeguards for an anti-stall system at the heart of the two fatal crashes.
Dickson said once the steps were completed ahead of the certification test flight ""it is a fairly straightforward process to unground the airplane."" He reiterated he would not let the 737 MAX fly again ""until I am satisfied it is the safest thing out there.""
Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg will appear before Congress for two days of testimony next week. He was stripped of his title as board chairman earlier this month.
On Wednesday, Indonesia plans to share with victims' families a final report into Lion Air flight 610 that crashed into the Java Sea shortly after take-off from Jakarta on Oct. 29, 2018, killing all 189 people on board. The report on the 737 MAX crash is expected to be made public later this week.

The legal shield would have given ArcelorMittal's managers immunity from prosecution related to a clean-up plan for the plant, which has become a symbol of the struggles of Italy's heavy industry and the focus of intense political wrangling.
Three of Italy's major manufacturing unions, the CGIL, CSIL and UIL, put out a joint statement warning that Monday's vote to lift the immunity guarantees was ""a serious matter that adds further uncertainty to the future of ArcelorMittal in Italy"".
The 5-Star Movement, which has a strong environmentalist platform, advocated the closure of Ilva prior to a March 2018 national election, but has since dropped its demands.
The PD has asked the government to ensure job levels are safeguarded at the plant.
The far-right League, now the main opposition party, has accused the ruling coalition of putting the plant at risk. ""We will do everything to avoid layoffs,"" said League leader Matteo Salvini in a statement."

(Reuters) -  United Parcel  Service Inc's (N:UPS) e-commerce fueled quarterly profit beat on Tuesday was overshadowed by news that Jim Barber, widely viewed as the world's biggest parcel delivery firm's next leader, would retire at year-end.
Shares in Atlanta-based UPS fell 4 percent to $113.52 on news of the departure of Chief Operating Officer Barber, who oversees the company's global small package, freight, supply chain, freight forwarding and engineering, and was instrumental in the company's turnaround. 
""Investors assumed he was going to be the next CEO and this caught us by surprise. Unfortunately, the market does not like surprises,"" Seaport Global analyst Kevin Sterling said.
Barber's retirement comes just months after similar news from Chief Financial Officer Richard Peretz, ushering in big changes to the UPS C-suite at a time when cooling economies in Asia and Europe threaten global growth.
""We have a strong bench. Succession planning is something we constantly focus on,"" Chief Executive David Abney said on a conference call with analysts.
UPS said Barber and Peretz will guide UPS through the key holiday peak shopping and shipping season, when the company's daily volumes can double.
The U.S. consumer continues to spend, bolstering online sales that fueled a 24% rise in UPS Next Day Air U.S. delivery volume during the third quarter.
That result was buoyed by rival FedEx Corp's (N:FDX) breakup with online retailer Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) this summer. 
""It's Amazon, but it's beyond Amazon,"" Abney said in a telephone interview with Reuters.
""Companies are competing on time. Next Day has become the standard. We see it in our Next Day Ground and our Next Day Air,"" said Abney, who noted that the company's multi-billion-dollar investments in network upgrades have shaved per-package costs by 2.5%.
Still, investors remain wary of the potential ill-effects of the ongoing U.S.-China trade war on the company, whose international package group accounts for about 20% of total revenue but roughly 35% of operating income. 
UPS third-quarter net income rose 16% to $1.75 billion, or $2.01 per share, after revenue increased 5% to $18.32 billion.
Excluding items, the company earned $2.07 per share, topping analysts' average forecast by a penny, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

(Reuters) - United Technologies (N:UTX) expects Boeing (N:BA) to maintain production of its 737 MAX planes at the current rate for the rest of 2019, Chief Financial Officer Akhil Johri said on Tuesday, allaying fears of a complete halt in production.
His comments come a day after several analysts raised doubts about Boeing's ability to maintain its production rate of 42 jets per month amid fresh uncertainty over the time frame for the 737 MAX's return to service.
""We continue to work on a daily basis with Boeing,"" Johri told Reuters in an interview after results, adding that UTC will get more clarity on the planemaker's 2020 production plan by January.
UTC, a major Boeing supplier, on Tuesday reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue, helped by an increase in demand for aircraft spare parts and maintenance services for an older fleet that remains in service in the wake of the MAX grounding.
""Although the MAX has been grounded, the airlines are ensuring that the fleet they have continues to fly... What that means is they have all the parts available for any repairs that might need to be done,"" Johri said.
UTC's shares rose 2.3% to $141.4 in premarket trading and Boeing gained more than 1.2% to $335 after declining 11% over the last three days.
Johri, however, said talks to partner with Boeing for its proposed new mid-sized jetliner, NMA, had slowed as the jet producer focused on getting the MAX back in the air.
""The talks are still happening with Boeing at the engineering level on the NMA, but the momentum has slowed a little.""

UTC reported quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $2.21 and beat analyst average estimate of $2.03. It also raised its 2019 adjusted profit outlook to a range of $8.05 to $8.15 per share, up from prior forecast of between $7.90 and $8.05.

The kickoff, originally scheduled for Oct. 20, was delayed after Aramco got mixed feedback from international investors. Aramco plans to press on with the listing plans by relying more on investors from Saudi Arabia and other parts of the Middle East to buy its shares, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.
Some domestic funds have been invited to a meeting at Aramco’s headquarters in Dhahran on Wednesday to discuss the IPO and may be asked for commitments shortly afterward, the people said. While Aramco may need to reduce its valuation expectations below the initial $2 trillion target, local institutions are seen as less sensitive to the pricing, one of the people said.
Aramco hasn’t finalized a new timetable, and the schedule for the share sale could still be pushed back again, according to the people. The process has been rocky from the start, with Saudi Arabia initially announcing the IPO project in 2016.
Plans were revived early this year before facing a setback after an attack last month on the company’s biggest processing plant. Whether Aramco can still succeed in listing this year will depend on whether it can drum up enough demand from Saudi investors as well as the regional funds it’s been approaching.
An imminent announcement could give Saudi Arabia some good news as it prepares for the Oct. 29 start of its annual Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh. The three-day confab, known as “Davos in the Desert,” is set to attract some of Wall Street’s top dealmakers as well as representatives from major institutional investors across the globe.
Aramco didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement last week, the company said the timing of the IPO will depend on market conditions."

Shares of the company rose 7% in premarket trading as it posted the first rise in international sales in a year during the third quarter and a 3.6% dip in U.S. retail motorcycle sales - the smallest decline in nearly three years.
Profits continued to sink - by 24% - but the results offered some hope that one of the biggest names in motorcycles was finally beginning to arrest a slide in global sales that it has been fighting for years. 
Sales in the world's biggest motorcycle markets in Asia, which Harley has targeted with smaller bikes that go against its traditional profile, rose 8.7% in the quarter and are up about 1.6% this year overall.
The company plans to source half of its revenue from overseas by 2027 and international retail sales rose 2.7% to 23,619 motorcycle in the quarter. 
While worldwide shipments fell 5.8% to 45,837 motorcycles, they topped analysts' estimates by over 1,000 motorcycles, and the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company stuck to its 2019 shipment target of 212,000 to 217,000 bikes.
The company is also cutting spending and it said it now saw 2019 capital expenses of $205 million to $225 million, about $20 million less than its previous estimates.
Excluding items, the company earned 70 cents per share, beating Wall Street expectations of 52 cents while revenue from motorcycles and related products overall fell 4.9% to $1.07 billion. 
TARIFF HIT DOUBLES
The company, which has been criticized by President Donald Trump for its plan to shift some U.S. production overseas, has also been battling the effects of trade tensions on its business globally.
Earlier this year, it said retaliatory import duties imposed by the European Union on its bikes would cost the company between $100 million and $120 million in 2019. 
Brussels in June raised import duties on U.S.-manufactured Harley bikes to 31% from 6%, and the company said the impact from tariffs more than doubled in the third quarter from a year ago to $21.6 million.

In response, Harley plans to begin shipping bikes from its Thailand plant but a delay in regulatory approval from the trading bloc means it will not see any benefit in earnings before the second quarter of 2020.

(NASDAQ:STMP) shares rallied Tuesday ahead of the opening bell after   United Parcel   Service Inc. (NYSE:UPS) announced a pact to offer discounted shipping rates to the company’s customer base of more than 740,000.
“We long mentioned a new partnership was needed to help lift shares and believe the UPS collaboration is a step in the right direction,” wrote Darren Aftahi, an analyst at Roth Capital Partners.
Rates are expected to be as much as 55% below daily rates, including surcharge waivers, he said. The deal should aid Stamps.com volume and margins and add upside to fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 forecasts, Aftahi said, even as the rates are still unlikely to be below legacy United States Postal Service rates.
The UPS collaboration marks the first partner Stamps.com has signed since ending its relationship with the USPS in February -- a move that sent the stock tumbling 58%. Less than three months later, Stamps.com cut its year forecasts, sinking the shares another 56%.
Shares of Stamps.com rose as much as 31% pre-market to $99.99, which would be the highest intraday level since late February. Before today, shares have dropped 51% this year.
The pact could be the catalyst necessary to reverse the trend in shares year to date, Aftahi said. He boosted his price target to $85 from $52. His rating remains neutral."
1396,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 09:18AM ET</span>",Goldman Sees U.S. Election Putting a Brake on Share Buybacks,"(Bloomberg) --  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists warn that next year’s contest for the White House may put a cap on a key driver of the Wall Street equity rally: stock buybacks.
“The uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the 2020 U.S. presidential election and its potential implications for policy will likely lead corporate managers to adopt a wait-and-see approach to cash spending,” said Goldman strategists, including Arjun Menon and David Kostin, in a note.
Corporate share buybacks, which Goldman expects to shrink by 2% on a net basis to $470 billion in 2020, have been the bull market’s constant companion, while many active managers chose to remain on the sidelines because of late-cycle concerns about growth. The practice, however, has come under fire from some top Democrats as the party’s presidential candidates campaign for increased corporate responsibility.
By forecasting a reduction in stock repurchases by U.S. companies, Goldman is drawing a parallel to the 2016 election cycle when annual gross buybacks fell by 5%. Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders earlier this year proposed that companies pursuing buybacks be required to take steps such as raising workers’ minimum pay to $15 an hour, improving pensions or offering seven days of paid sick leave.
Politics, of course, isn’t the only reason buybacks are expected to shrink in 2020, with Goldman strategists also citing slower earnings growth and a significant decline in corporate cash balances amid surging debt levels. And stock purchases are already showing a slump this year after the 2018 boom, with Goldman forecasting a year-on-year drop of 20% to $480 billion by the end of 2019.
At the same time, according to Goldman analysts, companies will remain the largest drivers of U.S. equity demand next year, while mutual and pension funds will continue to be net sellers."

(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) on Tuesday raised its full-year sales and profit forecasts after a better-than-expected first quarter, as it sold more toothpaste and expensive face cream.
Shares of the world's biggest personal care goods company rose 4.1% in premarket trading.
P&G, which makes Tide detergent, Pampers diapers and Pantene shampoo, has been raising prices and investing in new products across most of its business, hoping to claw back market share from upstart brands that have cropped up in recent years.
""P&G is clearly firing on all cylinders,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnie Herzog said. ""P&G raised its full-year guidance across the board, which is not typical so early in the fiscal year, and evidence management has conviction that momentum will continue.""
P&G forecast full-year core earnings growth in the range of 5% to 10%, compared with its prior estimate of 4% to 9% growth. The company expects full-year sales to grow as much as 5%, compared with earlier expectation of 4%. P&G retained its lower-end sales growth forecast of 3%.
The company also received a 0.4 percentage point sales boost from Japan, where retailers and shoppers hoarded beauty, household, baby and fabric care products and Baby businesses ahead of a planned VAT increase in October.
Organic sales, which exclude acquisitions, divestitures and currency effects, rose 7% in the company's fiscal first quarter, ended Sept. 30. P&G said organic sales rose 10% in its beauty business, which makes SK-II and Olay products. The company, which launched its Oral-B Genius X electric toothbrush and Crest toothpaste aimed at people with sensitive teeth and gums, said organic sales rose 9% at its healthcare business.
Organic sales in the grooming unit, a sore point for the company after it took a $8 billion writedown for its Gillette shaving business in the fourth quarter, reported 1% growth.
Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said in a post-earnings media call that P&G was trying to raise awareness about new Gillette products. Rivals like Unilever's (L:ULVR) Dollar Shave Club and Edgewell Personal Care's (N:EPC) Harry's have proven to be stiff competition in the shaving category.
Overall, net sales climbed 6.6% to $17.80 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $17.42 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net income attributable to the company rose to $1.36 per share from $1.22 per share a year earlier. Excluding items, P&G earned $1.37 per share, beating estimates of $1.24."
1398,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 09:02AM ET</span>",Big Four auditors failing to learn from company collapses: UK lawmaker,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Accounting firms have not shown a ""learning curve"" from the collapse of travel company Thomas Cook and builder Carillion, with urgent reform the only way to improve audit quality, a senior British lawmaker said on Tuesday.
Rachel Reeves, a Labour lawmaker who is chair of parliament's business committee, said the failure of Thomas Cook showed again that accountants were not proactive in ""doing the right thing"".
Reeves was holding a hearing with representatives of EY - formerly known as Ernst & Young - and PwC, who audited Thomas Cook in the years before it collapsed in September, triggering the repatriation of 150,000 British holidaymakers - the biggest in peace time for Britain.
Addressing the Big Four auditors, which also include Deloitte and KPMG, Reeves hit out at the slow pace of change.
""How many more cases of egregious accounting do we need before your industry opens its eyes and recognizes that you are complicit in this and that you need to reform?"" she said.
""We can't rely on you to do the right thing and that legislation is needed to have tougher regulation because... your industry is not willing to make the changes needed.""
EY, which replaced PwC as auditor of Thomas Cook in 2016, is being investigated by its regulator, the Financial Reporting Council.
EY and PwC representatives told the hearing they stood by their audits of Thomas Cook, complying in full with rules at the time, though with full hindsight some things could have been done differently.
Conservative lawmaker Antoinette Sandbach expressed incredulity at how the auditors ""blithely"" agreed that Thomas Cook was a ""going concern"", with no recent writedown in goodwill until May this year despite profit warnings and the need for cash injections.
PwC's UK head of audit Hermione Hudson said there were considerable ""challenging discussions"" over the going concern issue, prompting Thomas Cook to delay its annual report.
Richard Wilson, an audit partner at EY, said EY had publicly noted ""material uncertainty"" on the company being a going concern. The auditor is still owed 900,000 pounds from Thomas Cook for work completed.
After the Carillion and BHS collapse, two government-backed reviews have proposed setting up a new regulator, forcing companies to hire two auditors, and requiring the Big Four to run their audit and advisory services separately to avoid treading softly on audit to win lucrative advisory business.
But Britain's business minister Andrea Leadsom said last week the government would wait until early 2020 to propose legislation after a third review into the role of audit reports back before the end of 2019.

PwC and EY officials said reform should be implemented as a package drawing on all three reviews. If legislation is proposed in early 2020, change may still take a year or two, with even the regulator sceptical of planned reforms like joint audits.

1400,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 08:17AM ET</span>",Caterpillar’s ‘Earnings Recession’ Points to More Bad News for World Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- A bellwether of the global industrial economy may be sending out distress signals.
  Caterpillar   Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is heading for a “mild earnings recession,’’ according to   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS), and analysts expect the heavy-equipment maker to post its first year-over-year decline in quarterly profit since 2016 when it reports results on Wednesday.
Margins are shrinking as demand cools and the U.S.-China trade war fuels caution among customers. Machine sales have slipped in Asia and the U.S. on weaker orders in construction industries, just as the Deerfield, Illinois-based company has been trying to raise prices. That helps explain why analysts have pared the earnings outlook five times since August.
The following charts show why Caterpillar’s earnings report could bring more bad news for the world economy.
Machinery Meter
In June, worldwide machinery sales for Caterpillar grew at the slowest pace in more than two years on a 3-month rolling, year-over-year basis. The company posted the same increase in July and August. The sluggishness is largely due to a slowdown in North America, its largest market, and declining market share in China. Sales in North America expanded at the weakest rate in almost two years in August, and in Asia contracted the most since 2016.
Last week, the International Monetary Fund made a fifth straight cut to its 2019 global growth forecast, citing a broad deceleration across the world’s largest economies as trade tensions undermine the expansion. The forecast for this year would be the weakest since 2009, when the world economy shrank.
Lots on Dealer Lots
With concern over the sales outlook, the amount of equipment available on sellers’ lots has been in the spotlight all year. The company said in July that dealer machine and engine inventories increased about $500 million in the three months through June, compared with an increase of about $100 million in the same period a year earlier. It’s been counting on dealers working through the buildup to help meet 2019 profit targets. But analysts at William Blair & Co., who pared their earnings forecast on Oct. 7, said dealer inventories are instead rising and more production cuts may be needed.
Caterpillar isn’t alone. Manufacturers of durable goods in the U.S. had enough inventory to last 1.69 months in August, the longest since November 2016, according to the Census Bureau.
Stock Figures
Concern over the economic outlook and its impact on demand is showing up in analysts’ share-price targets. The rolling 12-month forecast for Caterpillar’s stock is down about 18% from the same time a year ago.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). trimmed its 2019-2021 earnings per share estimates by 4% on average. The bank said it expects earnings before interest and taxes to decline year-over-year in 2020, driven by “meaningful production cuts in North America and China construction equipment, while mining demand remains tepid given widespread macro uncertainty.”
The stock-price outlook could get help from a resolution in the trade war and further cuts in interest rates among central banks, Larry De Maria, an analyst at William Blair, said in his report earlier this month. But the uncertainty going into a U.S. election year, generally weaker industrial economy, and cyclical construction equipment markets should ultimately override those potential positives, limiting upside, he said.
Softening the Blow
To be sure, there are bright spots for Caterpillar. Earnings are still forecast to reach a record this year, and much of the bad news may already be reflected in the share price. The stock has risen about 4% in 2019, trailing the 15% gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Also, mining-equipment demand has held up, and should help soften the blow from a slowdown in construction, according to Karen Ubelhart, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
“Mining equipment should lead segment growth, yet is only 15-20% of sales and earnings,” Ubelhart said in a note last week. When Caterpillar reports earnings, “commentary on China will remain a focus, as will significant deceleration in North American construction equipment demand. ”"

1411,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 06:41AM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs Is Either Mad or Brilliant on Junk Bonds,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In markets, a theme can often become the overwhelming consensus. When that happens, traders feel two conflicting urges at the same time. The first is to say the majority is wrong and stake a contrarian position. The other is to wonder whether maybe everyone is onto something.
This captures the current struggle for investors in the U.S. high-yield and leveraged loan markets. The consensus opinion is perhaps best stated by this Bloomberg News headline from last week: “Leveraged Loan Buyers Are Running for Cover as Fear Ramps Up.” Simply put, money managers are flocking into debt with higher credit ratings because they’re worried about how riskier securities will hold up if economic growth slows and their weak investor protections are put to the test. Already, big price moves are roiling certain pockets of the credit markets with greater frequency. That’s pushed the gap between prices on single-B and double-B rated leveraged loans, as well as the spread between triple-C and double-B junk bond yields, to the widest levels since mid-2016.
As if to add fuel to the fire, S&P Global Ratings released a report late last week with the title “Weakest Links Reach a 10-Year High.” S&P defines weakest links as issuers rated B- or lower with negative outlooks or on its CreditWatch with negative implications. There were 263 of them globally in September, the most since November 2009. “The default rate of weakest links is nearly eight times greater” than the broad junk-bond market, analysts Nicole Serino and Sudeep Kash wrote. “The rise in the weakest links tally may signify higher default rates ahead.”
This report is catnip for those who believe the high-yield consensus. The longest economic expansion in U.S. history has effectively stamped out default risk except around the edges of the bond market. Notably, even with all these weakest links, S&P still says its base case is for the U.S. default rate to reach 3.4% by mid-2020 — hardly an apocalypse. But if there’s even a chance that corporate failures exceed estimates, bondholders aren’t the types to stick around and risk it. At least not until the securities get too cheap to pass up.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management is one of the few contrarians suggesting the market might already be at that point. “We are starting to find opportunities where we are willing to go down in quality,” Ashish Shah, the firm’s co-chief investment officer of fixed income, said last week. “We think the market is being too bearish on the economy.” In Shah’s view, investors may be hesitant to make risky bets in the final months of 2019 but will get aggressive in the new year.
Obviously, Shah isn’t endorsing all low-rated bonds. No credit investor will ever recommend a rating category or an industry broadly. But even just the suggestion of picking and choosing among the riskiest junk debt goes against the grain. Time will prove this stance either mad or brilliant.
It’s a tricky call. By Shah’s own thought process, buying riskier junk bonds now might be getting in too early if most investors are going to clean up their portfolios heading into the end of the year. Traders are all-too-familiar with the pain from December 2018, for one, which was the high-yield market’s worst month in three years.
On the other hand, the Federal Reserve isn’t tightening monetary policy as it was at the end of last year. Rather, policy makers have cut interest rates twice since July and look poised to do it again on Oct. 30. Those actions are all in the name of sustaining the economic expansion, which should bolster lower-rated companies. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan even noted last week that, in hindsight, the criticism of the December 2018 rate increase was fair. 
Now, interest-rate cuts are far from a guarantee that the economy can keep chugging along. Oaktree Capital Group LLC’s co-founder, Howard Marks, for one, is skeptical that the Fed can hold off an eventual recession. He said last week that his firm, one of the world’s largest distressed-debt investors, has gradually been putting more emphasis on safety in credit, though he’s still comfortable holding single-B rated obligations that his analysts have vetted. “Ratings don’t tell you whether something is safe or not,” he said.
Money managers will always criticize ratings companies. But now credit raters are also flagging that a growing number of companies are at risk of deteriorating. The S&P report, for instance, shows the U.S. has 177 “weakest links,” compared with the five-year average of 138 and the 10-year average of 114. That ought to concern those who believe that credit-rating companies, on average, tend to hand out grades that are too high.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists, for instance, used similar language to S&P in a report that concluded “beneath the veneer of relative spread resilience and muted realized defaults, the weak links in the leveraged credit markets are coming under pressure.”
At the same time, markets have fallen for the end-of-cycle head fake time and again. Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida, in remarks last week before the central bank’s blackout period, said that the global economy is “muddling through” and that the situation isn’t dire. That seems like a fair assessment. In those kinds of conditions, the riskiest junk bonds can largely find a way to scrape by as well.
That kind of flimsy assurance doesn’t cut it anymore for a number of high-yield investors. Until (or unless) more of them join Goldman Sachs Asset Management in wading back into the risky end of the market, the dominant up-in-quality consensus looks unstoppable."

The South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) made irregular findings at South African Airways Technical during a recent audit and said some aircraft could not be flown until corrective action had been taken, Comair said in a statement.
Comair did not elaborate, and a SACAA spokesman said the authority would issue a statement soon.

WUZHEN, China (Reuters) - At one of the world's showpiece tech conferences in China, jibes at the United States for its 'bully behavior' lent a Cold War tone to proceedings as trade tension once again reared its ugly head in an event that drew a dearth of top U.S. executives. 
The state-run World Internet Conference, one of the country's most prominent tech events, took place this year against a backdrop of rising Sino-U.S. frictions and has been especially overshadowed by Washington's moves against Chinese tech companies. 
The United States earlier this month placed several Chinese AI companies on a supplier blacklist and trade talks between both countries show little sign of any quick resolution.
Attendees in previous years included the heads of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). In 2017, Apple CEO Tim Cook told the conference that the company shared China's vision for developing a digital economy for openness.
But this year's three-day event, which ended on Tuesday, drew few American luminaries and did not feature a U.S.-China panel like last year, reflecting the heightened tensions between the United States and China. 
In his opening remarks, China's propaganda chief Huang Kunming set the overall tone with the criticism that the cyberspace industry was being hindered by a ""Cold War"" mentality and ""bully behavior,"" a barely veiled jibe at the United States. 
""No sanctions or restrictions can hinder China’s development or the development of Chinese enterprises,” Yang Shuzhen, the head of the Chinese Academy of Cyberspace Studies, a government-backed think tank, told reporters at the conference.
""No country's enterprise can cover all the world's technical patents, components and equipment. The irreversible trend is that all countries rely on the support of the global market."" 
SPYING AND AI
In May, Washington ramped up pressure on China by placing Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], the world’s largest telecoms equipment provider, on a U.S. blacklist over national security concerns, banning it from buying American-made parts without a special license.
The U.S. government, fearing Huawei equipment could be used to spy on customers, has led a campaign to convince allies to bar it from their 5G networks. Huawei has repeatedly denied the claims.
Some attendees told Reuters that they were seeing efforts by the Chinese government to allocate more resources toward the tech sector to compete with the United States. 
""The trade tensions have indeed impacted on our local traditional businesses, including the apparel industry and fiberglass manufacturers, said a local government official who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the press. 
""But we are trying our best to encourage high-tech businesses to set up operations here, such as renewable energy-driven vehicles and self-driving cars,"" the official added.
Still, many speakers including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) chairman Daniel Zhang and Microsoft's Artificial Intelligence & Research executive vice-president Harry Shum, avoided discussing the 'entity list' or other thorny topics publicly. 
Huawei and Megvii were also among 15 companies awarded prizes by the conference organizers for new product innovations, but no mention was made of the troubles they may face from being put on Washington's trade blacklist. 
""The problem is that everyone’s avoiding the problems,"" said one U.S. attendee. 
""There is not a candid discussion of the problems foreign companies face in China, or some of the larger problems having to do with internet governance in China. Rather, there’s technological boosterism,"" he said. 
Others also tip-toed around the issue of the months-long protests in Hong Kong, even as a seminar was organized to discuss internet innovation in the city and Macau. 
Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) CEO Robin Li was one of the few speakers to make a passing reference to the protests. In a speech talking about artificial intelligence, he predicted that people could one day use the technology to store their thoughts and have conversations with people from the past.
Former Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping could be among them, he said. Deng in 1984 and 1987 said if ""turmoil"" occurs in Hong Kong, ""the central government must intervene"". 
""We can also ask Mr. Deng Xiaoping what he thinks of the situation in Hong Kong today,"" Li said.

1415,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 05:27AM ET</span>",Investor revolt scuppers Sunrise's $6.4 billion Liberty Global deal,"By Oliver Hirt and Angelika Gruber
ZURICH (Reuters) - Sunrise Communications Group (S:SRCG) bowed to investor pressure on Tuesday and scrapped its 6.3 billion Swiss franc ($6.39 billion) acquisition of Liberty Global's (O:LBTYA) Swiss cable business UPC.
The Swiss telecommunications group had battled to save the deal in the face of opposition from its biggest shareholder, Germany's  Freenet  (DE:FNTGn) that holds 25% of its stock.
Sunrise will now focus on going it alone, its top managers said, stressing that its dividend was not at risk from a 50 million Swiss franc break fee it owes Liberty Global, set up by U.S. cable pioneer John Malone.
It cancelled an extraordinary shareholder meeting (EGM) planned for Wednesday to approve a 2.8 billion franc cash call needed to finance the UPC deal, avoiding an embarrassing defeat on the measure.
""The board of directors of Sunrise has concluded that the clear majority of shareholders who have registered their shares to vote at the EGM do not support the capital increase,"" it said, citing shareholder indications and opposition from Freenet.
Freenet and other investors had opposed the rights issue even in its scaled-down form.
""We regret cancelling the EGM. We have spent a significant amount of time engaging with our shareholders and continue to believe in the compelling strategic and financial rationale of the acquisition,"" Sunrise Chairman Peter Kurer said.
It said it cancelled the EGM with Liberty Global's consent.
Although the share purchase agreement technically remains in force until late February, Sunrise made clear the deal was effectively dead.
""Management is now really focused on implementing the standalone strategy. We respect the decision of the shareholders,"" Chief Executive Olaf Swantee told Reuters, adding he did not expect to resume negotiations with Liberty Global.
TOO EXPENSIVE
Some Sunrise investors had said the price tag for UPC was too expensive and raised concerns that Liberty Global was not taking part in the deal.
Liberty Global this month offered to buy up to 500 million Swiss francs in new Sunrise shares as a way of easing through the capital hike needed to clinch the sale.
""The existing share purchase agreement between the parties will remain in place with some minor amendments, including the flexibility to convene a new EGM and certain adjusted termination rights,"" Liberty Global said on Tuesday.
Sunrise shares, which had fallen more than 10% this year, gained 2.3% to 79.35 francs by late morning.
Vontobel analysts said the collapse of the deal was a missed opportunity to consolidate the Swiss telecom market, dominated by state-controlled  Swisscom  (S:SCMN). 
""We expected a less promotional environment post the transaction among the smaller operators, which is now likely to continue. Nonetheless, we continue to expect Sunrise taking market share in mobile and continue its attractive dividend policy,"" they said in a research note.
But they removed the 50% acquisition synergies it had included in its valuation and lowered its price target to 85 francs.

1416,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 05:22AM ET</span>",StockBeat: UBS Rides Out Low Rate Environment With Solid Wealth Unit,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- The big bank earnings season in Europe got under way Tuesday, a week after Wall Street’s mixed bag left them with their best chance in ages of not looking shoddy by comparison.
UBS Group (SIX:UBSG) took up the challenge with gusto, announcing that it pulled in $15.7 billion in new money to its wealth management unit in the three months to September. That’s the key figure because the Swiss-based group has placed an increasingly concentrated bet on managing the money of the world’s richest people. Sadly for the rest of the sector, because wealth management is an area where UBS is uniquely strong for UBS, there's no obvious read-across for the rest of the sector.
It's still a pleasant enough situation for Iqbal Khan, the star banker who joined UBS as head of wealth management and heir apparent to CEO Sergio Ermotti at the start of October, to be arriving in. Khan and co-head Tom Naratil are due to present their ideas for taking the unit to the next stage by December, Ermotti told Bloomberg on Tuesday.
The bank was also able to post a $24 billion increase in net assets at its asset management unit, which takes care of the not-so-ultra-rich’s money. That, too, is something of an achievement in an increasingly challenging landscape for traditional money managers.
The bank’s shares rose 2.1% in response to the news initially, but soon pared them as the market digested the less pleasant elements of the release. Those included another $100 million to restructure a shrinking securities business, part of an investment bank that focuses on Asia and Europe rather than the healthier markets of North America.
Additionally, the bank warned that “low and persistent negative interest rates and expectations of further monetary easing will adversely affect net interest income compared with last year.”
There, at least, is a theme that one can confidently see recurring in other European bank earnings over the next couple of weeks.
By 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), UBS was up 1.2%, outperforming most of its peers, on a morning when most European markets were heading sideways or drifting lower amid lingering doubts on the ability of the U.K. to stop itself sailing on to the rocks of a Hard Brexit. The Euro Stoxx 600, which hit a 17-month high on Monday, was down 0.3% at 393.66, while the German DAX was flat and the FTSE 100 was up 0.2% as the pound slid ahead of the latest attempt by the U.K. parliament to approve an EU withdrawal bill. A vote is due after the European market close later."

The Renault-Nissan partnership was rocked by former alliance boss Carlos Ghosn's arrest in Tokyo almost a year ago on financial misconduct charges, which he denies. 
The two firms are still trying to repair relations, including through recent management overhauls, to focus again on combined efforts to cut costs and invest in new technologies - among the pressing issues thrown into sharp relief by a Renault (PA:RENA) profit warning last week.
""My obsession is for the alliance to take off in 2020,"" Senard told France Inter radio. 
""If, by 2020, we don't manage to start extracting ... all the potential of this alliance, I'll consider it to be a failure, on a personal level and by our teams.""
Senard did not give further details. 
But he added that other matters, such as attempting to revive merger talks with Fiat Chrysler (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU), which were abandoned in June, were secondary to the industrial projects Renault and Nissan needed to work on. 
""Today, it's not on the table,"" Senard said of a Fiat deal. 
He added reducing Renault's 43.3% stake in Nissan, which could help improve relations, was also not top of his list. 
""Nothing can ever be excluded, (but) this is not what we're focused on,"" Senard said.
Senard was parachuted in from tyre maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP) in early 2019 to help steady Renault, which is 15% owned by the French state.
Earlier this month, the carmaker ousted CEO Thierry Bollore, a former Ghosn protegee known for having a strained relationship with Nissan, as it tries to wipe the slate clean with its Japanese partner. 
""I discovered an alliance in worse shape than I'd imagined ... this takes time to mend,"" Senard said. 

Renault, which said last week it was reviewing some mid-term targets, is due to release more details about its third quarter performance on Oct. 25.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares edged lower on Tuesday as talk of progress in China-U.S. trade talks was offset by mixed corporate earnings, while sterling retreated ahead of another vote on Brexit.
The broad European STOXX (STOXX) slipped 0.3%, and MSCI's world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was flat at 0.02% lower.
French speciality minerals company  Imerys  (PA:IMTP) slipped 6% after cutting its outlook for 2019, and Norway's Aker BP (OL:AKERBP) moved marginally lower as it slashed its full-year oil output target.
British household goods maker  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) was stranded at the base of the STOXX index with a 5% fall after it cut its full-year sales forecast for the second time this year.
In Switzerland, drugmaker  Novartis  (S:NOVN) raised its 2019 target and reported better-than-expected revenue, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier AMS (S:AMS) climbed 6% as demand from smartphone makers boosted operating profit.
Shares of UBS (S:UBSG) led gains among banking stocks (SX7P) after Switzerland's biggest bank reported a smaller than expected loss in quarterly profit.
Swedish defence firm Saab (ST:SAABb) gained 7% to lead the STOXX 600 after reporting third-quarter operating earnings well ahead of market forecasts and affirming its view that operating cashflow this year would improve versus 2018.
""This week is an important week for earnings,"" said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments. ""We've seen a lot of talk on Brexit and trade talks and the new news is the earnings and the signal they give for the future. We've broadly priced in that earnings will be slightly positive for the year, but everyone is seeing how monetary policy stabilises the situation.""
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) slipped 0.14%.
TRADE TALKS, BREXIT VOTES
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) added a modest 0.4%, with a holiday in Tokyo keeping turnover light. 
China and the United States have achieved some progress in their trade talks, Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said on Tuesday, adding that as long as both sides respected each other, no problem could not be resolved.
U.S. President Donald Trump sounded upbeat on a China deal on Monday, while White House adviser Larry Kudlow said tariffs on Chinese goods scheduled for December could be withdrawn if talks go well.
Meanwhile, euro zone government bonds dipped before votes in Britain's parliament crucial to determining whether the country can leave the EU in an orderly way at the end of the month.
Ten-year government bond yields across the euro zone were down 1 basis point on the day (DE10YT=RR), (NL10YT=RR), (FR10YT=RR). Germany's 10-year yield was at -0.35%, near three-month highs.
After he was forced by opponents into asking the EU for a delay that he had promised he would never ask for, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is battling to push legislation through the House of Commons that will enact his last-minute Brexit deal. Lawmakers vote around 1800 GMT on the 115-page Withdrawal Agreement Bill and then vote on the government's extremely tight timetable for approving the legislation.
Sterling slipped 0.1% to $1.2947  in early London trading. It was flat against the euro, and was last trading against the single currency at 0.86050 (EURGBP=D3).
""If the House of Commons votes in favour of the deal, GBP/USD could rally towards $1.3500 over the medium term. The UK would then enter a transition period that lasts until 31 December 2020,"" said Kim Mundy, a currency strategist at CBA.
The Canadian dollar  was little changed as the ruling Liberal government of Justin Trudeau held onto power but with a minority government after a closely fought election.
In commodity markets, spot gold inched 0.2% higher to $1,487.20 per ounce .

Oil prices edged lower as the market fretted about the health of the global economy and the future for energy demand. Brent crude (LCOc1) futures were down 10 cents at $58.86, while U.S. crude (CLc1) lost 12 cents to $53.19 a barrel.

1419,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 04:55AM ET</span>","Uniqlo ad sparks protest, parody as South Korea-Japan dispute flares","By Sangmi Cha
SEOUL (Reuters) - A commercial by Japanese clothing brand Uniqlo has stirred a consumer backlash in South Korea amid accusations that it mocks victims of wartime forced labour and brothel workers, reopening deep wounds from Japan's colonial past.
A YouTube video created by a South Korean student parodying the ad has gone viral and protesters have targeted Uniqlo stores, demanding an apology from the company.
In the Uniqlo commercial, Iris Apfel, a 97-year-old American style icon with more than 1.4 million Instagram followers, is in an animated conversation with 12-year-old fashion designer Kheris Rogers.
When Rogers asks how she used to dress as a teenager, Apfel says: ""I can't remember that far back!""
Instead of a literal translation of that line, the commercial that aired in South Korea carried subtitles saying: ""Gosh! How can I remember something that goes back 80 years?""
Gaining more than 101,000 views in two days, the 19-second parody video posted on Saturday depicts a likeness of the Uniqlo TV commercial, which the company began airing this month in South Korea and other markets.
In the parody, South Korean college student Youn Dong-hyeun stands with Yang Geum-deok, a 90-year-old woman who had been a forced labourer for Japan's Mitsubishi during World War Two.
Youn, a history major, asks how hard it was for Yang when she was young. ""It is impossible to ever forget that awfully painful memory,"" she replies. Youn has posted the video with subtitles in English and Japanese.
Uniqlo, owned by Japan's Fast Retailing Co Ltd, pulled the ad in South Korea on Saturday.
""There was no intention to touch on the issue of comfort women or the South Korea-Japan dispute,"" a Uniqlo official in Seoul told Reuters, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation.
""Comfort women"" is a euphemism for girls and women, many of them Korean, who were forced to work in Japan's wartime brothels.
Relations between the two countries are at their poorest in decades after a ruling by South Korea's top court last year ordering Japan's Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to compensate wartime forced labourers.
In July, Japan tightened controls on exports of three key high-tech materials to South Korea. Seoul accused Tokyo of taking the step in retaliation to the court ruling, prompting a wide-ranging boycott of Japanese products.
""WE REMEMBER""
South Korea and Japan share a bitter history dating to the Japanese colonisation of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, including the use of comfort women.
South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon travelled to Japan on Tuesday to attend Emperor Naruhito's enthronement ceremony on behalf of President Moon Jae-in.
Lee's office said he planned to meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday, which would be the highest-level contact between the two countries since July's export curbs.
Uniqlo has already seen its South Korean sales hit and a sharp drop in customers at its stores as part of the boycott.
The translation for the ad's subtitles, which was carried out in South Korea, was meant to help convey the message of the original commercial, the official said. She declined to identify who had performed the translation.
Student protesters took to the streets as the outcry against the commercial grew, demanding an official apology from Uniqlo.
Bang Seulkichan, 22, was among those picketing a Uniqlo store in Seoul, holding a sign that read: “Colonial rule 80 years ago – we remember!”
Park Young-sun, South Korea's minister for small and medium enterprises, told a parliament committee on Monday the ad controversy was ""very upsetting""."

(Reuters) - European shares fell on Tuesday as investors sifted through a mixed bag of corporate earnings and eyed latest developments on U.S.-China trade talks and Britain's progress towards some form of orderly departure from the European Union.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX), which opened slightly positive, was down 0.3% by 0810 GMT, with France's CAC 40 (FCHI) lagging the most among major country indices.
British household goods maker  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) was the biggest drag on STOXX, slipping to its lowest level in more than one-and-a-half years after it cut full-year sales forecast for the second time this year.
""We've had a disappointment from  Danone  last week and Reckitt-Benckiser today on the consumer side,"" said Mark Peden, investment manager, equities at Kames Capital.
""Because of trade issues and manufacturing data, it looks as if expectations had gone a bit too negative for the industrial side and a bit too positive for the consumer side, which is why we're seeing a bit of a mixed shift in the market.""
Last week, the world's biggest yoghurt maker Danone (PA:DANO) had cut its 2019 sales growth target, while auto maker  Renault  (PA:RENA) and truckmaker Volvo (ST:VOLVb) issued dour profit forecasts amid a broad-based slump in auto sales.
Among other disappointments, French specialty minerals company  Imerys  (PA:IMTP) slipped 10% after cutting its 2019 outlook, while Norway's Aker BP (OL:AKERBP) moved 2% lower as it slashed its full-year oil output target.
Switzerland's SSMI index (SSMI), which had earlier bucked the gloomy trend, fell 0.4%, weighed down by Roche (S:ROG) shares on reports that UK's competition watchdog launched a merger inquiry into a proposed Roche-Spark Therapeutics Inc (O:ONCE) deal.
The tech sector (SX8P) outperformed with  Logitech  International's (S:LOGN) 2% climb after the Swiss computer keyboard and gaming accessories maker reported a 4.5% increase in operating income for its latest quarter.
Shares of UBS (S:UBSG) led gains among banking stocks (SX7P) after Switzerland's biggest bank reported a smaller-than-expected loss in quarterly profit.
Shares of  Just Eat  (L:JE) jumped 22% to top the STOXX 600 index after Prosus (AX:PRX) announced its bid to buy the food delivery company.
BREXIT ANXIETY
London's FTSE 100 (FTSE) and Dublin's ISEQ (ISEQ) were trading lower along with the pound ahead of a vote in British parliament, which is crucial in determining whether the UK can leave the EU in an orderly way at the end of the month.
Lawmakers will first vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and then on the government's tight timetable for approving the legislation, but analysts say much of the optimism around Brexit is already priced in and expect subdued reactions."

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Gojek's ex-CEO and co-founder Nadiem Makarim, who is leaving the Indonesian ride-hailing and payments company to join President Joko Widodo's cabinet, will keep his stake but without any advisory or executive role, a Gojek spokesman said on Tuesday.
""He will be a passive shareholder. No role within the business and no influence on the company,"" the spokesman said, noting the ex-CEO would not sit on the company's board. 
He declined to specify the size of Makarim's stake in Gojek, which is backed by tech giants Google and Tencent among others.
Gojek said on Monday that its president Andre Soelistyo and the other co-founder Kevin Aluwi would replace Makarim as co-CEOs.
Makarim, 35, told reporters on Monday that he had resigned from running operations at Gojek, which is valued at $10 billion.
He said it was a ""a big honour to be able to join the cabinet"" and that his specific role would be announced by Widodo later in the week. 
Indonesian media have linked Makarim to a possible cabinet post in a new digital economy ministry or in education. 
Gojek raised over $1 billion earlier this year from backers including Alphabet's Google (O:GOOGL) and Chinese tech giants Tencent (HK:0700) and JD (O:JD). 
The company said in a statement on Tuesday that its ongoing series F fundraising round was ""set to raise well over $2 billion"". 
Having evolved from a ride-hailing service founded in 2010 to a one-stop app allowing users to make online payments and order food and services such as massages, Gojek is now targeting a larger slice of the Southeast Asian market, where Softbank-rival Grab currently dominates ride-sharing.
Representatives from Gojek backers including tech giants Google and Tencent as well as American global investor firm KKR expressed support for the new leadership in the statement.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Apple (O:AAPL) supplier AMS (S:AMS) beat expectations with a 41% jump in third-quarter revenue on Tuesday and forecast further strong demand for its optical sensors from smartphone makers as it takes aim at a takeover of German lighting maker Osram (DE:OSRn).
Revenue of $645 million topped its own forecast of $610-640 million and AMS said it expected a figure of $610-$650 million in the fourth quarter.
AMS' Swiss-listed shares, which gapped higher at the open, were down 0.9% at 0810 GMT.
Its adjusted EBIT margin was 28% and AMS said it expected to at least maintain this level in the fourth quarter.
Operating cash flow increased more than threefold to $299 million, and AMS's backlog stood at $253.1 million end-September.
""AMS delivered even stronger results than expected and the outlook for the fourth-quarter also confirms the very solid business momentum not just with Apple but also the Android ecosystem,"" Vontobel analysts said in a note to clients.
AMS's main revenue source is optical sensors and Apple, its top customer, uses the Austrian firm's 3D facial recognition technology in its latest iPhones.
Apple accounts for around 40% of group revenue, analysts estimate.
CEO Alexander Everke's next aim is a takeover of Osram to combine AMS's expertise in sensors with the German firm's lighting know-how.
Everke's first attempt failed this month as AMS secured 51.6% support from Osram shareholders, short of the required 62.5%.
Under a new bid, its offer price stays at 41 euros per share, valuing Osram at 4.6 billion euros ($5.1 billion), but with a lowered acceptance rate of 55%.
Private equity groups Bain and Advent informed Osram on Friday that they would refrain from a takeover bid for the time being, and AMS hopes that will convince investors to tender their shares.
But sources familiar with the groups' thinking told Reuters on Sunday that they were waiting in the wings and could revive their approach if AMS's bid failed.
AMS plans to take on billions of new debt to take over Osram.
AMS ""feels confident about the new takeover offer for Osram... as it is financially attractive, strategically compelling and the viable option for Osram shareholders,"" it said.
Subject to the German financial watchdog Bafin's approval, the offer period is expected to begin this month, AMS said.
Last year the company was hit by production delays and initially slow demand for Apple's iPhone X series last year, but this year has been positive with iPhone 11 models and higher demand from Android phone makers including Samsung (KS:005930), and China's  Xiaomi  (HK:1810) and Huawei ."

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS (S:UBSG) is axing high-paying investment banking staff after a disappointing performance at the division prompted a 16% slide in third-quarter net profit and put the group's 2019 profit goals further out of reach.
Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti, credited for rapidly turning UBS around after the financial crisis, announced a further $90 million in expected annual cost savings at the investment bank on Tuesday, following a prolonged performance dip which Ermotti described as unsatisfying even given a tough market.
An earnings beat in its core global wealth management unit helped offset a 59% adjusted profit decline in its investment bank, putting the group's third-quarter net earnings of $1.05 billion ahead of analyst expectations.
Ermotti is running up against a number of headwinds in UBS's core markets, as wealthy clients hold back from trading, negative rates eat into margins and investment banking activity remains muted.
The bank's share price is down 16% over the past year, hitting a six-year low in August and edging back towards the level it was when Ermotti took charge in 2011.
In its investment bank a fall in M&A work meant its advisory revenue fell 21%, while equity and debt capital markets income were down 22% and 15% respectively. On the trading side equities revenue fell 7%, while foreign exchange, rates and credit revenue was steadier with just a 1% fall.
UBS said it expects to take restructuring expenses of around $100 million in the fourth quarter related to structural changes it is making to the business, run by co-heads Piero Novelli and Robert Karofsky.
Measures include streamlining and merging its securities and trading activities and reducing headcount.
OPERATIONAL GROWTH
The bank brought in net new money of $15.7 billion in its flagship wealth management business, as a sizeable jump in transaction-based income for the unit, newly under the joint management of long-time wealth management co-head Tom Naratil and former  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) star Iqbal Khan, saw a sizeable jump in transaction-based income, helped restore operational growth.
Shares in UBS opened 1.9% higher on wealth management strength.
While the group last year announced targets for a 15% return on common equity for the year and a 77% adjusted cost/income ratio, Ermotti in March hinted the bank faced a steep climb to attain the profitability increase implied by the targets.
Its return on common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital slid to 12.1% in the third quarter, bringing the return down to 13.8% for the first nine months, compared with 16.3% over the first nine months of 2018.
The bank's net interest income fell 8% from a year ago, as negative interest rates in Switzerland and the euro zone made their mark."

The S&P BSE Sensex declined 0.3% to 39,186.62 as of 10:04 a.m. in Mumbai. The NSE Nifty 50 Index rose 0.1%. Infosys sank as much as 16%, weighing the most on both gauges and offsetting post-earning gains in   HDFC Bank Ltd  . (NS:HDBK) and   Reliance Industries   Ltd. (NS:RELI).
Infosys Ltd. plunged after a letter addressed to company’s board and published by the Deccan Herald newspaper charged the company Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh of “unethical practices” in recent quarters to boost “short term revenues and profits.”
The company, to ensure independence in investigations, has recused the company’s CEO and CFO from the matter, Infosys Chairman Nandan Nilekani said in a statement to stock exchanges.
Of the 10 Nifty companies that have announced results so far, six have either met or exceeded analyst estimates. Today, private sector lenders Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank are scheduled to announce results.

“We expect the Infosys whistle-blower complaint to be negative for market sentiment. We await developments on the investigation as corporate governance issues are serious,” said Naveen Kulkarni, analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd.“The issue (Infosys complaint) is likely to remain an overhang on the stock in the near-term given it raises questions over the credibility of the current management,” Arya Sen and Ankur Pant, analysts with Jefferies India Pvt Ltd. wrote in note.The Numbers

Far from it.
While indexes of stocks, bonds and currencies hover around their strongest levels since early August, political crises from Ecuador and Argentina to Turkey, South Africa and -- most recently -- Chile and Lebanon are reminding investors of the risk of getting too deep in some of the highest-yielding markets.
For David Levy, chairman of the Jerome Levy Forecasting Center, the combination of the clamor for higher returns and ballooning debt levels in the developing world is reminiscent of the U.S. housing market before the global financial crisis.
“This cycle’s asset bubble is the emerging-market sector,” Levy said. “In the next recession there will be serious problems for emerging markets.”
PODCAST: How Exploding Private Sector Balance Sheets Have Changed Recessions As We Know Them
The turmoil was underscored on Monday when Chile, which has Latin America’s highest-rated debt, was engulfed in protests. That prompted the government to declare a state of emergency, triggering a 1.9% drop in the peso and a 4.6% fall in its stocks.
Ecuadorian protests, meantime, escalated after President Lenin Moreno ended fuel subsidies. In Argentina, investors are on edge ahead of a presidential vote on Sunday that’s expected to hand victory to leftist candidate Alberto Fernandez. And in Lebanon, dollar yields just soared to 24% as the government struggled to quell demonstrations against worsening economic conditions.
Eurobond sales from emerging markets this year have already exceeded the volume raised in all of 2018, as borrowers take advantage of high demand for their debt. Issuance in dollars and euros from governments and companies in developing nations has reached $525 billion, a 20% increase over the same period last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“There seems to be fatigue among investors with the geopolitical risk in emerging markets,” said Sergey Dergachev, senior portfolio manager at Union Investment in Frankfurt. “They are trying to look beyond the barrage of headlines about politics, demonstrations, sanctions. But ignore these for long and you may be hurt badly.”

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU (Reuters) -  Infosys  Ltd (NS:INFY) (N:INFY) said it was investigating whistleblower claims accusing its top two executives of ""unethical practices"" to boost short-term profit, sending its shares to their worst intraday fall in over six years.
The allegations were part of a letter dated Sept. 20, seen by Reuters, which said Chief Executive Officer Salil Parikh and Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy engaged in forced revenue recognition from large contracts and did not adhere to accounting standards.
Chairman Nandan Nilekani said in a statement on Tuesday that India's No.2 software services exporter placed the complaints before the audit committee on Oct. 10, and before the non-executive members of the board on Oct. 11.
The letter, signed by ""Ethical Employees"" who claim to be part of Infosys, also alleged irregularities with large deal approvals and said Roy directed certain people to make wrong assumptions on deals to show margins.
""Several billion dollar deals of last few quarters have nil margin,"" the letter said.
The allegations come just two years after Infosys endured a shake up that saw its then top boss Vishal Sikka leave the company.
The complaints are being dealt with in an objective manner, and Parekh and Roy were not part of the investigations to ensure independence, Nilekani said.
One of the complaints ""largely deals with allegations relating to the CEO's international travel to the U.S. and Mumbai,"" Nilekani added. Parekh did not respond to Reuters' request for a comment. Shares of the Bengaluru-based company tanked as much as 16%, its biggest intraday percentage fall since April 2013. The fall wiped out 470 billion rupees ($6.63 billion) in market capitalization, which was at 2.79 trillion rupees as of 1220 local time (0650 GMT). ""There will be overhang on the stock until there is clarity, Infosys is the blue-eyed boy as far as corporate governance is concerned... two complaints in two years could shake investor confidence, at least temporarily,"" said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities.  The Economic Times first reported the details of the letter on Monday.

1429,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 03:23AM ET</span>","Australia panel backs tougher oversight of airport costs, won't control pricing","By Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Australia's Productivity Commission on Tuesday said airport operators should be required to provide more information to the competition regulator on their service costs but stopped short of recommending pricing controls or intervening in disputes. 
Airlines had argued that more oversight was needed to keep a lid on rising access fees that have helped drive the profit margins of Australia's largely monopoly airports to rank among the world's highest, according to carrier-sponsored research.
The current light-handed regime, in which the government cannot regulate airport fees or even intervene in disputes over them, remains valid, according to a final report issued after a 16-month battle between airports and airlines.
Airlines for Australia & New Zealand (A4ANZ), which represents the interests of airlines, said it would urge the government not to adopt the report recommendations, citing significant risks of worsening disputes and court cases that would be damaging for travelers and the Australian economy.
""The existing system provides no constraint on monopoly airport behavior,"" A4ANZ Chairman Graeme Samuel said in a statement, arguing that an independent arbitration system was needed.
The government panel did recommend that Australia's largest airports should be required to report their revenues and costs from providing domestic and international services to airlines and to remove anti-competitive clauses from contracts with airlines. 
The commission did not rule out recommending harsher regulations in future, including areas such as pricing, if airports were found to have abused their market power.

St. James’s Place (LON:SJP) reported 2.11 billion pounds in net new money for the third quarter, down a little from 2.47 a year earlier. Funds under management are now up 18% year-to-date. 
""In what remains an uncertain external environment, these figures once again highlight the resilience of our business model,"" CEO Andrew Croft said, adding that the company remains ""well positioned to continue to grow over the medium to long-term.""

  Whitbread   (LON:WTB) reported flat revenue and a 5.4% increase in adjusted per share earnings for the first half of its fiscal year ending in March 2020. It upheld its guidance as regards its expansion in Germany, where it said ""we continue to look for ways to accelerate our ambitions.""
However, the U.K. outlook is ""challenging, with business confidence remaining weak and leisure confidence in decline, coinciding with heightened political and economic uncertainty, which has continued into the third quarter of FY20,"" it said. ""This has impacted hotel domestic demand, particularly in the regional market, where 80% of Premier Inn hotels are located. There has also been a greater decline in short-lead discretionary bookings, which tend to be at higher price points."" 
""With this uncertainty, it is difficult to predict how business confidence and business investment will evolve in the second half of FY20 and into FY21.""

  Reckitt Benckiser   (LON:RB)r cut its full-year revenue forecast for 2019 to at most 2%, after a gain of only 1.6% in like-for-like sales in the third quarter. It blamed a weak performance by its health division. It also said it's losing market share in infant nutrition in China, where birth rates have slowed in the last two years.
  Anglo American   (LON:AAL) said its copper output this year would be at the lower end of expectations due to a chronic drought in Chile that also threatens next year’s production. AA also reported a 14% drop in diamond output at its De Beers subsidiary. These negative factors were offset by the successful ramp up of its iron ore mine at Minas-Rio in Brazil. The company said it’s “broadly on track” to deliver its full-year production targets

  Bunzl   (LON:BNZL) reported currency-adjusted revenue grew 0.5% in the third quarter. Sterling weakness bumped that up to a 4% increase in reported terms. ""The Group's expectations for the year ending 31 December 2019 remain unchanged with overall trading consistent with the slowing underlying revenue growth indicated in previous announcements this year due to the impact of the continued mixed macroeconomic and market conditions across the countries and sectors in which the Group operates.""
Underlying revenue fell by 1%, while acquisitions added 1.5% in sales. It said its M&A pipeline remains ""active and a number of ongoing discussions are taking place.""

1433,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 01:56AM ET</span>",Canadian dollar holds near three-month high after Trudeau election win; no relief for energy stocks,"By Fergal Smith
TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar held near a three-month high on Tuesday as the market took in stride the prospect of a re-elected Liberal government, although some investors worried about the Liberals' need to rely on a left-leaning opposition party for support.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals are set to form a minority government after a tight election on Monday, with the latest tally from Elections Canada showing Liberals had won or were leading in 155 out of 338 seats.
A minority government leaves Trudeau in a weakened position and needing the support of a party such as the New Democrats (NDP) to push through key pieces of legislation.
""This is likely to exert drag on a Canadian dollar that might otherwise ride solid economic data, favorable interest rate differentials, and improving risk appetite higher,"" said Karl Schamotta, director global markets strategy at Cambridge Global Payments.
The Canadian dollar was trading nearly unchanged at 1.3082 to the U.S. dollar. The currency, which was boosted on Monday by signs of progress toward a resolution of the trade dispute between the United States and China, notched its strongest intraday level since July 22 at 1.3071.
The loonie has been the top-performing G10 currency this year, up more than 4% against the greenback.
The NDP has said it would increase corporate income tax rates and implement a wealth tax. It has also indicated its opposition to the expansion of a flagship oil pipeline, Trans Mountain.
""I expect limited stock market reaction on this outcome, energy stocks won't get any relief bounce on this news and should see a further deterioration in sentiment towards the space,"" Mike Archibald, associate portfolio manager at AGF Investments Inc.
The energy sector has the second largest weighting on Toronto's benchmark stock index (GSPTSE) at about 16%.
""In this scenario, pipeline approval would likely have a tough time passing, putting further pressure on Canadian energy stocks,"" Archibald added.
Canada is the world's fourth-biggest producer of crude and the energy industry accounts for about 11% of annual nominal gross domestic product.
Still, the economy could get a boost from additional fiscal spending. Trudeau has said he would nearly double the deficit from C$14 billion ($10.7 billion) in the fiscal year that ended in March.
""This likely suggests no major changes in the economic outlook, although the minority government will impel them (the Liberals) to agree to some of the policy priorities of the NDP — pointing to somewhat looser fiscal policy,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.
""We were likely headed in that direction in any event, based on the campaign pledges, but the minority situation will accentuate that trend."""

1436,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 11:07PM ET</span>",Chevron Wins Venezuela Waiver Extension As Sanctions Bite,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration extended  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX).’s waiver to operate in Venezuela, allowing the second-largest U.S. oil explorer to keep its toehold in the crisis-stricken Latin American nation as U.S. sanctions severely restrict crude exports.
The 90-day reprieve lets Chevron continue its role as the last major U.S. oil producer in the country until Jan. 22. The Treasury Department on Monday also extended waivers for four U.S. oil services providers: Baker Hughes Co., Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co., Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) Ltd. and Weatherford International Ltd.
The extension is the first granted since Trump fired former National Security Advisor John Bolton, who was seen as a vocal opponent of granting exceptions for U.S. companies doing business in Venezuela. Perhaps tellingly, Monday’s waiver was granted four days ahead of expiration, compared with a gap of just hours last time around.
Chevron’s joint ventures in the country are with Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the national oil company and the lifeblood of President Nicolas Maduro’s regime. There’s a desire within parts of the U.S. government to maintain some level of American presence in Venezuela’s oil industry in the event of a political transition. The U.S. and dozens of other countries recognize National Assembly President Juan Guaido as the nation’s rightful leader.
“It looks like they’ve convinced the Trump administration that this is something that needs to be done every 90 days,” said Muhammed Ghulam, a Houston-based analyst at Raymond James & Associates. “I don’t see much lobbying now on the other side of the issue.”
While Venezuela only accounted for 1% of Chevron’s global crude production last year, it remains strategically important as home to the world’s largest oil reserves. In recent months, Chevron made the case to the Trump administration that if it were to leave, its Venezuelan assets could easily be turned over to another operator with little effect on overall production. That could mean the state, or even Russian or Chinese interests, would benefit.
Hardliners, Pragmatists
“This seems again like a compromise between hardliners who wanted maximum pressure and pragmatists who believed that not renewing the license would not lead to regime change and just open spaces for the Russians to fill,” said Francisco Monaldi, a lecturer in energy economics at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy. “It seems pragmatism is prevailing.”
Venezuela’s crude exports have been crippled by U.S. sanctions, falling to a 70-year low of 495,000 barrels a day in September, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. The policy’s apparent success is another reason why removing Chevron wouldn’t have much effect on the Maduro regime, according to Monaldi.
“Sanctions have been so effective in reducing sales that producing more is not necessarily going to help” Maduro, he said.
Chevron’s near-century of operations in Venezuela included the crucial discovery of the Boscan field in the 1940s. The California-based driller has outlasted many other oil companies, including  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)., which left after a series of industry nationalizations during Hugo Chavez’s time as president.
Keeping a Toehold
As it stands now, the U.S. oil service companies have no desire to broaden beyond the tiny presence they’re maintaining in Venezuela, J. David Anderson, an analyst at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), wrote in an email. But the extension of the U.S. waiver allowing them to remain is ultimately helpful.
“It’s important to keep a toehold in the country in the event of a change of government down the road,” Anderson wrote. “If the government does change, it will be a massive opportunity for major oil companies and they will need all the help they can get” for service providers.
Venezuela’s oil output has fallen from a high of 3.7 million barrels a day in 1970 to less than 700,000 today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

1438,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 09:47PM ET</span>",Fallout from money manager Kenneth Fisher's remarks tops $1 billion in lost assets,"By Tim McLaughlin and Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Fallout from Kenneth Fisher's alleged insensitive remarks about women escalated on Friday when a large Iowa pension plan cut ties with the money manager, whose firm has lost more than $1 billion in assets under management in the last week.
The Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System was the latest to notify Fisher Investments that it will terminate its contract with his firm. Fisher Investments manages $386 million of IPERS' $34 billion trust fund.
Iowa joins pension funds run for Boston, the state of Michigan and Philadelphia in cutting ties with Fisher.
""IPERS staff has taken time to evaluate this situation, and it is our opinion that Mr Fisher's comments have damaged the credibility of the firm and its leadership,"" the Iowa pension plan said in a statement.
""As a result, the risk to IPERS is that the firm could lose investment talent, and/or it may be unable to recruit high caliber talent in the future. Furthermore, the negative publicity will probably continue to be a major distraction to Fisher investment personnel.""
Fisher Investments did not immediately comment.
In a video posted Oct. 9 on Twitter, Alex Chalekian, chief executive of a financial advisory firm, called attention to comments Fisher made at a financial conference last week.
Chalekian said Fisher made derogatory comments about genitalia, picking up girls and financier Jeffrey Epstein, among other topics. Epstein committed suicide in August while in jail awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
In a memo to his firm's employees sent to Reuters earlier this week by a spokesman, Fisher said: ""It pains me to know that my comments have caused you grief, concern, and indignation. I sincerely apologize.""
SEI Investments Co on Friday said it was reviewing its business relationship with Fisher.
SEI serves as a trustee and sponsor on investment portfolios managed by Fisher for dozens of retirement plans that have included Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) and Co, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota and Nextera Energy Inc, according to U.S. Department of Labor disclosures.
""The comments made do not reflect SEI or our core values,"" the company said in a statement. ""As the trustee of certain trusts advised by (Fisher), our fiduciary duty requires us to focus on and protect the interests of the investors in those trusts. We are engaged in a due diligence review of (Fisher) and will make decisions that we believe to be in the best interests of investors after that process concludes.""
Several other clients of Fisher, including Fidelity Investments, have said they are reviewing whether to keep his firm as a money manager.
The Kansas City Public School Retirement System, which has $78 million with Fisher Investments, will also review its relationship with the firm, Executive Director Christine Gierer said on Friday.
Gierer said she expects the situation will be discussed at the system's next board meeting, on Nov. 4.
Fisher's setbacks come in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which has exposed widespread sexual harassment or abuse of women in multiple spheres of American life and ended the careers of dozens of powerful men in media, politics, entertainment and business."

The bankrupt Californian power producer said the latest cuts were intended to avoid its equipment sparking wildfires in hot weather.
""This afternoon, the company began its 48-hour advance notifications to customers that it may be proactively turning power off for safety and conducting a Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) on late Wednesday evening,"" it said.
The power cutoffs may affect 15 California counties and are likely to be much smaller in scope than the Oct. 9-12 PSPS event, the company said.
It activated its emergency operations on Sunday night because of a possible strong and dry offshore wind.
The primary phase of weather risk was expected to last about 18 to 24 hours from Wednesday evening through the middle of Thursday, PG&E had said on Sunday.
The company's handling of recent power outages has been criticized for being too widespread, with insufficient communication with customers.
The outages are the latest in a string of events for which PG&E has been widely criticized. The utility filed for bankruptcy in January, citing potential civil liabilities in excess of $30 billion from major wildfires linked to its transmission wires and other equipment.
The notifications to customers about the upcoming power cutoffs left many of them frustrated, with some complaining on social media.
""I just got notified PG&E may turn off my power again this Wednesday!! They just turned it off 10 days ago for 3 days!! This can't go on!! Power is a necessity not a luxury,"" a customer said on Twitter.
Another resident tweeted: ""It's causing anxiety and money every single time. I work from home and this is impacting my ability to do my job."""
1440,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 09:16PM ET</span>",Rio Tinto studying ways to produce lithium from waste rock at California mine,"By Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) -  Rio Tinto  Plc (L:RIO) is studying ways to extract lithium from waste rock at a mine it controls in California, making it the latest company trying to produce the battery metal in the United States for the fast-growing electric vehicle market.
The move by Rio comes as U.S. politicians and regulators push to expand domestic mining of so-called strategic minerals used to make EV batteries and other high-tech equipment. China is the world's largest producer and consumer of many of these minerals.
Rio has produced borates - a group of minerals used to make soaps, cosmetics and other consumer goods - for nearly a century in the Mojave Desert, about 120 miles (195 km) north of Los Angeles.
That has left behind decades' worth of waste rock, known in the industry as tailings. Rio said it had been probing the tailings for gold and discovered lithium at a concentration higher than rival U.S. projects under development, although the company declined to give the exact percentage.
""The material being used has already been mined, so this will be a low-energy option for the production of lithium,"" Bold Baatar, Rio's chief executive of energy and minerals, said in a statement to Reuters.
The company is spending $10 million to build a pilot plant that will extract the white metal using a heat-and-leaching process involving a kiln heated to 1,740°F (949°C).
The pilot plant will only produce about 10 tonnes annually. If that step is successful, Rio said it would consider spending $50 million to build an industrial-scale plant to make 5,000 tonnes of lithium annually.
That would be roughly the same production capacity as a lithium brine project in Silver Peak, Nevada, controlled by,  Albemarle  Corp (N:ALB) - the world's largest lithium producer.
Rio said its facility could eventually be the largest lithium producer in the United States, though it did not give any long-term output estimates.
If brought into commercial production, the Rio facility would make battery-grade lithium, the type of the metal sought by Panasonic Corp (T:6752) and other cathode producers, who in turn supply the battery part for use in Teslas (O:TSLA) and other electric vehicles.
Rio also controls Utah's Kennecott copper mine and a lithium deposit in Serbia that has yet to be developed.
Other companies developing U.S. lithium projects include  Lithium Americas Corp  (TO:LAC), Standard Lithium Ltd (V:SLL), Texas Mineral Resources Corp (PK:TMRC), Piedmont Lithium Ltd (AX:PLL) and ioneer Ltd (AX:INR), which is developing a Nevada lithium project also containing a large concentration of borates."

(Reuters) - SoftBank Group (T:9984) offered nearly $10 billion on Monday to WeWork and its shareholders under a takeover plan that would keep the U.S. office-space sharing start-up afloat and lead to the exit of its Chairman Adam Neumann, sources said. 
WeWork could run out of cash as early as next month without new financing, sources have said, after the company pulled plans in September for an initial public offering (IPO).
It abandoned the IPO when investors questioned its large losses, the sustainability of its business model and the way WeWork was being run by co-founder Neumann, who gave up his CEO title last month and now serves as board chairman.
WeWork owner The We Company's board will meet on Tuesday to evaluate SoftBank's offer against an alternative financing proposal from JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), the people, who were familiar with the matter, said.
JPMorgan faces challenges in putting together a debt package for WeWork, because it has not underwritten it and is trying to find banks and institutional investors to back it, the sources added. 
SoftBank has offered $5 billion in new money to WeWork in the form of debt, the sources said. It is also proposing to accelerate a previous $1.5 billion equity commitment to WeWork in the form of warrants that are due in April, the sources said.
This commitment was made in January at a $47 billion valuation, but SoftBank is now seeking to renegotiate it at a valuation of about $8 billion, the sources added.
SoftBank is also proposing to launch a tender offer for up to $3 billion to acquire WeWork shares from existing investors and insiders, including Neumann, the sources said. Based on the outcome of the tender offer, SoftBank could own between 60% and 80% of WeWork but will seek to avoid consolidating the company on its books, one of the sources added.
SoftBank and its $100 billion Vision Fund already own about a third of WeWork through previous investments totaling $10.6 billion.
Neumann could step down from The We Company's board as part of the deal with SoftBank and become an adviser, according to the sources. SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure would succeed Neumann as chairman, the sources said.
WeWork, SoftBank and JPMorgan declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Neumann declined to comment.
SoftBank has lined up Mizuho Financial Group Inc (T:8411) as part of its syndication of the $5 billion debt package, one of the sources said. The package comprises letters of credit for more than $1 billion, as well as senior secured and subordinated bonds, the source added.
Mizuho declined to comment.
The We Company’s seven-member board tasked two directors with representing the interests of all investors in the company by sitting on the special committee considering the financing plans, Reuters reported earlier this week.
One is Bruce Dunlevie, who is a general partner at WeWork shareholder Benchmark Capital. The other is Lew Frankfort, who is the former CEO of luxury handbag maker Coach.
Artie Minson, previously WeWork’s chief financial officer, and Sebastian Gunningham, who was a vice chairman at the company, are now serving as its co-chief executives.
Facing a cash crunch, WeWork is seeking to slow down its expansion, reducing the number of new property leases it is taking on.
The We Company’s board has also agreed on a cost-cutting plan that includes layoffs, Reuters reported last week. The cuts will occur over the coming weeks, the sources added.
FALL FROM GRACE
Neumann's exit from The We Company's board would represent a dramatic fall from grace, given Wall Street's expectations earlier this year that he would lead one of corporate America's most hotly anticipated stock market debuts.
While Neumann's investors were willing to entertain his eccentricities since co-founding WeWork in 2010, his free-wheeling ways and party-heavy lifestyle came into focus once he failed to get the company's IPO underway.
During the attempts to woo IPO investors last month, Neumann was criticized by corporate governance experts for arrangements that went beyond the typical practice of having majority voting control through special categories of shares.
These included giving his estate a major say in his replacement as CEO, and tying the voting power of shares to how much he donates to charitable causes.
Neumann had also entered several transactions with We Company, making the company a tenant in some of his properties and charging it rent. He has also secured a $500 million credit line from banks using company stock as collateral.

Neumann, 40, is not the first founder of a major start-up to be forced to step down recently.  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) co-founder Travis Kalanick resigned as CEO of the ride-hailing start-up in 2017 after facing a rebellion from his board over a string of scandals, including allegations of enabling a chauvinistic and toxic work culture.

A decade on from the global financial crisis, investor confidence in banks globally is also again weakening as margins tighten, and revenues and loan growth slow, the consultancy, which advises senior management on major strategic changes, said in the report.
""The industry in aggregate is not in great health, because 60% of banks don't have returns that exceed cost of equity and we see that as a call to action,"" said Kausik Rajgopal, a managing partner for McKinsey and one of the main authors of the report.
A prolonged economic slowdown with low or even negative interest rates could wreak havoc on the sector, the consultancy said, as it faces threats from a raft of small fintech startups and bigger technology companies looking to enter banking or payment businesses.
McKinsey said banks should invest in artificial intelligence-driven risk analytics, cut costs by outsourcing, and grow revenue by improving services for customers.

Ackman, however, said in a conference call with analysts that the company would only consider selling itself if a substantial premium was offered.
The company is currently valued at over $5 billion.
In June, the real estate developer hired Centerview Partners to explore strategic alternatives that included a potential sale of the company.
The asset sales along with changes to the company's organizational structure announced on Monday is expected to reduce overhead costs by $45 million to $50 million per year.
The company named Paul Layne as CEO, effective immediately. He will replace David Weinreb who, along with the president Grant Herlitz, will step down from the company.
Both Weinreb and Herlitz had signed a 10-year employment agreement with the company in 2017.
Layne was most recently the president of the company's Central Region, which include properties The Woodlands, The Woodlands Hills and Bridgeland in Texas.
Ackman said Layne's appointment along with the company's headquarters move from Dallas to Houston will enable Howard Hughes to be more profitable and free-cash-flow-generative.
Ackman's Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management owned 2.77% stake in Howard Hughes as of June 30, according to Refinitiv data.
Howard Hughes was formed in 2010 as a tax-free spinoff from General Growth Properties."

(Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) offered close to $10 billion to WeWork owner The We Company, its employees and its investors on Monday under a plan to keep the struggling U.S. office-space sharing start-up afloat that would lead to the exit of its co-founder and Chairman Adam Neumann, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
WeWork could run out of cash as early as next month without new financing, sources have said, after the company pulled plans in September for an initial public offering (IPO). It abandoned the IPO when investors questioned its large losses, the sustainability of its business model and the way WeWork was being run by Neumann, who gave up his CEO title last month and now serves as board chairman.
SoftBank has offered $5 billion in new money to WeWork in the form of debt, the sources said. It is also proposing to accelerate a previous $1.5 billion equity commitment to WeWork in the form of warrants that are due in April, the sources added.
This commitment was made in January at a $47 billion valuation, but SoftBank is now seeking to renegotiate it at a valuation of about $8 billion, the sources added.
SoftBank is also proposing to launch a tender offer for up to $3 billion to acquire WeWork shares from existing investors and insiders, including Neumann, the sources said. Based on the outcome of the tender offer, SoftBank could own between 60% and 80% of WeWork but will seek to avoid consolidating the company on its books, one of the sources added.
Neumann could step down from The We Company's board as part of the deal with SoftBank and become an adviser, according to the sources. SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure would succeed Neumann as chairman, the sources said.
The We Company's board will meet on Tuesday to evaluate SoftBank's offer, one of the sources said. JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) has been trying to put together an alternative financing package, sources have said.
WeWork, SoftBank and JPMorgan declined to comment.
WeWork has lined up Mizuho Financial Group Inc (T:8411) as part of its syndication of the $5 billion debt package, one of the sources said. The package comprises letters of credit for more than $1 billion, as well as senior secured and subordinated bonds, the source added.
SoftBank and its $100 billion Vision Fund already own about a third of WeWork through previous investments totaling $10.6 billion.
The We Company’s seven-member board tasked two directors with representing the interests of all investors in the company by sitting on the special committee considering the financing plans, Reuters reported earlier this week.
One is Bruce Dunlevie, who is a general partner at WeWork shareholder Benchmark Capital. The other is Lew Frankfort, who is the former CEO of luxury handbag maker Coach."
1446,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 05:58PM ET</span>",Former Chevron exec seeks $500 million for post-sanctions Venezuela,"By Jennifer Hiller
HOUSTON (Reuters) - The former chief of  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) Corp's Latin American operations is moving to raise $500 million from big financial firms to invest in Venezuela once U.S. sanctions are eventually lifted, confident that political change will come and that foreign investment will be needed to boost sagging oil output.
Amos Global Energy LLC, an oil and gas firm started by former Chevron executive Ali Moshiri, begins a road show to raise funding next month, seeking five big investors to put in $100 million each. Amos Global, which includes Moshiri and two co-founders, also is researching Venezuela public debt holders for another fund that would be even larger.
""We are trying to be the first to enter Venezuela when sanctions are lifted,"" he told Reuters in an interview on Monday. Amos Global's goal is to line up investors and manage the assets.
The United States imposed sanctions on Venezuela’s state-run oil firm, PDVSA, in January, seeking to starve the country of oil revenue and oust President Nicolas Maduro. Many Western nations regard last year's Venezuelan election as fraudulent, while Maduro has denounced opposition leader Juan Guaido as a U.S. puppet seeking to foment a coup.
Venezuela has the world's largest reserves of oil, which accounts for the bulk of the country's export revenue, but production has tumbled.
Moshiri said he understands the difficulty of raising funds when Venezuela's sovereign bonds are in default, but believes he will be able to win investors. The plan will combine a low management fee, input from investors through seats on the board, and allowing them to leave the fund after two years with a 2% penalty if sanctions remain.
Moshiri, who retired from Chevron in 2017 after nearly four decades with the oil major, oversaw exploration and production in Latin America and Africa. He launched Amos Global Energy soon afterward with Noel Avocato, a former Chevron executive, and Chris Hasty, a former banker with  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
The company also is hunting for assets in Mexico and Argentina, both places where energy investments have stalled this year. Moshiri insists opportunities exist there and in Colombia, but concedes they require patience given the hurdles to foreign investment.
He is looking to farm into an existing project or take over assets in Mexico’s Chicontepec Basin, an onshore field northeast of Mexico City that he compares to the U.S. Eagle Ford shale field. The company has a financial partner he will not name that he said is ready to put up $500 million if Amos Global finds the right projects.
""If there's no deal, good, we're going to continue to do our research and provide consulting,"" Moshiri said. ""You learn about business by being patient."""

The S&P finished up 0.69%, with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) among the leaders. The index has been held back since mid-July by trade and economic worries and it finished the day 0.84% below its July high.
The Nasdaq Composite and the Nasdaq 100 indexes each rose 0.91%.
The Dow Jones industrials rose 0.21%, but the gain was held back by a 3.76% decline in shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA).
Boeing's fall to $331.06, which subtracted 88 points from the blue-chip index, was due to continuing controversy about problems with the grounded 737 MAX airliner. Three brokerages (  Credit Suisse   (SIX:CSGN), UBS and Robert W. Baird) downgraded the stock. Boeing is down nearly 13% this month, but still up 2.65% for the year. 
 
Chip stocks led the market on optimism that a trade deal might finally be negotiated between the United States and China. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index was up 1.88%. 
President Donald Trump said progress in the negotiations was being made.
The hope is that any deal, even a modest one, will open up Chinese markets to semiconductors from U.S. companies.
The Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 were also boosted by Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) 1.73% gain after Raymond James analyst Chris Caso boosted his target price for the stock to $280 from $250.

The software giant reports fiscal-first-quarter earnings after Wednesday's close in a heavy week of earnings reports. 
Apple reports fiscal-fourth-quarter results after the Oct. 30 close.
While chips got all the attention, energy stocks were the strongest performing sector, even as oil prices drifted lower. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 36 cents to $53.51. Brent crude dropped 46 cents to $58.96.
  Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) and   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX) each rose more than 1.6%. 
Coty (NYSE:COTY) jumped more than 13% after announcing it wants to sell a number of beauty-product brands acquired from Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) in 2016. Best known are the Clairol and Covergirl lines.
Banks also were strong performers as interest rates moved higher. Also rising were department stores Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) and Macy’s (NYSE:M).
Big drug distribution companies, including AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) were lower after settling an Ohio lawsuit charging them with abetting the opioid crisis.
Gold also slipped $6 to $1,488.10 an ounce in futures trading in New York. Interest rates were higher as investors moved into stocks from bonds. The 10-Year Treasury yield rose to 1.801% from 1.75% on Friday.
Coty (NYSE:COTY), oil-services giant Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL), Helmerich and Payne (NYSE:HP) and EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) were among the top S&P 500 companies.

NEW YORK/HOUSTON (Reuters) - UBS Group AG and the energy arm of Piper Jaffray Companies have cut staff in their oil and gas investment banking teams, three people familiar with the matter said on Monday, as U.S. dealmaking continues to dry up.
Mergers and acquisitions activity within the shale business is at its lowest level in a decade, excluding Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) Corp's purchase of Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC), as shareholders squeeze producers to focus on returns and develop existing acreage rather than expansion.
The decline has left investment bankers that advise on such transactions without enough work.
UBS declined to comment. Simmons Energy, which is a division of Piper Jaffray, did not reply to requests for comment.
Those departing UBS and Simmons Energy were focused on sales of acreage and smaller assets, known in the industry as the acquisitions and divestitures (A&D), and left in the last couple of weeks, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is not public.
Among those departing the Swiss bank are Managing Directors David Edwards and Miles Redfield, among the most senior names in the unit. Around half of the A&D team at UBS was dismissed, which previously consisted of around a dozen bankers, according to one of the sources. A second source said the number who left was fewer than 10.
Edwards and Redfield were among a 15-person team that joined UBS from Bank of Montreal's investment banking arm in 2015. The move was acrimonious with both men, along with two others, subject to a lawsuit from the Canadian bank over their switch.
At Simmons, around two-thirds of their upstream A&D team was laid off, including Phillip Ream, a managing director who joined the firm in 2018 from  Barclays  (LON:BARC). Piper Jaffray did not reply to requests for comment.
In total, around seven people at Simmons are set to leave, two of the people said.
The head of A&D for Simmons, Jay Boudreaux, has been asked to retire at the end of the year, according to one of the sources. Boudreaux has been with Simmons since 2005, according to his biography on the company's website. He did not reply to requests for comment.
These job cuts are the latest in the Houston investment banking community: Last month, Jefferies Financial Group laid off 15 people, mostly focused on A&D, while  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. cut 7% of its energy investment banking team in the city."
1451,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 05:05PM ET</span>",Trump administration renews three-month license for Chevron in Venezuela,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday renewed a license allowing  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), the last U.S. operating energy company in Venezuela, to continue drilling in the country for another three months through Jan. 22. 
Some Trump administration officials opposed a renewal of the license, believing oil production helps keep socialist President Nicolas Maduro in power by allowing him to pay down debts. 
Others in the administration see keeping a U.S. company in Venezuela as an asset after any ouster of Maduro. Chevron has been in Venezuela for nearly 100 years and has about 8,000 employees, contractors and direct suppliers involved in its ventures there. 
In January, the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA in an effort to oust Maduro. But it issued Chevron a six-month license to operate, which has now been renewed for two three-month periods. 
The Treasury Department said the license does not authorize transactions related to shipments of diluents, which Venezuela needs to thin its heavy oil for processing.
The license also covers oil field service companies Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), GE's Baker Hughes and Weatherford International. All have largely halted operations in Venezuela because of the instability.

1452,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 04:59PM ET</span>",Tech Fund That Beat 98% of Peers Bets on Samsung Over Apple,"(Bloomberg) -- A top-performing global technology fund manager has raised bets on Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co., making the stock the number one holding in his portfolio, ahead of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). or Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.
Hyunho Sohn, portfolio manager at FIL Investment Management whose Fidelity Global Technology fund runs about $4.8 billion of assets, said he has been adding positions in the world’s largest memory-chip maker since late 2018. He interpreted the sharp plunge in Samsung’s share price toward the end of that year as an opportunity, and he believes in the long-term growth of the tech giant.
“If you ask me why I bought the stock, while the chip cycle was experiencing a downturn, I’d say I have faith in its fundamentals from a long-term perspective,” Sohn said in a telephone interview from London. “Samsung is a typical example of my strategy, which is buying an undervalued stock that the market participants hate temporarily.”
His fund, which holds about 60 global technology stocks, has beaten 98% of its peers with an annualized return of about 20% over the past five years, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. The fund’s top five holdings also include Alphabet, Apple,  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)., and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).
The potential growth in demand for memory chips is apparent in the growing needs of cloud storage and service providers alongside the artificial intelligence industry that needs data storage, he said. Compared with global tech stocks, valuations of Samsung are “still attractive,” he added.

Although Samsung’s forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12.6 times is not cheap compared with its historical average, it still lags Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU).’s 14.7 times and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s 18.6. On forward price-to-book terms, Samsung is trading at 1.2 times, lower than almost all of its peers.
Shares of Samsung have risen about 30% this year as overseas investors bought net 4.3 trillion won ($3.6 billion) of shares, the most sought-after stock on Korea’s KOSPI benchmark this year.

To be sure, it’s not all rosy for the memory chip sector. Micron, the third-largest player in the industry, released disappointing sales forecasts last month. And Samsung’s third-quarter preliminary earnings guidance announced earlier this month is less than half of its operating profits a year earlier. Chip prices have also been mixed. Contract prices for 32-gigabyte DRAM server modules fell 13.8% in the third quarter from the previous three-month period, while those for 128-gigabit MLC NAND flash memory chips rose 12.3%, according to inSpectrum Tech Inc.
“I know we don’t see clear signs of recovery in the memory chip industry yet,” Sohn said. “But for me, based on valuations, long-term growth potential, and balance sheet metrics like free cash flow, Samsung is a stock that I am comfortable with having large positions in. I still see an upside for the stock.”"

1455,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 04:23PM ET</span>",Day Ahead :Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com – Here’s a preview of the top three things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Earnings Season Heats Up; McDonald's, Texas Instruments and Procter & Gamble
McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) reports third-quarter earnings on Tuesday before the opening bell.
Ahead of the company's earnings, Wall Street appears optimistic as analysts expect the fast-food giant’s initiatives to drive demand will be reflected in comparable sales growth for the quarter. The company not only launched promotional offers, but added new items to its menu. 
Same-store sales are expecting to have risen 5.4% in the quarter, according to consensus estimates from FactSet.
McDonald's is expected to report earnings of $2.21 per share on revenue of $5.49 billion. 
Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is also out with its report before the opening bell.
P&G has won investing fans in the recent months with many cheering the company’s efforts to keep demand high for its products, underpinning top-line growth.
But keeping its products in demand has come at a cost as spending on marketing has kept a lid on profit growth in recent quarters.
P&G is expected to report earnings of $1.24 a share on revenue of $17.45 billion.
After bell on Tuesday, chip maker Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) releases its quarterly report in what will be a busy week for chip stocks, with Xilinx's (NASDAQ:XLNX) earnings due Wednesday and Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) on Thursday.
Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is expected to report earnings of $1.42 per share on revenue of $3.82 billion.
As well as earnings, guidance will be closely watched as TI has seen orders come under pressure as customers reign in capital spending amid geopolitical uncertainty.
2. API Report on Tap
The weekly American Petroleum Institute report due Tuesday comes as investors continue to fret about the ongoing build in domestic crude supplies as refinery activity continues to tick lower.
API data last week showed crude stockpiles rose 10.5 million barrels. It was the second-straight weekly increase at a time when many are concerned that weakening global growth will keep a lid on oil-demand growth, pressuring oil prices.
WTI futures settled 0.7% lower at $53.31 a barrel.
3. Housing Activity in Focus
The National Association of Realtors releases its report on September existing home sales at 10 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
Forecasts compiled by Investing.com expect the report to show sales in September fell 0.7% to an annual rate of 5.45 million units.
The backdrop for home sales activity has been mixed. Plunging mortgage rates have increased demand, but a lack of supply of lower-priced homes has sidelined many homebuyers."

Softbank plans to spend between $4 billion and $5 billion on new equity and existing shares to take a 70% controlling stake in WeWork. The deal would value WeWork between $7.5 billion to $8 billion and could be announced as soon as Tuesday, according to the reports.

We Work was valued at $47 billion as recently as January. It shelved plans to go public after its IPO prospectus in August revealed a $900 million loss in the first half of the 2019.
The report comes just a week after reports suggested that WeWork was running out of cash and had been in talks with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and SoftBank to raise funds.

(Reuters) - U.S. and European companies in polluting industries rarely disclose the financial risks they face related to climate change even though a global task force called on them to do so two years ago, Moody's Investors Service said in a report on Monday.
The analysis of the public filings of 28 building materials, oil and gas and utility companies comes after the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures in 2017 recommended voluntary disclosure by companies of the financial impact of climate change. 
The FSB coordinates financial rules for G20 countries.
Though 80 percent of the companies in the Moody's sample said climate change was affecting strategic decisions, just two of the 28 linked their climate projections with an effect on cash flows and balance sheets, the report said.
Those companies were a European utility and U.S. oil and gas company, the report said without giving names. Companies the credit ratings service used in its analysis have a combined $877 billion of debt. They included  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa),  Duke Energy  Corp (N:DUK) and Eletricite de France SA (PA:EDF), among others.
“Although companies have made some progress in the level of disclosure they provide, standardised and consistent quantification of the financial impact from climate risks is still in a nascent stage,"" Vincent Allilaire, one of the authors of the report, said in a statement.
While climate-related disclosures overall are up, the quality and depth of reporting varies widely, Moody's said.
Many investors have called on companies to provide better information on how climate change could impact their businesses amid concerns that assets are being mispriced because the risk is not being factored in.

Nevertheless, Moody's characterized the widespread adoption of climate-related financial disclosures as ""slow and gradual.""

1460,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 03:36PM ET</span>",Analysts Are Taking a Knife to Their 2020 Profit Estimates,"(Bloomberg) -- High on the list of things bulls dread this earnings season is that it become the scene of a big downward cut in next year’s estimates. It happened last year, helping foment the worst fourth quarter of the bull market. And though it’s very early, it’s happening now.
Despite a week of decent results, analysts last week chopped estimates for combined S&P 500 earnings in 2020 by almost $1, to $178.40 a share. Down 0.5%, the decline was the biggest for any week since January, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.
To be sure, analysts almost always over-estimate future earnings and lower their forecasts as a period draws near. And S&P 500 profits are still projected to expand 10% in 2020, compared with 1.9% this year. But amid memories of last year’s spectacle -- in which forecasts peaked in September and then started an 8% slump -- bulls need next year’s estimates to stand up.
“For the market to meaningfully take a step to the upside, investors need to have greater conviction that you’re going to get high single digit or better earnings growth,” said Jeremy Zirin, head of Americas equities at UBS Global Wealth Management. “Markets have to get comfortable that you’re going to see a re-acceleration of earnings growth.”
Two weeks into this reporting season, investors are already showing heightened sensitivity to instances where companies fail to live up to Wall Street’s earnings and sales expectations.
Among S&P 500 companies that have announced results, 81% beat earnings estimates, a near-record pace. For those that didn’t, retribution has been swift. Companies that missed on both sales and revenue saw their shares trail the market by 3.9 percentage points in first-day reactions, compared to the historical average of 2.4 points, data compiled by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) showed.
“This may suggest that investors are not yet confident enough in forward-looking outlooks to look through 3Q misses,” BofA strategists led by Savita Subramanian wrote in a note.
While much has changed since a year ago, most notably the orientation of the Federal Reserve toward interest rates, investors are aware that earnings sentiment started to turn south right before the market meltdown.
DataTrek Research’s co-founder Nick Colas is among those who think analysts’ estimates have to come down a lot from current levels. Sales growth will be subdued, coming in between 3% and 4%, he estimated. Margin pressures -- like higher wages and input costs -- will “eat up” all those gains, making for 2020 profits that “essentially mirror” this year’s, at $163 a share, he wrote to clients. That would mean virtually no growth.
For now, that risk doesn’t seem to be registering with investors, thanks to a global effort from central banks to spur growth. To Mike Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), it’s only a matter of time for the reality to sink in. His model on earnings revisions suggested the S&P 500 would have been flat in the past 12 months, as opposed to an actual 6% increase.
“This reflects the very aggressive shift in monetary policy recently by the Fed and other central banks -- i.e. that policy change is priced,” Wilson wrote in a note. “However, once the market gets past the initial relief it will have to contend with the deteriorating fundamentals.”"
1461,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 03:36PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Europe regulator to clear Boeing 737 MAX in January at earliest,"By Tim Hepher
COLOGNE, Germany (Reuters) - European regulators expect to clear Boeing's grounded 737 MAX to return to service in January at the earliest, following flight trials by European test pilots scheduled for mid-December, Europe's top aviation safety official told Reuters.
The head of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) declined to estimate when U.S. regulators would make their own decision to lift a flight ban imposed in March, but said any gap between the agencies would be a matter of weeks rather than months.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) has said it aims to return the jet to service by end-year following changes to cockpit software and training in the wake of two fatal crashes that sparked the grounding in March.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has primary responsibility for lifting the ban and is expected to be followed by other regulators including EASA, but there have been reported concerns that other agencies could be slow to act.
""For me it is going to be the beginning of next year, if everything goes well. As far as we know today, we have planned for our flight tests to take place in mid-December which means decisions on a return to service for January, on our side,"" EASA Executive Director Patrick Ky said late on Friday.
He said a return to service of the MAX would be coordinated with the FAA as much as possible, but that the two agencies had slightly different processes and consultation requirements.
""So we may end up with a couple of weeks of time difference but we are not talking about six months; we are talking about a delay which, if it happens, will be due mostly to process or administrative technicalities.""
Ky was speaking shortly before the disclosure of internal Boeing pilot messages from 2016 plunged the planemaker into fresh turmoil. On Monday, he declined comment on the messages. 
Some analysts and unions suggested the texts could further delay a return to service, but FAA officials said following the release they did not expect the messages would affect tentative plans for a certification flight in early November. The FAA says it needs at least 30 days from that flight to end the grounding.
A European source said there were no immediate signs of an impact.
HUMAN FACTORS
However, the timing for ungrounding the MAX is not set in stone and depends on a number of outstanding checks.
The FAA is waiting for a final Boeing system update designed to avoid so-called MCAS control software pushing the MAX's nose downwards due to data from a single faulty angle-of-attack (AOA) or airflow sensor. Instead, MCAS will monitor both sensors.
EASA has not withdrawn a suggestion that only a third sensor would make the system foolproof, but says it is prepared to set its concerns aside - at least on a transitional basis - if a separate exercise aimed at improving pilot procedures can make the workload from such faults manageable for an ""average"" crew.
""We are still looking at the changes made by Boeing on their flight control computers which they did over the summer and early September. We are entering a critical stage in the project where we look at the human-factor issues and how much in terms of workload a crew can take in terms of alarms,"" Ky said.
The workload tests will be carried out together with the FAA, but EASA will perform its own flight and simulator tests.
These will help EASA decide whether to rely solely on improved cockpit procedures so that pilots can easily cope with any sensor outage, or demand another technical safety net to make it harder for sensor data to disappear in the first place.
""The two are complementary...If you want better AOA integrity, one obvious way would be to add another sensor, which is not easy to do,"" Ky said.
TRANSITIONAL PERIOD
If EASA concludes an extra fallback is still needed, Ky did not exclude making this a ""synthetic"" or computerized sensor capable of imitating a probe and sending calculated data to aircraft systems to supplement data from actual sensors.
""This has never been done before but we are open to discussing all possible solutions with Boeing,"" Ky said.
He did not rule out introducing a transitional period in which the plane could be cleared with reduced pilot overload.
""If you have a new operational procedure which simplifies the workloads for pilots and enables you to arrive at an acceptable level …. this can be done for the return to service,"" he said. ""Now, is this level acceptable for a longer period than just the transitional period? That is something we need to assess.""
The outcome of the workload tests will also influence what training is required, Ky said.
Ky dismissed concerns that competition between global regulators would hamper a smooth worldwide return to service.
""There is no real competition between regulators,"" he said.
He also rebuffed suggestions from some analysts that EASA is dragging its feet or allowing recent transatlantic political tensions to sharpen its scrutiny of the U.S.-made jet.
""All the decisions that we took on this project were technical decisions. We don't do politics.""
Asked whether regulators now fully understood the accidents, the first of which is due to trigger a final Indonesian accident report later this month, Ky cited a combination of factors.
""With hindsight everything is much easier. … The interaction between the machine and the human is never completely rational; it is a human-machine interface,"" he said.
""There were design mistakes for sure - the MCAS should never have been designed the way it was designed - and bad luck.""
Boeing has said the accidents were caused by chains of events of which the performance of MCAS represented one link.

On Sunday, it said it had developed improvements to the 737 MAX that would ensure similar crashes never happened again.

1462,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 03:35PM ET</span>",Rubio Duels With MSCI Over Investors' Money in Chinese Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- Global index provider MSCI Inc. is pushing back against criticism by U.S. Senator Marco Rubio that it’s helping funnel billions of Americans’ investment dollars into Chinese companies linked to human rights abuses and national security threats.
“Currently there is no U.S. law or regulation that prohibits an index company from creating an index containing China A securities or U.S. investors from trading in the China A market,” MSCI’s Chief Executive Officer Henry Fernandez said in a letter seen by Bloomberg. China A shares are open to buying and selling by foreign investors.
Fernandez wrote in a response to questions from Rubio about the index’s composition that inclusion isn’t based on “subjective judgment regarding the company’s intrinsic value or basic practices,” but on standardized attributes such as company size and liquidity.
MSCI’s response comes after the Florida Republican sent a public letter asking the index provider for an explanation on why it added hundreds of Chinese stocks to its benchmark emerging markets index since last year and then increased the weighting to them this year. The moves paved the way for billions of dollars more in investments and retirement-savings to flow to Chinese companies.
Some stocks in the index, such as Hangzhou Hikvision, have recently been placed on a U.S. blacklist preventing business with American companies.
MSCI didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Rubio’s pressure on MSCI is part of a larger campaign by U.S. lawmakers to slow the spigot of money that has flowed from U.S. investment funds into Chinese companies. The moves come during an ongoing trade war between the two countries that has prompted U.S. officials to increase scrutiny to the money going into China.
American Securities Association CEO Chris Iacovella said MSCI’s response fails to address any of the concerns Rubio raised to protect American investors.
“MSCI continues to look the other way as it funnels billions of dollars of American money out of the U.S. and into Chinese companies that are fraudulent, on the sanctions list, or do-not-do business list,” he said.
Rubio has led a push by a group of bipartisan lawmakers advocating for more stringent restraints on investment and greater scrutiny of Chinese companies in stock indexes and U.S. pension funds. He has also proposed legislation that could delist Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges if they failed to comply with U.S. accounting practices and other laws.
The White House has been in touch with Rubio to discuss its support for the matter, but the legislation’s prospects in Congress remain unclear.
The MSCI letter agreed with Rubio that investors should know where they are investing and said in some cases the company makes specific references to China’s different accounting standards, and identifies China as an authoritarian regime. A Rubio spokesman said the Senator’s office received the letter earlier this month.
The MSCI CEO drew the distinction between passive index funds that MSCI powers, which do not serve as investment recommendations, and active asset managers, who can pick and choose which stocks to direct funds. In addition to serving as a benchmark for investments, MSCI said its indexes are used by academic institutions and researchers, cautioning that requiring the index to exclude certain stocks would “severely limit the ability to understand and assess global markets.”
Rubio told Bloomberg earlier this year that he’s not advocating for an all-out ban on U.S. investment in China, but for a regulatory body charged with examining investments, modeled on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which was recently granted greater power to restrict Chinese acquisitions of U.S. technology.
“Firms like MSCI have an obligation to make sure investors know whether their investment dollars are unwittingly aiding Chinese state-owned and state-directed companies linked to China’s efforts to steal American innovation, undermine fair competition, increase threats to U.S. national security and economic security, and support China’s systemic and egregious human rights abuses,” Rubio said in an accompanying statement in June. “We can no longer allow China’s authoritarian government to reap the rewards of American and international capital markets.”"

Accompanied by his daughter Ivanka and flanked by LVMH's controlling shareholder, French billionaire Bernard Arnault, Trump cut the ribbon at the plant in Alvarado, Texas, on Friday, where workers will produce some of the brand's famed handbags.
Vuitton bosses including chief executive Michael Burke were also present. 
But the event appeared to cause some discomfort inside Vuitton, with Ghesquiere - who has designed its women's collections since 2013 and whose creations are often worn by Brigitte Macron, the wife of the French president - decrying the visit. 
""Standing against any political action. I am a fashion designer refusing this association,"" Ghesquiere said in a post on Instagram over the weekend, adding the hashtags #trumpisajoke and #homophobia, without elaborating. 
Vuitton declined to comment. LVMH had no immediate comment to Ghesquiere's comments, which marked a rare moment of public discord within the group.
LVMH's Arnault, who is France's richest man, had already met with Trump shortly after his election in early 2017, visiting him in New York and stating at the time that Vuitton had plans for a new U.S. factory.
The Texas plant, which adds to Vuitton's two existing U.S. manufacturing hubs in California, will create 1,000 jobs, the brand said. 
Vuitton produces the bulk of its luxury goods in its home country, trading off the cachet of its ""Made in France"" credentials. But its U.S. presence is seen as a having advantages at a time of growing global trade tensions. 
Some anti-Trump campaigners seized on the Vuitton visit. 'Grab Your Wallet' is a U.S.-based campaign that calls on shoppers to boycott brands linked to Trump in some capacity. It includes Vuitton on its list, as well as other LVMH brands like Christian Dior and Givenchy. 
Arnault, 70, who had endorsed Emmanuel Macron when he was running for the French presidency in 2017, steered clear of policy talk at the factory inauguration, and highlighted Vuitton's commitment to the United States. 

""Louis Vuitton, a name I know well - cost me a lot of money over the years,"" Trump said during the visit.

But with recent positive comments from both sides, chip stocks are in the ascendency ahead of aslew earnings from semis this week, including chip bellwether Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) due Tuesday.
After notching their ""phase one"" agreement, which has yet to be signed, China and the U.S. stoked optimism, citing progress toward ratifying the deal, sending chip stocks, many of which generate sizable revenue from China, higher. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index was up about 1.8%.
Following China saying it would work with the U.S. to address the core concerns of each party, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow expressed optimism about ongoing talks and said that tariffs scheduled for December could be withdrawn if talks continue to go well.
The upturn in sentiment on trade between the two countries marks a sharp contrast from the summer, when trade relations soured, leading the U.S. to not only increase tariffs on Chinese imports, but target companies like Huawei, an important customer for U.S. chip companies. 
The U.S., however, temporarily lifted the ban on U.S. companies, allowing them to work with Huawei until August. The reprive was then extended to November.
The uptick in chip stocks comes just a day ahead of the quarterly update from TI, seen as a bellwether for semiconductor companies given its global customer base. Other tech earnings also hit the deck this week, with Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) reporting on Wednesday after the bell and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) reporting on Thursday after the close. "

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Peloton Interactive (O:PTON) slumped 6% on Monday, even after a multitude of buy ratings from the stationary bike seller's IPO banks, underscoring Wall Street's growing exhaustion from money-losing startups.
At least 14 underwriters of Peloton's initial public offering on Sept. 25, including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), UBS and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), launched analyst coverage of the unprofitable company, all of them recommending investors buy its poorly performing stock.
Peloton's stock has fallen 24% since its debut last month, when storm clouds were amassing over office-sharing startup WeWork's IPO, which would be scuttled on Sept. 30.
Among underwriters launching coverage on Monday following a quiet period related to Peloton's IPO, Goldman Sachs appeared the most bullish, with a price target of $37, or 68% higher than its current price of around $22.
JPMorgan, which had a price target of $32, and Goldman Sachs were the IPO's lead underwriters.
The New York company sells exercise equipment and a subscription service for streaming exercise classes. Its flagship product is a stationary bike priced at over $2,200.
""Peloton is creating a new market in connected fitness, one leveraged to health and wellness' growing share of consumer spending, the ubiquity of always-on devices, and the power of online communities,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry wrote in a report.
Peloton's revenue more than doubled to $915 million in the fiscal year ending in June, while its loss deepened from $48 million to $196 million.
Earlier this month, Peloton sued Echelon Fitness LLC, alleging that it infringed on its patents and sold ""cheap, copycat"" products.
At the end of September, WeWork's parent company was forced to abandon its much-anticipated IPO due to skepticism about its burgeoning losses and corporate governance problems, and Wall Street has become more picky since then. 
SmileDirectClub (O:SDC), an unprofitable company selling teeth aligners directly to customers, has slumped 60% since its IPO on Sept. 11, even after analysts from its underwriters overwhelmingly recommended buying the stock.
 Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER), 2019's most hotly anticipated public listing, has tumbled 30% since its May IPO. Most analysts covering Uber recommend buying its shares, according to Refinitiv.

Fisher had managed $500 million in the $8 billion Fidelity Strategic Advisers Small-Mid Cap Fund , a mandate the Boston firm said last week was under review. 
Since then a set of public pension funds also pulled money from Fisher, including funds in Iowa and in the cities of Boston and Philadelphia, bringing total withdrawals to around $1.8 billion. Other systems have Fisher under review including in Florida and Los Angeles.
Fisher did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a video posted Oct. 9 on Twitter, Alex Chalekian, chief executive of a financial advisory firm, called attention to comments Fisher made at a financial conference last week.
Chalekian said Fisher made derogatory comments about genitalia, picking up girls and financier Jeffrey Epstein, among other topics. Epstein committed suicide in August while in jail awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
In a memo to his firm's employees on Oct. 11 and sent to Reuters by a spokesman, Fisher said: ""It pains me to know that my comments have caused you grief, concern, and indignation. I sincerely apologize.""

At Fidelity, assets previously managed by Fisher have been reallocated within the fund, said Fidelity spokesman Vincent Loporchio.

1469,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 01:40PM ET</span>","Drug companies reach $260 million opioid settlement with Ohio counties, averting landmark trial","By Kathy Gray
CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Four large drug companies reached a last-minute $260 million legal settlement on Monday over their role in the U.S. opioid addiction epidemic, striking a deal with two Ohio counties to avert the first federal trial over the crisis.
However, drug distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC),  Cardinal Health  Inc (N:CAH) and McKesson Corp (N:MCK) and drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA) fell short of a wider deal worth tens of billions of dollars to end all opioid litigation against them.
The distributors, which handle around 90% of U.S. prescription drugs, will pay a combined $215 million immediately. Israel-based drugmaker Teva is paying $20 million in cash and will contribute $25 million worth of Suboxone, an opioid addiction treatment, according to Hunter Shkolnik, an attorney for the counties. 
Teva, the world's largest generic drugmaker, will makes its contribution over 18 months, according to Shkolnik.
The deal settles claims brought by Ohio's Cuyahoga and Summit counties, which had accused the companies of fueling a nationwide opioid crisis. Some 400,000 U.S. overdose deaths between 1997 and 2017 were linked to opioids, according to government data.
""While the companies strongly dispute the allegations made by the two counties, they believe settling the bellwether trial is an important stepping stone to achieving a global resolution and delivering meaningful relief,"" the distributors said a joint statement. Teva declined to comment.
The so-called bellwether or test trial was meant to help shape a broader settlement of some 2,600 lawsuits pending over the toll opioids have taken on local communities and the nation.
Late on Friday, talks collapsed that were aimed at reaching a $48 billion global settlement of all opioid litigation against the same defendants.
Shares in the companies had risen last week in anticipation of a broader deal. On Monday, shares of the big three drug distributors were down from more than 2% to 4%, having trimmed some earlier losses.
""We are not surprised to see distributor shares giving back some of last week’s gains as uncertainty persists in this extremely complex litigation,"" Baird analyst Eric Coldwell wrote in a note.
'STILL AT THE TABLE'
The settlement, if extrapolated to nationwide deal resolving all litigation for the four defendants, suggests a settlement value of around $48 billion, based on a court-approved allocation formula. 
“We’re still at the table,"" said Joe Rice, an attorney for the local governments, who indicated the timing of payments was a sticking point. ""This should be a global settlement, but it’s got to be fair and it’s got to be now.” 
The judge overseeing the case, Dan Polster, said he would work out a new trial date for the remaining defendant, pharmacy chain operator Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA).
Lawyers representing the local governments said in a statement on Monday that the litigation had revealed the country's pharmacy system ""has played a greater role in the opioid epidemic than previously realized.""
Walgreens said in a statement on Monday that it only sold opioids to fill a valid prescription written by a licensed physician. It said it was diligent to prevent the diversion of controlled substances.
A sixth defendant, the smaller distributor  Henry Schein  Inc (O:HSIC), said on Monday it had been dismissed as a defendant from the trial after agreeing to a deal worth around $1.25 million.
The lawsuits accuse drugmakers of overstating the benefits of opioids while downplaying the risks. Distributors allegedly failed to flag and halt a rising tide of suspicious orders, shipping vast amounts of the pills across the country.
Drugmakers have denied wrongdoing, arguing their products carried U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved labels that warned of the addictive risks of opioids. They say they did not cause the toll the epidemic has had on states and localities.
Distributors had argued that they made up only ""one component of the pharmaceutical supply chain"" and their role was to make sure medicines prescribed by licensed doctors were available for patients.
Monday's settlements add to deals worth $66.4 million that the two Ohio counties earlier struck with drug companies  Mallinckrodt  Plc (N:MNK), Endo International Plc (O:ENDP), Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and Allergan Plc (N:AGN).
Armond Budish, county executive of Cuyahoga, said Friday's proposed global settlement, which had the support of state attorneys general, would have distributed funds over 18 years, not immediately. ""People are dying now,"" he said.
Cuyahoga County has said it will use the funds to expand residential treatment beds, increase emergency care follow-up and to create alternatives to jailing low-level drug offenders, among other initiatives.
Polster, has aggressively pushed for a settlement that ""could do something meaningful to abate this crisis.""

Pharmacy chains and drug distributors unsuccessfully tried to remove the outspoken judge from the case, saying he was biased and had pressed too hard for a costly settlement.

1470,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 01:29PM ET</span>",Boeing may face billions more in losses as MAX crisis deepens: analysts,"By Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) may have to book billions of dollars in additional charges related to its grounded 737 MAX jets, brokerages said on Monday, following reports that call into question the timing of the aircraft's return to service.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and UBS downgraded the stock after reports on Friday showed internal messages between two Boeing employees stating that the plane's anti-stall system behaved erratically during testing before the aircraft entered service.
The new revelations pose fresh challenges for Boeing, which is reeling under pressure after two fatal crashes forced the company to ground the planes and book billions of dollars in losses.
The crisis over the messages continued to consume the U.S. manufacturer on Monday, with Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg telling all employees by email they should speak to managers if they have questions about the instant messages.
Muilenburg began the email, sent late on Sunday Seattle time, by saying Boeing continues to make ""steady progress"" toward lifting the 737 MAX worldwide safety ban.
Boeing's shares fell as much as 5.7% to $324.40 in early trading on Monday, making the stock the biggest percentage loser on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI). They have lost 18% of their value since the second deadly crash of the popular single-aisle jet in March.
The planemaker has already cut production of the MAX, and analysts said there was an increasing possibility that the company would have to halt production altogether.
""We see increasing risk that the Federal Aviation Administration won't follow through with a certification flight in November and lift the emergency grounding order in December,"" UBS analyst Myles Walton said, downgrading the stock to ""neutral"" from ""buy.""
Walton cut his target price on Boeing's shares by $95 to $375, citing an increase in ""likelihood of a pause on the 737 MAX production system"" due to a delay in the jet's return.
UBS also downgraded Boeing's biggest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems (N:SPR), to ""neutral"" from ""buy"" and cut its target price on the stock to $88 from $92.
BILLIONS IN LOSSES
Boeing's shares fell nearly 7% on Friday after Reuters first reported the news, which prompted a demand by U.S. regulators for an immediate explanation and a new call in Congress for the company to shake up its management.
The company on Sunday expressed regret over the messages, and said it was still investigating what they meant.
Credit Suisse, which had stuck to its ""outperform"" rating since July 2017, downgraded the stock to ""neutral"" and cut its target price by $93 to $323, 6% below Boeing's Friday closing price of $344.
With the likely delay in MAX's return to service until February 2020 and the stoppage of production, the American planemaker could record $3.2 billion in charges over four months on top of a $5.6 billion charge taken so far, analyst Robert Spingarn said.
""BA could be forced to furlough or fire a portion of its MAX workforce. This could result in lost labor force productivity when/if the MAX does return to service. We have seen the consequences of such events in shipbuilding: it can be ugly,"" said Spingarn.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) reduced its price target on Boeing's shares to $370 from $400, saying there were many questions swirling around Boeing's culture, brand and corporate governance following the latest developments.

""Risk management, disclosure and accountability of management and the board .... could weigh on the stock in the wake of this setback,"" BofA analyst Ronald Epstein said.

At TD Ameritrade and E-Trade, commissions make up about 30% of revenues, while at Schwab, commissions make up less than 10% of revenue.

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Corporate planemakers announced plans on Monday to improve maintenance and parts accessibility for customers, amid a broader industry push for higher-margin aftermarket services. 
The announcements come ahead of the world's largest business jet show, which kicks off on Tuesday featuring new large corporate planes that can fly farther, services like fast wifi at 40,000 feet and an industry push toward sustainable aviation fuels. 
Canada's Bombardier also said its new Global 5500 aircraft will fly 200 nautical miles farther than planned, with a range of 5,900 nautical miles, a lure for customers eager to travel non-stop between far-flung cities. 
The Montreal-based plane and train maker is adding a pair of line maintenance stations at two U.S. locations, which will introduce unscheduled services to customers and then build toward scheduled maintenance operations in the coming months.
Bombardier has focused on boosting sales of new products and maintenance packages to drive revenue growth for its aftermarket service business.

Textron Aviation, which produces Cessna Aircraft, said it grew warehouse square footage at three U.S. locations by nearly 50%, to over 8,000 square feet. The U.S. expansion follows Textron's plans to make parts more readily available to customers in Europe and Asia-Pacific earlier this year.

1476,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 12:17PM ET</span>",Judge orders Massachusetts to redo parts of vaping ban,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - A Massachusetts judge on Monday ruled that a four-month ban on the sale of vaping products the state adopted in response to an outbreak of lung illnesses linked to e-cigarette use was likely unlawful, but he gave the state time to fix its defects.
Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Douglas Wilkins in Boston said he would bar the state from enforcing the ban on nicotine-vaping product sales unless Governor Charlie Baker's administration by next week put forward a new rule codifying it.
But Wilkins said because Baker's administration could easily re-enact his Sept. 24 emergency order imposing the ban through a regulation that the public could comment on, he did not believe it was appropriate to rule more broadly.
The ruling was a mixed result for Baker and the industry trade group Vapor Technology Association, which challenged the ban in court, saying it posed an ""existential threat"" to the state's $331 million nicotine vaping products sector.
That ban covered the sales of e-cigarettes and vaping supplies, both those used for nicotine and THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, which is legal in the state.
Wilkins said nothing in his ruling would affect the ban's application to products containing THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, which is legal in the state, or black market products.
The VTA and Baker's office did not respond to requests for comment. 
In its lawsuit, Washington-based VTA argued that Baker's emergency order marked an unconstitutional overreach by the governor by imposing a law that the state's legislature never approved.
It also argued the order was arbitrary, by claiming to target youth vaping and the outbreak by banning all sales to anyone in the state regardless of age even when evidence suggested black market products were behind the lung injuries.
At least 1,479 e-cigarette-linked lung injury cases have been reported to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It says most cases have been linked to products containing THC, particularly those obtained off the street.
Several other states, including Michigan, New York, Washington, Oregon and Rhode Island, have moved since September to restrict sales of flavored e-cigarettes on the grounds that they pose a health risk to teenagers.

Courts in New York, Oregon and Michigan have since put those state's bans on hold following lawsuits by the vaping industry. A federal judge in Boston previously declined to block Massachusetts' prohibition, which was much broader.

1477,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 12:11PM ET</span>","Hong Kong riot police teargas, chase protesters, residents jeer officers","By James Pomfret and Greg Torode
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong riot police fired tear gas late on Monday to disperse pro-democracy demonstrators gathered to commemorate the three-month anniversary of an assault by more than 100 men on protesters, commuters and journalists.
The clashes in the Yuen Long neighborhood came a day after widespread violence in which tens of thousands marched through Kowloon district and hardcore activists threw petrol bombs at police, torched metro entrances and trashed shops.
Hong Kong has been battered by five months of huge and often violent protests over fears Beijing is tightening its grip on the territory, the worst political crisis since colonial ruler Britain handed it back to China in 1997.
Under a policy that deems marches illegal unless they have a police permit, riot police stopped around 100 protesters reaching the Yuen Long metro station in Hong Kong's northwest, which was closed five hours early amid tight security.
Police ordered protesters to disperse, at one stage rushing them and detaining one person. Scuffles broke out between pro-Beijing supporters and protesters and angry residents emerged from apartments to jeer officers, calling them ""black police"". 
A police statement said police resorted to tear gas after some protesters hurled ""hard objects"" at them and vandalized bank facilities in the vicinity. It urged residents to stay indoors, keep windows closed and avoid local streets.
After a few hours most protesters had scattered but police remained on the streets in force, occasionally firing tear gas at small groups and chasing down individuals. A few masked protesters taunted police but quickly disappeared up side streets when officers approached.
Elsewhere in the city, protesters staged peaceful sit-ins at five metro stations.
JULY MOB ATTACK ON PROTESTERS
Protesters are angry that police did not act quickly enough to protect pro-democracy activists and commuters from the July 21 gang assault at the Yuen Long metro, and at what they say is a slow investigation into the incident.
Police have arrested 34 people and charged six.
At the time some believed the men had been hired to attack the group. Some politicians and activists have linked Hong Kong’s shadowy network of triad criminal gangs to political intimidation and violence in recent years, sometimes against pro-democracy activists and critics of Beijing.
One of Monday's protesters, a secondary school pupil, said he could not accept a call from the government to move on and wait for a report from the Independent Police Complaints Council into the Yuen Long attack.
""We can't forget this, because I think that this is so horrible to all Hong Kong people, and this should not be moved on from until the criminals are caught and in the jails,"" he said, without giving his name.
Yim, a 42-year-old social worker, said he was in Yuen Long station on the night of the July attack, adding it was important to continue to protest against such mob violence.
""There were many people filmed that night but they’ve only arrested six people so far ... we want an independent investigation and justice for this attack.""
Many in Hong Kong feel police have used excessive force against protesters and want an independent investigation into police actions.
LAM APOLOGIZES TO ISLAMIC COMMUNITY
After two weeks of relative calm, Sunday's massive rally showed there was still widespread support for the pro-democracy movement and no end in sight to the unrest in the Asian financial hub, which is facing its first recession in a decade.
Embattled Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam has rejected the demands of protesters and backed police actions.
Lam apologized to the city's Muslim community on Monday after a police water cannon fired blue dye at a major mosque during operations on Sunday night. Police said the action was an accident and also apologized, but the incident has heightened racial tensions, with Islamic leaders calling for calm.
There have been few major rallies in recent weeks, but violence has escalated at those held, with militant activists setting metro stations ablaze and smashing up scores of shops, often targeting Chinese banks and stores with mainland links.
Police have fired thousands of rounds of tear gas, hundreds of rubber bullets and three live rounds at brick- and petrol bomb-throwing activists. 
Since the protests escalated in June, more than 2,600 people have been arrested, many under 18 years of age, while two people have been shot and many more injured.
Many people in Hong Kong are angry at what they see as mainland China's attempts to limit the freedoms the city enjoys under the ""one country, two systems"" principle enshrined in its handover from Britain in 1997.
The protests pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power. Beijing has denied eroding Hong Kong's freedoms and Xi has vowed to suppress any attempt to split China.
Protesters are demanding universal suffrage, an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, amnesty for those charged, an end to labeling protesters as rioters, as well as the formal withdrawal of a China extradition bill that was the original trigger for the unrest.

The cosmetics company has struggled to integrate about 40 beauty brands, including Covergirl and Max Factor, that it bought from Procter & Gamble (N:PG) in 2016, forcing it to take billions of dollars in writedowns and outline a four-year restructuring plan.
The company also said it was exploring options for its Brazilian unit as it shifts its focus to its fragrance, cosmetics and skin care businesses.
""Coty is the No. 2 player in the global professional hair business, which has high consumer loyalty and should be an attractive business to a potential buyer,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Joe Lachky said.
Lachky, however, said the company's Brazil business was less attractive given the macro-economic volatility in the country.
Coty's professional beauty unit, which primarily sells hair and nail care products to salon professionals, raked in about $1.81 billion in annual sales and accounted for about 21% of its total revenue.
The unit, however, has seen falling sales in the last four quarters.
""(The announcement) accelerates this transformation and will help ... deleverage our balance sheet, and improve our ability to invest in areas with the greatest growth potential,"" Chief executive Officer Pierre Laubies said.
Coty said it would use the proceeds from any of the transactions to pay down debt and return excess cash to shareholders.
The company, which is majority owned by German conglomerate JAB Holdings, has hired  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to run a sale process for the units, which generated about $2.7 billion in net revenue in fiscal 2019.
Earlier this year, JAB raised its stake in Coty to 60%, giving it a firmer grip on the company."

(Reuters) - Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co on Monday promised more cost cuts after reporting a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly revenue as the oilfield services looks to counter weak demand from North American shale producers, sending its shares up about 7%.
The biggest hydraulic fracking services provider, which earlier this month cut 650 jobs in North America, said it would take steps over the next few quarters that will lead to $300 million in annualized cost savings.
Oilfield service providers are struggling with reduced spending by oil and gas producers as investors push for higher buybacks and dividends rather than growth in a weak oil price environment.
Larger rival Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB) said on Friday it had recorded a $1.58 billion goodwill impairment charge related to its pressure pumping business in North America.
""HAL is taking costs out more aggressively than the Street forecast, which it expects to lead to strong Q4 operating margin improvement in the Drilling & Evaluation segments despite falling revenue,"" said Anish Kapadia, founder of London-based oil and gas consultancy firm AKap Energy.
Halliburton warned of further activity declines in North America, with fourth-quarter revenue for its hydraulic fracturing business declining by low double digits and margins by 125 basis points to 175 basis points.
""Feedback from our customers lead us to believe that the rig count and completions activity may be lower than the fourth quarter of last year,"" Chief Executive Officer Jeff Miller told analysts during a post-earnings call.
Halliburton said its revenue from North America, which accounts for more than half of the company's total, fell 21% in the third quarter. Revenue from completion and production fell 16% in the three months ended Sept. 30.
The company also idled more equipment in the third quarter than the first six months of the year, Miller said.
Evercore ISI analyst James West said Halliburton was ""showing leadership by walking away from unprofitable or low return work.""
Net profit attributable to Halliburton fell to $295 million, or 34 cents per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $435 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier.
Analysts had on average estimated 34 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Revenue fell to $5.55 billion, below analysts' average estimate of $5.80 billion.

1488,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 09:32AM ET</span>",Italy's biggest bank wants to become less Italian,"By Silvia Aloisi and Gianluca Semeraro
MILAN (Reuters) - The chief executive of UniCredit (MI:CRDI) has a plan to revive his company's ailing share price - make it less Italian. 
Italy's biggest bank is looking at whether it can distance itself from its home country's stagnating economy and fractious politics by putting some of its most prized assets under one roof in Germany, people familiar with the matter said.
Jean Pierre Mustier will unveil on Dec. 3, as part of his new business plan, a scheme to set up a new sub-holding company in Germany to house the bank's foreign operations, the sources said.
By keeping its assets in Germany, Austria, Eastern Europe and Turkey away from Italy, UniCredit could reduce their Italian identity - and associated credit rating - making their funding cheaper, the sources said.
Mustier, a Frenchman appointed in July 2016 to reinvigorate the then weakly capitalized Milanese bank, has sold businesses, cut jobs and shut branches to strengthen UniCredit's balance sheet. Sources earlier this year said the bank had put on ice a possible bid for German rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
But UniCredit, which describes itself as pan-European, operates in 14 countries and makes just over half of revenues outside Italy, is still essentially perceived by investors as a risky Italian institution. 
The new plan is an indication of Mustier's belief that the Italian economy is holding back UniCredit's share price and risks pushing up the bank's funding even more if the economic outlook deteriorates. 
""Who can say for sure that Italy's debt won't be downgraded to junk?"" said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity and describing the corporate reorganization as an insurance policy if Italy's economy continues to perform poorly.
""The bank has to be ready for that kind of possibility,"" the person said, noting Moody's currently rates the euro zone's third biggest economy - burdened with the second highest debt to GDP ratio in the single currency bloc - just one notch above non-investment grade. Germany has a triple-A rating with all major credit ratings agencies. 
SOVEREIGN DEBT PROXY
Italian banks - which are struggling with bad loans, a sluggish economy and political instability - have traditionally been seen as a proxy for the country's sovereign debt because they hold vast amounts of government bonds.
UniCredit trades at 0.5 times book value, among the lowest levels in the industry, despite having a better than average return on equity. Its share price has fallen 30% since April last year, wiping out much of the rally it had after Mustier took charge.
To place a $3 billion, five-year bond in November last year, when a sell-off in Italian assets sent borrowing costs for the country's banks soaring and shut all but the strongest names out of the funding market, UniCredit had to pay a steep 7.8% coupon.
""UniCredit is by size one of Europe's leading banking groups but, because of its Italian roots, investors associate it with the Italy risk to an extent which is in my opinion excessive given its geographical diversification,"" Stefano Caselli, banking and finance professor at Milan's Bocconi University.
""It's clear that UniCredit pays a price both in terms of regulatory capital and cost of funding for being Italian,"" he said. ""So a diversification strategy aimed at allowing the bank to link its cost of funding to the countries where it is present makes total sense."" 
Some other Italian companies with big foreign operations, including car maker  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and broadcaster  Mediaset  (MI:MS), have moved or are in the process of moving their legal headquarters to the Netherlands as part of a pivot away from Italy. 
The European Central Bank would have to approve the plan to set up the holding company in Germany - where UniCredit already owns lender HVB - potentially taking at least a year, meaning the shift would not happen for sometime. 
CUTTING EXPOSURE
Mustier has repeatedly said that UniCredit will remain listed and headquartered in Milan and reiterated the bank's commitment to its home country.
But since May he has steadily cut the bank's exposure to Italy, including by selling its stake in online broker FinecoBank (MI:FBK) and announcing it would reduce its 55 billion euros ($61.37 billion) portfolio of Italian government bonds. 
The bank is also considering cutting 10,000 jobs, or around 10% of its workforce, as part of the new 2020-2023 plan, almost all of them in Italy, sources said in July.
UniCredit has said any workforce reduction will be handled through early retirement.
But the planned cuts, together with a wider management reshuffle earlier this year, have helped to create a perception among some employees and rivals that the bank is less focused on its Italian operations. 
""You can tell that the Italian commercial business is not a priority for them, they are not aggressive, they are not chasing clients,"" said the chief executive of another Italian bank.

(Reuters) - Smith+Nephew Plc (L:SN) Chief Executive Namal Nawana is stepping down after just 17 months in the role after becoming dissatisfied with his salary at the medical device maker.
The company said Nawana, who will be replaced by former Roche Diagnostics head Roland Diggelmann, was leaving to pursue opportunities outside the United Kingdom and his departure was a mutual decision. A spokeswoman gave no additional details.
""There appears to be a pretty simple reason Nawana is leaving – pay,"" AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.
""It became apparent over the summer that the company was looking for ways to increase its head honcho's remuneration with apparent discussions about a move to a U.S. listing to escape an increasing backlash in the UK towards excessive executive pay.""
An earlier FT report had said Smith+Nephew directors discussed moving the company's main listing from London to New York, where higher executive payouts are more common and less controversial, to boost its top salaries.
Analysts at Berenberg also said Nawana's pay ""aspirations"" made his departure inevitable. Nawana, who steps down at the end of the month, did not respond to request for comment on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).
Faced with stricter rules in the United Kingdom designed to tackle soaring executive pay, the company is in talks with shareholders over its 2020 remuneration policy.
Nawana, who joined the British maker of artificial knees and hips in May 2018, received total pay of $2.88 million that year, according to the company's last annual report. His predecessor Olivier Bohuon received $5.12 million in 2017.
Smith+Nephew shares, which have risen 40% since Nawana's appointment last year, fell 8.2% on Monday.
PRODUCT DIVISIONS
Nawana had focused on boosting revenue and profitability by realigning the 160-year-old company's operations, concentrating on product divisions rather than geographies.
He was former head of U.S. diagnostics company Alere - where he earned $8.6 mln in 2016 - and overhauled more than half of Smith+Nephew's leadership team. He hired heads for the company's main divisions of sports medicine, orthopaedics and wound management to speed up product development.
Results came quickly as the company reported higher than expected half-year profit and boosted its 2019 revenue forecast in July.
Analysts expect Smith+Nephew's revenue to rise more than 4% this fiscal year, compared with the 0.8% to 3% growth the company has had over the last three years.
Smith+Nephew is looking to Diggelmann, with more than 20 years in the orthopedics and diagnostics sectors, to continue revenue growth by building on Nawana's strategy. He has already had a hand in many decisions having been a board member since March last year.
""We expect (Diggelmann) to pursue a strategy of improving operational execution, something any competitor of Roche Diagnostics would say he did extremely well,"" Berenberg analyst Tom Jones said.
High executive pay has become a controversial issue in Britain, highlighted by outsized awards such as a $100 million pounds bonus to Jeff Fairburn, chief executive of housebuilder  Persimmon  (L:PSN). The company said in November he would leave after deciding criticism of the award had become a distraction.
Regulations introduced in January mean listed companies with over 250 employees will have to disclose the ratio of CEO pay to the rest of the company's workforce, in a move the government said would make companies justify the pay of top bosses."

Johnson's opponents are hoping to add an amendment that would bind the UK into a customs union.
""The opposition will find it harder to filibuster the government agenda here and make an amendment for a customs union which was seen as way to obstruct the passing of the deal,"" said Morten Lund
""It looks like if they don't get the customs union through, they might pass the deal that's why the sterling is moving higher.""

1494,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 07:33AM ET</span>",JPMorgan Warns U.S. Money-Market Stress to Get Worse,"(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. says the money-market stress that sent short-term borrowing rates surging last month is likely to get much worse despite the Federal Reserve’s attempts to inject billions of dollars into the financial system.
The Fed has offered overnight loans and started buying up to $60 billion of U.S. Treasury bills a month in an effort to ease pressure in the vast repo market, where banks typically lend their assets in exchange for short-term financing. Secured lending rates shot up in late September, with analysts pointing to scarcity of interbank reserves as well as regulations that limits the size of bank balance sheets and their repo-lending capacity as the potential culprits.
JPMorgan says it’s not convinced the Fed has resolved the issues in the funding markets, according to a note from analysts led by Joshua Younger in New York. Funding pressures resurfaced last week even after primary dealers, firms approved to trade directly with the Fed, took all of the available overnight liquidity from the central bank and sold it as many T-bills as possible.
“Given the benefits of our newfound perspective, we recommend viewing these moves as highlighting the limitations of the Fed’s chosen solution to their operational issues,” the analysts wrote. “With year-end coming up, this is all likely to get much worse, in our view, before it gets better.”
The overnight liquidity provided by the Fed goes directly to primary dealers, whereas those most in need of it are the non-primary dealers, the JPMorgan analysts wrote. The success of the program therefore depends on how much of the liquidity is passed along, but primary dealers are deterred from doing so by rules specifying how much capital they must hold to protect against losses.
Meanwhile, a preliminary analysis of balance sheets at the largest banks based on their third-quarter results suggests they may have to cut back on repo activity even more at year-end to avoid liquidity charges.
“What new permanent reserves are being delivered to the banking system should face the same frictions -- both from balance sheet constraints and intraday liquidity requirements -- that generated these issues in the first place,” the JPMorgan analysts said.
JPMorgan’s note follows similar warnings from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., who have also attributed September’s funding stresses to factors including post-financial crisis bank regulation. Even after the Fed’s latest moves to ease the log-jam in funding markets, “intermediation bottlenecks remain,” Goldman Sachs said.
Analysts at sell-side banks have argued for the creation of a “standing repo facility” by the Fed that would allow banks to continuously exchange their securities with the central bank in exchange for cash. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said his bank -- still one of the biggest players in the repo market -- was unable to calm, or profit from, the dislocation in funding markets last month because of regulation.
The JPMorgan analysts recommend investors use futures markets to position for the spread between Fed Funds rate and repo to widen in December, as this will capture year-end funding stress. This has been a popular way for traders to play the funding squeeze, with a surge in activity in these contracts seen following September’s repo spike."

Earnings for S&P 500 (SPX) companies are expected to have fallen 3.1% in the third quarter from a year ago, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
A recent rise in volatility in currency markets from near five-year lows has revived some interest in guarding against currency risk, but firms' hedging activity remains relatively weak, analysts said.

A rallying dollar typically hurts profits for U.S. multinational companies, making their foreign currency revenues worth less in dollar terms.
At the end of the third quarter, the dollar was up more than 6% against the euro (EUR=) compared to a year ago.
While there is no consolidated data on hedging activity, anecdotal evidence suggests corporate hedging appetite is light at best, analysts said.
Trade-related headlines and the associated moves in the yuan and the yen have spurred some degree of rise in hedging activity in Asian currencies, but for the majors - the most heavily traded currencies - there is little rush to hedge, analysts said.
The  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) FX Volatility Index , which slipped to a five-year low in early July, jumped as high as 8.11 by mid-August amid rising trade-related tensions.
However, the index has slipped since then and was at 6.8 on Friday, 2 points shy of its 5-year average.
Muted volatility in the currency market tends to cause companies to turn complacent when it comes to managing currency risk, Wolfgang Koester, senior strategy officer at treasury and financial management firm Kyriba said.
Traders agree. While the pickup in currency moves in August sparked some discussions around FX risk management, companies are not rushing to pour money into hedges just yet.
""We're definitely having more discussions with clients around the currency swings but so far they haven't seen any noticeable uptick in hedging,"" said Minh Trang, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank.
Such reticence in hedging might cost companies, history suggests.
For those North American companies that quantify the effect on their results from currency fluctuations, the collective hit in the second quarter was $21.01 billion, according to a Kyriba report released on Thursday.
That marked the third straight quarter that the negative impact on these companies has totaled north of $20 billion, the longest such streak in more than a decade, according to Kyriba.
(Graphic: Negative currency impact to North American cos, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7588/7519/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
Whether companies ramp up hedging activity depends on the fate of ongoing trade-related negotiations between the world's largest economies, analysts said.
""So far, much of the trade war rhetoric remains contained. If that escalated outside of the vacuum, for example, it would be more concerning and probably create more market volatility,"" said Silicon Valley Bank's Trang.
Persistent volatility would in turn spark a renewed interest and urgency in guarding against adverse currency moves.
""The higher that implied volatility sits and for longer, the more likely it is that the conversation around hedging is going to rise at the boardroom level,"" Schamotta said."

Capco’s shares rose 8% in London on Monday, valuing the firm at 2.3 billion pounds ($2.8 billion). The stock had lost nearly half its value from its 2015 peak before today’s gains as the company struggled to find buyers for its holdings in the Earls Court district of London.
Candy has held early stage talks with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund about a joint move to take over CapCo, the Sunday Times reported over the weekend. Nicholas and his brother Christian are the developers responsible for the Qatari-backed luxury One Hyde Park apartments in London’s Belgravia neighborhood.
There’s no certainty that an offer will be made, according to a statement on Monday from Candy Ventures, the investment company controlled by Nicholas. The group will make an announcement by Nov. 18 of its intention.
CapCo has struggled with its Earls Court holdings as London’s prime real estate market endures the longest slump in decades. Independent valuers have cut the price of land in the capital’s upmarket district since 2015. The company has been weighing the sale of the land, which has planning permission for about 7,500 homes, but so far the bids have all come in below book value.
CapCo said in July it planned to spin off its holdings in the London tourist and shopping haven of Covent Garden as a separate listed company after it couldn’t find buyers for its assets in the Earls Court district. The separation is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
The value of Capco’s stake in land in the Earls Court district was 389 million pounds as of June 30, down 15.9% from December."

Yields on benchmark South African government notes are at their highest in three weeks, trumped only by junk-rated Nigeria, Turkey and Lebanon among 29 major emerging markets. Rand-denominated sovereign debt has lost 3% for dollar investors this half, the worst performance after Colombia and Argentina. Foreigners have dumped a net 25 billion rand ($1.7 billion) of the country’s bonds this year, cutting their holdings to 37% of the total, from 43% less than 18 months ago.
The rand has weakened 4.6% in the half to date, and is among the five worst-performing developing-nation currencies versus the dollar. Speculative long-rand contracts retreated to the lowest level in more than three months last week, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. When it comes to the cost of insuring South Africa’s debt against default, only Turkey and Argentina are more expensive.
Eskom, which supplies about 95% of the country’s power, has 450 billion rand ($30.5 billion) of debt and is surviving on state bailouts after massive cost overruns at two partially completed coal-fired power plants. The country endured four days of controlled blackouts last week to prevent total collapse of the grid. Power shortages and policy uncertainty have damped economic growth and plunged business confidence to multi-decade lows as investors await the government’s turnaround plan for the utility.
“These outages threaten South Africa’s fragile growth profile,” Siobhan Redford, a Johannesburg-based analyst at Firstrand Bank Ltd., said in a client note. “Clarity and certainty on plans for Eskom -- both in terms of financing needs and returning to a more sustainable power generation profile -- are vital in boosting the confidence of both domestic and offshore investors.”
South Africa will “soon” announce the appointment of a permanent chief executive officer for the utility and “shortly” release a special paper on the path the CEO and a strengthened board should take, President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a statement on Monday, in which he described Eskom’s financial situation as “untenable.”
“The sheer scale of Eskom’s debt is daunting,” Ramaphosa said. “Further bailouts are putting pressure on an already constrained fiscus.”
Lingering Uncertainty
The bailouts will probably widen South Africa’s budget deficit to the biggest since the financial crisis, threatening the country’s last remaining investment-grade credit rating at Moody’s Investors Service, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. Moody’s is scheduled to review the assessment on Nov. 1, days after the mid-term budget is presented to lawmakers.
A risk premium was priced in to the rand and local debt partly due to weak economic fundamentals and uncertainty on the future of Eskom, the medium-term budget policy statement and the credit assessment from Moody’s, said Elna Moolman, a Johannesburg-based economist at Standard Bank Group Ltd.
Last week, the government published its latest Integrated Resource Plan, which maps out the energy mix for the next decade. It includes a switch to more green energy as the country, which sources most of its electricity from coal, faces pressure to meet emissions-reduction targets.
South Africa will develop a framework to take aging coal-fired plants out of service, Ramaphosa said. While this will present challenges for communities and workers where fossil fuel-powered energy generation takes place, “it also presents opportunities for those affected to have access to technologies that are more cost-effective and better for human health.”

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets started the week in bright mood, led by bank stocks amid upbeat comments from China on its trade dispute with the U.S. and ongoing confidence that the Brexit saga is moving towards its conclusion.
Over the weekend, Chinese vice-premier and top trade negotiator Liu He was quoted as saying that there had been substantial progress on resolving differences with the U.S. in recent talks.
“Stopping the escalation of the trade war benefits China, the U.S and the whole world. It’s what producers and consumers alike are hoping for,” Liu said in a speech that was interpreted by many as preparing the public for the confirmation of a “phase-1” deal to de-escalate the dispute.
Markets were also sustained by hopes that Prime Minister Boris Johnson can force his EU withdrawal bill through parliament, having backed away from forcing a vote on it on Saturday. Getting the bill passed would end the short-term uncertainty over Britain’s formal departure from the bloc but would still leave large, longer-term questions over the U.K.’s future access to the EU’s single market unanswered.
By 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 0.4% at 393.24, just a whisker below the 17-month high that it hit last week. The U.K. FTSE 100 was up less than 0.1%, thanks to sterling strength, while the German DAX was up 0.6% and the Italian FTSE MIB was up 0.4%.
Markets are benefiting from some recent upgrades out of Wall Street. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) turning more bullish on the region last week and   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS) analysts reportedly upgrading European banks to overweight at the weekend.
Bank stocks were among the biggest gainers in early trading, led by Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) with a 3.9% gain and  Danske Bank , up 3.0%. Six of the biggest seven gainers in the Euro Stoxx 50 were also banks, Santander (MC:SAN) also catching the eye with a plan to launch a nationwide online deposit-taking platform in the U.S., a step that would greatly increase its presence in that market.
More than anything, Morgan Stanley’s call is a valuation-based play on a bombed-out sector. Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) trades at only one-quarter of the book value of its assets, while the sector as a whole trades at 0.64 times book, according to data compiled by Investing.com. Few trade at more than 11 times this year’s expected earnings, while banks such as   Intesa Sanpaolo   (MI:ISP), ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd),   Natixis   (PA:CNAT) and   Societe Generale   (PA:SOGN) offer dividends of over 8%. Nordea (HE:NDAFI) and  Danske Bank  (CSE:DANSKE) offer even higher yields of over 10%, albeit against a background of looming changes to regulation that may force them to cut their payouts."
1503,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 05:11AM ET</span>",European shares rise amid Brexit tussle as focus shifts to earnings,"By Agamoni Ghosh and Lisa Pauline Mattackal
(Reuters) - European shares rose on Monday with investors turning their focus to earnings, while remaining hopeful that Britain would be able to avoid a disorderly exit from the European Union.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will again try to put his Brexit deal to a vote in parliament later in the day after he was forced by his opponents to send a letter seeking a delay from the European Union.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.3% after finishing nearly flat last week, hurt by some weak quarterly results and conflicting Brexit headlines.
London's FTSE 100 (FTSE) lagged as the pound recovered from its earlier losses to climb higher.
""Mostly, the expectation is that they'll cobble together some sort of a deal, said Will James, senior investment director, European equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
With just 10 days left until the Oct. 31 deadline, the exit is again in disarray as Britain's political class argue over whether to leave with a deal, exit without a deal or hold another referendum.
Most sub-sectors were in the black led by banks (SX7P) and autos (SXAP), but defensive plays including healthcare (SXDP) and real estate (SX86P) lagged the broader market.
""There's a degree of fatigue, because markets are used to an idea now that they are one step forward, and considering they have been so volatile, people are seeking value in areas that haven't performed really well,"" James said.
 Tomra Systems  (OL:TOM) gained 13% to top the STOXX 600 after reporting strong quarterly results, including an all-time high order intake.
More third-quarter earnings for European firms are scheduled this week, with UK-listed RBS (L:RBS) and  Barclays  (L:BARC) kicking off bank earnings.
Companies listed on the STOXX 600 are expected to report a 3.7% drop in third-quarter earnings, worse than the 3% fall expected a week ago, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Among other stocks, ProSiebenSat.1 Media (DE:PSMGn) rose nearly 5% after Slovak investor Patrik Tkac disclosed a 3.6% stake in the German broadcaster, a move that could rekindle talk of consolidation in the European television industry.

On the other hand, the Berlin government's move to freeze rents put real estate companies such as Deutsche Wohnen (DE:DWNG), Ado Properties (DE:ADJ) and Vonovia (DE:VNAn) under pressure."
1504,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 04:21AM ET</span>",Berlin rent freeze prompts Deutsche Wohnen share slide,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Deutsche Wohnen (DE:DWNG) and other German property companies' shares were hit on Monday by Berlin city government's approval of a plan to freeze rents in the German capital for five years.
Shares in Deutsche Wohnen, the largest private landlord in Berlin, fell by as much as 4.5% in reaction to the blueprint approved on Friday by the Berlin Senate, which also includes capping subletting contracts.
The plan will be sent to parliament this month, where it is expected to be approved and will go into effect in January 2020.
Deutsche Wohnnen shares were trading 3.6% lower at 0714 GMT, while shares in Vonovia (DE:VNAn), Grand City Properties (DE:GYC), TAG Immobilien (DE:TEGG) and LEG Immobilien (DE:LEGn) were also down.
Under the plan, initially drafted in June, rents will be frozen for five years from June 18, 2019, with the possibility of an inflation-related increase of about 1.3% only allowed from 2022 and very limited hikes allowed to pay for modernizations.
Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothaeusler said the agreement reached by Berlin's governing parties was slightly watered down from a previous draft and he expected listed companies in the sector would have to provide guidance on its impact.
Rents in Berlin, for long far cheaper than in other major European cities, have more than doubled since 2008 as around 40,000 people a year have moved to the German capital, where some 85% of residents rent rather than own homes.
Opponents of the rent freeze say the policy could worsen Germany’s housing crisis as it would scare off real estate investors eager to build in urban centers.
But the Social Democrats, which form Berlin's government together with the Greens and far-left Die Linke, and are Chancellor Angela Merkel's junior coalition partners on the federal level, have raised the idea of a national rent freeze.
This resonated in the most populous European Union country, where most people rent and only 46% are homeowners."

The opening at Haneda Airport, which is closer to central Tokyo than Narita airport, comes as Virgin Australia's new CEO Paul Scurrah looks to rejig the loss-making airline's route network to better compete against deep-pocketed rival Qantas.
Haneda Airport has a limited number of slots and pinned the two Australian carriers up against each other for the lucrative opportunity. Qantas had applied for both slots, while Virgin Australia applied for just the one.
A final decision by IASC will come sometime after it closes a submission deadline on Oct. 24 about its draft call, according to its statement issued on Monday.
Virgin Australia, which is trying to raise debt to fund the full takeover of its frequent flyer program, said in an emailed statement it plans to use its allocated slot to operate a daily service between Brisbane and Haneda from March next year.
The airline plans to codeshare with ANA Holdings Inc (T:9202) on flights between Australia and Japan. 
Virgin Australia, however, did not say where the aircraft will come from. Scurrah declined previously to rule out cutting flights to Hong Kong as part of its route and fleet review. 
Australia's competition regulator earlier this month had backed Virgin's application for a slot, citing competition concerns if Qantas were to get both.
The draft decision comes ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games set to begin next summer.
IASC, in its draft, said the Japanese government released 100 extra aircraft arrivals and departures per day at Haneda, aimed solely at international flights. 
A Qantas spokesman said his airline looked forward to operating more flights to Haneda.

""We'll confirm whether these flights will operate from Melbourne or Sydney shortly,"" he said in an emailed statement.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks edged up on Monday as Chinese shares reversed early losses, supported by hopes for progress in resolving the U.S.-China trade war, while sterling slipped after the British parliament delayed a crucial vote on a Brexit withdrawal deal.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.25%. Chinese shares (CSI300) advanced 0.31%, while Japan's Nikkei (N225) rose 0.30%.
The pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures (STXEc1) were up 0.22%, German DAX futures (FDXc1) 0.19% and FTSE futures (FFIc1) just 0.04%.
The pound slipped from a five-month high against the dollar and the euro after the British parliament forced Prime Minister Boris Johnson to seek a delay to an Oct. 31 deadline for Britain's departure from the bloc.
The vote for an extension dealt a blow to optimism that a deal agreed last week would ensure Brexit happens with little economic disruption.
Oil futures fell as lingering economic growth concerns and excess supplies of crude prompted speculators to trim their long positions.
The Chinese stock market appeared to take some encouragement from comments by Chinese vice premier Liu He on Friday that Beijing will work with the United States to address each other's concerns, and that stopping the trade war would be good for both sides and the world.
Also on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he thinks a trade deal between the United States and China will be signed by the time Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings take place in Chile on Nov. 16-17.
Shares in Hong Kong also got a lift after Chinese bourses revised rules to allow mainland investors to buy Hong Kong-listed dual-class shares for the first time.
""We've had some positive news from Liu, and allowing Chinese investors direct access to dual-listed Hong Kong shares is a another positive,"" said Sean Darby, global equity strategist at Jefferies in Hong Kong.
""There is still a lot of money on the sidelines, and there are only eight or nine weeks left to put that money to work before we end the year. I expect markets to remain bid.""
U.S. stock futures (ESc1) rose 0.22% in Asia as investors brace for high-profile earnings this week from  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Amazon.com (O:AMZN) and others.
The S&P 500 fell 0.4% on Friday partly due to worries about fallout from the U.S.-China trade war.
The 15-month long dispute over China's trade and industrial policies has shown few signs ending despite several rounds of talks.
Financial markets have been whipsawed over this period as a steady increase in tit-for-tat tariffs have slowed global trade and raised the risk of recession for some countries.
Underscoring the damage, Japan's exports fell in September for the 10th straight month, while South Korea's exports for the first 20 days of October dived 19.5% year-on-year, data on Monday showed.
Hong Kong shares (HSI) erased early losses to rise 0.26%.
Chinese bourses on Friday revised rules that would allow Hong Kong-listed dual-class shares to be included in the Stock Connect scheme for the first time, which boosted shares of popular tech companies  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810) and  Meituan Dianping  (HK:3690) on Monday.
The rule change, which will take effect on Oct. 28, could be a positive for Hong Kong shares, which have been battered during months of often violent protest against Chinese rule of the former British colony.

The pound fell 0.6% to $1.2907 and was off about 0.4% to 86.47 pence per euro.
The British government insists Brexit will take place on Oct. 31, but uncertainty over how British lawmakers will respond could weigh on sentiment for sterling.
The leader of the House of Commons says the government plans to put the new Brexit deal to a debate and vote on Monday, but it is unclear if the speaker of the House will let this happen.
Elsewhere in the currency markets, the dollar edged 0.1% higher to $1.1158 per euro (EUR=EBS) rose slightly to 108.53 yen .
U.S. crude (CLc1) fell 0.22% to $53.66 a barrel. Brent crude (LCOc1) fell 0.27% to $59.26 per barrel.
Money managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to Oct. 15, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.
Long bets on U.S. crude have dropped sharply in the last two weeks after a spate of weak economic figures worldwide fanned concerns about global energy demand.
Treasury prices fell in Asia. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes (US10YT=RR) rose to 1.7607%.
Gold , often considered safe-haven asset, was little changed at $1,490.60 per ounce."

The job cuts at the Swiss bank started last week and were centred on both ""front and back office"" positions in the trading and investment banking divisions of the global bank, said the person, who declined to be named.
UBS said in September that it would combine its global markets and banking businesses in a move to pare back its management structure and revamp its flagging market share.
As part of that move, the bank's main equities unit will be merged with its smaller foreign exchange, rates and credit trading (FRC) operations to form a single 'Global Markets' securities and trading unit.
Ros Stephenson and Javier Oficialdegui were named global co-heads of the newly renamed Global Banking unit, overseeing global M&A, IPOs and capital markets activities. 
The major Asian financial centres of Hong Kong and Singapore, which hold the majority of UBS Asian workforces, would be most impacted by the latest round of redundancies while positions were also cut in Sydney and Tokyo, the person said.
Most of the front line investment banking changes were limited to junior staff, he added.
UBS has 10,000 people employed in Asia and a bank spokesman declined to comment on the most recent round of job cuts.
Bloomberg reported earlier on Monday that UBS was cutting about 40 jobs in Asia Pacific.

1512,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 01:12AM ET</span>","Boeing expresses regret over ex-pilot's 737 MAX messages, faults simulator","By Eric M. Johnson and David Shepardson
SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Sunday it understood the outcry over leaked messages from a former test pilot over erratic software behavior on its 737 MAX jet two years before recent crashes, and added it was still investigating what they meant.
The world's largest planemaker, under growing pressure to explain what it knew about 737 MAX problems before it entered service, said it had not been able to speak directly to former employee Mark Forkner but echoed his lawyer's subsequent claims that the problems were linked to a faulty simulator.
The role of the simulator has emerged as a crucial issue since the 2016 messages surfaced on Friday, since investigators will want to know whether erratic movements reported by the pilot meant Boeing was aware of problems on the aircraft itself or only in the artificial cockpit.
The FAA on Friday ordered Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg to give an ""immediate"" explanation for the delay in turning over the ""concerning"" document, which Boeing discovered some months ago.
In the messages from November 2016, then-chief technical pilot Forkner tells a colleague the so-called MCAS anti-stall system - the same one linked to deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia - was ""running rampant"" in a flight simulator session.
At another point he says: ""I basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly).""
The messages, first reported by Reuters, prompted a new call in Congress for Boeing to shake up its management as it scrambles to rebuild trust and lift an eight-month safety ban of its fastest-selling plane.
""We understand entirely the scrutiny this matter is receiving, and are committed to working with investigative authorities and the U.S. Congress as they continue their investigations,"" Boeing said in its statement on Sunday.
Boeing said it informed the FAA about its decision to expand MCAS to low speeds. The FAA also observed MCAS operation in the low-speed configuration during certification flight testing, from August 2016 through January 2017, Boeing said.
The instant messages prompted harsh reactions from several Democratic lawmakers in Washington, with Representative Peter DeFazio saying, ""This is no isolated incident.""
""The outrageous instant message chain between two Boeing employees"" suggests ""Boeing withheld damning information from the FAA,"" DeFazio, who chairs the U.S. House Transportation Committee, said on Friday.
Muilenburg, who was stripped of his chairman title by the company's board nine days ago, is set to testify before the committee on Oct. 30.
'UNDUE PRESSURE'
DeFazio's committee also obtained details of a 2016 Boeing survey that found nearly 40% of 523 employees handling safety certification work perceived ""potential undue pressure"" from managers, such as bullying or coercion.
Other top concerns include ""schedule pressure"" and ""high workload,"" though 90% of the employees said they were comfortable raising concerns about ""undue pressure"" to management, according to a copy of the Boeing presentation of the survey results seen by Reuters on Sunday.
The presentation was obtained by the committee's investigators and not among a trove of documents handed over the committee by Boeing itself, a person briefed on the matter said.
Evidence of ""undue pressure"" was also pinpointed by a group of international regulators reviewing the 737 MAX certification.
A Boeing spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the survey results.
SIMULATOR FLAWS
On Sunday, Boeing said it has not been able to speak to Forkner directly about his understanding of the document.
""He has stated through his attorney that his comments reflected a reaction to a simulator program that was not functioning properly and that was still undergoing testing,"" Boeing said.
""The simulator software used during the Nov. 15 session was still undergoing testing and qualification and had not been finalized,"" Boeing added.
Reuters reported on Friday that the simulator had a number of software problems, citing a former Boeing test pilot who analyzed the transcript and who had direct knowledge of the flight simulator at the time.
Such calibration problems may have contributed in some way to Forkner's observations and conclusions about MCAS' behavior, the former pilot, and a second former Boeing engineering employee, Rick Ludtke, said.
Boeing's statement was released as its board of directors and top executives from its airplanes division and supply chain gathered in San Antonio, Texas for previously scheduled meetings on Sunday and Monday.
The board meetings come as pressure mounts on the Chicago-based company not only from the regulatory and criminal investigations stemming from the crashes but also from the financial burden caused by the jet's safety ban and continued high production.
Several industry sources said there was speculation inside the company of significant job cuts as it continues to experience a cash drain. The 737 production rate may also have to come down if regulators further delay the MAX's return to service, the people said."

1514,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 12:20AM ET</span>",China Surveillance Giant Expects Client Losses From U.S. Ban,"(Bloomberg) -- Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. warned it may lose customers in overseas markets because of its U.S. blacklisting, underscoring the extent to which curbs on the sale of American technology may hurt the world’s largest video surveillance business.
Executives at the Chinese camera provider, which reported profit in line with estimates, said clients may hold off on purchases while they gauge the impact of those restrictions. But the company is large enough to withstand U.S. sanctions and develop its own technology in the longer term, they said. Its own home market remains a rich vein of revenue as the U.S. business shrinks, a trend that may persist, Huang Fanghong, a Hikvision senior vice president, said on a call Saturday. Its shares gained as much as 5.4% Monday -- the most in more than a month on an intraday basis.
Hikvision found itself in the cross-hairs of the Trump administration this month after it joined other Chinese companies -- including Huawei Technologies Co. -- on an Entity List that prevents American firms from supplying it with components and software. The seller of video cameras used around the world in surveillance was accused of involvement in human rights violations against Muslim minorities in the far-western region of Xinjiang. On Monday, brokerages including  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and CICC cut their projections on Hikvision’s 2020 earnings growth.
“While management says they expect the worst is over, we believe some customers may have concerns on the impact of the Entity List,” Citigroup analysts wrote.
Hikvision executives say they had anticipated the action and stockpiled enough key parts to keep operations going for some time. The company has also said it didn’t foresee major impact on its business as a result of the ban.
In Huawei’s case, for instance, some suppliers including  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU). developed workaround solutions to the prohibition. Most of Hikvision’s American suppliers are continuing to do business with it, while abiding by export regulations and without the need for special licenses, according to Huang.
“We have made a great deal of preparations, from a year ahead of the ban,” Huang said. “There’s no way for us to fully discuss the impact from the entity list in 10 days. We need more time to talk to our suppliers and customers. A steady component supply is key in this process, no matter if we decide to use original materials or a replacement design.”
The U.S. decision, which came on the eve of sensitive trade negotiations, takes President Donald Trump’s economic war against China in a new direction: the first time his administration has cited human rights as a reason for action. It deals a potentially heavy long-term blow against Hikvision, which has steadily switched to Chinese-made components in recent years but still relies on the likes of Intel, ON Semiconductor Corp. and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Inc., particularly for higher-end chips.
Still, as much as 80% of Hikvision’s sales are insulated from the U.S. ban, analysts Charles Shum and Simon Chan of Bloomberg Intelligence wrote in an Oct. 8 note.
“Hikvision’s sales may continue to rise over the next year despite the Trump administration’s decision,” they wrote. “It can also source alternative parts, though with a weaker performance, from local suppliers in the medium term.”
Hikvision reported Friday that net income grew 17% to 3.81 billion yuan ($538 million) in the September quarter, while revenue grew 23%. The company forecast growth of 5% to 20% in net income this year.
Hikvision was added to the Entity List alongside SenseTime Group Ltd. and Megvii Technology Ltd., two giant enterprises Beijing is counting on to spearhead advances into a revolutionary technology. Hikvision doesn’t play as outsized a role in China’s ambitions but it’s a key partner to Beijing as well as governments around the world. Its cameras are used from Paris to Bangkok and Urumqi, and are considered pivotal to crime prevention as well as helping build “smart cities” or networked urban environments.
Longer term, U.S. sanctions threaten to crimp some of the explosive growth Hikvision has managed this decade, in large part due to China’s effort to put in place the world’s largest surveillance and monitoring network. The company may find itself short of the components it needs to build advanced systems, unless Chinese chipmakers succeed in developing more advanced chips -- another of Beijing’s stated policy ambitions in tech.
Thanks to cheap but capable cameras, the Chinese company has enjoyed double-digit growth over the past eight years. Demand for its surveillance cameras, video storage and data analysis services has boomed particularly in its home market. Overseas, the company competes against Canon, Hanwha Techwin and Bosch.

Pays Heavy Price for Unrest in HK Amid Lack of Insurance Coverage,"Investing.com - MTR Corp Ltd (HK:0066), Hong Kong’s subway operator, will probably have to pay for the bill for damages suffered over the past four months during the city’s political unrest.
Credit-rating firm Moody’s Investors Service said in a report that the operator may not be fully covered by its insurance and that its credit profile has likely taken a hit as a result.
MTR is accused by anti-government protesters of being in lockstep with the government and police and has seen its stations vandalized and its corporate image tarnished. More than half of the railway stations were severely damaged and their services suspended during violent protests on Sunday.
Over the weekend, police and protesters exchanged volley of tear gas and petrol bombs while multiple Chinese banks and shops deemed to be pro-Beijing were wrecked. 
It was estimated back in early September that MTR has suffered damages of HK$50 million. 
Share prices of the company last traded at HK$44.10 by 11:18 PM ET (03:18 GMT), falling by about 10% since Hong Kong’s unrest began in early June. "

The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component both slipped 0.1% by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT).
The National Bureau of Statistics data showed Monday that China’s new-home prices rose 0.53% in September from August in 70 major cities. Meanwhile, Beijing unexpectedly kept its one-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR) unchanged at 4.2%. The five-year LPR was fixed at 4.85%, also unchanged from September.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 0.2%.
The Nikkei 225 also gained 0.2%. Japan’s exports in September fell 5.2% year-on-year, Ministry of Finance data showed on Monday, dragged down by car parts and semiconductor production equipment.
South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 0.1%. Data from the Korea Customs Service showed that the country’s exports in the first 20 days of October were down 20% from a year earlier. 
In the U.K., politicians failed to deliver the Brexit vote that had been promised at the weekend. The country’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, is now legally bound to ask the EU for another extension to negotiations.
On the Sino-U.S. trade front, China’s Vice Premier Liu He confirm that Beijing and Washington “have made substantial progress in many aspects” and that they have “laid an important foundation for a phase one agreement.”

BOSTON (Reuters) - Fallout from Kenneth Fisher's alleged insensitive remarks about women escalated on Friday when a large Iowa pension plan cut ties with the money manager, whose firm has lost more than $1 billion in assets under management in the last week.
The Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System was the latest to notify Fisher Investments that it will terminate its contract with his firm. Fisher Investments manages $386 million of IPERS' $34 billion trust fund.
Iowa joins pension funds run for Boston, the state of Michigan and Philadelphia in cutting ties with Fisher.
""IPERS staff has taken time to evaluate this situation, and it is our opinion that Mr Fisher's comments have damaged the credibility of the firm and its leadership,"" the Iowa pension plan said in a statement.
""As a result, the risk to IPERS is that the firm could lose investment talent, and/or it may be unable to recruit high caliber talent in the future. Furthermore, the negative publicity will probably continue to be a major distraction to Fisher investment personnel.""
Fisher Investments did not immediately comment.
In a video posted Oct. 9 on Twitter, Alex Chalekian, chief executive of a financial advisory firm, called attention to comments Fisher made at a financial conference last week.
Chalekian said Fisher made derogatory comments about genitalia, picking up girls and financier Jeffrey Epstein, among other topics. Epstein committed suicide in August while in jail awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
In a memo to his firm's employees sent to Reuters earlier this week by a spokesman, Fisher said: ""It pains me to know that my comments have caused you grief, concern, and indignation. I sincerely apologize.""
SEI Investments Co on Friday said it was reviewing its business relationship with Fisher.
SEI serves as a trustee and sponsor on investment portfolios managed by Fisher for dozens of retirement plans that have included Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) and Co, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota and Nextera Energy Inc, according to U.S. Department of Labor disclosures. 
""The comments made do not reflect SEI or our core values,"" the company said in a statement. ""As the trustee of certain trusts advised by (Fisher), our fiduciary duty requires us to focus on and protect the interests of the investors in those trusts. We are engaged in a due diligence review of (Fisher) and will make decisions that we believe to be in the best interests of investors after that process concludes.""
Several other clients of Fisher, including Fidelity Investments, have said they are reviewing whether to keep his firm as a money manager. 
The Kansas City Public School Retirement System, which has $78 million with Fisher Investments, will also review its relationship with the firm, Executive Director Christine Gierer said on Friday.
Gierer said she expects the situation will be discussed at the system's next board meeting, on Nov. 4.
Fisher's setbacks come in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which has exposed widespread sexual harassment or abuse of women in multiple spheres of American life and ended the careers of dozens of powerful men in media, politics, entertainment and business.

The company statement http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thomson-reuters-statement-on-ceo-succession-planning-300941671.html came after the Financial Times reported Thomson Reuters had begun a search for a new chief executive.
David Thomson, the company's chairman, said the board ""is fully supportive of Jim Smith and his management team. We are aligned on strategy and direction."" 
Smith said in a memo to employees he was actively involved in the succession planning process. 
""To be clear, I'm not planning to go anywhere soon,"" Smith said. ""Please know that when the time comes to hand over the reins, you will hear it from me.""
The Financial Times cited four unnamed sources as saying Thomson Reuters, which owns the Reuters news agency, had hired search firm Spencer Stuart to put together a list of internal and external candidates. The search was at an early stage, the newspaper said.
In a statement, Thomson Reuters said: ""The Board of Directors considers succession planning and benchmarking for all key executives a matter of good governance. Hence, the Board and management continuously assess internal candidates and work with search firms to scan the external market.""
Spencer Stuart declined to comment and a spokesman for Thomson Reuters declined to comment specifically on whether it had engaged Spencer Stuart. 

Smith oversaw the sale of a majority stake in the news and information provider's financial-data business to a Blackstone Group Inc-led (N:BX) consortium last year. Earlier this year, Blackstone agreed to sell the financial-data business, now called Refinitiv, to  London Stock Exchange  Group (L:LSE) for $27 billion.

1519,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2019 08:56PM ET</span>","Hong Kong firms, lacking riot insurance, pick up pieces from protest damage","By Sumeet Chatterjee and Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's businesses will likely foot the bill for vandalism inflicted over the past four months during the territory's most violent protests in living memory as few of them bought insurance coverage for riot damage, industry insiders said.
Businesses big and small have suffered smashed windows, graffiti and even fire for their perceived support of mainland China by activists concerned that the central government in Beijing is exerting increased control over the special administrative region at the cost of democratic freedoms.
Displaying a banner in support of the police - who protesters have complained of being heavy-handed - was enough to see a small video game shop in western New Territories vandalized four times this month.
""I don't know whether I'll get insurance compensation,"" said shop owner K.K. Man. ""There's a chance that I won't get compensation because the damage is due to social unrest... I don't think riot damage is covered.""
While businesses flood insurers with claims for such damage, few are likely to be fully compensated as Hong Kong insurance usually protects against events such as fire and natural disasters, such as typhoons.
Coverage for civil unrest, particularly for small and mid-sized firms, is uncommon, industry insiders said.
Hong Kong is a lucrative market for global insurers including American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG), AXA SA (PA:AXAF) and Zurich Insurance Group AG, with the value of premiums as a percentage of gross domestic product at 18.16%, second only to Taiwan in the Asia-Pacific region.
Total insurance premium volume in the territory last year rose 8.3% to $66 billion, the quickest growth rate in the advanced Asia-Pacific region that includes Australia, Japan and Singapore, a Swiss Re study showed.
Near term, Hong Kong insurers expect a surge in demand for coverage that includes riot damage, though profit is likely to suffer from payouts for event cancellations, a drop in demand for travel insurance and, more generally, economic downturn.
""Overall financial damage from these events will be quite significant and neither insurers nor most of the businesses would have prepared for something like this,"" said an insurance sector lawyer with a global law firm.
""So you will see a sharp rise in litigation around what's covered and what's not, as well as pressure on earnings of insurance companies because of a surge in claim settlements and a drop in premium income,"" the lawyer said.
The financial impact of the protests could not be determined with unrest ongoing, but two insurance executives said liabilities for insurers could run into millions of dollars.
The executives and the lawyer declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
UNLUCKY
Anti-government demonstrations have taken place on almost every weekend since June 9. On Sunday, riot police and protesters exchanged tear gas and petrol bombs as an illegal march descended into chaos, with hundreds of shops trashed and Chinese banks and metro stations targeted.
Retailer Best Mart 360 Holdings Ltd on Wednesday said as of Oct. 13, 59 of its stores had suffered damage during protests.
""The Group is discussing and handling with its insurance company,"" it said. ""In the event that the insurance company refuses to compensate or inadequately compensates its claims, the Group may be required to bear the corresponding economic losses.""
Best Mart did not identify its insurer or elaborate on why compensation might be refused. An external spokeswoman for the retailer declined to comment beyond the statement.

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - New large corporate planes that can fly farther and an industry push toward sustainable aviation fuels are seen as bright spots as the world's biggest business jet makers assemble in Las Vegas to showcase their offerings at the sector's largest gathering.
The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) annual corporate aircraft show kicks off on Tuesday against a backdrop of slowing global economic growth, trade tensions between the United States and China and Brexit uncertainties, factors seen softening demand for corporate jets in the next two years, industry executives and analysts say.
""We're optimistic but at the same time, in the short and medium term we have to be cautious,” said Gaetan Handfield, senior manager of marketing analysis for Honeywell (NYSE:HON) Aerospace. 
Honeywell’s 2019 business aviation outlook sees 7,600 new business jet deliveries worth $248 billion from 2020 to 2029, down 1 to 2 percentage points from the company’s 2018 forecast. 
Deliveries were up this year almost 13% during the first half of 2019, according to data from the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA).
Deliveries, expected to rise 7% in 2020 according to Honeywell, are being fueled by the ramp up of new models that offer longer-ranges and amenities such as beds and hot showers at 40,000 feet.
General Dynamics' Gulfstream, Bombardier, Textron's Cessna, Dassault Aviation and Embraer SA saw their order backlogs grow 7% during the first half of 2019, the first rise since the 2008 financial crisis, said aviation analyst Rolland Vincent.
An NBAA highlight this year could be the widely-expected launch of a new long-range jet by Gulfstream, which declined comment.
Buyers eager to make non-stop trips between far-flung cities like New York and Tokyo are looking for long-range jets. 
'CYCLICAL DECLINE'
Others are also prioritizing fuel efficiency, and encouraging the use of sustainable fuels and carbon-offsets at a time when the aviation industry faces ""flight shame"" protests by climate change activists.
Jetmakers will fly their aircraft into Las Vegas using a blend of biojetfuels, although industry usage of alternatives to kerosene remains limited.
In an industry where sales are usually aligned with economic growth, analysts remains cautious given uncertainty in Europe with Brexit, and in the United States, the world's largest market for business jets, where President Donald Trump faces an impeachment probe.
""New deliveries will ramp up (this year) due to a number of new products being introduced, only to begin a cyclical decline as world economic weakness further manifests itself,"" said aviation analyst Brian Foley.
U.S. economic growth is slowing in 2019, with economists forecasting growth this year of around 2.5%, below the Trump administration's 3% target.
Foley expects new sales to remain roughly flat next year, but sees softer demand in 2021 which will lead to planemakers delivering fewer planes a year later in 2022.
Brian Proctor, president of Dallas-based private jet consultancy Mente Group said sales of pre-owned planes are picking up after a slow start to the year, with some buyers looking to purchase by year's end to take advantage of favorable tax rules introduced last year by the Trump administration.
He said buyers want to purchase ahead of next year's U.S. presidential election under existing rules.
""Because of the uncertainty they are speeding up decisions because they want to know what the rules are,"" said Proctor, also chairman of the International Aircraft Dealers Association. 
Sales of pre-owned business jets are down 19% in volume for the first 8 months of 2019, on an annual basis, but the planes for sale are spending less time on the market, Vincent said.

""Buyers appear to be moving more quickly when they find the asset they are seeking,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), facing growing skepticism about its digital currency project Libra, on Sunday said the initiative could use cryptocurrencies based on national currencies such as the dollar, instead of the synthetic one it initially proposed.
David Marcus, who heads the Libra project for Facebook, told a banking seminar the group's main goal remained to create a more efficient payments system, but it was open to looking at alternative approaches for the currency token it would use.
""We could do it differently,"" he said. ""Instead of having a synthetic unit ... we could have a series of stablecoins, a dollar stablecoin, a euro stablecoin, a sterling pound stable coin, etc,"" Marcus told the panel.
""We could definitely approach this with having a multitude of stablecoins that represent national currencies in a tokenized digital form,"" he said. ""That is one of the options that should be considered.""
Marcus said he was not suggesting currency-pegged stablecoins were the group's new preferred option.
""What we care about is the mission and there are a number ways to go about this,"" Marcus told Reuters after the panel, adding that the Libra needed to ""demonstrate a lot of agility.""
The Facebook-led project suffered severe setbacks earlier this month, as major payment companies Mastercard Inc (N:MA) and  Visa Inc  (N:V) became the latest partners to quit the group behind the project.
Other key members that have pulled out included Stripe, eBay Inc (O:EBAY) and Booking Holdings Inc (O:BKNG) and  PayPal Holdings Inc  (O:PYPL).
Global policymakers and regulators have also worry that creation of a new synthetic global currency could upend the global financial system, threaten users' privacy, and facilitate money laundering.
Group of 20 finance leaders on Friday agreed to set strict regulations on cryptocurrencies and said such stablecoins should not be issued until various global risks were addressed.
Marcus told Reuters that Facebook was still aiming for a June 2020 launch of Libra, but acknowledged it could miss that target due to regulatory hurdles.
""We'll see. That's still the goal,"" Marcus told Reuters when asked if the recent departure of several major partners from the project would delay the planned 2020 launch.
""We've always said that we wouldn't go forward unless we have addressed all legitimate concerns and get proper regulatory approval. So it's not entirely up to us,"" he said."

Santiago and other Chilean cities have been engulfed by several days of rioting as protests over an increase in public transport costs prompted President Sebastian Pinera to declare a state of emergency.
Santiago governor Karla Rubilar confirmed that three people died in a supermarket in the capital that was set on fire by demonstrators on Saturday. 
""We regret to inform that according to preliminary information from Chilean police two people were found fatally burned in San Bernardo and a seriously injured person was moved to hospital where they died,"" she said in a tweet on Sunday. She did not name the supermarket.
Flights operated by Chile's biggest airlines LATAM and another, Sky Airline, were suspended or delayed on Sunday morning after a curfew, a public transport shutdown and continued rioting left flight crews struggling to get to work, Rubilar said.
Crowds of affected passengers were left stranded at the airport as a result.
LATAM Chile tweeted that due to the public order situation its flights into and out of Santiago were being affected. ""We will continue to adjust our itineraries of flights into and out of Santiago on October 20 and 21,"" the tweet said, adding that passengers should check their flights before going to the airport.

Lei's remarks come as the company faces intense competition in its home market from rival Huawei Technologies. Last month Xiaomi launched the Xiaomi Mi 9 Pro, the company’s first 5G-enabled phone for the domestic market. 
According to Lei, demand for the phone exceeded the company’s expectations and led to supply chain issues. The device’s reception has prompted Xiaomi to launch 5G models for the high, middle, and low-end price tiers next year.
“People in the industry fear that next year 4G models won’t sell, this is a step you have no choice but to take,” Lei said. “So we hope that operators can speed up their expansion of 5G base stations.”
Xiaomi’s share price has fallen steadily this past year as China’s smartphone market grows more competitive. In September the company announced it would plan a $1.5 billion share buyback.
In the second quarter of 2019, Xiaomi occupied 11.8% of China’s smartphone market, down from 13.9% one year prior according to research firm Canalys. 
All other top Chinese brands suffered declining sales volumes as consumers flocked to Huawei, driven in part by patriotism. The Shenzhen-based handset maker became the center of U.S.-China tensions in May when Washington effectively called for U.S. companies to cease supplying parts to it.

However, Xiaomi has enjoyed success in Europe, where it remains a relatively new player in the continent. The company’s market share in the region during the second quarter of 2019 hit 9.6%, up from 6.5% the year prior, making it one of the fastest growing phone brands in the region.

U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday charged Halkbank with taking part in a multi-billion-dollar scheme to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran.

""We would like to welcome additional partners in this area, which has great future potential,"" BMW boss Oliver Zipse told Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung (FAS) in an interview.
Collaborations as well as a financial investments were options for any future partners, he said, adding that customers want a wide choice across different brands.
The two carmakers have combined Daimler's Car2Go car-sharing business with BMW's DriveNow, ParkNow and ChargeNow businesses, with each holding 50% stake in the venture.
Mobility services include car sharing, parking and electric car charging services.
The head of the mobility venture resigned last month in what a media report described as a dispute over how much investment the business requires.
Zipse also told FAS that BMW aims to take Daimler's crown as the world's largest maker of luxury cars but added there was no target by when this should be achieved.

Carrying 50 passengers and crew on board, Qantas Flight 7879 on a new Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787-9 Dreamliner touched down in Sydney on Sunday morning after a 16,200-kilometre (10,066-mile) journey which lasted 19 hours 16 minutes.
""This is a really historic moment for Qantas, a really historic moment for Australian aviation and a really historic moment for world aviation,"" Qantas Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce, who took the flight, said after landing.
With demand for air travel rapidly growing and aircraft performance improving, carriers are increasingly looking into ultra-long-haul travel. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects the worldwide number of annual passengers to grow from 4.6 billion this year to 8.2 billion by 2037.
No commercial aircraft as of yet has the range to fly such an ultra-long haul with a full passenger and cargo load. To give the plane the needed range, the Qantas flight took off with maximum fuel, only a few passengers, restricted baggage load and no cargo.
The goal was to gather data, with a team of researchers to monitor, among other things, lighting, activity, sleep and consumption patterns of passengers, and crew melatonin levels. They also tracked the brain wave patterns of pilots, equipped for the flight with brain monitoring devices.
The aim of the research was, Qantas said in a statement, to increase health and wellness, minimize jet lag and identify optimum crew rest and work periods.
""The flight was very successful from two components - the first one was research,"" Qantas Captain Sean Golding said.
""And also the feat of distance - that flight last night was 16,200 kilometers. We were airborne for 19 hours and 16 minutes, and we landed here in Sydney with a comfortable 70 minutes of fuel.""
The airline also plans to test a nonstop flight from London to Sydney and expects to make a decision by the end of the year whether to start the routes, which would commence in 2022 or 2023."

(Reuters) - Boeing Co's (N:BA) board of directors and top executives from its airplanes division and supply chain were due to meet on Sunday in San Antonio, Texas, two days after the U.S. planemaker was plunged into a fresh crisis over its banned 737 MAX jet. 
The meeting comes as pressure mounts on the world's largest planemaker not only from investigations into the 737 MAX following two deadly crashes, but also from the financial burden caused by the jet's safety ban and continued high production. 
Several industry sources said there was speculation inside the company of significant job cuts as Boeing, unable to deliver 737 MAX planes to customers, continues to drain cash. 
And although Boeing has so far told suppliers it expects to maintain a production rate of 42 single-aisles monthly with plans to increase to a record level next near, rates may have to come down if regulators further delay the MAX's return to service, the people said.
The schedule for the board's face-to-face meetings was set for Sunday and Monday in San Antonio, one of the people said, two days before Boeing reports earnings on Oct. 23. 
The week after, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg - who was stripped of his job as board chairman eight days ago - is due to testify before U.S. Congress about the plane's development. 
In conjunction with the board meeting, top executives including Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief executive Kevin McAllister and Jenette Ramos, senior vice president of Manufacturing, Supply Chain & Operations, were due to fly on Sunday to Boeing's Kelly Field facility in San Antonio, where numerous 737 MAX jets are parked in storage, two of the people said.
A Boeing spokesman declined to comment on the board's agenda and the company's production or staffing levels.
Apart from those issues, the board is likely to discuss a series of 2016 internal messages, first reported by Reuters on Friday, in which a senior Boeing pilot said he might have unintentionally misled regulators.
The pilot also said the stall-prevention system known as MCAS - which investigators have linked to the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people - was ""running rampant"" during a simulator session.
The messages sent Boeing shares tumbling, prompted a demand by U.S. regulators for an immediate explanation, and a new call in Congress for Boeing to shake up its management.

Federal prosecutors aided by the FBI, the Transportation Department Inspector General and several blue-ribbon panels are also investigating the plane's approval.

(Reuters) - A  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) investment banker was released on bond and placed on leave by the firm after allegedly being involved in an insider trading scheme, a bank spokeswoman said on Saturday.
Bryan Cohen, a vice president at Goldman Sachs who works in the Consumer Retail industry group, was arrested early Friday on charges of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. He was also sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and accused of improperly using insider information about impending corporate deals.
Cohen, 33, of New York, was arraigned on Friday before a U.S. magistrate judge in Manhattan and released after he posted $250,000 and ordered to refrain from the ""conduct alleged,"" according to court records. A pre-trial hearing is set for Oct. 22.
Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Nicole Sharp said the firm is ""cooperating with the authorities on the situation regarding Mr. Cohen. Protecting client confidential information is our highest internal priority and we condemn this alleged behavior.""
A lawyer for Cohen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The SEC complaint also names a Greek citizen, George Nikas, 54, who has homes in New York and Athens and owns a restaurant chain ""GRK Fresh"" that includes locations in Manhattan. A lawyer for Nikas could not immediately be identified Saturday.
The complaint says the pair participated in a scheme that netted Nikas at least $2.6 million in illicit profits by trading shares in two companies. Cohen passed on non-public corporate deal information to an unnamed trader who in turn gave it to Nikas who used it to illegally trade securities, the SEC said.
Cohen got cash in exchange for information he gave the trader.
The trader and Nikas ""realized millions of dollars in illicit gains from trading the securities of at least two different public companies --  Syngenta  AG (OTC:SYENF) and Buffalo Wild Wings Inc -- in advance of news that these companies had been targeted for acquisition,"" the SEC said.
The SEC says Nikas profited from buying Syngenta securities in 2015 after first being passed information about  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) Co's proposal to acquire it and later about ChemChina's interest.
In October 2017, Cohen passed along that Arby's Restaurant Group was interested in acquiring Buffalo Wild Wings, the SEC said, prompting additional trades.
In June, former Goldman Sachs vice president Woojae Jung was sentenced to three months in prison for engaging in insider trading based on non-public information about several companies that were bank clients."

The rule change, which takes effect on Oct. 28, came 15 months after China and Hong Kong bourses started work towards including dual-class shares in the investment link following a rare public dispute over the issue.
Dual-class shares give greater voting rights to company founders over individual investors.
Under revised rules published late Friday separately by the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, stocks qualified for inclusion must meet certain thresholds in terms of liquidity, market cap and trading period.
For example, they must have a minimum listing history of six months plus 20 trading days on the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) (HK:0388), and a minimum market cap of HK$20 billion ($2.6 billion) on average during the 183 days prior to the vetting.
Xiaomi and Meituan, China's biggest platform for on-­demand services, both listed in Hong Kong last year with two classes of shares, after the Hong Kong exchange changed its rules to allow companies to do so. 
Days after Xiaomi's initial public offering (IPO), the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges said that they would not allow companies with two classes of shares to be included in Stock Connect, triggering a dispute with HKEX."

(Reuters) - U.S. oil major  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) said late on Friday it is optimistic about maintaining a presence in Venezuela even amid U.S. sanctions on the country and state oil company PDVSA as part of Washington's effort to oust President Nicolas Maduro. 
The company's remarks follow an earlier report by Bloomberg that said the United States is considering extending Chevron's waiver to operate in Venezuela with more limitations by granting the company a 90-day sanctions reprieve.
""We are a positive presence in Venezuela, and we are hopeful that General License 8C is renewed so that we can continue operations in the country for the long-term,"" Ray Fohr, a Chevron spokesman, told Reuters in an emailed statement. 
""We have dedicated investments and a large workforce who are dependent on our presence."" 
""General License No 8C"" is the license that authorizes transactions in Venezuela involving PDVSA and entities it owns, according to the website of the U.S. Department of Treasury. 
Chevron's future in Venezuela now depends on U.S. President Donald Trump, who must decide by Oct. 25 whether to renew the waiver allowing the company to keep operating in Venezuela despite U.S. sanctions. 
The Treasury Department aims to further limit Venezuela's crude production and is concerned that Chevron's joint venture projects in Venezuela are providing financing to help Maduro's socialist government pay back its debt to Russian oil company Rosneft PJSC, Bloomberg reported on Friday. This could encourage more loans in the future. 
The report added, however, that the United States also wants to maintain a presence in Venezuela's oil industry in case of a political transition. 
Chevron has been present in Venezuela for nearly 100 years. It opened its Caracas office in 1923, and first struck oil at the Boscan field in 1946. 
The Trump administration has several times imposed sanctions on Venezuela and sought to limit PDVSA's transactions to largely cut off Maduro's access to oil revenues, which account for most of the South American country's hard currency income. 

The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment late on Friday.

Bill Johnson, who became CEO of bankrupt PG&E Corp earlier this year, told an emergency meeting with the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) that recent power outages included lack of information and hardships that cannot be repeated.
But the day when preemptive power outages would no longer be necessary is still years away, he said.
""Eventually the technology will get us to a point where we don't need to be doing it,"" he said. ""This is probably a 10-year timeline to get to a point where it's really ratcheted down significantly.""
The state utilities regulator called the emergency meeting with senior PG&E executives after ordering the utility to take corrective actions related to its handling of the power outages, which have been criticized for being conducted on too large a scale with insufficient communication with customers.
""This is not hard,"" PUC President Marybel Batjer said during the meeting to the panel of PG&E executives assembled. ""You guys failed on so many levels on pretty simple stuff.""
PG&E cut off electricity to more than 730,000 homes and workplaces in northern California last week in a bid to reduce wildfire risks posed by extremely windy and dry weather.
The shutdown was unprecedented in its scope, and PG&E's website and call center were overwhelmed by customer traffic.
""I apologize for the hardship and the lack of information. This cannot happen again,"" Johnson said.
He said he expected the precautionary outages would decrease in size and scope each year.
To reduce the need for them, the utility will create smaller sections of wires so that shutoffs can be more targeted, increase vegetation management and use new materials to cover power lines, Johnson said.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday urged the company to provide credits or rebates to affected customers.
The outage is the latest in a string of events for which PG&E has received widespread public criticism. The utility filed for bankruptcy in January 2019, citing potential civil liabilities in excess of $30 billion from major wildfires linked to its transmission wires and other equipment."
1535,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2019 12:46AM ET</span>","Boeing 737 MAX test pilot grappled with simulator flaws, too","By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - In newly released instant messages from 2016, a top Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX test pilot tells a colleague that the jet's MCAS flight control system - the same one linked to two fatal crashes - was ""running rampant in the (simulator) on me.""
But the broader conversation appears to show the Boeing pilot was also grappling with a number of software problems with the flight simulator itself, according to a former Boeing test pilot who analyzed the transcript and who had direct knowledge of the flight simulator at the time.
Such calibration problems may have contributed in some way to then-chief technical pilot Mark Forkner's observations and conclusions about MCAS' behavior, the former pilot, and a second former Boeing engineering employee, Rick Ludtke, said.
The messages, first reported by Reuters, appear to be the first publicly known observations that MCAS behaved erratically during testing before the aircraft entered service.
They sent Boeing's shares tumbling, prompted a demand by U.S. regulators for an immediate explanation, and a new call in Congress for the world's largest planemaker to shake up its management.
At one point during the 9-minute conversation, Forkner tells colleague Patrik Gustavsson that he was in his hotel room ""with an ice cold grey goose"" after a session on a flight simulator earlier in the day.
The Nov. 16, 2016 conversation took place four months before the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration certified the MAX, the latest iteration of Boeing's 737 aircraft, and two years before deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people.
That simulator, likely supplied by  Textron Inc  (NYSE:TXT) company TRU Simulation + Training, was also still months away from winning FAA certification and had numerous technical problems that affected its performance, the former Boeing pilot said.
At one point in the exchange, Forkner tells his colleague the machine was ""pretty stable"" and he had signed off on some ""DRs"", or ""discrepancy reports"" - likely meaning that they had resolved earlier issues, the two former Boeing employees said.
""But there are still some real fundamental issues that they claim they're aware of,"" Forkner said, likely referring to the manufacturer.
Boeing declined to comment. TRU did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Forkner's lawyer David Gerger told Reuters: ""The simulator was not reading right and had to be fixed to fly like the real plane.""
Earlier in their conversation, Gustavsson asks Forkner whether he could get anything done in the simulator or if he experienced the ""normal chaos."" That likely refers to general software issues, the former Boeing employees said.
Forkner then says MCAS was ""running rampant in the sim on me"". He describes what he experienced: ""I'm leveling off at like 4000 ft, 230 knots and the plane is trimming itself like craxy (sic). I'm like, WHAT?""
Gustavsson responds that he experienced similar patterns with MCAS, ""but on approach.""
""On approach"" is when pilots line up the aircraft to land. At a certain elevation, pilots typically extend the aircraft's flaps, the former Boeing employees said.
Boeing has said MCAS only operates when the flaps are retracted, so it would be unusual that Gustavsson would have experienced the same behavior on approach, with flaps extended, the former Boeing employees said.
""We don't know if he is describing glitches in the simulation, or if it's actually an MCAS misbehavior,"" Ludtke said.
Pilots have complained they did not know about the existence of MCAS before the Lion Air crash in October 2018. In a separate set of emails released by the FAA on Friday, Forkner told the agency in January 2017 that the company would delete references to MCAS from the flight operator's manual ""because it is outside the normal operating envelope.""
In marketing the 737 MAX, Boeing said current 737 pilots would only need computer-based training on the new narrowbody model rather than simulator training, which is more costly. The FAA approved the training requirements when it certified the aircraft in 2017."
1536,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2019 12:41AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Electric Hummer could be part of GM's move into EV trucks, SUVs - sources","By Ben Klayman and Paul Lienert
WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) plans to build a new family of premium electric pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles at its Detroit-Hamtramck plant beginning in late 2021, possibly reviving the imposing Hummer brand on some of them, several people familiar with the plans said.
The so-called BT1 electric truck/SUV program is the centerpiece of a planned $3 billion investment in the Detroit-Hamtramck plant to make electric trucks and vans, and part of a broader $7.7 billion investment in GM's U.S. plants over the next four years, according to a proposed labor deal between the automaker and the United Auto Workers union. 
The investments were made public by the UAW on Friday but no details were provided.
The investment would move the automaker into a part of the EV market that is largely untested and where GM has a higher likelihood of turning a profit, analysts said.
""It makes perfect sense to hit the high end of the market in order to generate some revenue that might actually turn a profit,"" Auto Forecast Solutions vice president of global vehicle forecasting Sam Fiorani said.
GM is mirroring the approach electric carmaker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) took by starting in the high end and then moving down the price ladder, he said.
That is important for a company who previously tried to sell the plug-in electric hybrid Chevrolet Volt and all-electric Bolt cars at lower prices and higher volumes, but failed to sell enough to make those efforts profitable, Fiorani said. 
The UAW's 48,000 GM hourly workers are scheduled to vote next week on the proposed contract that would end a month-long strike that analysts say has cost the No. 1 U.S. automaker about $2 billion.
GM's BT1 program includes an electric pickup for the GMC brand and an electric SUV for Cadillac, both due in 2023, the sources said. 
Before then, GM plans to begin low-volume production in late 2021 of the first BT1 model, a pickup, under a different brand, the source said. A performance variant of the pickup will be added to that brand in 2022, followed by an electric SUV in 2023. 
One of the sources said the Hummer name is ""under consideration"" but a decision has not been finalized. The pickup is codenamed ""Project O.""
Bringing back the Hummer name would take advantage of a still strongly recognized brand name, Fiorani said. Hummers were rugged civilian utility vehicles with low gas mileage that were inspired by military vehicles and were popular with such celebrities as actor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former basketball star Dennis Rodman.
""Putting a Hummer badge on anything is a great idea for General Motors because half the marketing is already paid for,"" he said. ""Making it environmentally friendly is just icing on the cake.""
The pickups and SUVs in the BT1 family will use a new dedicated electric vehicle architecture, including a ""skateboard"" chassis that bundles electric motor and batteries, the sources said. Fiorani expects the GM electric truck to sell at around $90,000 or more, while the other vehicles will easily top $100,000.
GM President Mark Reuss said in June at a UBS conference that the new EV architecture will be highly flexible, enabling the Detroit automaker to build a variety of body types in different sizes, with the capability of providing front-, rear- or all-wheel drive models.
When the plant reaches full production in 2024, it is expected to build about 80,000 electric vehicles a year, the sources said. Fiorani called that figure realistic.
As part of its plans around EVs, GM plans to open a battery plant near its closed Lordstown, Ohio, factory that sources have said would be a joint venture and is part of plans to invest another $1.3 billion in non-GM plants in the United States over the next four years.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said in April the automaker would make an electric full-size pickup, but provided no further details. The company has said it plans to invest $8 billion to develop electric and self-driving vehicles, launching 20 new EVs globally by 2023.
Asked about the details provided to Reuters, GM spokeswoman Jordana Strosberg said GM doesn't comment on speculation. But she added the company is committed to an electric future.
""GM believes in an all-electric future and we are making great progress in that area,"" she said. ""We have announced that a pickup truck will be part of our future portfolio, but have no additional information to provide.""
GM is aiming to be one of the first in what is soon to be a crowded market for electric trucks and SUVs.
Well-funded Michigan startup Rivian has announced plans to build an electric pickup - a premium version of which will top $90,000 - followed by an electric SUV, beginning in fall 2020. It also has a contract with investor Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) to build up to 100,000 electric delivery vans for the e-commerce giant.
GM previously held discussions about investing in Rivian and using its electric vehicle platform, but sped up its internal EV program when the startup turned to rival  Ford Motor Co  (N:F).
Ford invested $500 million in Rivian in April and said it planned to use Rivian's skateboard to build a new Ford-branded electric vehicle.
Ford plans to unveil an electric version of its own F-series pickup in early to mid 2022, sources previously told Reuters. It also will begin selling a Mustang-inspired electric SUV next year as part of its plan to invest $11.5 billion electrifying its vehicles by 2022, including adding 16 fully electric models.
Electric pickups and SUVs - the heart of the U.S. market - could help Ford and GM generate the significant sales of EVs they will need to meet tougher emission standards and electric vehicle mandates in California and other states. The Trump administration is moving to roll back those standards – and eliminate extra credits that automakers receive from EV sales -but the electric trucks are a hedge if California prevails.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the company wants to add a pickup to its growing family of premium electric vehicles, but has not provided a specific timetable. Tesla is expected to unveil a prototype this year, with analysts predicting a 2022 debut.

1537,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 08:00PM ET</span>",Boeing pilots' messages on 737 MAX safety raise new questions,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co senior pilot said he might have unintentionally misled regulators, in a series of internal messages from 2016 that became public Friday, plunging the world's largest airplane maker into a fresh crisis. 
The messages, first reported by Reuters, sent Boeing shares tumbling, prompted a demand by U.S. regulators for an immediate explanation, and a new call in Congress for Boeing to shake up its management as it continues to grapple with the fallout from two fatal crashes that have grounded its fastest-selling plane.
In a transcript of instant messages between two employees, the 737 MAX's then-chief technical pilot, Mark Forkner, said the so-called MCAS anti-stall system in the airplane was ""running rampant"" in a flight simulator session. The system has been tied to the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that together killed 346 people.
The messages, which sources provided to Reuters, appear to be the first publicly known observations that MCAS behaved erratically during testing before the aircraft entered service. (https://tmsnrt.rs/2OZl4Ic)
The Federal Aviation Administration ordered Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg to give an ""immediate"" explanation for the delay in turning over the ""concerning"" document which Boeing discovered some months ago.
The fresh discovery came days before Muilenburg, who was stripped of his chairman title by the board last week, is due to testify before Congress. 
""These messages indicate that Boeing withheld damning information from the FAA, which is highly disturbing,"" Peter DeFazio, Chair of the U.S. House of Representatives transportation committee, wrote in a letter to U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao on Friday.
The FAA said it ""is reviewing this information to determine what action is appropriate.""
A person briefed on the matter said Boeing failed to turn over the documents to the FAA for four months and that the Justice Department is also in possession of the messages.
Boeing said on Friday that Muilenburg had called FAA Administrator Steve Dickson to respond to the concerns raised in his letter and assured him that the company ""is taking every step possible to safely return the MAX to service.""
It said it had produced the document containing a former Boeing employee's statements to the appropriate investigating authority earlier this year, and brought it to the attention of the Department of Transportation on Thursday.
Boeing has been cooperating with the House of Representatives Transportation & Infrastructure Committee's probe into the 737 MAX and will continue to do so in investigations by U.S. authorities, the company said.
Boeing turned the documents over to the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI in February, one source said.
Federal prosecutors aided by the FBI, the Department of Transportation's inspector general and several blue-ribbon panels are investigating the 737 MAX's certification. And the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee confirmed it will question Muilenburg at an Oct. 29 hearing, one day before a House of Representatives panel is scheduled to question him.
The 737 MAX has been grounded worldwide since March, forcing more than 100 daily flight cancellations at large U.S operators of the aircraft such as Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), and eroding their profits.
Boeing has said the grounding has already cost it at least $8 billion.
Its shares fell 6.8% to close at $344.00, before edging up 1.4% after hours.
'I BASICALLY LIED'
Forkner said in one text message, ""I basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly)."" The other employee responded that ""it wasn't a lie, no one told us that was the case"" of an issue with MCAS.
Forkner responded soon after: ""Granted I suck at flying, but even this was egregious."" At one point Forkner said ""there are still some real fundamental issues"" in the simulator.
In the exchange, Forkner said he was writing while ""drinking icy cold gray goose.""
""If you read the whole chat, it is obvious that there was no 'lie,'"" Forkner's lawyer David Gerger said by email on Friday.
""The simulator was not reading right and had to be fixed to fly like the real plane. Mark's career – at Air Force, at FAA, and at Boeing – was about safety. And based on everything he knew, he absolutely thought this plane was safe.""
Forkner and his colleague allude to technical problems with the simulator itself, which one former Boeing test pilot said may have contributed in some way to Forkner's observations and conclusions of MCAS' behavior.
In a separate batch of emails, released by the FAA on Friday, Forkner said in November 2016 that he was working on ""jedi-mind tricking regulators into accepting the training that I got accepted by FAA."" 
DeFazio, the House committee chair, said such ""tricks and boasting"" indicates ""improper coziness between the regulator and the regulated.""
Forkner is no longer employed by Boeing. The Seattle Times reported in September that he repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right to not turn over documents subpoenaed by the Justice Department.
The FAA reiterated that it is ""following a thorough process, not a prescribed timeline, for returning the Boeing 737 MAX to passenger service. The agency will lift the grounding order only after we have determined the aircraft is safe.""
Boeing has been revising the 737 MAX software as part of its efforts to win fresh approval for the jet to fly again.
Southwest, the world's largest operators of the 737 MAX, said in a statement it had been unaware of the messages but continued to work with the FAA and Boeing to safely return the aircraft to service.
The Southwest pilots union, which has filed a lawsuit against Boeing for lost wages during the grounding, said in a statement that the document was ""more evidence that Boeing misled pilots, government regulators and other aviation experts about the safety of the 737 MAX.""

""As pilots, we have to be able to trust Boeing to truthfully disclose the information we need to safely operate our aircraft. In the case of the 737 MAX, that absolutely did not happen,"" Southwest Airlines Pilots Association President Jon Weaks said.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 07:18PM ET</span>","J&J recalls 33,000 bottles of baby powder as FDA finds asbestos in sample","By Julie Steenhuysen and Lisa Girion
(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) said on Friday it is recalling around 33,000 bottles of baby powder in the United States after U.S. health regulators found trace amounts of asbestos in samples taken from a bottle purchased online.
J&J shares fell more than 6% to close at $127.70.
The move marks the first time the company has recalled its iconic baby powder for possible asbestos contamination, and the first time U.S. regulators have announced a finding of asbestos in the product. Asbestos is a known carcinogen that has been linked to deadly mesothelioma.
The recall is the latest blow to the more than 130-year-old U.S. healthcare conglomerate that is facing thousands of lawsuits over a variety of products, including baby powder, opioids, medical devices and the antipsychotic Risperdal.
A jury last week ordered the company to pay $8 billion to a plaintiff in a case claiming J&J downplayed the risks of Risperdal. That award is not expected to stand, the company and legal experts have said. 
J&J faces more than 15,000 lawsuits from consumers claiming its talc products, including Johnson's Baby Powder, caused their cancer.
On a conference call with reporters on Friday, Dr. Susan Nicholson, head of Women’s Health in the company's medical safety organization, called the asbestos finding ""extremely unusual,"" adding that it was ""inconsistent with our testing to date.""
The voluntary recall announced on Friday is limited to one lot of Johnson's Baby Powder produced and shipped in the United States in 2018, the company said. J&J in a news release said that testing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as recently as a month ago found no asbestos in their talc.
The FDA said in a statement that the latest sampling took place during its testing for asbestos in talc-containing cosmetics that it began reporting this year. A second Johnson’s Baby Powder sample from a different lot tested negative for asbestos, the agency said.
The FDA said it stands by the quality of its testing and results and recommended consumers stop using the product if it comes from the affected lot.
J&J said on the conference call that it received a report from the FDA on Oct. 17 alerting the company about the asbestos finding. It said it has started an investigation and is reviewing manufacturing records and collecting data on the distribution of the lot to determine where the product was shipped.
J&J added that it is working with the FDA to determine the integrity of the tested sample as well as the validity of test results.
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION NEEDED
The type of asbestos discovered by FDA testing has not been found in the mine where the company sources its talc, J&J's Nicholson said. She described it as an environmental contaminant most commonly found in building materials and industrial applications.
J&J said it was too early to confirm whether cross-contamination of the sample had caused a false positive, whether the sample was taken from a bottle with an intact seal or whether the it was prepared in a controlled environment. It added that it could not confirm whether the tested product was authentic or counterfeit.
""It is so critical that we perform a thorough investigation of the sample to determine the source of contamination,"" Nicholson said.
Since 2003, talc in Johnson's Baby Powder sold in the United States has come from China through supplier Imerys Talc America, a unit of Paris-based Imerys SA and a co-defendant in much of the talc litigation. Imerys and J&J said the Chinese talc is safe. 
J&J has known for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc, Reuters reported last year. Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company’s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos. Company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it, while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public, Reuters found.
J&J has repeatedly said that its talc products are safe, and that decades of studies have shown them to be asbestos-free and that they do not cause cancer.
The FDA test indicated the presence of no greater than 0.00002% of chrysotile asbestos in the tested sample, J&J said.
The World Health Organization and other authorities recognize no safe level of exposure to asbestos. While most people exposed never develop cancer, for some, even small amounts of asbestos are enough to trigger the disease years later.
Thousands of the lawsuits against J&J have been consolidated before a New Jersey federal judge, who is currently weighing company motions to disqualify plaintiffs’ expert witnesses, including the head of an asbestos testing lab who has testified in earlier trials that he found the contaminant in J&J powders.
Leigh O’Dell, one of the lead plaintiff attorneys, on Friday said the recall ""vindicates the position we’ve been taking for months.”
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Larry Biegelsen said in a research note that the recall could encourage additional lawsuits and prompt the company to pursue a broader settlement.
Jefferies healthcare strategist Jared Holz said J&J has already lost close to $10 billion in market value due to the talc issue over the past year.
He said further downside to J&J stock is likely to be limited because legal concerns over talc are well known and have already taken a toll on the share price. ""This is one single bottle within one lot with barely a trace here,"" he said.
J&J said in February that it had received subpoenas from the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission for documents related to the asbestos contamination allegations. A Bloomberg report, which Reuters has confirmed, said those inquiries include a criminal grand jury investigation into how forthright J&J has been in its statements about the safety of its powders.

While talc products make up less than 1% of J&J sales expected by analysts to reach $82 billion in 2019, the New Jersey-based healthcare-products maker considers its Baby Powder to be an essential facet of a carefully tended image as a caring company.

1541,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 05:12PM ET</span>",Oracle co-CEO Mark Hurd dies at 62,"By Vibhuti Sharma and Neha Malara
(Reuters) - Oracle Corp's (N:ORCL) 62-year-old co-chief Mark Hurd died on Friday morning, the company said, an unexpected development that raises pressure on co-CEO Safra Catz to lead the business software maker's ongoing transition to cloud computing.
Last month, Hurd went on a medical leave for unspecified health reasons, while Catz and founder Larry Ellison took over his responsibilities during the absence. 
The company has not given details about the cause of death.
""Oracle has lost a brilliant and beloved leader who personally touched the lives of so many of us during his decade at Oracle,"" Ellison wrote in an email to company employees.
Hurd and Catz were named co-CEOs in 2014, after Ellison decided to step aside to focus on his role as chief technology officer.
Under their tenure, Oracle has been aggressively pushing into cloud computing to make up for a late entry into the fast-growing business dominated by  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
Last month, the company missed revenue estimates.
Wedbush Securities analyst Steve Koenig said he does not see any changes in how the company will be run after Hurd's demise.
""Safra and Larry have been long-time collaborators and partners in leading Oracle, and the company has a deep bench of sales talent.""
Hurd joined Oracle as co-president in September 2010, a month after he was ousted in a controversial fashion from Hewlett-Packard Co, where he had been chief executive since 2005. 
Hurd resigned from HP in August 2010 after allegations of sexually harassing an employee. An internal probe later cleared him of those charges, though it found him guilty of filing inaccurate expense reports. (https://reut.rs/2P14d7Y)
Long-time friend Ellison stood up for Hurd in an email to New York Times, calling Hurd's removal the ""worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) board fired Steve Jobs many years ago"".
When Hurd and Catz were named co-CEOs in 2014, analysts were skeptical about the dual CEO structure. However, cloud software giants like Salesforce.com Inc (N:CRM) have followed suit.
Catz, trained in finance and law, was a Wall Street banker from 1986 until she joined Oracle in 1999 and has been a central figure in Oracle's many acquisitions. 

Sales-oriented Hurd spent 25 years at computer and ATM pioneer NCR Corp before joining HP.

1542,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 05:08PM ET</span>",Trump says he will nominate deputy to be new U.S. energy secretary,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he would nominate Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, a former vice president of  Ford Motor Co  and Louisiana state energy regulator, to head the department.
""I am pleased to nominate Deputy Secretary Dan Brouillette to be the new Secretary of Energy,"" Trump wrote in a post on Twitter. ""Dan's experience in the sector is unparalleled. A total professional, I have no doubt that Dan will do a great job!"" 
If confirmed by the Senate, Brouillette will replace Rick Perry, who said on Thursday he would step down by the end of the year.
Brouillette, 57, has taken on increasing responsibilities at the Energy Department in recent months as Perry signaled he would resign. He went on international trips for the department and sat in for Perry during several Cabinet meetings. 
Brouillette was vice president at Ford (N:F) from 2004 to 2006. After that, he headed public policy for United Service Automobile Association (USAA) which offers insurance and financial services to veterans.
A native of Louisiana, he was a member of the state's Mineral and Energy Board from 2013 to 2016. Before that he served at the Energy Department as an assistant secretary for congressional and intergovernmental affairs for two years under former President George W. Bush. 
Joe McMonigle, who was a department chief of staff under Bush, said Brouillette does not have the instincts of a politician like Perry, who had been the longest-serving governor of Texas. But like Perry, Brouillette has an easy relationship with many Democratic and Republican lawmakers, McMonigle said. 
Brouillette, who met with Trump on Friday, is expected to keep pushing the president's policy of maximizing oil, gas and coal output while slashing regulations on energy facilities. 

""I don't know of a single issue where he differs from the president,"" McMonigle said.

1543,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 05:06PM ET</span>",Wisconsin county to lock in long-term financing for Foxconn project,"By Karen Pierog
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Wisconsin's Racine County next week will lock in $110 million, 20-year financing for a major development by Taiwan's Foxconn Technology Group that has undergone changes in scope since it was announced in 2017, the county and a bank underwriting the bonds said.
The planned $10 billion, 20-million-square-foot campus in the southeastern Wisconsin county had been hailed by the White House as the largest investment for a brand new location by a foreign-based company in U.S. history and proof that President Donald Trump was reviving American manufacturing.
But Foxconn's changing plans have raised doubts about how many jobs it will create. Foxconn initially sought to manufacture advanced large-screen displays for TVs and other consumer and professional products at the Wisconsin site. It later said it would build smaller Generation 6 liquid crystal display screens instead and is currently constructing a nearly 1 million-square-foot facility that will begin production in 2020's 4th quarter.
Interim notes Racine County sold in 2017 and 2018 to finance land acquisition for Foxconn will be replaced with $110 million of taxable general obligation bonds carrying maturities from 2020 through 2039 in a deal pricing through underwriters led by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Howard Cure, a managing director at Evercore Wealth Management, said investors who buy the bonds the county hopes to pay off with special assessments on the Foxconn development will have to weigh the risks the county could face if the project falters.
""If you buy this paper you have to track the progress of Foxconn,"" he said.
The sale of the bond anticipation notes, which greatly increased the county's debt burden, led Moody's Investors Service to downgrade the county's rating by a one-notch to Aa2 in 2017.
On Friday, Moody's affirmed the Aa2 rating and a negative outlook, which it said reflects the county's exposure to ""risks and uncertainties"" surrounding the Foxconn project.
While noting uncertainty over the size and scope of the project, S&P Global Ratings rated the bonds AA, saying that they do not substantially add to the county's debt burden or introduce substantial risk to its credit quality.
Racine County, which is putting its unlimited taxing power behind the bonds, said it has strong protections in its local development agreement with Foxconn.
“We remain encouraged about the progress we’ve seen and continue to see each day on the ground,"" Racine County Executive Jonathan Delagrave said in a statement.
Still, the bond issue's prospectus said there is no guarantee whether there will be future amendments to Foxconn's contract with the state or if the facility will be constructed in accordance with the development agreement. It added that ""no assurance can be provided as to the specific type, size, scope or generation of the facility"" that is ultimately built.
Wisconsin's Democratic Governor Tony Evers, who inherited the project from his Republican predecessor and Trump ally Scott Walker, had raised the possibility of renegotiating Foxconn's contract as the project's scope was in flux.
The company fell short of a 2018 employment goal, hiring 178 full-time workers rather than the 260 targeted, and failed to earn a tax credit of up to $9.5 million.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street fell on Friday as negative headlines about Johnson & Johnson and Boeing, along with bleak economic data from China, soured investor risk appetite and offset generally positive corporate earnings.
All three major U.S. stock averages ended the session in the red, but the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posted weekly gains. The blue-chip Dow was nominally lower than last week's close. 
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) shares led both the S&P 500's and the Dow's declines. 
Boeing dropped 6.8% after Reuters reported that text messages between two employees suggested the planemaker misled the Federal Aviation Administration about the safety of the grounded 737 MAX aircraft.
Johnson & Johnson announced it would recall baby powder in the United States after regulators found trace amounts of asbestos in a sample, sending its shares falling 6.2%.
Growth of China's gross domestic product slowed to its weakest pace in nearly 30 years as the bruising trade war with the United States took its toll, stoking fears of slowdown contagion.
The International Monetary Fund has lowered its forecast for global growth this year to 3%, which would mark the slowest expansion since the financial crisis.
""There's no question that there's signs out there that the economy is weakening,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.
Today's market weakness ""has to do with (GDP) news out of China, Boeing and Johnson & Johnson,"" Cardillo added, saying ""market sentiment in terms of earnings is positive.""
Third-quarter earnings season has hit full stride, with 73 companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 83.6% have come in above average estimates, according to Refinitiv data.
Still, analysts currently see S&P 500 earnings dropping by 3.1% compared with last year, which would mark the first contraction since the earnings recession that ended mid-2016.
Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) gained 1.3% after the oilfield services company posted its largest quarterly loss ever as a result of a $12 billion charge as Chief Executive Olivier Le Peuch moved to shift focus toward software and services.
 American Express  Co (N:AXP) reported better-than-expected third-quarter profit as consumers boosted their spending. Still, the credit card issuer's shares dipped 2.0%.
Coca-Cola Co's (N:KO) revenue beat expectations and an upbeat forecast gave its shares a 1.8% boost.
Kansas City Southern (N:KSU) jumped 7.3% after the railroad operator also beat profit expectations, on increased petroleum shipments to Mexico.
Next week, market participants look forward to high profile results from Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG),  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS)  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Boeing,  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), 3M Co (N:MMM),  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR), Amazon.com (O:AMZN), and others. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 255.68 points, or 0.95%, to 26,770.2, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 11.75 points, or 0.39%, to 2,986.2 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 67.31 points, or 0.83%, to 8,089.54.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, seven closed in the red, with tech (SPLRCT), communications services (SPLRCL) and industrials (SPLRCI) suffering the biggest percentage declines. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.03-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 29 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 51 new highs and 59 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.24 billion shares, compared with the 6.55 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

The S&P 500 was off 0.39%. But the Dow Jones industrials slumped 0.95%, or more than 255 points, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.83%.
Just about all of the Dow's decline was due to Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 6.8% loss and a 6.2% decline for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). The two subtracted more than 227 points from the price-weighted blue-chip index.
The higher a stock's price, the more impact it has on the index. And gains for other stocks can be overshadowed by a big more from a stock with a big price.
In fact, 14 of the 30 stocks were higher, with Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), up 1.8% on the better-than-expected third-quarter results, and   Verizon Communications   (NYSE:VZ), up 1.06%. 
 
Boeing's slump came after Reuters reported that text messages between two employees suggested the planemaker misled the Federal Aviation Administration about the safety of the grounded 737 MAX aircraft.
Johnson & Johnson fell after announcing it would recall baby powder in the United States after regulators found trace amounts of asbestos in a sample
The S&P 500, meanwhile, finished under 3,000 for the 21st-straight session.
The Nasdaq was weighed down by weakness in tech stocks, especially chip stocks. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 1.06%, in large part due to worries about China, which reported its GDP growth rate dropped to 6% year over year, its weakest pace in nearly 30 years. The slide is largely the effect of the U.S.-China trade fight.
Thanks to the Dow's drubbing on Friday, the index ended the week down 0.17%, its fourth weekly loss in five weeks. The S&P 500, far more diverse, was up 0.54% for the week, its second-straight gain. The Nasdaq added 0.4%, its third weekly gain in row.
For the year, the Dow is up nearly 14.8%. The S&P 500 is up 19.1%, with the Nasdaq up 21.9%.
The necessary caveat is that the gains came mostly in the first quarter as the market recovered from last fall's big dive.
The Dow is off 0.67% from its 2018 peak, along with a 0.54% decline from the same peak for the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 is up 1.54%.
But the worries weighed on the Dow and the S&P 500 as well because so many U.S. companies have looked to China as a major source of new sales.
Seven of the 11 S&P sectors were lower, but there was considerable strength in real estate, financial and utility stocks as interest rates were flat to lower. 
The 10-Year Treasury yield fell to 1.75% from Thursday's 1.755%, It could go lower if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates at its Oct. 29-30 meeting. The odds of that happening stood at nearly 90% late Friday.
Apartment companies, including AvalonBay Communities (NYSE:AVB) and Apartment Investment and Management (NYSE:AIV), hit new highs, along with   Home Depot   (NYSE:HD) and Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR), hit new highs.
Other stocks hitting new highs included Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG),   Crocs   (NASDAQ:CROX),   Nike   (NYSE:NKE) and Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU).
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), up 0.48% on the day, ended the week as the most valuable company in the world with a $1.068 trillion market capitalization. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), down 1.63% on Friday, ended with a $1.048 trillion market cap. 
Robotic surgical-equipment maker Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), investment manager   State Street   (NYSE:STT), brokerage ETrade (NASDAQ:ETFC) and New England bank People’s United Financial (NASDAQ:PBCT) were among the top S&P 500 performers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - European officials struck a measured tone on Friday after the United States imposed new 10% and 25% tariffs on some European Union goods over aircraft subsidies, with a top German official warning against steps that could escalate the tensions.
German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz on Friday said European Union officials were working intensively to hammer out a broader trade deal with the United States and avert additional, potentially far more devastating tariffs on European-built cars.
Asked about new U.S. tariffs on up to $7.5 billion worth of EU airplanes, cheese, wine and other imports that took effect on Friday, Scholz said he favored a ""firm, clear and decisive"" approach that did not further escalate the situation.
""I think it will work at the end of the day,"" he told reporters during the IMF/World Bank annual meetings.
In Brussels, EU trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom said the EU would respond with its own tariffs ""in due course"" when its own case against Boeing (N:BA) is adjudicated in early 2020.
Despite some initial suggestions it could do so, there was no move by Brussels to impose any immediate retaliatory tariffs against the United States under earlier WTO rulings.
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Friday said the EU was working on measures to compensate sectors hit by the new U.S. duties and ""limit damages for those directly hit.""
The WTO has found that both Airbus (PA:AIR) and its U.S. rival Boeing received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies in a pair of cases that have run for 15 years. The U.S. tariffs on $7.5 billion of EU imports took effect Friday.
The WTO's dispute settlement body on Monday cleared Washington to take the record countermeasures against the EU and Airbus-producing countries Britain, France, Germany and Spain.
The actions include 10% duties on Airbus planes and additional 25% duties on a wide swath of French wine, Scottish whiskies and cheeses from across Europe.
Fifteen international beverage groups on Friday urged the U.S. and EU governments to end the tariffs.
""Our industries are collateral damage in trade disputes that have nothing to do with the beverage alcohol sector,"" the groups said in a statement. ""This new round of tariffs will further damage a transatlantic industry that has already been negatively impacted by the EU’s retaliatory tariff on American Whiskey.""
They said the new U.S. tariffs on EU spirits and wines could result in the loss of 8,000 good-paying jobs across the U.S. beverage alcohol sector, from importers, distributors, wholesalers, to the hospitality sector.
U.S. President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials have recently downplayed tensions with Brussels, raising the prospect that they could once again delay threatened national security tariffs against European cars. A decision is due by Nov. 14."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon's decision to move into a full-rate production contract for the F-35 jet, made by  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT), could be delayed until 2021 because of issues integrating the jet with its testing and training simulators, an official said on Friday.
Full-rate production contracts are more lucrative for defense companies than low rate production contracts, suggesting larger payments for F-35 deliveries to Lockheed from the U.S. government and its allies could be delayed by as much as a year.
Pentagon acquisition chief Ellen Lord told reporters she had signed off on a report that indicated the final decision on full-rate production could be delayed up to 13 months.
A decision on full-rate production had been expected this December.
""We are not making as quick progress on the joint simulation environment, integrating the F-35 into it,"" Lord said.
The Joint Simulation Environment is a government-owned modeling and simulation facility that can be used for testing aircraft and flight systems as a supplement to open-air testing.
A Lockheed Martin representative said the company was ""confident the full F-35 enterprise is prepared for full-rate production and ready to meet growing customer demand.""
Lockheed Martin's goal was to deliver 131 aircraft in 2019 with production growing ""to over 140 production aircraft deliveries"" in 2020, the representative said."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) attempts to humble Porsche with a new lap record on Germany's legendary Nordschleife racetrack have reignited a controversy about the value of lap times, as the circuit steps in to quash claims of cheating.
Porsche and U.S.-based Tesla are battling to establish supremacy in lap times for four-door electric sportscars, but comparisons are not exact, as conditions, ranging from car modifications to tyre types, vary with each test.
""We want to have circumstances that can be understood and replicated,"" said Nuerburgring spokesman Alexander Gerhard, adding that the racing circuit operator had moved to tighten rules by which a car maker can claim a certified lap time. 
Setting a new record time for four-door electric cars would give Tesla's ageing Model S a boost just as German rivals Audi, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Porsche prepare to launch their own electric cars.
Automakers use the Nordschleife, one of the world's most treacherous courses with 40 right-hand and 33 left-hand turns, to hone a vehicle's sporting characteristics and burnish a car's image for marketing purposes.
Tesla was spotted this week with a variant of its Model S sedan at the circuit, which is 20.8 km (12.9 miles) long, with slanted cambers and a 300-m altitude difference between its highest and lowest points. 
German car magazine Auto Motor und Sport said a Tesla was seen recording an unofficial time of 7 minutes and 23 seconds, which would beat a lap time set by Porsche's Taycan, which Porsche says achieved a lap time of 7 minutes and 42 seconds.
But Tesla's challenge has prompted questions about whether the Silicon Valley car maker is playing fair. 
""The car was heavily modified,"" said Stefan Baldauf, who photographs prototype vehicles being tested on the circuit for a living.
""Aside from a roll cage and the driver's seat, the interior had been stripped out,"" he added. ""The windows were blacked out, so it was hard to tell.""
The Tesla also appeared to have semi-slick tyres, used only on racing circuits and unsuited for everyday use, Baldauf said.
A Porsche spokeswoman told Reuters its Taycan was tested using standard tyres. 
""A comparison is hardly fair if this is the vehicle used to demonstrate that Tesla is faster,"" Baldauf added.
Notary Jens Boehle, who certified lap times by Porsche, said, ""Scope for cheating is as big as you can imagine. Is it a prototype vehicle, a standard road legal vehicle, or is it a specially modified racing version of a standard road car?""
""These are just some of the questions that need to be answered."" 
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk responded on Twitter this week.
""The final configuration used at Nürburgring to set the record will go into production around summer 2020, so this is not merely for the track,"" Musk said.
Tesla declined to comment on its lap record effort.
Officials are trying to standardise speed record attempts, Gerhard, the Nuerburgring spokesman, said. In some runs for the record, cars were allowed to make a flying start using a 20.6-km (12.8-mile) stretch of the track.
""We now mandate that the full 20.8 km is used,"" Gerhard added. ""And we employ a notary to measure the time following rumours that another manufacturer had cheated, by speeding up video footage.""
It also mandates where timing devices should be located. 
On Twitter, Musk confirmed that Tesla is using the Nordschleife to market its ""Plaid"" mode on a 7-seater Tesla Model S.
""We expect these track times to be beaten by the actual production 7 seat Model S Plaid variant that goes into production around Oct/Nov next year,"" Musk said.
Porsche says its 919 Evo hybrid racecar now holds the overall record for all vehicle categories, with a lap time of 5 minutes and 19 seconds, set in 2018. 
Nuerburgring hopes the new rules, introduced this year, will help revive the circuit's popularity as a venue for competitive benchmarking. 

""We want to be a believable benchmark,"" Gerhard said.

1550,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 02:51PM ET</span>",Even Eateries With $850-a-Bottle Vinegar Feel Trade-War Bite,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. 
President Donald Trump’s trade wars have upset the calculus for some of the most momentous decisions shaping the world economy, from central banks to global corporations.
And some of the least important ones, too -– like where to have lunch in Los Angeles.
Trump’s latest tariffs take effect Friday: A 25% charge on gourmet imports from Europe, like French wine, Italian cheese, Spanish olives and Scotch whiskies. The president, who’s thrown markets into turmoil with his trade campaigns, has approval this time from the World Trade Organization. It said the measure to slap duties on $7.5 billion of European goods is a justified retaliation against Europe’s airplane subsidies.
At the Monsieur Marcel market and restaurant at LA’s historic Original Farmers Market -- where lunchtime crowds enjoy customized cheese trays and charcuterie boards -- owner Stephane Strouk said he’ll probably raise some prices as a result.
‘A Little Piece’
Some customers are rich enough not to object –- or even notice -– if tariffs bump up their bill a bit, says Strouk, who stocks 100-year-old vinegar at $850 a bottle. But they’re in the minority, he says.
“The impact will be for the people who like to buy a little piece of cheese,” Strouk said.
About 60% of what he sells is from Europe, and he says the tariffs will squeeze his margins.
He’s doing a shipment now, he says, without knowing exactly how much he’ll have to pay extra until the cargo clears customs. “I can only hope it isn’t hit.”
Shop Local
A few miles away at Sqirl, a vibey counter-service joint with lines well outside the door, owner Jessica Koslow can afford to be more relaxed.
After getting started as a jam-maker, Koslow took the farm-to-table approach when she set up her restaurant. Most of her suppliers are a drive away.
“I feel protected from the trade war in some ways,” she says. “I’m a supporter of shop local.”
She’s not entirely immune. Koslow says you get Comte cheese, on her menu as a $2-$3 add-on to sandwiches or omelets, from cow’s milk in eastern France -- and it would be hard to substitute its “elegant” flavor. She doesn’t see good alternatives to “smooth” Swiss chocolate or European wines, either.
‘That’s Not Fair’
While they’re affected differently, both restaurateurs say they see the complexities of trade disputes.
Strouk, a Frenchman who emigrated to the U.S. decades ago, said he’s not an admirer of aviation subsidies in his native Europe. “That’s not fair,” he says, expressing hope that a deal can be reached. “But why hit gourmet foods?”
Koslow worries that other countries will respond with their own tariffs –- which could hit the farmers she buys from. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Friday the EU is prepared to hit the U.S. with retaliatory duties if the sides can’t find a negotiated solution.
“I wouldn’t want to see local producers heavily affected,” Koslow says.
In her next venture, she might be more exposed. Koslow is set to open a new restaurant called Onda later this month near the beach in Santa Monica, with Mexican celebrity chef Gabriela Camara.
Alongside Californian fare, it will serve Mexican avocados and seafood from the Baja peninsula –- the kind imports that Trump was threatening to tax just a few months ago. Koslow calls her new restaurant a “border-defying” collaboration.

Futures are pricing in 23 basis points of reductions at the Fed’s Oct. 29-30 meeting after Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said Friday the central bank will “act as appropriate” to sustain the expansion as risks remain “evident.”
“The Fed just confirmed via Clarida’s comments that they’re currently biased to cut rates at the October meeting,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets. “The window to push back against that has effectively closed.”
Traders also still see a possibility of more action in December, with futures implying a total of 34.5 basis points of reductions by the end of 2019. That means, if the anticipated quarter-point cut comes this month, markets are forecasting 38% odds of another in the final meeting of the year.
“The Fed certainly wants to stop in October but if they shift to a truly data-dependent mode and the data doesn’t cooperate then the Fed will act as appropriate, and appropriate could well prove to be a cut in December,” Lyngen said.
Fed policy makers stop giving public comments in the lead-up to Federal Open Market Committee meetings, and Clarida’s remarks were the last before the start of this blackout.
The pause will leave investors guessing about the Fed’s interpretation of two key events that have been dragging global markets. U.S.-China trade negotiators are still laboring toward an early-stage deal, with the prospect of more talks this month. The U.K. prime minister faces a pivotal vote on the plan to exit the European Union. And pessimists on the growth outlook found some support in this week’s poor retail sales figures.
Moreover, unless anything radical changes over the coming days, history suggests the Fed will cut, as it’s never withheld easing against the market’s expectations.

CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Executives from several large healthcare companies and state attorneys general were progressing toward what is expected to be a multibillion-dollar deal to resolve the sprawling litigation over the U.S. opioid epidemic, a plaintiffs' lawyer said on Friday.
""I think we can get a long way,"" said Peter Weinberger, a lawyer for local governments that have sued the companies, when asked by a reporter if a deal was possible on Friday.
U.S. District Court Judge Dan Polster summoned to his court executives from the largest U.S. drug distributors, McKesson Corp (N:MCK),  Cardinal Health  Inc (N:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC), and Israel-based drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA) to try to hammer out a deal before a landmark federal trial starts on Monday.
Weinberger said Polster was shuttling between healthcare executives and state attorneys general and other plaintiffs' lawyers who were huddled privately in separate rooms in the Cleveland federal courthouse.
Polster is overseeing thousands of lawsuits by local governments that allege the companies fueled a public health crisis responsible for roughly 400,000 U.S. deaths from 1999 to 2017, according government statistics.
Earlier this week, the companies proposed a deal that could be worth $50 billion to settle the litigation, two sources told Reuters.
Weinberger said smaller distributor  Henry Schein  Inc (O:HSIC) was also participating in the talks, and the general counsel from pharmacy chain Walgreen Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA) was at the courthouse but not in the negotiations.
Those two companies round out the defendants in the trial that is scheduled to start on Monday.
If the parties make progress at Friday's talks, Polster has the option of postponing Monday's trial to give them more time to negotiate.
The complex litigation pits thousands of towns, cities, counties and tribal governments against numerous companies across the healthcare industry involved in the manufacture and distribution of opioids.
The governments are seeking to recover some of the billions of dollars spent on emergency services, treatment and policing as a result of increased addiction rates.
Attorneys general are separately suing in their own state courts, and while Polster does not have jurisdiction over those cases he invited them to join the talks to try to reach a deal.
The distributors have been accused of failing to flag and halt suspicious orders for opioids, while drugmakers are accused of promoting benefits of the drugs while playing down their risks.
The distributors have insisted that they were shipping FDA approved medicines prescribed by doctors. The drugmakers have also denied any wrongdoing.
Shares of the companies have risen this week in anticipation of a possible deal that could end the litigation, despite the possibility that each company could be on the hook for billions of dollars.
A settlement would remove uncertainty and allow the companies to distance themselves from a politically charged crisis, said a research note from Morningstar on Wednesday.
Monday's scheduled proceeding is a so-called bellwether or test trial with two Ohio counties, Cuyahoga and Summit, serving as plaintiffs. A bellwether trial gives the parties a chance to assess a jury's reaction to the allegations, which could then shape a settlement of all the litigation.
Other defendants in lawsuits overseen by Polster include Johnson & Johnson ,  Mallinckrodt  Plc (N:MNK), Endo International Plc (O:ENDP), Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and Allergan Plc (N:AGN), among others.
OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, viewed as one of the main culprits in fueling the opioid crisis, is also no longer part of the Ohio trial after declaring bankruptcy."

New emails show that Boeing's then chief test pilot working on the plane complained in 2016 messages to another pilot that a new flight control system known as MCAS was causing problems in flight simulations, Reuters said. But the pilot did not tell government regulators certifying the plane. He added he ""basically lied"" to the FAA although unknowingly,

Video game sales fell 8.5% to $1.28 billion year on year in September after hitting a 20-year low in August, according to NPD Group. 
Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) was off 1.5%. It had been down as much as 3%, falling below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) also fell nearly 3% from five-week highs before trimming losses.   Take-Two Interactive   Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) was up slightly..
For the year so far, videogame spending is down 6% to $8.3 billion, led by a fall in hardware spend as gamers await the console refresh cycle next year.
The next-generation of PlayStation and Xbox consoles are expected to launch in time for the holiday season next year.
With just a handful of big titles released last month, the fall in video game sales shouldn’t come as a surprise, with some saying the data can be overlooked, particularly with the usual strong slate of game released in the lead up to crucial holiday season.
But if demand continues to wane in the coming months, that could be cause for concern. For the moment, however, gaming stocks have played their way into a better position so far this year, with the EA and Take-Two boasting double-digit gains. "

1561,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 12:34PM ET</span>","In oil-rich region, Venezuelans fear catastrophe if Trump forces Chevron to leave","By Luc Cohen and Mariela Nava
LA CAÑADA DE URDANETA, Venezuela (Reuters) - With the $2 he earns in wages each week working as a cargo driver for Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, 56-year-old Freddy Brito cannot even afford to buy one kilogram (2.2 lb) of cheese.
To feed himself and his wife as the once-prosperous OPEC nation suffers a hyperinflationary economic collapse, Brito depends on a monthly basket of rice, canned tuna, beans and other products valued at $200 given to him by California-based  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX), PDVSA's minority partner at the Petroboscan field in western Zulia state where he works.
But Chevron's future in Venezuela now depends on U.S. President Donald Trump, who must decide https://www.reuters.com/article/venezuela-oil-chevron-usa/trump-administration-renews-chevron-license-in-venezuela-for-3-months-idUSL2N24Q1WL by Oct. 25 whether or not to renew a waiver allowing Chevron to keep operating in Venezuela despite U.S. sanctions on PDVSA, part of Washington's campaign to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro.
The benefits enjoyed by Brito and some 1,200 other Petroboscan employees and contractors are not available for most of cash-strapped PDVSA's 100,000-odd workers, who have seen their wages eroded due to inflation, prompting thousands to resign https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-oil-workers-insight/under-military-rule-venezuela-oil-workers-quit-in-a-stampede-idUSKBN1HO0H9 and join the 4 million Venezuelans who have emigrated.
""If Chevron leaves, we would be left without a helping hand, because what little we have comes from them,"" Brito said.
Chevron has been present in Venezuela for nearly 100 years: it opened its Caracas office in 1923, and first struck oil at the Boscan field in 1946, making it among the private companies with the longest presence in the country.
But in January, the U.S. Treasury Department slapped sanctions on PDVSA as part of Washington's effort to cut off cash flow to Maduro. Chevron was only able to remain in Venezuela thanks to a six-month exemption granted to it and major oilfield service companies like  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL) and Schlumberger NV (N:SLB). The companies are keen to retain a presence in Venezuela, which has the world's largest crude reserves.
The campaign to oust Maduro has since stalled, despite Venezuela's deteriorating economy and accusations of human rights violations. After internal debate https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-oil-chevron-usa/trump-administration-split-on-renewing-chevrons-venezuela-license-idUSKCN1UI2OH within the administration, Trump in late July renewed the waiver for three months. 
Some in the administration, like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, argued that, were Chevron to leave, Maduro might deliver its assets to Russian or Chinese companies, depriving a potential new government of a chance to rebuild the economy in partnership with the U.S. firm. But others, such as former National Security Advisor John Bolton, argued that forcing Chevron out could prompt a further decline in crude output, adding to the economic pressure on Maduro.
With the new deadline looming, residents of La Cañada de Urdaneta, where Petroboscan's operations are located, fear the company's exit would add further misery to a drastic deterioration in their quality of life during the last seven years of recession. 
""Chevron has supported everything,"" said Yennifer Gonzalez, a parent of three students at the San Agustin school in La Cañada, where the company funds meals for students and staff, and is also paying for a construction project. ""If Chevron leaves, here in the field things will not be the same.
By law, PDVSA's joint ventures are required to invest 1% of their profits in social programs in the areas where they extract crude. In La Cañada, Chevron's logo adorns schoolyard basketball hoops it donated and police stations it helped build. 
Chevron spokesman Ray Fohr said in a statement the company's social investment contributions totaled nearly $100 million between 2007-2018, and that the firm was a ""positive presence"" in the country.
Neither PDVSA nor Venezuela's oil ministry responded to requests for comment. Maduro blames an ""economic war"" led by the United States for the country's problems.
HALTED PUMPJACKS
Venezuela's crude output steadily declined from well over 2 million barrels-per-day (bpd) in 2014 to just over 1 million bpd by the end of last year, the result of a drop in prices and what critics say is years of underinvestment and mismanagement. Blackouts and U.S. sanctions have accelerated that collapse this year: the country now produces just 600,000 bpd.
Petroboscan and Petropiar, Chevron's other major joint venture with PDVSA, together pumped well over 100,000 bpd earlier this year. But both have halted production completely at times in recent months, as Washington's sanctions scare away buyers and Venezuela's storage tanks near capacity, according to sources and documents seen by Reuters.
None of the dozen pumpjacks that Reuters observed while driving through the Boscan field on Oct. 14 and Oct. 15 were turning.
Should Chevron be ordered to depart, that would be unlikely to have a major impact on Maduro, analysts said.
""Two million barrels to 600,000 barrels and these guys are still there,"" said Francisco Monaldi, an energy economist at Rice University in Houston, referring to Maduro's government. ""And you think that because of 100,000 (fewer bpd) it's going to make a difference?""
Even with Chevron's help, Brito's patience with his miniscule wages is wearing thin. He held back tears when talking about his four children who have moved to Colombia, where he said many Petroboscan workers would emigrate if Chevron left. 

""I can tell you because I'm one of them,"" he said. ""I'll sell what I have here, pack my bags, and I'll drive away in my truck.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Documents from Saudi Aramco show that the world's largest oil firm earns only a limited proportion of its profit from foreign refining ventures, an area in which the company plans huge investment.
The news comes as Aramco, according to two sources familiar with the matter, has delayed the planned launch of its initial public offering in hopes that pending third-quarter results will bolster investor confidence.
A subsidiary that holds Aramco stakes in South Korean refiner S-Oil (KS:010950) and Showa Shell of Japan made a net income of $319 million in 2018, accounts seen by Reuters show. 
Saudi Refining Inc, through which Aramco operates the largest U.S. oil refinery, made $423 million last year, separate accounts showed.
The documents, seen by Reuters, do not appear to be in the public domain.
The earnings represent a small proportion of Aramco's $111 billion in net income from 2018. They also illustrate just how profitable Aramco's core oil-producing business - which pumps about 10% of the world's oil - actually is.
Aramco is making huge investments in overseas downstream operations. With Indian companies and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co, it plans to build a giant refinery and petrochemical project that sources say will cost $60 billion. Aramco declined to comment.
Selling a stake in Aramco has been a centerpiece of Vision 2030, a plan championed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil. 
Aramco appears to make a small proportion of its profit from refining compared with listed peers. Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), for example, earned $7.57 billion from downstream activities in 2018, almost a quarter of its $23.83 billion annual earnings.
In 2018, Aramco received revenue of $138.67 billion from its downstream operations and $216.9 billion from upstream, according to the company's published acccounts.
Some analysts say Aramco's performance is better than that of its listed peers, based on metrics followed by investors in oil companies. 
Jason Kenney of Santander (MC:SAN) said Aramco's first-half 2019 earnings showed a higher return on capital employed than listed peers and stronger performance on operational yardsticks such as refinery reliability.

This highlights ""the impressive order of magnitude at which Saudi Aramco is delivering"", he said in a report.

(Reuters) - Credit card issuer  American Express  Co (N:AXP) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit that highlighted the health of the U.S. consumer even as fears mount that a manufacturing-led weakness could spread to the broader economy.
U.S. retail sales fell for the first time in seven months in September, adding to concerns after data showed a moderation in job growth and services sector activity in the last month.
New York-based AmEx, for long the preferred choice of affluent Americans for credit cards, however, quelled investor concerns with its ninth straight quarter of foreign exchange adjusted revenue growth of at least 8%.
""The trends we saw in the business this quarter continue to be consistent with an economy that continues to grow, albeit at a more modest pace than last year,"" Chief Executive Officer Steve Squeri said.
U.S. big banks' quarterly results also showed that American consumers are helping to prop up the economy, even as recession fears have led businesses to pull back on spending and borrowing.
""We see a long runway to sustain this performance. In the (fourth quarter), we expect revenue growth to continue with the strong levels we have seen,"" Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Campbell told analysts on a post-earnings conference call.
AmEx reaffirmed its 2019 adjusted earnings per share forecast range of $7.85 to $8.35 and said it expects revenue growth of between 8% and 10% in the fourth quarter.
The company, whose largest shareholder is Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), has ramped up reward programs on its cards and struck partnership deals with a number of firms to counter competition from JPMorgan Chase & Co's (N:JPM) Sapphire Reserve and  Citigroup  Inc's (N:C) Prestige Card.
AmEx said foreign exchange adjusted proprietary card member spending rose 7% in the third quarter, led by strong consumer growth in both the United States and international markets.
Net income rose to $1.76 billion, or $2.08 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $1.65 billion, or $1.88 per share, a year earlier, the company said.
Analysts had expected a profit of $2.03 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company beat profit estimates for the seventh time in the last nine quarters, according to Refinitiv data.
Shares in AmEx, however, were 1.3% lower as investors were disappointed that the company did not raise its guidance.

Asda said its defined contribution pension plan, that provided ongoing pension arrangements to the majority of its staff, was not included in the deal.
In April Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) 7.3 billion pounds agreed bid for Asda was blocked by Britain's competition regulator. A month later Walmart said it would instead look at an initial public offering for Asda and in July Asda CEO Roger Burnley said this could happen in two to three years."
1575,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 09:35AM ET</span>",Thousands converge on Barcelona for fifth day of Catalan protests,"By Jon Nazca and Jordi Rubio
BARCELONA (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of demonstrators waving Catalan flags and chanting ""Independence!"" and ""Freedom for political prisoners!"" poured into Barcelona on Friday, the fifth day of protests against the jailing of separatist leaders. 
Many of the marchers began their journeys to the city on Wednesday from municipalities across the northeastern Spanish region, after the Supreme Court sentenced nine separatists to up to 13 years in jail over a failed bid to break away from Spain in 2017.
The sentences set off the worst sustained street violence Spain has seen in decades, and Friday's protests, that also include workers on strike, will be closely watched by authorities in Madrid.
""Throughout this week, as you well know, there have been violent incidents in Catalonia. They have been organized ... by groups who are a minority but are very organized,"" Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told a news conference. ""Their actions, as we have already said, will also not go unpunished."" 
Friday's marches have so far been peaceful, ranging from families pushing prams to cyclists wheeling their bicycles and people draped in the Catalan independence flag, who took over a highway lane and other major roads as they walked towards the Catalan capital. Some in Barcelona stood by the side of the roads, applauding as the walkers arrived. 
Protesters walking on a highway towards Barcelona carried a giant banner reading, in English: ""Free Catalan Prisoners Now."" 
Several main streets in Barcelona were closed to traffic in anticipation of the marches. Regional trains and the city's metro were running on a reduced timetable after pro-independence unions called a strike.
Barcelona's main landmark, the multi-spired Sagrada Familia cathedral designed by Antoni Gaudi, was shut down due to the protests, an official told Reuters. 
The Spanish soccer federation (RFEF) said in a statement on that Barcelona's Oct. 26 home match against Real Madrid, one of the biggest rivalries in the sport, had been postponed due to security concerns. 
FLIGHTS CANCELED
Barcelona's El Prat airport canceled 57 flights on Friday, airport operator Aena said.
Barcelona town hall said 700 garbage containers were set ablaze since protests began on Monday and estimated that the city had suffered damage totaling more than 1.5 million euros ($1.67 million). 
Thursday began with largely peaceful protests as young people draped in Catalan flags tossed balls and skipped rope. The mood shifted later in the night, with protesters setting fire to cafe chairs lining the fashionable Rambla de Catalunya street in the heart of Barcelona's tourist district. 
An official from Barcelona town hall said around 10 trees were set on fire on Thursday. 
Regional police said 16 people were arrested across Catalonia on Thursday, while health officials said medical aid was provided to 42 people. 
Carmaker Seat, a unit of Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), halted production at its plant in Martorell, near Barcelona, from Thursday afternoon until Saturday, over concerns that the marches would disrupt traffic, a company spokeswoman said.
Barcelona's wholesale market, MercaBarna, said visits to its fish sellers were down 85% on Friday, while flower sellers at the market saw 90% fewer customers.
Pro-independence leaders went ahead with a 2017 referendum on independence, despite it being deemed illegal by Spanish courts, followed by a declaration that the region was breaking away from Spain. Madrid responded by seizing control of the Catalan administration and putting the ringleaders on trial.
Catalonia's former leader Carles Puigdemont, who fled to Belgium after the failed independence bid, on Friday told reporters that Belgian authorities had allowed him to remain free without bail after Spain's Supreme Court targeted him with a European arrest warrant.

1576,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 09:27AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Lampert helps bankroll Sears as woes persist after bankruptcy - sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Mike Spector
(Reuters) - U.S. retailer Sears has borrowed about $150 million from lenders, including its billionaire owner Eddie Lampert, as it racks up losses less than a year after it emerged from bankruptcy protection, people familiar with the matter said. 
The new financing will help stock Sears' store shelves for the holiday shopping season, as it struggles to become profitable. Lampert is no stranger to bankrolling Sears, having extended loans through his hedge fund ESL Investments Inc to the department store chain over the past decade until its financial collapse last year.
The new financing is backed by assets that include Sears' real estate and intellectual property, the sources said. The funds are less than the roughly $200 million Sears originally sought, the sources added. 
Sears was unable to borrow as much as it wanted because lenders were concerned about the 126-year-old company's prospects and financial wherewithal, according to the sources.
Among those that provided the financing was hedge fund Cyrus Capital Partners LP, which extended a loan to the retailer while it navigated bankruptcy court last year, one of the sources said. Sears is still hoping to negotiate with lenders and secure the roughly $200 million, one of the sources said.
The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. A spokesman for Sears did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ESL and Cyrus declined to comment.
Sears filed for bankruptcy protection in October 2018 after losing billions of dollars in the face of competition from the likes of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
Lampert, formerly the company's chairman and CEO, had pledged to restore Sears to its glory days, when it owned the tallest building in the world and companies that included a radio station and Allstate (NYSE:ALL) insurance.
Sears dates back to the late 1880s and its mail-order catalogues with merchandise from toys, medicine and gramophones to automobiles, kit houses and tombstones made it the Amazon of its time.
Lampert combined Sears and rival chain Kmart more than 15 years ago, heralding the formation of a retailer with $55 billion in annual sales. But revenues subsequently plunged amid the rise of online shopping and large retailers such as Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT). 
Sears has lost money almost every year over the past decade. Its stores deteriorated, even as Lampert bought the company's stock and lent it money. It sold several assets, including its legendary Craftsman tools brand.
Lampert made another go at the investment during a bankruptcy auction earlier this year, purchasing about 425 Sears and Kmart stores and assuming liabilities for a collective $5.2 billion deal.
The transaction closed in February, creating a smaller Sears now operating under the moniker Transform Holdco LLC. 
Sears is currently in the midst of closing additional stores and has warned employees and vendors of significant business challenges. It will have about 300 stores at the end of the year, the sources said.
The company also plans to close its acquisition of Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores Inc, (O:SHOS) a retailer of lawn and garden equipment and appliances, as soon as next week, one of the sources said.
STORE CLOSURES
Sears completed an $800 million refinancing in April that allowed the chain to lower its interest costs after it emerged from bankruptcy, according to a letter viewed by Reuters. 
Sears told its employees and vendors in a separate August letter seen by Reuters that it has ""faced a number of challenges returning our stores to sustainable levels of productivity, including... a generally weak retail environment."" 
The department store chain also said it could not rule out more store closures in the near term.
""Our goal remains to return the company to profitability and preserve as many jobs as possible in the communities we serve,"" the letter said. 
The Sears bankruptcy estate filed a lawsuit against Lampert earlier this year claiming that he had ""looted"" the company of billions of dollars, depriving creditors of repayment.

At the time it was filed, ESL said it vigorously disputed the lawsuit, calling the allegations ""misleading or just flat wrong,"" and saying all transactions were done in good faith and for shareholders' benefit.

1577,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 09:06AM ET</span>","Zero-sugar sodas, smaller soft drink cans drive Coca-Cola revenue beat","By Soundarya J
(Reuters) -  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue on Friday as customers took to smaller-sized cans of its sodas, including Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, prompting the beverage maker to give an upbeat forecast for 2019.
Faltering demand for sugary drinks has forced the world's two largest beverage makers, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP), to roll out low-sugar drinks, while diversifying into coffee, tea and bottled waters to boost sales.
Coca-Cola has also been rolling out new products such as Coca-Cola Plus Coffee, a blend of its trademark soda with coffee in more than 20 markets, as well as drinks in small but high-margin packs that are appealing to consumers who are turning more health conscious.
The beverage maker is launching Coca-Cola Energy, its first Coke-branded energy drink, in the United States, and has expanded its coffee business with the multi-billion dollar purchase of Britain-based Costa Coffee last year.
Volume in sparkling soft drinks rose 2% in the quarter, driven by double-digit percentage growth in Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Sprite in North America. 
Strong growth was also seen in its smaller package drinks, led by double-digit growth in 7.5-ounce mini-cans.
Organic revenue, that excludes the impact of currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, climbed 5% during the quarter, above the average analyst estimate of 4.3%, according to five analysts polled by Refinitiv.
Shares of the Atlanta-based company rose 2% before the opening bell, adding to the 14% they have gained this year.
""We were very impressed with Coca-Cola's better-than-expected topline,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnie Herzog said.
Coca-Cola also said it now expects full-year organic revenue growth to be at least 5%, from its previous forecast of 5% growth.
Overall, revenue rose 8.3% to $9.51 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 27, beating the average analyst estimate of $9.43 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Excluding items, Coca-Cola earned 56 cents per share, inline with estimates.
The beverage maker maintained its full-year profit forecast even as it lowered its capital expenditure forecast for the year to about $2.2 billion from its prior target of about $2.4 billion.

Earlier in the month, PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP) also reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and sales, benefiting from an advertising blitz and demand for its low-calorie beverages in North America.

1578,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 09:05AM ET</span>",Judge's unorthodox approach has huge opioid settlement within reach,"By Tom Hals and Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - From the start of the sprawling U.S. litigation seeking to hold drugmakers and distributors liable for the country's opioid epidemic, Judge Dan Polster has made one thing clear: he never wanted a trial.
On Friday, Polster will make his most dramatic bid yet to avoid a landmark trial that is scheduled to start on Monday. The federal judge has summoned the top executives from several large healthcare companies to his Cleveland court to try to hammer out a settlement that could be worth around $50 billion.
Polster has a knack for getting bitter adversaries into a conference room, making them feel understood and reaching a resolution, said Seema Saifee, a law clerk for the judge from 2004 to 2006.
""There would be times when I would be working on a draft opinion and he would come out of a conference room and say 'settled that one.' And I would take the draft and duly throw it out,"" said Saifee, a senior staff attorney with the non-profit Innocence Project in New York. 
""A colleague said he could probably settle the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,"" said Saifee.
If no deal is reached, Polster will play the part of the reluctant trial judge, guiding what promises to be some of the most complex litigation in U.S. history. 
""We don't need a lot of briefs and we don't need trials,"" said Polster at an initial hearing last year, after a federal panel assigned him to coordinate federal opioid cases from around the country. ""None of those are going to solve what we've got.""
Polster is overseeing more than 2,300 lawsuits by towns, cities, counties and tribal governments that seek to hold drugmakers, distributors and pharmacies liable for their role in a U.S. public health crisis that has taken a terrible toll.
Opioids were involved in around 400,000 overdose deaths between 1997 and 2017, and have cost the country hundreds of billions of dollars in emergency services, addiction treatment and lost worker productivity. 
The lawsuits allege that drug manufacturers aggressively marketed their painkillers while downplaying the risks of addiction, and claim drug distributors failed to halt and report suspicious orders for opioids. The companies deny the allegations. 
In a last-ditch effort to avoid a trial, Polster asked the chief executive officers of McKesson Corp (N:MCK),  Cardinal Health  Inc (N:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC) - the three largest U.S. drug distributors - and Israel-based drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA) to meet on Friday to discuss a proposal they have made to settle the cases.
'REALLY INNOVATIVE'
Polster, a native of his northern Ohio jurisdiction who has said he cycles 10 miles (16 km) to work, has taken an aggressive approach to getting a deal on opioids.
He invited state attorneys general, whose cases were not before him, to participate in settlement talks, and he ordered the federal government to turn over confidential data showing where each manufacturers' opioids were distributed in the United States.
He also recently endorsed a novel ""negotiation class"" framework that could be used to allow thousands of local governments to vote on potential settlements.
""If it looks like he is doing things that are really innovative, he is,"" said Mary Davis, the interim dean at the University of Kentucky College of Law. 
If talks fail, Monday will mark the start of a two-month trial that will pit Ohio's Cuyahoga and Summit counties against some companies in a bellwether, or test, trial that allows parties to see a jury's reaction to the allegations.
The outcome will be watched closely by plaintiffs and defendants in future trials, including U.S. healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ), to help them reach what is known as a global settlement of all opioid litigation.
""Maybe this isn’t what a court should do,"" Polster told a gathering at Harvard Law School in April 2018 about aggressively pushing settlements. ""The courts didn’t ask for this ... This one cried out for some effort to come together.”
The judge has his critics.
A Reuters investigation showed that Polster has been more willing to seal documents than other judges involved in opioid litigation, raising concerns that important information about the crisis remains secret. Polster declined to comment on that report.
The major drug distributors and retailers, including CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) and Walmart Inc (WMT), took the rare step of trying to remove the judge from the case based on his appearance of bias, in part due to his unusual habit of discussing the case in the media and his push for a settlement. An appeals court backed Polster.

""Publicly acknowledging this human toll does not suggest I am biased; it shows that I am human,"" Polster wrote in a court filing.

1579,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 08:57AM ET</span>","Deficit feeds lead's rally, but surplus on the horizon","By Pratima Desai
LONDON (Reuters) - Unexpected shortages of lead due to supply disruptions have helped prices of the car battery metal to outperform other metals such as copper, aluminum and zinc, but looming surpluses mean this trend is unlikely to persist.
Benchmark lead on the London Metal Exchange at around $2,200 a tonne is up nearly 9% so far this year compared with losses of 3%, 7% and 25% for copper, aluminum and zinc respectively.
(GRAPHIC - Lead outperforms: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/6972/6954/lead%20prices%20rebased.png) 
Prices of industrial metals overall are under pressure from the protracted trade dispute between the United States and China, the world's two largest economies, which has weighed on growth, industrial activity and demand.
Behind lead's ascent to 15-month highs above $2,200 a tonne is Nyrstar's Port Pirie lead smelter in Australia, which halted production in May. It produced 160,000 tonnes of lead last year.
(GRAPHIC - Lead prices: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/6976/6958/Lead%20price.png) 
In a recent production report, Nyrstar said lead output at 51,000 tonnes in the first half of the year was down 27% for the same period last year. Analysts expect Port Pirie to produce only 90,000 tonnes of lead this year.
Nyrstar declined to comment.
""Lead has been a star performer largely because of Port Pirie. But this year we are at a transition point, going from four years of deficits to five maybe six years of surpluses,"" said Wood Mackenzie analyst Farid Ahmed.
Ahmed expects prices to average around $2,000 a tonne next year and nearer $1,900 a tonne in the years after.
""We've downgraded our consumption numbers through the year as the U.S.-China trade war dragged on and despite Port Pirie, we see a market moving into surplus which will put pressure on lead prices, but we don't see a price collapse.""
Historically, lead is seen to be recession-proof as during cold weather more batteries need to be replaced and this is exacerbated by weak growth when many people and firms decide to replace batteries rather than purchase new cars and trucks.
Global auto sales are seen down 3% this year, according to a forecast developed jointly by J.D. Power and LMC Automotive.
""With trade uncertainty in the backdrop, global risks could pull down the U.S. economy, and with it, auto demand next year,"" said Jeff Schuster, President, Americas Operations and Global Vehicle Forecasts, LMC Automotive.
Analysts expect lead demand to remain unchanged or shrink this year, for the first time since the 2008 financial crash.
Global lead demand is estimated at around 12 million tonnes.
(GRAPHIC - Lead demand by sector: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/6971/6953/Lead%20demand%20by%20sector.png) 
More than 85% of that will be used to make batteries, most of them destined for the auto industry, sales of which have been falling in many countries around the world.
(GRAPHIC - Lead vs auto sales: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/6973/6955/US%20vehicle%20sales%20vs%20lead%20prices.png) 
""We thought 2019 would be a surplus year. We are now forecasting a deficit of 50,000 tonnes this year, but the final number will depend on whether Port Pirie comes back soon,"" said CRU analyst Neil Hawkes.
""Losses at Port Pirie and other smelters have been partially offset by weaker demand, but we are going into a seasonally strong period for lead demand so prices should be supported.""
Adding to lead shortages is Glencore's Belledune smelter in Canada where workers have been on strike since April. It produced 76,000 tonnes last year and is expected by analysts to produce 50,000 tonnes this year. 
 Glencore  (LON:GLEN) declined to comment.
(GRAPHIC - Lead stocks: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/6974/6956/LEAD%20STOCKS.png) 
Draws on lead stocks at LME registered warehouses, below 70,000 tonnes and down nearly 20% since Aug. 1, also suggest supply falling short of demand, traders say.
But they say that the lead in LME warehouses does not meet the quality requirements of the battery industry and that it needs to be resmelted.
""Speculators are long of lead, for now,"" one trader said. ""But the lead in LME warehouses isn't really fit for purpose, can't really be used. Unless someone bothers to clean it up, it will probably show up again somewhere else.""

1580,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 08:37AM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Tech haves and have-nots face third-quarter tests,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Technology companies, which make up the largest swath of the U.S. stock market, are expected to post a nearly 8% drop in third-quarter profits as reports roll in next week from many of the sector's biggest corporations.
But below the surface, the estimates reveal a wide range among the companies that comprise the S&P 500 information technology sector (SPLRCT), which includes Apple Inc (O:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) as well as communications equipment, hardware and IT services companies.
The overall sector's earnings performance is being dragged down by semiconductors, which are expected to post a nearly 27% plunge in quarterly profits, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, as analysts point to impact from the U.S.-China tariff conflict and generally weak demand.
Growing business IT spending continues to support other pockets of tech, according to investors. Software firms are poised for a nearly 11% gain in profits from a year ago, according to the IBES data from Refinitiv.
""You may have two dynamics going on in tech in the opposite direction,"" said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio. ""Can software live up to the numbers and will semis beat the numbers?""
Among software companies, Microsoft, the largest U.S. company by market value, reports results on Wednesday, while earnings are also due next week from semiconductor stalwarts  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) and Texas Instruments Inc (O:TXN).
Other tech earnings next week include payment processors  PayPal Holdings Inc  (O:PYPL) and  Visa Inc  (N:V), with iPhone maker Apple, whose results ripple through its supply chain, expected to post a 2.7% drop in earnings when it reports the following week.
One of the early reporters, International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM), kicked off the season on a sour note on Wednesday, with quarterly revenue that missed estimates.
(GRAPHIC - Tech's third-quarter outlook: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-STOCKS-WEEKAHEAD/0H001QXE0902/eikon.png)
Even with the disparate forecasts for the third-quarter company results, tech stocks are outshining the market broadly in 2019.
The S&P 500 tech sector, which comprises over one-fifth of the benchmark index, has climbed more than 30% in 2019, compared to a 19% rise for the S&P 500 (SPX).
Federal Reserve easing of interest rates has helped the performance, which comes despite uncertainty about the health of the global economy and about U.S.-China trade tensions.
Tech is ""the primary growth engine of the economy,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) in Boston.
""China is an issue for them, but at the same time they continue to grow and they continue to innovate,"" Joy said. ""You have to have exposure in technology. We just think as you look around at the market landscape, it's one of the better places to be right now.""
The tech sector's strength is broad-based, including gains so far this year of about 30% or more from the four biggest industry groups by market value within the tech sector: software , IT services , hardware, storage & peripherals and semiconductors .
""The IT budget continues to garner more dollars from the general budget of Corporate America,"" said Michael Seidenberg, portfolio manager for the global technology team at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors. ""There will be winners and losers within the sector, but I think generally speaking that is a trend that has persisted.""
Of U.S. corporations, semiconductor makers are seen as among the most affected by the U.S.-China trade tensions, which have triggered big swings in their shares.
But the stocks still have prospered: the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index (SOX) has climbed nearly 40% this year to all-time highs, while three chip stocks - KLA Corp (O:KLAC),  Lam Research Corp  (O:LRCX), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (O:AMD) - are the tech sector's biggest 2019 gainers.
Despite the steep decline in third-quarter profits projected for S&P 500 semiconductor companies, analysts are optimistic there will be improvement soon, with semiconductors expected to post an 11% rise in 2020 earnings, according to Refinitiv data.
""To me, there's a huge disconnect between the performance of these names and the underlying fundamentals,"" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta.
For software and other tech companies, the third quarter can be seasonally weak, said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh, who said she would be looking for executives to comment on whether business is being pushed back to future quarters.
But the strong employment market has supported tech stocks, Forrest said.
""This a phenomenon you see in the late stages of an expansion,"" Forrest said. ""Hiring is up and to support all the new people that you've hired, you to add to your technology."""

The luxury jewelry retailer, owned by Greek  Folli Follie  (AT:HDFr), has around 28 standalone stores across the UK and Ireland along with seven kiosks and employed 350 people when it appointed administrators earlier this month.
""Whilst we continue to talk to interested parties about a sale of the business, the ongoing cash-flow pressures mean the current cost base is not sustainable,"" joint administrator Matt Smith said. 
Smith had earlier said that the directors had been seeking alternative solutions, including a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), refinancing or sale, but were unable to ink such a deal.
Links of London was founded in 1990, offering unisex jewelry and lifestyle accessories, with luxury products designed after London's art, music, and film scenes at the time.
It appointed administrators earlier this month and said on its website it was unable to process any online sales, but directed people to its stores. 

The jeweler's Greek owners have also faced their share of troubles. Folli Follie in August mandated Deloitte and Savigny Partners to look into the possible sale of Links of London, which it bought in 2006.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co's incoming chief executive Makoto Uchida told employees on Friday that his mission is to ""restore business performance and regain trust in Nissan"".
""Nissan is on the right path for recovery ... although it might be a gradual process,"" Uchida, who is Nissan's China chief, said in a video message posted on an internal company website.
Someone who saw the video made details of it available to Reuters.
Uchida is expected to formally take up the CEO post by Jan. 1, 2020.
His appointment was announced in early October, along with decisions by the board of Japan's second-biggest automaker (T:7201) to name Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211) executive Ashwani Gupta chief operating officer and Nissan executive Jun Seki vice chief operating officer.
The three will take the helm of a company that has been shaken by turmoil following the downfall of former chairman Carlos Ghosn last year and the departure of former CEO Hiroto Saikawa last month.
Nissan's profits have nearly evaporated and its business has weakened globally but especially in the United States.
To restore profitability, the Yokohama-based automaker is in the process of laying off some 12,500 employees globally and is trying to mend frayed ties with its alliance partner,  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).
Following various internal meetings, Uchida told employees in the video he was convinced that Nissan was on the right path for recovery, though it might be a gradual process.
""However, please understand that I cannot do it alone,"" he said.
""The most important thing right now is to have trust and full contribution from each one of you.""
Uchida said he was poised to use all his experience to turn the company around, which he stressed also ""will include the building of alliance partnerships"".
In picking Uchida as the new global head of Nissan, the company's board has chosen an executive known internally for close ties to top shareholder Renault and for a frank, straight-talking manner that has marked him as an outsider.
According to one long-time associate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, Uchida is known for his unflagging work ethic and relentless focus on cost control. The source described Uchida as direct and to the point in conversations, a ""foreigner with a Japanese face"".
Uchida joined the car maker mid-career in 2003, a rarity in a country where top executives usually spend their entire working lives at the same company."

""We regret the choice of the U.S. to move ahead with tariffs. This step leaves us no alternative but to follow through in due course with our own tariffs in the Boeing case, where the U.S. has been found in breach of WTO rules,"" Malmstrom said.
The WTO has found that both Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies in a pair of cases that have run for 15 years. The United States imposed tariffs on $7.5 billion of EU imports on Friday. An adjudication on damages in the Boeing case is expected early in 2020."

1589,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 07:00AM ET</span>",Renault shares slump as profit warning deepens carmaker's problems,"By Sarah White
PARIS (Reuters) - A profit warning sent Renault's (PA:RENA) shares as much as 15% lower on Friday, capping a turbulent year for the French carmaker since the arrest of long-time boss Carlos Ghosn and adding to signs of a sharp global auto industry slowdown.
 Renault  and Nissan (T:7201) both announced leadership changes last week, seeking to reboot their alliance which was thrown into crisis last year by the arrest of Ghosn in Tokyo on financial misconduct charges, which he denies. 
But the companies are struggling amid a global slowdown and a fall in emerging market demand, with pressures also coming from tougher emissions regulations in Europe and the need to invest in electric and self-driving technologies. 
Rivals including  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and French Peugeot-maker PSA (PA:PEUP) are set to add to the picture next week in sales updates, while Swedish truckmaker Volvo (ST:VOLVb) on Friday reported a sharp drop in orders.
Renault said late on Thursday that sales were likely to drop between 3% and 4% this year, compared with its previous forecast for a similar outcome to 2018. It blamed difficulties in Argentina and Turkey in particular.
The company also said its operating margin was set to come in at 5%, versus a previous 6% goal, as it struggles to keep a lid on research and development costs.
Analysts, who said they had expected sales targets to be revised, added that the margin guidance, equivalent to a steeper-than-expected 500 million to 600 million euro cut to Renault's operating profit, was the main shock. 
""Renault guiding down for the full year should not be a major surprise, although the magnitude is,"" analysts at Jefferies said in a note. 
Renault shares dropped to a six year low of 46.7 euros and at 0955 GMT were down 12.3% at 48.11 euros. 
FIAT LOGIC
While Renault is not alone in suffering from an auto market downturn, its capacity to react was also thrown off kilter by the Ghosn turmoil, with industrial projects planned with Nissan placed on the backburner. 
In its latest management revamp, sealed last week, Renault ousted Ghosn protegee Thierry Bollore as CEO and appointed financial chief Clotilde Delbos in the interim, billing the changes as a reset for the alliance. 
Nissan also has new faces at the helm. 
Delbos said on Thursday the two groups would now be able to focus on ways to cut costs after the shake-up, though the worsening backdrop for carmakers adds urgency for the alliance.
""Needless to say that this profit warning comes at a time of major instability at Renault and its partner Nissan,"" analysts at Evercore said in a note. 
Carmakers also face billions of euros in fines if they fail to comply with EU emissions targets by 2021.
Many are behind the scenes thinking of further tie-ups with rivals to face these challenges, according to industry sources. 

Renault has said in recent weeks that a failed deal with  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), which withdrew a merger offer in June, was not at present on the agenda. Delbos said on Thursday that the logic of such a transaction was ""as attractive"" as before.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks slipped after China posted its weakest growth rate in nearly three decades on Friday, while the dollar was set for its worst week in almost four months having been pummeled by pound and euro Brexit rallies.
China's economy grew a slightly less-than-expected 6% in the third quarter, leaving traders hoping that the swift stimulus Beijing and the major global central banks have provided in recent weeks will fend off a more serious downturn.
Main European bourses fell a modest 0.1%-0.3% (EU) after Asia had been led lower by a 1.2% slump in top Chinese shares (CSI300). There was also a sharp reverse in car shares (SXAP) after a  Renault  (PA:RENA) profit warning. (EU)
""You can't get away from the fact that China is slowing, but it's not slowing more than we thought,"" said head of global macro strategy at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets Michael Metcalfe.
""We know that Q4 is going to be a soft patch, but to a degree policymakers are ahead of this, so as long as we don't have an escalation of the trade war now I think markets can handle it.""
In currencies, sterling was taking a breather at $1.2850 , having scored its best six-day streak in near 30 years on Thursday after Britain and the EU sealed a new Brexit deal. 
Doubts about whether the deal will be approved in the British parliament were still sky high, though, with swathes of lawmakers, who are either reluctant about Brexit or worried the deal is not a clean enough break, due to debate the deal in a rare Saturday sitting.
""Whatever was agreed last night with the EU still has to go through the British parliament... the uncertainty surrounding that still hasn't changed one iota,"" said James McGlew, executive director of corporate stockbroking at Argonaut.
The euro rested at $1.1125 (EUR=EBS), not far from $1.1140, its highest since Aug. 26. The dollar remained weak too having seen this week's weak retail sales data and more U.S. interest rate cut talk contribute to its biggest weekly slide since June. (DXY)
EARNINGS
Helping to alleviate immediate trade war worries, China had said on Thursday that it hoped to reach a phased agreement in its trade dispute with the United States as soon as possible.
Investors were also encouraged by upbeat earnings from Netflix (O:NFLX) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), but poor results from International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM) and weak U.S. economic data weighed.
Housing starts, industrial production and mid-Atlantic factory output all fell short of economists' expectations.
Reflecting the cautious mood, the safe-haven yen strengthened, with the dollar falling 0.13% to 108.51. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes (US10YT=RR) edged up though to 1.764%, compared with a U.S. close of 1.755% on Thursday.
Euro zone bond yields were also nudging up with German Bund yields holding at -0.40%, the highest since early August. (DE10YT=RR)
The Bund yield is now up 16 bps since Irish and British leaders said on Oct. 10 they saw a path to a Brexit deal, which boosted risk appetite and weakened demand for safe-haven assets like bonds.
In commodities, oil fell on the China data, with Brent crude (LCOc1) easing 0.52% to $59.60 and U.S. crude (CLc1) dropping 0.19% to $53.83. 
""The (China) GDP print has weighed on short-term sentiment and we have seen regional stock markets and oil contracts edge lower because of that,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at brokerage OANDA.
Crude demand growth tends to track economic growth trends, but Halley said China's need for oil would not recede any time soon.
Underlining that view, Chinese official data released on Friday showed robust refinery throughput in September, rising 9.4% from a year earlier to 56.49 million tonnes, on increases from new refineries and some independent refiners resuming operations after maintenance. 
Gold  dipped to $1,488 per ounce.

1595,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 05:30AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Sometimes You Just Have to Say Renault, Nault, Nault","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Europe’s automotive sector plunged on Friday after France’s   Renault   (PA:RENA) slashed its outlook for 2019, citing the weakness of the European economy and the cost of introducing cleaner engines.
Renault’s own shares fell as much as 15% before recovering a little to trade down 12.1% by 5:30 AM ET (0900 GMT), after acting CEO Clotilde Delbos indicated revenue this year would come in 1 billion euros under previous guidance, with operating profits taking a hit of around 600 million.
The company now sees sales falling as much as 4% this year, instead of staying roughly flat. Under the new guidance, this year’s free cash flow is likely to be around -700 million euros, something that may strain the company’s credit rating (although Delbos, who doubles as chief financial officer, played down suggestions of a downgrade on Thursday’s hastily-arranged analyst call).
The news wiped out all of Renault’s gains for year and put it firmly at the bottom of the CAC 40 (which also had bad news from   Danone   (PA:DANO),   Remy Cointreau   (PA:RCOP) and   Thales   (PA:TCFP) to digest). It also dragged down rivals   Fiat   Chrysler (MI:FCHA),   Peugeot   (PA:PEUP) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
The reasons are depressingly familiar: the company is heavily dependent on Europe, where its sales have been hit not only by macroeconomic weakness, but also by the introduction of tighter emissions standards, which have forced it to invest more in cleaner engines.
 Renault  (PA:RENA) was a late, reluctant and not particularly distinguished convert to the now largely-discredited diesel technology, in a continent where over 400,000 lives were shortened by air pollution in 2016, according to EU research published earlier this week. 
The developments are another stark reminder of the existential challenges facing the European car industry in general and  Renault  (PA:RENA) in particular, given the way its alliance with Nissan has frayed in the last 12 months. They come only a week after chief executive Thierry Bollore was forced out, with the aim of restoring a relationship on which Renault depends for its bottom line. 
Like many others in the sector,  Renault  (PA:RENA) will be relieved if the U.K. can leave the EU without causing further harm to the European economy. However, Thursday’s figures suggest that Renault is going to need much more than a smooth Brexit to turn itself around."

1597,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 05:01AM ET</span>",Cathay Pacific shelves U.S. dollar bond plans amid Hong Kong unrest,"By Scott Murdoch
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) has shelved plans for its first U.S. dollar debt deal in 23 years, the airline said on Friday, after sources told Reuters that global investors had baulked at the pricing due to civil unrest in Hong Kong.
The airline, the biggest corporate casualty of widespread anti-government protests in the Asian financial hub, on Friday lowered its second-half profit expectations, citing ""incredibly challenging"" conditions in its home market.
Cathay had started meeting investors in Hong Kong and Singapore on Sept. 24 after it mandated four banks to explore carrying out a U.S. dollar denominated bond, according to a term sheet issued at the time, seen by Reuters.
It would have been the first U.S. dollar debt deal for Cathay since 1996 and had been touted as a landmark transaction for the airline given all of its debt is denominated in Hong Kong dollars.
The issuance was to be unrated, and two sources with knowledge of the matter said that Cathay was willing to pay 200 basis points over the U.S. Treasuries rate to secure three-year or five-year funding, with the size and term of the placement dependent on demand. 
However, investors demanded a higher price of at least 300 basis points over U.S. Treasuries, which made the deal more expensive for Cathay, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.
Cathay's term sheet had said the transaction would be reliant on market conditions. 
A Cathay spokesman on Friday said the Hong Kong dollar private placement market was providing more funding opportunities and a debt issuance in that market was completed last month.
""We will continue to monitor the U.S. dollar bond market in future,"" he said in a statement.
Dealogic data showed that Cathay raised $102 million in October and $64 million in May through Hong Kong dollar denominated deals. 
The airline has only carried out 12 bond transactions in the past decade and all were priced in Hong Kong dollars. 

Cathay had mandated Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and HSBC to work on the shelved U.S. dollar bond deal.

1598,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 04:53AM ET</span>",Renault sales warning drags on European shares,"By Medha Singh and Lisa Pauline Mattackal
(Reuters) - French carmaker  Renault  dragged European shares lower on Friday, while the sharpest contraction in the Chinese economy in nearly three decades exacerbated worries about slowing global growth.
Renault (PA:RENA) slumped 12.7% to lowest since 2013 after the company cut its full-year revenue and profit forecast amid a broad-based slump in auto sales.
The fall put the wider auto and auto parts index (SXAP) on course for its biggest percentage drop in two-and-a-half weeks, and pulled the Paris (FCHI) index down 0.2%, lagging its European peers.
Adding to the gloom in the auto sector, Sweden's AB Volvo (ST:VOLVb) said demand for trucks would fall on both sides of the North Atlantic next year.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was marginally lower, eyeing its third day of losses, but still on pace to end a volatile week, dominated by Brexit headlines, modestly higher.
Boris Johnson struck a Brexit deal with the European Union on Thursday, sending the benchmark index to its highest in more than a year, but concerns remain about the deal getting through the British parliament.
""Everyone is very tired of Brexit. People just want to get this done and look forward to other things, like negotiating a free trade deal,"" said Stefan Koopman, senior market economist at Rabobank.
Uncertainty about UK's orderly exit from the EU and other geopolitical tensions, combined with slowing global growth, have rankled financial markets this year.
After a solid increase in the first quarter, gains in the STOXX 600 index have tapered off in the second and third. Fresh data on Friday showed China's economic growth slowed more than expected in the third quarter.
Investor focus now turns to the third-quarter earnings season, which kicks off in earnest next week. An earnings recession in Europe is expected to deepen in the third quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Early earnings reports, however, were a mixed bag, with weak results from the defense and retail sectors, but a strong report from Swedish medical technology group Getinge (ST:GETIb). Its shares jumped 16.3% to the top of STOXX 600 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly core profit.
 Thales  (PA:TCFP), the largest European defense electronics company, dropped 3.5% after lowering its 2019 revenue growth forecast, while yogurt maker  Danone  (PA:DANO) tumbled 6.2% after narrowing its sales growth outlook for 2019.
 London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) rose 2.4% after reporting a higher-than-expected third-quarter income ahead of the planned shareholder vote on its deal to buy data provider Refinitiv.
The German (GDAXI) index ticked higher, with help from  Deutsche Post  AG (DE:DPWGn) after Berenberg upgraded the stock to ""buy"", while gains in banks propped up Spanish (IBEX) and Italian (FTMIB) bourses."
1599,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 04:24AM ET</span>","After Hemorrhaging $100 Billion, Europe Stages a Comeback","(Bloomberg) -- Growth remains slow, the Brexit saga is far from over and yet, European assets are gaining favor with investors.
The reason? There are several, including optimism that a no-deal Brexit is off the table and that the U.S. and China are making progress in trade talks. But in Europe’s case, it’s also a contrarian call on buying a market that has been largely avoided by investors this year.
“We saw that the positioning was particularly poor and Europe was one of the more unloved and under-owned areas of the world,” said Nathan Thooft, head of global asset allocation at Manulife Investment Management, which has been buying European stocks in October. “As soon as people start to see positive signs, they come running back and the opportunity for the upside is still there.""
Just this year alone, European equity funds have lost about $100 billion to outflows, even as the returns have been comparable to those of the S&P 500 index. Fund managers see Europe as the region with the least favorable profit outlook among major markets, according to the latest Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). fund manager survey. And they have a point since Germany on Thursday slashed its 2020 growth forecast and is flirting with recession.
But the October moves in key European markets are signaling that bears may be giving up some of their positions. The euro, which last month hit a two-year low, is the best-performing major developed-market currency after the pound this month, while the Euro Stoxx 50’s 2.5% gain in U.S. dollar terms is three times that of the S&P 500. And Europe’s primary bond market jumped back to life on Thursday and may set a new annual record by the end of next month.
Strategists from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America turned bullish on European stocks earlier this month, saying that economic data are hitting lows and can only get better from here, whereas low investor positioning creates ample room for entry.
“Given the strong consensus underweight and fading political uncertainty, some international investors view Europe more positively now,” said Ulrich Urbahn, head of multi-asset strategy and research at Joh Berenberg Gossler & Co. “There is a bigger chance now that Europe can attract more inflows in the coming months.""
And now that Boris Johnson managed to bridge a deal with the European Union, all eyes are on his ability to get it through Britain’s Parliament. Success would be a major positive catalyst for European and U.K. assets. European stocks are unlikely to jump 5% overnight if a deal is passed, but it’ll fuel further upgrades in investor positioning, according to Manulife’s Thooft.
Reports that the EU and U.K. were closing in on a draft deal sent the STOXX Europe 600 to the highest level in 17 months on Tuesday. The likes of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said that euro-area stocks would be a key beneficiary of increased political clarity.
Speculation that the U.K. is nearing a Brexit deal pushed Sanford C. Bernstein strategists led by Inigo Fraser-Jenkins to raise European equities -- but not the U.K. -- to overweight. Analysts blame passive funds for their different views on Europe and the U.K., saying that index-tracking funds for Europe excluding the U.K. have seen strong selling over the past 18 months, whereas U.K. passive funds has seen no material exit.
“Europe has been left behind and it is proving to be a wrong choice already,” said Alberto Tocchio, chief investment officer at Colombo Wealth SA, who has bought call options on European stocks on expectations of a Brexit deal. “A potential resolution of the Brexit issue could be the spark that would lead to some major inflows into Europe over the next months."""

Vivendi shares were up 2.7% in early trading, the best performer on France's benchmark CAC-40 index (FCHI), which was down 0.7%.
""Group trading continues to track well, but we view the major catalyst for share price upside in the short term to be further sell down of UMG,"" wrote brokerage Liberum, which kept a ""buy"" rating on Vivendi.
Investors in addition to China's Tencent Holdings (HK:0700) have shown interest in buying a minority stake in Universal, Vivendi said late on Thursday.
Universal, the music label of Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande and the Beatles, was the main sales growth driver for Vivendi in the third quarter.
The Paris-based group, controlled by French billionaire Vincent Bollore, aims to cash in on a music industry revival, driven by a growing thirst for subscription and advertising-based streaming services.
The company said it was still in talks with Tencent for a sale of up to 20% of Universal, which could value the division at about 30 billion euros ($33.4 billion). Due diligence and legal documentation on the Universal sale is expected to be completed in the coming weeks, Vivendi added."

Individual and business customers will be charged a rate of -0.75% on cash balances above 2 million Swiss francs ($2.02 million), Switzerland's second biggest lender said. Balances of less than 2 million francs will be unaffected.
A rate of -0.85% will be imposed on business customers with balances above 10 million francs.
The new rules take effect from Jan. 1 for individual customers and Nov. 15 for business customers.
Credit Suisse's cross-town rival UBS (S:UBSG) in July said it would charge a -0.75% rate on deposits above 2 million francs, while Postfinance charges fees to private customers with balances above 500,000 francs.
Several banks in Switzerland, including private bank  Julius Baer  (S:BAER), and the eurozone also pass on the cost of negative official rates to corporate depositors, though most large players have refrained from doing so with individual clients.
""As other banks have been doing for some time, Credit Suisse is introducing negative interest rates for clients with very high Swiss franc cash holdings,"" Credit Suisse said on Friday.
""The reason for this is the persistent negative interest rate environment.""
The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has charged a negative rate of -0.75% since January 2015 on deposits parked with the central bank by commercial banks overnight, one of the tools the SNB uses to deter investor appetite for the Swiss franc.
Many economists expect the SNB to take the interest rate lower next year to prevent further strengthening of the safe-haven currency, which could damage Switzerland's export-reliant economy."

The business includes the main Three TV news broadcaster, which may have to be shut down if no buyer is found soon, leaving several hundred people jobless and the country with just one state-owned broadcaster for reporting TV news. 
Mediaworks, owned by U.S. asset management firm Oaktree Capital, will continue to retain its radio network and the New Zealand business of Australian outdoor advertising company QMS Media (AX:QMS).
It has blamed the government for allowing state broadcaster Television New Zealand to dominate the TV industry thereby disadvantaging its business. 
""The market that free-to-air television operates in is tough and has been exacerbated this year,"" said Chief Executive Michael Anderson, adding that the focus would now be to accelerate opportunities for its radio and outdoor platforms, which have delivered better growth. 
""This is reflected in the performance of all free-to-air television operators in New Zealand, not just us,"" he added. 
Mediaworks has also put the TV business's associated real estate up for sale. It was not immediately clear how much the business would fetch. 
TV networks in New Zealand, which has a population of about five million people, have been facing growing pressures from shrinking advertising revenue and competition from popular streaming services like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
Mediaworks reported a loss of NZ$5.5 million ($3.50 million) for the year ended December 2018, weighed down by the Three TV business. 
Local media reported that staff at Three TV, which includes journalists and news readers, fear that the network could be closed by Christmas this year in case a buyer is not found quickly.
Journalists and media commentators discussed the announcement on social media and called for efforts from the public to help the popular TV network to find a buyer. 
Broadcasting Minister Kris Faafoi told local media that the government would not interfere in the commercial decision of a private company.

1606,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 02:43AM ET</span>",Saudi Aramco delays planned IPO until after earnings update: sources,"By Hadeel Al Sayegh and Marwa Rashad
DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco has delayed the planned launch of its initial public offering in hopes that pending third-quarter results will bolster investor confidence in the world's largest oil firm, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Aramco had been expected to announce plans next week to float a 1% to 2% stake on the kingdom's Tadawul market, in what would have been one of the largest ever public offerings, worth upwards of $20 billion.
However, after a Sept. 14 attack on its Abqaiq and Khurais plants temporarily knocked out half its crude output, the world's top exporter wants to reassure investors by first presenting results covering the period, the two sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the information is not public.
""They want to do all that they can to hit the valuation target. Solid results after the attack will put them in a stronger position,"" said one of the sources.
The second source confirmed the offering had been postponed, and there was currently no new date set for the listing. Neither source knew when third quarter results were likely to come out.
In a statement to Reuters on Friday, Saudi Aramco said: ""The company continues to engage with the shareholders on IPO readiness activities. The company is ready and timing will depend on market conditions and be at a time of the shareholders' choosing.""
The news comes after Reuters, citing sources familiar with the IPO, reported on Sept. 24 that the offering was unlikely to happen this year in light of the attacks.
The Financial Times, which initially reported the IPO delay on Thursday, cited a source as saying the listing was delayed by ""weeks"".
The prospect of Aramco selling a piece of itself has had Wall Street on tenterhooks since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first flagged it three years ago.
However, his desired $2 trillion valuation has always been questioned by some financiers and industry experts who note that countries have been accelerating efforts to shift away from fossil fuels to curb global warming, putting oil prices under pressure and undermining producers' equity value.
Then came the September attack, which initially knocked out 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of production, or more than 5% of global oil supply.
Aramco executives have insisted since the attack that it would have no impact on its plans to list the company. The full restoration of oil output as declared by Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Oct. 3 - at a faster clip than expected - was seen boosting the company's image.
""The official line was that the Q3 results were very good, so they want to update the analysts and market the IPO after the Q3 numbers,"" the second source said. 
Aramco halted plans for a blockbuster international listing of around 5% last year amid debate over where to list overseas, but talks resumed this summer.
They were given impetus by the appointment of Yasir al-Rumayyan, a close ally of Prince Mohammed and former investment banker, as chairman of Aramco. A host of banks were given roles to arrange the listing.

Saudi investors see the IPO as a chance to own part of the kingdom's crown jewel and an opportunity to show patriotism after the attack.

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 02:13AM ET</span>",Going Dutch? Low interest rates rattle 'world's best' pension system,"By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - When Frans Kolkman hung up his police badge in 2017, he was looking forward to a comfortable retirement. Two years later he's among millions of Dutch pensioners facing a cut and fearing there may be worse to come.
The planned reductions, due to take effect from January 2020, have shaken a country renowned for having one of the world's strongest pension systems, and are an early warning to others about the impact of record low interest rates.
Kolkman, who spent 43 years in the police force, hastens to add he will still be well-off but ""if I live another 20 years, and there's cut after cut after cut, then I really don't know anymore.""
The European Central Bank's (ECB) stimulus policies, which have helped drive interest rates into negative territory, are blamed in part for the impending cuts in the Netherlands and have triggered a fierce debate over how the funding of pensions should be calculated.
ECB President Mario Draghi said last month that the central bank was ""very concerned"" about the side effects of negative rates, but maintained they were required for economic growth.
At the heart of the Dutch debate is a technical question over how to calculate the cost of future pension payouts while the ECB helps keep rates low.
Actuaries make assumptions about how long pensioners will live, count up the future payments that have been promised to them and then use an assumed interest rate to ""discount"" how much must be put away to pay them.
The lower this interest rate, ""rekenrente"" in Dutch, the more conservative the accounting, and the more it costs to meet future liabilities.
The rekenrente is derived from government bond yields -- which have turned negative across Europe as interest rates steadily fell this summer.
Each 1% fall in interest rates has led to roughly a 12% fall in the coverage ratio between assets and liabilities in pension pots, the Dutch central bank says. As a January deadline approaches, cuts appear inevitable.
That has led several funds and some experts to argue that the rekenrente, which is around 0.3%, should be raised instead. Many blame ECB policy and see its effects as temporary.
Increasing the rekenrente to 2% or 3% would restore the funds to full solvency. Corien Wortmann-Kool, the chairwoman of the 456 billion euro ABP civil servants fund, told Reuters she opposes pension cuts as ""unnecessary"" for now.
""We believe we can achieve good returns, now and in the future,"" she said, estimating a 4% return over time is achievable despite low interest rates.
ABP's coverage ratio first fell through a 95% ""critical"" level, below which pensions should be cut to ensure a fund has enough assets to meet its liabilities, in July. It fell to 88.6% in August before recovering to 91% in September.
But Dutch Central Bank President Klaas Knot, the country's top pension regulator, says the rekenrente is ""integral"" to the system.
""We will continue to adhere to the risk-free rate of interest,"" Knot told journalists this week.
His approach is supported by a group of 10 academics who this week wrote to parliament arguing against a change.
""Imagine you took the risk free rate of return and raised it by 2%. Then the coverage ratio would increase at a typical fund by up to 30%. It sounds too good to be true -- and it is. Pensioners get that money paid out now, but the assets pot will be a little more empty each year, and that would go on each year for years,"" the letter said.
SIGN OF THE TIMES
One reason the Dutch system is considered so strong is its rigorous accounting. Another is its reliance on several different sources of pensions. Its first tier is the basic state pension that is funded by current workers on the ""pay as you go"" basis that is the heart of systems in France, Italy and Germany.
The Dutch system relies more heavily than most on a second tier, supplementary employer-run pension funds, the ones preparing cuts. The Dutch fight will be closely watched in the United States and Britain, which have similar tiered systems but funds sometimes use less stringent accounting rules.
Even after the cuts, Dutch workers would still receive more generous pensions than employees in other rich countries. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) calculates that Dutch retirees get about as much, all told, as their after-tax income while they were working.
But for Kolkman and other pensioners, cuts estimated at up to 8% next year make no sense, given assets in Dutch pension funds have doubled since 2008 to more than 1.5 trillion euros.
This represents the most of any major industrialized nation as a percentage of GDP, as up to 90% of Dutch workers are enrolled in funds to which they and their employers contribute.
""It's an amazing amount of money,"" said Henk Krol, leader of the 50Plus political party, which represents older voters. ""Now the problem is: how much must there be in the pot to pay everyone the share that he or she deserves?""
Krol expects some rule change will ultimately be agreed to avert the cuts, given the prospect of national elections in 2021.
For those running the pensions, however, the reality is that cuts are coming.
""At the current coverage ratio of 92.2% we must cut pensions in 2020,"" said Peter Borgdorff, fund director of the 238 billion euro PFZW fund, which covers healthcare workers, on Thursday.
And central bank chief Knot sees no wiggle room.
""It's not so relevant why rates are so low, what's relevant is that they are going to stay at this level and then the consequences for the housing market and for pensions must be faced. ... We will enforce the rules,"" said Knot.
Kolkman knows that he is lucky: his private pension will cover 40% of his ""generous"" final salary. But he says cuts seem wrong, especially given that Dutch pensions have already not been indexed for inflation for years.
""What gets me is now we're retired we can't really fight back. We can't go on strike. We could demonstrate, I guess, but they aren't going to lose sleep over that."""

1609,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 01:00AM ET</span>",Saudi Aramco to Delay Launch of Its Initial Public Offering,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Aramco abruptly postponed the launch of the world’s largest initial public offering by at least a few weeks, according to people briefed on the situation.
The delay will give the array of Wall Street banks advising the Saudi state oil producer time to incorporate third-quarter results into their pre-IPO assessment valuations, said one of the people, who asked not to be named discussing confidential deliberations. The banks are still struggling to meet the $2 trillion valuation the company is seeking, according to the person.
The sudden delay disrupts the carefully choreographed plan to launch the share sale on Oct. 20, followed a week later by intense promotion during the country’s big investment forum -- dubbed Davos in the Desert -- and ending with an IPO in late November. Now, a listing is unlikely before December or perhaps January.
Last year, Aramco delayed the IPO after more than two years of preparations as international investors balked at the $2 trillion valuation Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had put on the company.
This time Saudi Arabia opted for an easier route, deciding to start with a local listing only in Riyadh -- ditching plans for a sale in London or New York -- and enlisting local banks and wealthy families to support the IPO.
The Saudi government had seemed determined to press on with an accelerated schedule even in the face of potential headwinds that include weak oil prices, a slowing world economy and last month’s attack on the company’s biggest processing plant.
While details of the proposed offer haven’t been made public, people involved in the transaction said earlier this month that about 2% of Aramco might be sold, raising $40 billion and easily exceeding the $25 billion raised in 2014 by Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.
Ever since the Crown Prince first mooted the the IPO of the kingdom’s most prized assets in early 2016, Aramco’s valuation has been contentious. Many analysts have said that $2 trillion is too much compared with similar publicly traded companies.
Aramco may well be the world’s most valuable company, but based on the dividend yield received by investors in  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)., the largest U.S. oil company, its valuation would be closer to $1.5 trillion.
The Sept. 14 attack on its oil facilities disrupted output and sent shock waves through energy markets, triggering the biggest one-day jump in Brent crude prices on record and stoking security concerns. Investors are already demanding a premium to hold the country’s debt, downgraded this month by Fitch Ratings Ltd.
While advisers had been working on an intention to announce float for Oct. 20, executives hadn’t given a firm timeline in public. Aramco Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser said last month that the IPO would happen “very soon.”
The IPO promises to be a fees bonanza for the more than two dozen advisers working on the share sale, with Aramco set to pay them $350 million to $450 million, people familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The delay to the IPO’s launch was reported by the Financial Times earlier.

LONDON (Reuters) - Delivery delays to Boeing's (N:BA) 777X jetliner are holding back Emirates' growth and could partially affect the Gulf carrier's broader fleet requirements, airline President Tim Clark said on Thursday.
Dubai-based Emirates has 150 of the 350-400-seat model on order, of which eight were originally slated for delivery next year, and has yet to firm up orders for 40 of Boeing's mid-size 787 jets.
The world's largest operator of long-haul aircraft is also in talks to complete an order for 70 Airbus jets, with both sets of negotiations in focus ahead of the Dubai Airshow in November.
Boeing suspended load testing on its new 777X in September, when media reports said a cargo door failed a ground test. There have also been issues with its  General Electric  (N:GE) GE9X engine, the largest ever produced for an airliner.
The plane was originally due to enter service with Emirates in June 2020. In an interview, Clark said Emirates no longer expects to receive the first 777X before ""April or the second quarter"" of 2021.
""That has conditioned everything else,"" he told Reuters on the sidelines of the Airlines 2050 conference in London.
""First of all I want to know when the thing’s going to come,"" he said. ""Our fleet plans are very much driven by when these aircraft are going to be delivered to us.""
The airline's capacity growth is being held back by the delivery delays and will resume only ""when I get some visibility on all this"", Clark said.
A Boeing spokesman said the U.S. manufacturer was working through its ""disciplined development process"" to prepare the 777-9 for its first flight and delivery to launch customers.
In September, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said it was ""working towards entry into service (of the 777X) by the end of 2020,"" subject to the availability of engines.
There has been speculation that Emirates could defer or reduce 777X orders, or else downgrade some to the smaller 787.
Clark told the Seattle Times in June that Emirates was discussing a combination of 777Xs and 787s that may preserve overall numbers but substitute some jets and defer others.
INDUSTRY PROMISES
Planemakers already face pressure over late deliveries of smaller aircraft, with Boeing's 737 MAX grounded following two accidents and Airbus's A320neo hit by industrial delays. But the November air show is expected to test airlines' leverage in negotiations for some of the industry's biggest jets.
While Boeing tries to finalize its 787 deal, Airbus will be hoping to complete an order for 40 similar-sized A330neo and 30 A350 jets which Emirates tentatively ordered in February when Airbus decided to halt production of its flagship A380.
Asked about the status of new Airbus orders, Clark stressed the importance of keeping costly assets working reliably.
""You’ve probably heard me say in the industry, I want aircraft that will give me 99.9% dispatch reliability from day one. Until they can contract for that, we’re not going to take them.""
An Airbus spokeswoman said the A330 family has a dispatch reliability - or the proportion of departures without technical problems - of 99.4%, with the A350 already at 99.9%.
Clark said the aerospace industry had ""over-promised"" in recent years, placing jets in the market before they had the technical maturity to deal reliably with hot Gulf conditions.
""The engines in particular have got to be able to do that, and I’m not quite sure they are there yet.""
He also said Emirates would begin flying to Mexico City as planned on Dec. 9, despite a successful challenge by Delta Air Lines' (N:DAL) partner Aeromexico against a bilateral government pact underpinning the new route.
""This is Aeromexico and Delta making life difficult for us,"" Clark said. ""There will be a legal wrangling going on, but as far as I'm concerned, we're going to fly.""

Delta referred queries to Aeromexico which had no immediate comment.

(Reuters) - The chief executives of the three largest U.S. drug distributors and a drugmaker have been summoned to appear before a federal judge to discuss a proposal to resolve thousands of lawsuits alleging they fueled the U.S. opioid crisis, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
The order by U.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland, Ohio, came as distributors McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK),  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and Israel-based drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd moved to reach a deal ahead of a trial before Polster that begins on Monday.
Those companies, along with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), have been negotiating a settlement they value at roughly $50 billion that would allow them to resolve 2,600 lawsuits brought nationwide, mostly by states and localities, people familiar with the matter said.
All of those companies except J&J are set to be defendants in the trial before Polster, who oversees the bulk of the litigation. Polster has pushed for a deal that could ""do something meaningful to abate this crisis"".
The companies have been discussing the settlement with four state attorneys general whose cases are not before Polster, sources told Reuters on Wednesday. Lawyers for the local governments say they have not decided whether to back it.
Late Thursday, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost raised concerns about the proposed deal with his counterparts in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas, who are leading negotiations.
Yost, in a letter seen by Reuters, said he feared the four attorneys general were not consulting with other states. He said that threatened to repeat the problems of a proposed $10 billion settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP, which has divided states between supporters and opponents of the deal.
He also said opioid settlement funds must go to addressing the crisis, not general budget purposes. He worried attorneys for the local governments could be paid hundreds of millions of dollars for their work, and he wanted that reduced. 
Yost also said only a few states filed claims against the drug distributors and it would be unfair to treat all states the same in a settlement.
The letter was posted on the cleveland.com website and Reuters also received a copy.
Under the proposal, McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health would pay $18 billion over 18 years and J&J would pay $4 billion, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Teva has offered to give away medications it values at $15 billion as part of an overall deal it values at roughly $28 billion under which it would also provide distribution services, the people said.
Spokespeople for Cardinal CEO Michael Kaufmann and AmerisourceBergen CEO Steven Collis declined to say if they would be in Cleveland on Friday. Representatives for Teva CEO Kare Schultz and McKesson CEO Brian Tyler did not respond questions of whether they would be in court.
Opioids were responsible for roughly 400,000 overdose deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The lawsuits accuse drug manufacturers of deceptively marketing opioids in ways that downplayed their risks, and drug distributors of failing to detect and halt suspicious orders. They deny wrongdoing.

    The cases prompted OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP to file for bankruptcy protection in September after reaching a tentative deal it says is worth at least $10 billion to resolve the cases.

1613,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 08:14PM ET</span>",Goldman wants traders to be more like dealmakers and coders,"By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Over the past decade or so,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) has watched its annual trading profits fall 84%, as post-financial crisis regulations upended Wall Street. Now, bank executives are hoping they have figured out the key to a turnaround: asking traders to be more like investment bankers.
Over the past year, Chief Executive David Solomon and his leadership team have given the trading business a fresh mandate. They have replaced top trading executives, invested heavily in automation and turned Goldman's securities platform, called Marquee, into a product that can be sold to customers, according to interviews with six bank insiders.
Goldman plans to invest as much as $200 million in securities division technology over the next three years, a person familiar with the matter said. Much of that will go toward hiring people who know how to code.
Salespeople in the trading division, who used to primarily focus on hedge funds, are trying to make inroads with corporate treasurers, as well as portfolio managers at mutual-fund firms like Fidelity Investments and algorithmic trading houses like AQR or Two Sigma, one person said.
Trading staffers must often partner with Goldman Sachs dealmakers to forge those relationships. And, like bankers, they are now being judged by how many meetings they get and how much new business they can deliver with targeted clients, the same person said.
The changes bring a sales culture to the fore, but executives say it is not at the expense of the central risk trading approach that made Goldman traders famous.
""That core is the key to the investment-banker approach and technology investments resulting in success,"" another employee said. 
On Tuesday, Goldman reported a 6% rise in quarterly trading revenue, benefiting from market volatility, as well as  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) AG's decision to pull back from trading. But, year-to-date, the business is down 6%.
Goldman Sachs executives acknowledge that a turnaround could take years. However, they say that changes made over the past year are already making a difference, especially the efficiency savings from investments in tech.
""This quarter we saw some green shoots from the client-centric strategy we've put in place,"" Jim Esposito, global co-head for the securities division said in an interview. 
Most major global banks have seen their trading businesses turned upside down since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Since then, loss-stunned customers shifted product preferences and new regulations prohibited activities that had been extremely profitable or made them prohibitively expensive.
Even so, Goldman Sachs stands out among Wall Street banks because of how much its profits had been weighted in trading, and how little it changed its business model around the crisis.
Where U.S. banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) had big consumer and corporate lending operations, and even Goldman Sachs' closest rival,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) significantly altered its business mix through an acquisition, Goldman Sachs took years to announce meaningful changes to its strategy.
In recent years, the industry of making and managing clients' trades has consolidated around the top global banks. Goldman is one of those banks, but it will need to remain ""on the offensive,"" said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities.
""We don't see the revenue pie expanding dramatically in legacy businesses like equity trading and (fixed income, currencies and commodities) trading,"" said Ryan. ""There are opportunities. It's really in maintaining and gaining share as other firms retreat.""
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES
Goldman executives say these fundamental changes to the trading business will help the bank prosper over the long term.
In addition to new goals and performance metrics for trading staff, Goldman Sachs leadership has been meeting with major clients or prospective clients to find out what the bank could do better to win more business, according to two executives.
They are paying closer attention to ""broker votes"" that big investors submit to learn what improvements should be made to Goldman's technology, operations or customer service, executives said.
The bank has also been working to improve trading technology to lure quantitative investors.
Pricing for investment-grade credit below $2 million is now completely electronic, with plans to expand, said Adam Korn, global head of securities division ""strats"" and technology. Goldman used the term strats to refer to quantitative analysts.
""If you come back in a year or two, I suspect we will have automated the $2-$5 million segment of the investment grade,"" Korn said in an interview.
Additionally, Goldman has expanded functions of Marquee, which was once its internal trading system and opened it up to customers.
The bank is experimenting with giving clients access to proprietary data and risk analysis for a fee, possibly a monthly subscription. There are now 50,000 monthly active users of the service, Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr said during an earnings call on Tuesday.

""There is a great intensity and sense of urgency to measure and metric our progress with clients,"" Esposito said. ""Trading and sales are aligned neatly around this effort.""

1614,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 06:48PM ET</span>",Your Money: U.S. teachers take hands-on approach to financial literacy,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - There are a lot of hard truths about money, but here is one of the hardest: We are really bad at passing along money smarts.
As it stands, only 57% of American adults can be considered financially literate, according to a global survey by Standard & Poor’s. 
A new initiation from education fundraising website DonorsChoose.org and the  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Foundation is aiming to change that with a new hands-on approach. Rather than kids reading about starting a business, why not actually open a school store? Rather than reading about concepts like supply and demand, why not start making T-shirts, and see if they can sell them?
The “Innovation Challenge” prompts teachers to craft creative FinLit projects, helps them get funded, and then monitors which ones pay off.
“Experiential learning is so important, especially for lower-income families,” said Casey Cortese, managing director of Schwab’s community services, which is taking a new hands-on approach to teaching financial literacy. “If you make lessons tangible and real, it really cements learning.”
This year's overall winner of an online fan vote: Students of Rapunzel Galang in Lanham, Maryland, undertook virtual-reality field trips to different historical landmarks through time. They did that using VR headsets – but first they had to plan, budget, and pay for such trips, by researching about the places they wanted to visit.
Another innovative project: Xavier Lewis in Dayton, Texas, combined financial literacy with a “Mission to Mars” STEM project. Students earned money in their virtual bank accounts with attendance, class participation, and completing assignments. They could then spend that money to buy supplies to assemble rockets, rovers and hovercrafts for a simulated flight to Mars.
Other projects included creating a virtual-reality bank, filming a how-to video series on personal finance, using dinosaurs to pass along money lessons, and teaching the idea of “wants versus needs” via dramatic play.
KEEP IT GOING
While 92% of teachers say financial education is important, only 12% actually undertake it - because they just don’t have the resources, said Cortese.
To combat that with the Innovation Challenge, 15 of the top projects were developed into full lesson plans. Teachers across the country could then download them for free and use them in their own classes. The first 200 teachers who did so, and submitted a report on how it went, got a $250 credit to apply to future projects on the site.
The initiative has encouraged educators to think bigger and more creatively than just using a crowdfunding site like DonorsChoose to cover things like basic supplies. Since the Innovation Challenge first got started, “There has been a 66% increase in FinLit projects posted,” said Rianne Roberts, partnerships manager for the fundraising site.
Financial literacy is a long game, though. You can teach a third grader about money smarts today, but you will not know for years whether those habits have actually taken root. 
When the Schwab Foundation first started partnering with the site in 2017, 350 teachers participated in its financial literacy campaigns, reaching 36,000 students. In 2019, in comparison, they have already reached 1,600 teachers and 250,000 students.

So far this year, Schwab donated $375,000 to the Innovation Challenge, and $500,000 total to DonorsChoose. Of those teachers who used the resulting materials, 98% said they plan to keep teaching financial literacy in schools.

1615,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 06:12PM ET</span>",UAW will keep GM strike going while members vote on new contract,"By Paul Lienert and David Shepardson
DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union said on Thursday workers at General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) will stay off the job while they vote on a proposed contract that delivers higher pay for full-time workers and better terms for temporary workers, but allows the automaker to close three U.S. plants.
Union leaders are giving the 48,000 striking workers until Oct. 25 to vote on the contract terms, but have recommended ratification of the deal. 
The decision to keep the strike going for another week reflects the pressure on top UAW leaders amid a continuing federal corruption probe of the union. Disappointment among rank and file at the failure to prevent the plant shutdowns and block GM from moving work to Mexico could be challenges for union leaders as they seek to have the deal ratified.
In 2015, rank and file UAW workers at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV rejected the first version of a contract. This time, UAW leaders are keeping workers on strike pay of $275 a week while they decide on the tentative agreement.
""Our members will make this decision,"" UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg said at a press conference at the Detroit building where GM is based. ""It is their contract. It is in their hands.”
GM hopes the deal can be approved expeditiously. ""We encourage the UAW to move as quickly as possible through the ratification process, so we can resume operations and get back to producing vehicles for our customers,"" the company said in a statement. 
GM shares closed down 1.3% at $36.19 on Thursday, after a modest rally on Wednesday following the UAW's announcement it had reached a tentative contract deal.
On Wall Street, reaction to the proposed agreement, the highlights of which the union released, has been muted. ""We continue to believe that if this is ratified, it is a fairly solid outcome for GM,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a note Thursday. ""The financial implications of the deal don’t look too onerous."" 
The strike began on Sept. 16, with UAW negotiators seeking higher pay for workers, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits. Other issues included the fate of plants GM has indicated it may close, the use of lower-paid temporary workers and GM's production of vehicles in Mexico.
The strike cost GM an estimated $2 billion according to analysts, hurt auto suppliers and played a role in U.S. manufacturing output falling more than expected in September. 
The longest nationwide strike against a Detroit automaker since 1970 became a political event. Democratic presidential candidates joined UAW picket lines, eager to win union votes in Midwest swing states. For his part, U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on GM Chief Executive Mary Barra before the strike to preserve jobs at a car plant in Lordstown, Ohio, that she had targeted for closure. The White House did not comment.
However, under the deal, GM will move ahead with closing Lordstown and two parts plants in Baltimore and Warren, Michigan. Workers from Lordstown on Thursday were outside GM's Detroit headquarters, where UAW leaders were meeting, to protest the planned agreement.
GM also appears to have dodged a significant addition to its long-term balance sheet liabilities by agreeing to make a one-time cash distribution to UAW members eligible for pensions.
The union said GM has agreed to put ""new product"" in the company's Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant as part of the deal. Details were not provided in the UAW summary but sources have said the plant will build electric trucks.
Separate from the UAW deal, GM on Thursday confirmed plans for an electric battery plant near the Lordstown complex that could eventually employ 1,000 people. Sources have said the battery plant would be a joint venture, where the workers are represented by the UAW and earn in the range of $15 to $17 an hour. 
LORDSTOWN'S DISPLACED WORKERS
GM has said it plans to sell the Lordstown plant to a group affiliated with electric truck startup Workhorse Group Inc that would initially employ 400 people - barely a tenth of the workforce Lordstown had when it was operating on three shifts. A Workhorse spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.
A group of workers from the Lordstown plant stood outside the hotel ballroom where UAW leaders were meeting on Thursday, reading the UAW summary of the contract on smartphones. The Lordstown workers, some wearing red shirts with the slogan “Stop Building in Mexico,” said they were not satisfied with what they saw.
Scott Gearhart, who worked for 26 years at Lordstown, said he is now working at GM's Wentzville, Missouri, pickup truck assembly plant, living in an apartment and driving 10 hours to go home on days off. “I have my family at home. My mom’s by herself,” Gearhart said, explaining why he has not moved.
Tommy Woliko looked up from reading the contract summary on a smartphone. “I’m looking for something that says we’re not losing jobs to Mexico,” he said. “I see nothing.” Woliko worked for 11 years at Lordstown before moving to GM’s heavy duty pickup truck plant in Flint, Michigan.
“It’s a very good experience working there,” Woliko said. “But it’s not home.” 
GM also is moving ahead with plans to invest $9 billion in the United States over the life of the next UAW deal, sources said. It also would create or retain 9,000 UAW jobs, a substantial number of which would be new, a person familiar with the plans said. The UAW contract summary did not address these figures.
The UAW’s summary of the contract terms did not include details of which GM plants would be receiving shares of the $7.7 billion in direct investments the company has outlined. In 2015, the UAW listed plants that would be getting investment and jobs in its contract summary. UAW spokesman Rothenberg said some of the investments in the current deal were not included in the national agreement.
As part of the push to protect jobs, the UAW said it will jointly form a committee with GM that would meet at least quarterly to discuss the impact of technologies like electric and self-driving vehicles and their impact on UAW members. This group would address instances where work has shifted out of the union due to new manufacturing processes.
The UAW has expressed concern it could lose thousands of workers at engine and transmission plants operated by the Detroit Three automakers as the companies launch more electric vehicles in coming years.

If the deal is approved by the workers, the union will next begin negotiations with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co or Fiat Chrysler, covering many of the same issues. The UAW previously agreed to temporary contract extensions with both automakers while it focused on GM.

The SEC had alleged that Bobby Dwayne Montgomery prompted Osiris to book fake revenue and give false information to auditors. Montgomery agreed to a judgment that enjoins him from future violations of securities law, the SEC said in a statement.
""Our client is pleased to have resolved this matter on a no-admit no-deny basis, and looks forward to moving on with his life,"" said Stephen Crimmins, Montgomery's lawyer.
The biotech firm previously paid a $1.5 million penalty to settle charges of overstating company performance and issuing fraudulent financial statements for nearly two years, the regulator said.
The SEC said it last month dismissed charges against one of Osiris's former chief financial officers, Gregory I. Law. Litigation against two other executives is ongoing, the agency said.
""The SEC deserves credit for belatedly recognizing that Greg is innocent, but it doesn’t change the fact that he shouldn’t have been charged to begin with,"" said Aitan Goelman, counsel for Law."

1. Coca-Cola Earnings Due
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is set to report earnings before U.S. markets open Friday, with many investors eager for details on the beverage giant’s plans to launch Coca-Cola Energy in the U.S. amid a push to break into the energy drinks market.
Within months of making its debut in Europe, Coke Energy captured 2% of energy drinks market in July. Coke is hoping for more of the same as it takes its energy drink nationwide in the U.S.
Coca-Cola is expected to report earnings of 56 cents per share on revenue of $9.45 billion. The earnings would be down 2 cents from a year ago with revenue up 14.4%.
Shares were up 0.56% on Thursday and are up 13.6% for the year.
2. Rig Counts on Tap
Baker Hughes releases its weekly measure of drilling activity on Friday, at a time when domestic production continues to flirt with record highs and a downtick in refinery activity keeps supply trending higher.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. rose by 1 to 856.
Crude futures on Thursday settled 1.2% higher at $53.93 a barrel.
3. Fed Jawboning Continues
The last wave of speeches from Fed speakers is due on Friday ahead of the usual Fed blackout: the period during which members are prohibited from speaking on monetary policy before the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Oct. 30. 
 Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Esther George and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan speak at 10 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and Fed Vice President Richard Clarida are due at 10:30 AM ET.
During the Fed’s previous meeting in September, members were split on what the best course of monetary policy action is going forward.
Seven members voted for the Fed to cut rates to a range of 1.75% to 2.00% in the September meeting, while two members voted to keep rates steady. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard voted to cut rates by 50 basis points.
The odds of a rate cut at the end of the month stand at nearly 86%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor tool."
1619,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 04:55PM ET</span>","Renault Cuts Full-Year Forecast, Blaming Weakening Economies","(Bloomberg) --  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) slashed its outlook for revenue and profit this year as deteriorating economies weigh on auto demand and tougher regulatory standards increase costs.
The French carmaker sees 2019 revenue declining by 3% to 4%, after previously forecasting sales would be close to last year’s level, the company said in a statement after the market closed on Thursday. Group operating margin will be around 5%, below previous estimates for 6%.
The reduced guidance is mainly due to markets outside Europe, including Turkey and Argentina, and spending on research and development, interim Chief Executive Officer Clotilde Delbos said on a conference call. Furthermore, “it’s still difficult to pass on the full extra costs” of regulation to customers, she added.
Video Address
The warning comes after Bloomberg News reported that Delbos told employees that the company needs to re-evaluate the strategic road map put in place by former CEO Carlos Ghosn to reflect a change in the industry environment.
Renault confirmed the plan alongside the forecast cuts, saying the new management team is reassessing the “Drive the Future” mid-term targets unveiled in 2017.
“We need to make some choices,” Delbos said in a video address, highlighting Renault’s negative cash flow in the first six months of the year. “Unfortunately the situation hasn’t improved during the summer and we need to put Renault back on track,” she said.
Renault took a hit in the first half of 2019 from poor results at partner Nissan Motor Co. The French automaker owns 43% of the Japanese company, which is smarting from slumping U.S. sales and aging vehicle models.
European car sales declined 1.6% to 12.1 million in the nine months through September, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said this week. Spain led the decline with a 7.4% drop, with Germany the only major market to record a gain.
Renault’s third-quarter sales fell to 11.3 billion euros ($12.6 billion) from 11.5 billion euros the previous year, the company said. Cash flow should be positive in second half of the year, but may not be for the whole of 2019.
Reducing the sales and profit target “is an important move to clear the way for a turnaround under the interim CEO, a weak first-half performance and a deteriorating macroeconomic outlook,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Michael Dean said in a note.
The shares have gained 0.6% this year, valuing the company at 16 billion euros.

1620,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 04:54PM ET</span>","What Would Happen If President Trump Quit, Raymond James Asks","(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump hasn’t shown any sign of budging as he continues to fight the House impeachment inquiry and refuses to release his tax returns to Congress. But, what would happen if he did? In fact, what if he just up and quit?
As an intellectual exercise, that’s the question Raymond James analysts Chris Meekins and Ed Mills posed in a research report that tried to imagine what the aftermath of a resignation would look like.
“While we acknowledge this is a low probability event; the question we are hearing more often in D.C. is: What if President Trump decides to walk away from the presidency and voluntarily resigns prior to being impeached and/or having to release his tax returns,” Meekins and Mills wrote.
The Raymond James analysts speculate that Trump could quit the presidency before impeachment and before he’s forced to release his tax documents. The president wouldn’t want to go down in history “as one of the only impeached presidents.”
“Trump can go make even more money and maybe start his own media network, which reportedly was the initial plan,” Meekins and Mills wrote.
After a resignation, the analysts see a President Mike Pence making Nikki Haley, the former United Nations ambassador, his vice president and campaigning at the top of the ticket in the 2020 presidential race.
After an initial shock, with Pence campaigning as a “predictable, traditional, conservative choice,” the market would rally -- most notably companies related to China trade, pharmaceuticals and defense contractors.
Meekins and Mills stress that Trump leaving voluntarily is remote, seeing him instead as “the rare individual who declares victory in defeat.”
“There is a sense that he is still seeking validation through winning re-election and he strongly believes he has been treated incredibly unfairly by Congressional Democrats and the press,” they said. “He is strong in his belief that he did nothing wrong and resigning early would only validate that criticism.“"

Brazilian equity funds have seen a net inflow of 47.7 billion reais ($11.5 billion) this year through September, which would be the highest total for any year since Brazil’s capital markets association began tracking the data in 2006. That’s happened even as foreign investors pulled cash out of the market.
“Lower rates are leading to growing inflows to equity funds, but this move is just getting started,” said Marcos Peixoto, the co-head of equities at Sao Paulo-based XP Asset Management, who helps oversee about 6 billion reais. “It’s a trend that will last for years.”
The benchmark Ibovespa equity index has gained 20% since the beginning of the year as the Brazilian government moved forward with an overhaul of the country’s social security system -- a key item in President Jair Bolsonaro’s effort to put finances on a more sustainable footing. As tame inflation allows the central bank to cut interest rates, Brazilians are taking their money from government bonds and low-yielding savings accounts to invest with hedge funds and equity funds.
The enthusiasm for equities isn’t universal. Unlike locals, foreign investors have pulled about 4.1 billion reais out of Brazil stocks this year taking into account both primary and secondary markets, according to data from Brazil’s stock exchange. Excluding inflows from equity offerings, the outflow jumps to 30 billion reais -- with a 9.9 billion-real withdrawal in the first two weeks of October.
Foreigners “haven’t yet re-risked their Brazil exposure,” said Morgan Harting, a portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein in New York. “That’s a combination of global portfolios just being more defensively positioned and some skepticism about how much more room to run there is in Brazil, particularly since the headline GDP growth rate still seems pretty sluggish.”
Economic activity indicators have produced mostly negative surprises this year. Analysts on average now see gross domestic product expanding just 0.9% in 2019, down from a forecast of 2.5% at the start of the year.
“I’m very optimistic on the foundation being laid for future growth,” said Will Pruett, a money manager at Fidelity who is overweight Brazil stocks within Latin America and manages $542 million. “For others in the market, it may take more tangible evidence, such as a GDP pick up.”"

The company in 2014 discriminated against more than 2,300 candidates to be online customer service representatives and phone bankers in three U.S. cities, the Labor Department said in a statement Thursday. Wells Fargo must pay about $600,000 in back wages, benefits and interest to individuals, and offer jobs to original applicants as they open up.
The agency’s statement didn’t detail the hiring issues, and the bank didn’t admit liability. Wells Fargo agreed to revise its selection process and train hiring managers to eliminate the discriminatory practices.
“While Wells Fargo strongly disputes the allegations, we believe that putting this matter behind us is in the best interest of all of our stakeholders,” Wells Fargo spokesman Peter Gilchrist said in a statement. He said the settlement relates to practices in place five years ago that the firm has since changed. “Wells Fargo values and promotes diversity and inclusion in every aspect of our business.’’
Wells Fargo last month selected a new chief executive officer as part of its efforts to move past years of scandals that have eroded its brand and heaped on legal costs. Charlie Scharf starts in the top job on Monday.

The S&P 500 moved up 0.28%, finishing at just under 2,998 and about one percentage point below its all-time high reached in July. It reached as high as 3,008 during the day.
The Dow Jones industrials finished up 0.09%, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.4%. The Russell 2000 index was up 1.1%. 
 
The Brexit deal negotiated by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson resolved many issues about about the Northern Ireland-Ireland border, but it's not clear if Johnson will have the votes to approve the deal in parliament Saturday.
Stocks got a lift after Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to a five-day ceasefire in his attacks on Kurdish strongholds in northern Syria. The agreement came after four hours of negotiations with Vice President Mike Pence. 
The rally was also boosted by a third-quarter earnings season that continues to be decent. Healthcare, real estate, communications services and industrial stocks led the market higher. Gains for such stocks as Honeywell International (NYSE:HON),   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS),   United Rentals   (NYSE:URI) and Humana (NYSE:HUM) offset slumps in   IBM   (NYSE:IBM) and Boeing (NYSE:BA).
IBM's third-quarter results late Wednesday disappointed investors and Big Blue's shares dropped 5.5%, trimming its gain for the year to 18.1%.
Boeing fell 0.9% in part because Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) said it doesn't expect to have Boeing 737 Max airliners in its schedule until Feb. 8.   Air Canada   (TSX:AC) said it doesn't see flying the plane again until Feb. 14. The 737 Max has been grounded since two crashes in 2018 and early 2019 killed 346 people. 
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), meanwhile, rose 2.4% after its third-quarter report suggested the company is confident it can weather new streaming video from a host of competitors. 
 
 
 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), up 0.4%, overtook Microsoft as the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of $1.063 trillion. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), down 0.6%, saw its market cap drop to $1.058 trillion.
The rally lost some steam in the last hour of trading when The Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil giant, was delaying the launch of its long-expected initial public offering again until December or January. That kept the indexes in check.
All three indexes are still looking at sizable gains for the year. The problem is that the market's been stalled since this summer.
The S&P ended the day 1% below its July peak. The Dow is off 1.36% from its mid-summer peak. The Nasdaq is off 2,2% from its peak. 
Oil futures had risen before the Saudi Aramco news, but were falling in after-hours trading. West Texas Intermediate crude settled up 57 cents to $53.93 a barrel. Brent crude, the global benchmark, added 49 cents to $59.91. 
Gold futures rose $4.30 to $1,498.30 an ounce in New York.
Packaging company Dover (NYSE:DOV),  United Rentals  (NYSE:URI) and drug distributors   Cardinal Health   (NYSE:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) were among the top S&P 500 performers. 
Defense contractor Textron (NYSE:TXT),  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), M&T Bank Corp (NYSE:MTB) and oil-and-gas producer   Noble Energy   (NYSE:NBL) were among the worst S&P 500 performers on the day.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fast-food chicken chain Chick-fil-A is turning the tables on in-house dining, unveiling a new sit-down table service through its app that means customers will not have to wait at the counter to order.
On Thursday, the privately owned restaurant operator announced ""dine-in mobile ordering,"" when guests in or on their way to a store can order through the Chick-fil-A app on their mobile phones.
After finding a seat, guests tap their phones to their corresponding table numbers and an employee will bring the meal to the table.
Most big restaurant operators are trying out new technology - at drive-thrus, counters, kitchens and delivery services - to speed food orders.
In September, McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) acquired Apprente, a voice-technology startup focused initially on drive-thru ordering, with plans to look later at using new voice technology for mobile ordering or kiosks.
In tests that began last year at 80 Chick-fil-A stores in five local markets, large parties and families with children in particular said they liked the dine-in mobile service.
""This technology will be particularly helpful for busy parents who can now head straight into the restaurant and have their meal brought to their table at their convenience, without waiting in line,"" said Khalilah Cooper, Chick-fil-A director of service and hospitality, in a statement."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street advanced on Thursday as investor sentiment was buoyed by a string of corporate earnings beats and encouraging geopolitical developments.
A broad-based rally led all three major U.S. stock averages to moderate gains.
Britain and the European Union agreed to a severance deal, moving closer toward wrapping up three years of uncertainties after Britons voted to leave the bloc.
Upbeat statements from Beijing and Washington fueled hopes that a phased agreement could ease the long-running U.S.-China trade war that has rattled markets for months. 
And Turkey agreed to pause its Syria assault to allow for the withdrawal of Kurdish forces.
""The Turkish cease fire is viewed positively,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. ""Good news for Trump is good news for the market.""
""From an investment perspective, the market likes the Trump agenda,"" Massocca added. 
Analysts now see third-quarter S&P 500 earnings falling by 2.9%, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S, marking the first contraction since the earnings recession that ended mid-2016.
But of the 63 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported so far, 82.5% have come in above estimates.

In other earnings news, shares of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp were the biggest drag on the blue-chip Dow, sinking 5.5% after missing quarterly revenue estimates.
Honeywell International Inc's (N:HON) quarterly results fell short of analyst expectations, but positive geopolitical developments helped the international conglomerate gain 2.4%.
On the economic front, a spate of underwhelming data supported the notion that the longest period of expansion is U.S. history could be running out of steam. Housing starts, industrial production and mid-Atlantic factory output all fell short of economist expectations.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.90-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

1626,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 04:16PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Wall Street banks see green light from Fed on reserves - sources,"By Matt Scuffham and Pete Schroeder
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wall Street banks believe they are getting a green light from supervisors to hold more Treasury debt and less cash after last month's volatility in overnight lending markets, three industry sources told Reuters.
That change could help boost liquidity in the overnight lending markets, because Treasury bonds are a common type of collateral pledged by companies and investors in exchange for cash.
Banks have complained for years that the U.S. Federal Reserve can be painfully prudent with its view that Treasury bonds are not the same as ordinary dollars when used as a liquidity buffer.
In recent weeks, they have intensified efforts to get Fed officials and examiners to soften their stance, and initial signs suggest the industry may finally be getting a warmer reception.
In private conversations with senior bankers, supervisors have attempted to make banks more comfortable with using excess reserves to lend in repo markets rather than hold onto more cash, sources familiar with the discussions said.
The Fed declined to comment on conversations with regulated entities.
Banks hold regular meetings with Fed supervisors, who provide broad guidance on how to interpret regulations but do not offer formal instructions, people familiar with the matter say. Rather than be prescriptive about how to manage reserves, supervisors identify shortcomings and provide general feedback on capital plans put forward by the institutions.
Bankers previously came out of that process understanding that the Fed preferred them to hold cash rather than Treasury bonds in times of stress, industry sources said. A struggling bank looking to offload large volumes of Treasury bonds may need to do so at a deep discount, which is a worry for regulators.
""Banks have been to some extent instructed by their supervisors, at least through the years, that there is a preference or even a requirement … that the banks hold high levels of excess reserves,"" said Bill Nelson, a former senior Fed official who is now chief economist for the Bank Policy Institute, which lobbies for larger banks.
REPO MARKET UPHEAVAL
The tone taken by bank supervisors in private interactions with bank staff changed after chaos in the overnight lending market, known as ""repo,"" in September, one bank source said.
Rates for those loans suddenly spiked to 10% and the Fed had to step in to provide liquidity for the first time since the global financial crisis. The smooth functioning of those markets is critical to the financial system, providing banks with the short-term funding they need to trade and lend.
The Fed's approach to regulation and supervision has relaxed since U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Randal Quarles as head of banking supervision two years ago. Quarles said the Fed was rethinking its position on reserves at a May 2018 conference, but bank sources said they did not experience any change in approach until recently.
U.S. lenders with more than $250 billion in assets are currently required to hold a large pool of high-quality, easily tradable assets that can cover cash outflows during times of extreme stress.
Banks can park those excess reserves at the Fed, either in idle cash or by buying Treasury bonds. Both are regarded as ""high-quality, liquid assets"" in formal regulatory requirements. However, many banks believed the Fed preferred cash over Treasuries, based on private supervisory feedback they received.
Some bankers, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, say that prevents them from easing stress in repo markets.
This month, Reuters reported that changes to JPMorgan's $2.7 trillion balance sheet, which saw the bank reduce the cash it had on deposit at the Fed by 57% through June, were a factor in the repo spike.
Speaking to reporters after JPMorgan reported third-quarter results on Tuesday, Dimon said he would have happily provided more overnight loans when rates spiked because it would have generated better profits than leaving cash at the Fed. But, in his view, regulatory constraints prevented JPMorgan from doing so.
""We have $125 billion in that checking account today. I would be happy to move all of it into repo, but we can't because of regulations,"" he said."

Previously installed Takata inflators will be replaced by those produced by other suppliers ahead of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's schedule, the company said.
At least 24 deaths worldwide have been linked to the rupturing of faulty Takata air bag inflators, including 16 in the United States.

(Reuters) - E-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc said on Thursday it will completely halt U.S. sales of all flavors except tobacco, mint and menthol, as the company faces heightened scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers and state attorneys general over the appeal of its nicotine products to teenagers.
Thursday's move, which ends online sales, means Juul's mango, fruit, creme and cucumber nicotine pod flavors will no longer be available for sale anywhere in the United States. The company last year pulled those flavors from retail stores but continued to sell them on its website with what the company said were ""strict age-verification controls.""
Juul's new chief executive, K.C. Crosthwaite, a veteran of Marlboro maker  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc, announced the move Thursday as the company attempts to repair its relationship with regulators.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month warned Juul that it was misleading consumers by marketing its products as safer than cigarettes, and requested additional information on its nicotine blend. Soon after, the Trump administration announced plans to ban all flavored e-cigarette products, citing alarming growth in teenage use of the products.
Soon after, Juul's former CEO, Kevin Burns, stepped down.
Crosthwaite said in a statement Thursday that the company needs to ""reset the vapor category"" by ""earning the trust of society,"" working ""cooperatively"" with regulators and policymakers.
He previously said the company would suspend all advertising in the United States, stop its support of a San Francisco ballot measure that would overturn an e-cigarette ban and refrain from lobbying the Trump administration on the proposed flavor ban.
Juul will continue to sell mint, menthol and tobacco flavors online and in stores, though a spokesman said Thursday ""we continue to review our policies and practices"" in advance of the FDA's proposed flavor ban and ""have not made any final decisions."" The company will ""fully support and comply with the final policy when effective.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) said on Thursday it was postponing the return of Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX jets to its flight schedule until Feb. 8, the latest delay for the plane involved in two fatal crashes with other carriers over five months.
The airline had previously planned to keep the jet off its flight schedule through Jan. 5. United Airlines (O:AAL) and American Airlines (O:AAL) have canceled flights involving the 737 MAX until January.
""With the timing of the MAX's return-to-service still uncertain, we are extending the MAX-related flight schedule adjustments through Feb. 8, 2020,"" Southwest said in an update on its website https://www.southwest.com/html/air/737-MAX-8.html?clk=737MAX8_190408. ""The revision will proactively remove roughly 175 weekday flights from our schedule out of our total peak-day schedule of more than 4,000 daily flights.""
On Wednesday, Air Canada (T:AC) said it had removed its 24 737 MAX planes from flight schedules until Feb. 14.
Boeing said Thursday it had no change in its aim to ""return to service in the fourth quarter."" But the plane maker will not hold a certification test flight for the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) until early November. If that test flight results in U.S. certification, then European regulators will weigh in, and pilots at airlines must be trained to use the improved system.
This week, Southwest's pilots union forecast that the grounded jet would return to the skies around February, weeks later than Boeing has projected. No major North American airlines have scheduled commercial flights of the 737 MAX in the fourth quarter.
Southwest is the largest operator of the MAX with 34 jetliners in its fleet. The aircraft was grounded worldwide following a Lion Air crash in Indonesia on Oct. 29, 2018, and an Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10 that together killed 346 people.
The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA), the union for the airline's pilots, said flights would likely resume in ""probably a February time frame.""
Last week, the Southwest pilots' union sued Boeing, alleging the planemaker “deliberately misled” the airline and pilots about the 737 MAX. The plane's grounding in March forced more than 30,000 Southwest Airlines flight cancellations and caused over $100 million in lost wages for pilots, the union said.
Boeing said last week it believes the lawsuit ""is meritless and will vigorously defend against it.""
The union noted that following the certification test flight, the European Joint Aviation Authorities Joint Operational Evaluation Board has to submit recommendations to the FAA's Flight Standards Board.
Airlines will then submit proposed changes to the FAA Certificate Management Office and pilots must complete training.
Boeing is under pressure to deliver updated software and training to regulators for the aircraft to fly again, and the company has been negotiating compensation with customers like Southwest over the financial hit from the grounding.

Southwest, with around 10,000 pilots represented by SWAPA, had 41 more MAX jets on order for this year alone.

LONDON/PARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several U.S. boutique investment banks are looking to hire senior staff in Paris in the wake of Britain's departure from the EU and have poached bankers from France's most established advisory firms, including Lazard, sources told Reuters.
New York-based Evercore Inc has tapped headhunting firm Charta Partners to hire French bankers with long-standing relationships with the country's key companies, sources said, as it prepares to open an office in Paris.
Evercore competes head-to-head with U.S. independent advisory firms Centerview, Greenhill, Perella Weinberg and Moelis, who are all also looking to hire in France.
The push comes as Britain is finalising its planned departure from the EU, prompting large investment banks and independent advisory outfits to bulk up their presence across Europe to maintain access to continental clients. 
Paris offers an attractive European hub for international banks which are trying to spread their bets away from London and Frankfurt. 
But France's ranking in European deal-making has dropped since a record 2017 when it was Europe's fourth biggest M&A market with $105 billion worth of deals, according to Refinitiv data.
In 2018 it was overtaken by Italy, falling to seventh place in European league tables after closing just $54 billion worth of deals, the data shows. 
In the first three quarters of this year, it generated less than $40 billion worth of deals, none of which were transformational transactions following the aborted merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and  Renault  (PA:RENA) in May.
Yet international banks remain confident that the market will pick up again, betting on the ambitions of large French companies to boost their global presence through sizable M&A deals.
""It's a good time to be a French banker. In fact, seasoned French bankers are in high demand right now,"" said a London-based headhunter, adding the U.S. boutiques had aggressive hiring plans.
A Paris-based investment banker who recently left a bulge-bracket bank told Reuters he had received four different proposals to join U.S. boutiques.
""Paris is a one-stop shop,"" said a French government official who previously worked as a banker. ""Banks, insurers, large conglomerates and industry bodies are all close to each other.""
Greenhill in September hired Amelie Negrier-Oyarzabal, a former partner at Lazard for 16 years, to lead its efforts to open a French hub.
Two other Lazard bankers - Nicolas Constant and Pierre Pasqual - left the firm in early October to join an undisclosed U.S. boutique, sources told Reuters.
Constant was a seasoned Lazard managing director who spent 14 years at the firm, focusing primarily on private equity, while Pasqual was a director who joined in 2012 from  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
Their departure has triggered rumours that Lazard's French boss Matthieu Pigasse could also leave the firm, sources told Reuters, after he recently held talks with several boutiques including Evercore.
Lazard denied that Pigasse is leaving the firm but confirmed that Constant and Pasqual had resigned. 
Evercore and the other banks declined to comment.
POACHING PIGASSE
Pigasse played a key role in winning a high-profile mandate for Lazard for the upcoming initial public offering (IPO) of Saudi Aramco, pushing out Evercore who had been previously retained by the oil giant in 2017.
Pigasse went to Riyadh over the summer when the Aramco pitches took place, a source with knowledge of the matter said, and also worked on the Saudi company's first international bond issue earlier this year.
Lazard's Aramco win gave Pigasse prestige outside France, making him a top candidate for U.S. rivals.
Earlier this year the 51-year old banker held talks with Mediobanca over a possible move to the Italian investment bank, led by Chief Executive Alberto Nagel, two sources with direct knowledge of the talks told Reuters.
Mediobanca was not immediately available for comment.
Milan-based Mediobanca has also been seeking to win market share in France and Pigasse contacted the Italian firm in March while it was in the process of buying a 66% stake in French advisory boutique Messier Maris & Associés, a deal announced in April, the sources said.
Pigasse did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Other newcomers in France include Perella Weinberg, the investment bank founded by Joe Perella and Peter Weinberg, which opened an office in Paris in 2018, luring French bankers from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
Perella was recently appointed by French engineering and digital services firm Altran as its sell-side adviser during takeover discussions with business consultancy firm Capgemini, several sources said.
Centerview is also among those on the lookout for French rainmakers, a source familiar with its strategy said, and would only launch a Paris office once a senior dealmaker was available.

Moelis has opened an office on Paris' Champs-Élysées and it has advised international clients looking to buy French assets.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's Ferretti plans to bring on board a European private investor after abandoning a planned stock market flotation, the yachtmaker's chief executive said on Thursday.
Ferretti said it had decided to call off its initial public offering on the Milan stock exchange because it could not get the right pricing, confirming what a source had earlier told Reuters.
""You'll see, in 2020 a new investor will come on board,"" Ferretti CEO Alberto Galassi told Reuters by telephone, adding the private investor could take a stake of around 30% and talks had been going on with them for some time.
Later on Thursday Italian professional audio equipment maker RCF said it too had put its plans to list in Milan on hold, citing adverse conditions on primary markets at home and abroad.
It has been a challenging year for European IPOs, with investor sentiment battered by expectations of an economic slowdown as Brexit and the U.S.-China trade war take their toll.
Recent failed attempts include Kazakh fintech Kaspi.kz's planned float in London, Germany's Domicil Real Estate AG and KKR's pulling of Latitude in Australia.
Galassi said that while the IPO book was covered, meaning there were sufficient investors to buy all the shares on offer, they would not pay a price reflecting Ferretti's value.
U.S. investors were very few, he said, with the ongoing trade tariff dispute between Washington and Beijing not helping the listing of a company whose main shareholder is Chinese.
Ferretti, which used to trade on the Milan market before it was delisted in 2003, is 86% owned by Weichai Holding Group."

The settlement resolves a multistate investigation that found J&J violated consumer protection laws by misrepresenting the safety and effectiveness of its devices and failing to sufficiently disclose risks associated with their use, the attorneys general said.
Thousands of women have sued the company and its Ethicon unit alleging that they were injured by its pelvic mesh devices, which are used to treat bladder issues and pelvic organ prolapse, in which organs shift from their normal positions.
The settlement resolves claims with 41 states and the District of Columbia. 
The deal does not cover lawsuits over J&J's mesh marketing by four states, California, West Virginia, Kentucky and Mississippi, which remain pending. 
A trial in California's case concluded in September, though a decision has not yet been issued. The state of Washington settled a similar case in April for $9.9 million.
J&J in a statement on Thursday said the settlement contains no admission of liability or misconduct on the part of Ethicon.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered makers of all implants to immediately stop their sale and distribution amid claims that they caused pain, perforations, urinary problems, bleeding and other serious injuries.
J&J in 2012 stopped selling mesh implants for pelvic organ prolapse, though it continues to market devices for use in treating incontinence.
J&J shares have been under pressure this year, widely underperforming the S&P healthcare sector, as the company faces tens of thousands of lawsuits alleging deceptive marketing and harm from side effects caused by its products, including baby powder, opioid drugs and medical devices.
On Wednesday, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters the company would pay $4 billion in cash to resolve lawsuits seeking to hold it responsible for partly fueling the U.S. opioid crisis.

Last week, a jury hit J&J with $8 billion in punitive damages for a case involving its anti-psychotic drug Risperdal, highlighting the risks an all-or-nothing legal strategy could have.

1636,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 01:22PM ET</span>",StockBeat: Boston Beer Surges as Cowen Serves up Frothier Outlook,"Investing.com – Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) surged on Thursday after Cowen upgraded its outlook on the beverage company, citing the explosive growth of its seltzer brand.
Cowen analyst Vivien Azer upgraded Boston Beer to outperform from market perform and raised her price target from $386 to $450, sending shares of Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) up more than 4.5%. The high on the day was $403.47.
With beer consumption in the U.S. on the way down, Boston Beer turned to an alcohol-infused seltzer in 2016, launching Truly Spiked & Sparkling and hasn't looked back.
The Truly brand has seen explosive growth – in a market that has enticed beer, wine and vodka drinkers to make the switch to seltzer – helping the company offset softness in beer and cider sales.
According to Nielsen data, hard-seltzer sales grew roughly 200% over the past year.
The strong level of demand for hard seltzer won’t last forever, but that doesn't necessarily mean the end of the road for Boston’s Truly, with new flavours expected to launch next year.
“With Truly continuing to drive outsized growth for SAM, and with new formulations and a lemonade line extension slated for next year, we believe Truly will continue to transform SAM’s growth algorithm, and offset continued softness in beer and cider,” Cowen said.
Boston Beer is up 67% so far this year and 136% since the end of 2016. It's off 8.8% from its intraday peak of $444.64 reached on Aug. 27. It has an average price target of $376, according to consensus estimates of Investing.com"
1637,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 01:21PM ET</span>","A sham Qatar deal could have cost ex Barclays exec $64 million, court hears","By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - A former top  Barclays  (L:BARC) executive, on trial in London on fraud charges, would have risked a 50 million pound ($64 million) ""good leaver"" package if he had sought a criminal deal with Qatar during the credit crisis, a court heard on Thursday.
It would have been ""lunacy"" for Roger Jenkins, one of three men charged with fraud over undisclosed payments to Qatar during emergency fundraisings in 2008, to risk such accrued benefits and a job that had paid him 38 million pounds in 2007 alone, his lawyer told a jury at the Old Bailey criminal court.
The high-profile Serious Fraud Office (SFO) case revolves around how Barclays -- one of the few major British banks to survive the credit crisis without direct government aid -- raised more than 11 billion pounds ($14 billion) from Qatar and other investors to avert a state bailout as markets roiled.
Prosecutors allege that former top executives lied to the market and other investors by not properly disclosing 322 million pounds paid to Qatar, disguised as ""bogus"" advisory services agreements (ASAs), in return for around four billion pounds in two fundraisings over 2008.
Jenkins, the former head of the bank's Middle East business, Tom Kalaris, who ran the wealth division and Richard Boath, a former head of European financial institutions, deny charges of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation and fraud by false representation.
Lawyers for Jenkins and Kalaris told the jury the case against their clients was misconceived, perverse and illogical and that there was no evidence the ASAs were a sham or fake.
In brief opening speeches before the prosecution continues laying out its case, they alleged the defendants believed the ASAs were genuine agreements to secure lucrative business for Barclays in the Middle East -- a region it was keen to exploit.
They said the agreements were side deals during emergency fundraising that June and October that had been approved by internal and external lawyers and cleared by the board.
""The unequivocal, repeated advice was that this was legitimate - providing the ASA was a genuine contract for the provision of benefits to Barclays,"" said John Kelsey-Fry, a senior lawyer representing Jenkins.
Jenkins, who will give evidence later, had pursued and won the trust of Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, the former prime minister of Qatar, and wanted to unseat  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) as the wealthy, gas-rich Gulf state's preferred bankers, the jury heard.
Had Jenkins considered a fraudulent deal with Sheikh Hamad, the sheikh might have rung up Barclays bosses and said: ""Neither I nor QIA (the sovereign wealth fund) are putting a penny in a bank like yours. I will never do business with you again,"" Kelsey-Fry said.
Qatar Holding, part of QIA, invested in Barclays alongside Challenger, Sheikh Hamad's investment vehicle.
The case against Kalaris, meanwhile, hung on three conversations he had with Boath on the afternoon of June 11, 2008, that the prosecution had ""fundamentally misunderstood"", his lawyer Ian Winter said.
When Kalaris told Boath: ""Noone wants to go to jail here"" and that lawyers would provide ""air cover"", he was trying to ensure that a genuine ASA would be approved by legal experts as a legitimate means of paying Qatar for real value, Winter said.
All three men, aged between 60 and 64, are charged over the June fundraising. Jenkins, alone, also faces charges over the October fundraising.
The trial is scheduled to last around five months."

1640,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 12:58PM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley executives offer cautious outlook after profit beat,"By Anirban Sen and Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
(Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) reported a higher-than-expected profit on Thursday, bolstered by strength in bond trading and M&A advisory, but executives were careful not to sound too optimistic about the rest of the year.
Like other big banks, Morgan Stanley had to navigate falling interest rates, volatile markets and recession signals during the third quarter, and fared relatively well. Its overall profit rose 3%, topping Wall Street expectations by a healthy margin.
However, the factors that created such a difficult operating environment during the quarter have not gone away, Chief Executive James Gorman and Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said on a call to discuss earnings.
They suggested the trade dispute between the United States and China, further central bank easing, an unknown Brexit outcome and other geopolitical tensions could pressure results further. Although Gorman said the fourth quarter was ""off to a good start,"" that could change.
""We remain cautious today as trade talks swirl and interest rates continue to be debated,"" Gorman said.
Although Pruzan said CEO confidence has remained high, it is unclear whether companies that are planning initial public offerings will proceed. Morgan Stanley led some of this year's biggest IPOs, but signs of a possible downturn have slowed activity.
""Conversion from pipeline to realized remains highly dependent on market conditions,"" he said.
During the quarter, Morgan Stanley swallowed heavy losses from stakes in companies that went public. Investment revenue plummeted to $33 million from $340 million.
Nonetheless, Morgan Stanley shares were up 2.7% in afternoon trading, with analysts celebrating the results. The bank beat KBW's revenue forecasts in each business line, analyst Brian Kleinhanzl wrote in a note to clients.
Overall, Morgan Stanley's profit rose to $2.2 billion, or $1.27 per share, from $2.1 billion, or $1.17 per share in the year-ago quarter. Net revenue inched up to $10 billion from $9.9 billion.
Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.11 per share on revenue of $9.6 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The sixth-largest U.S. bank capped three days of results from Wall Street heavyweights. JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) also topped expectations, while  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) disappointed.
Sales and trading revenue rose 10% to $3.5 billion. Gains came from a 21% jump in bond trading as equities trading fell slightly compared to a year ago. Morgan Stanley typically ranks No. 1 in equities trading, but after years of market-share gains it has been facing tougher competition lately.
Its investment banking business, which includes advising on deals and helping corporations raise money, posted a 5% rise in revenue to $1.5 billion.
Wealth management's $4.4 billion in revenue was down 1% from a year ago. That business has been a stabilizing force for Morgan Stanley during volatile times.
The business is trying to add new clients in Asia and lend to them more, Gorman said. Morgan Stanley's loan book grew 8% rise in the third quarter, but net interest income stayed flat due to declining rates.
In investment management, its smallest business, Morgan Stanley reported a 17% rise in revenue, to $764 million.
Gorman complimented Morgan Stanley's trading and investment banking businesses for being resilient in a shaky quarter, and said management is focused on keeping the bank stable and prosperous over the long term.
""There remains tremendous upside here,"" he said."

1643,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 12:26PM ET</span>",Brexit may spur more deals in legacy general insurance policies,"By Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's impending departure from the European Union is creating expansion opportunities for specialist general insurers who buy up and manage policies closed to new customers.
Whether Britain leaves the European Union without a deal or under a so-called hard Brexit, British insurers selling policies into the EU will need a local subsidiary, and vice versa.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday that Britain and the EU had agreed a new Brexit deal, but he still faces resistance from other parties in parliament.
If a Brexit deal is finally agreed it will give insurers more time to set up EU subsidiaries, but domestic-focused and smaller firms are reluctant to do this because of the cost.
Another option for those insurers is to end their overseas operations and sell books of legacy business to a specialist insurer.
European insurer Darag - which specializes in buying closed books - has set up in Britain this year, and expects Brexit-related deals. The firm, which now has seven UK employees, has already had enquiries, its chief executive Tom Booth told Reuters.
Chris Fagan, CEO of insurer Catalina, another closed-book specialist, also told Reuters that Brexit could have a positive impact for his firm.
""Brexit is causing EU insurers to look at their structures and this brings non-core lines into focus, leading to opportunities for the acquirers,"" said Andrew Ward, a director for insurance deals at PwC.
Fortitude Re, a vehicle set up by U.S. insurance group AIG (N:AIG) with investment from private equity firm Carlyle to house AIG's closed books, is also planning to buy or reinsure other closed books and expand into Europe, four sources told Reuters. AIG declined to comment.
There are nearly $800 billion in closed books of non-life insurance globally, including $300 billion in Europe, according to PwC. Around $9 billion changed hands across 34 publicly announced deals globally in 2018, the consultants said in its first annual deals report.
Closed book specialists take over old policies or reinsure them, reducing risk for the insurers.
The specialists say they can use economies of scale to manage them more efficiently. Some also invest more of the policies in alternative asset classes to increase returns.
""There is a reasonable margin to be made in this area of insurance,"" Stephen Roberts, chairman of the Insurance & Reinsurance Legacy Association, said.
Outside the life insurance sector, insurers are usually keenest to offload books of business where claims may still be have to be paid years after an event.
The sector started off with asbestos-related business, but books of business sold these days include motor, medical malpractice and also employers' liability, taken out by companies to cover compensation for work-related accidents or illness.
Zurich Insurance (S:ZURN), for example, transferred UK employers' liability policies totaling $2 billion to specialist insurer Catalina in Dec 2018.
Lloyd's of London's decision last year to tell its members to ditch the worst-performing 10% of their business has led to a number of closed book deals, including in poorly-performing insurance classes such as marine.
They include specialist insurer Riverstone's takeover of policies from Lloyd's syndicate Advent Underwriting in January 2019.
The market for closed life insurance books is also a large one in Europe, with deals such as Italian insurer Generali's (MI:GASI) sale of some of its German closed life business to private equity firm Viridium last year.
Life insurance is less likely to be impacted by Brexit, industry sources say, as the business is often more domestic, and larger life insurers have generally set up the relevant EU or UK subsidiaries.
But for overseas insurers with small UK life insurance business, Brexit could be a catalyst that ""may cause people to look again"" at their business, Simon True, group corporate development director at closed life insurance specialist Phoenix (L:PHNX), said."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Lawyers representing families of passengers killed in a Boeing 737 MAX crash in Ethiopia in March are set to issue subpoenas to Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) and American Airlines (O:AAL), according to documents seen by Reuters. 
The subpoenas will be issued to the two biggest U.S. operators of the jet over the next couple of days, the lawyers separately told Reuters. 
They seek to know what  Boeing Co  (N:BA) promised potential airline customers about flight crew training and the 737 MAX certification process, and about Boeing's communications with the two airlines following a Lion Air crash in Indonesia on Oct. 29, 2018, and before the Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10.
They are seeking documents about 737 MAX software known as MCAS widely linked to both deadly crashes, as well as information on the aircraft's sensors. 
The two crashes, both involving 737 MAX jets, killed 346 people and spurred more than 100 lawsuits against the Chicago-based planemaker.
Southwest and American declined to comment.
The 737 MAX was grounded globally following the Ethiopian crash in March, and Boeing has been working to deliver software fixes aimed at winning fresh approval for commercial flight in the fourth quarter.
Both Southwest and American have flagged a hit to profits due to the grounding of the 737 MAX, which has forced each to cancel more than 100 daily flights through early next year.
While families of the Lion Air crash victims are in settlement talks with Boeing, the Ethiopian crash victims are pursuing a jury trial.
Both cases are in Chicago federal court, where a Lion Air status hearing is taking place on Thursday.
In a court filing late Monday, Boeing said veteran litigator Dan Webb, a former U.S. Attorney and special prosecutor in the 1980s Iran-Contra arms-sales affair, had joined its legal team in the Lion Air case.
In addition to the Chicago cases, questions about how Boeing designed and developed the 737 MAX are a focus in probes by the U.S. Department of Justice and a Congressional committee.
The planemaker has said it was sorry for the lives lost in both crashes but stopped short of admitting liability in how it developed the 737 MAX or the flight control software.    

Last week, an international aviation panel criticized U.S. regulators and Boeing over the certification of the plane.

The video-streaming pioneer is bracing for the launch next month of Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) Disney+ and Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) Apple TV+ after years when it has been left largely to develop and garner content from Hollywood studios unthreatened. 
That has stirred the first outright concerns among financial investors about the company's ability to fight deep-pocketed rivals, a feeling that was exacerbated by a shock slide in subscribers last quarter - the first in eight years. 
Shares in the company have fallen 22% since that report in mid-July. After Wednesday's third quarter results, they were back trading nearly 20% higher overall on the year. 
""In the race to capture the major share of audience in the global market, nobody is close to where Netflix is,"" said James Fattal, an analyst with financial markets platform Investing.com.
""Its original content for places like India and some European markets will mean the company will continue to be favored in the early years of these streaming wars."" 
Still, nine Wall Street brokerages cut their price target on the stock while one previous bull, Macquarie, downgraded its rating to neutral. 
Another house, Needham, projected the company would lose 10 million of its roughly 60 million U.S. subscribers over the course of 2020 unless it lowers prices, and several analysts noted the company's own ""prudent"" estimates for subscriber growth into the end of 2019. 
""In some ways Netflix has defied the naysayers in Q3, coming close enough to guidance and delivering impressive revenue and earnings growth,"" Macquarie analysts said. 
""We think it will be hard ... to grow much more in the US, and we suspect pricing power is limited.""

1647,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 11:26AM ET</span>",Workers at UK's Asda face sack as contract deadline looms,"LONDON (Reuters) - British supermarket group Asda said shop floor workers have just over two weeks to sign-up to new employment contracts, first proposed in April, or face losing their jobs.
Of Britain's big four grocers - market leader  Tesco  (L:TSCO), Sainsbury's (L:SBRY), Asda and Morrisons (L:MRW) -Walmart (N:WMT) owned Asda is the last to implement more flexible working contracts as it seeks productivity improvements in a brutally competitive market.
Asda's new standardized contracts increase the base rate of pay for over 100,000 retail workers to 9 pounds ($11.58) per hour, plus premiums, while maintaining benefits including an annual bonus, share save scheme and staff discount.
However, they remove paid breaks and require employees to work across departments and work on some bank holidays.
Asda has said workers have until Nov. 2 to sign the new contracts when the 12-week notice period of their various current contracts ends. Without a contract they will not have a job.
""We have been clear that we don't want any of our colleagues to leave us and whilst the vast majority of colleagues have chosen to sign the new contract, we continue to have conversations with those who have chosen not to, to try and understand their concerns,"" said a spokeswoman for Asda.
She declined to provide a figure for those who had refused to sign, adding that a figure of 12,000 cited by Sky News on Wednesday was ""entirely speculative"".
""There's still some time for colleagues to make their mind up and decide whether they want to move over to the new contract,"" she said.
The GMB union has called the contracts ""draconian"" and its campaign against them has been backed by opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn.
The supermarket group says the new contract represents an investment of more than 80 million pounds and is not a cost-cutting exercise.
All of Britain's big four grocers are continuing to lose market share to German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl, which are aggressively opening new stores.
In April Sainsbury's 7.3 billion pounds agreed bid for Asda was blocked by Britain's competition regulator. A month later Walmart said it would instead look at an initial public offering for Asda and in July Asda CEO Roger Burnley said this could happen in two to three years."

ZURICH/LONDON (Reuters) - Global consumer goods companies have been banking on emerging markets to drive their growth, so signs on Thursday that sales have come off the boil in the once-booming economies of China and India could set alarm bells ringing.
 Unilever  (L:ULVR), Nestle (S:NESN) and drinks group  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) all pointed to slower progress in key Asian markets as a factor for muted sales growth over the last three months but for the time being are keeping targets intact.
Packaged goods companies like these have been relying more on emerging markets to offset changing habits in developed economies, where growing numbers of consumers are turning to fresher foods, niche brands or cutting back on spending.
Yet two of the biggest emerging markets are now showing signs of slowing growth, with trade tensions with the United States hitting domestic consumption in China and more erratic and damaging monsoons curbing rural spending in India.
Anglo-Dutch Unilever said growth ""slowed a little"" in China during the third quarter, while Nestle said its sales performance in China was flat over the first nine months of the year.
Including globally managed businesses such as Nespresso, Nestle's growth in China was 1.5%, Chief Executive Mark Schneider told investors on a call.
French drinks company Pernod Ricard said the pace of its sales growth in China slowed to 6% in the quarter from 27% a year earlier due to challenging market conditions.
""We are seeing different dynamics between price points (in China),"" Nestle finance chief Francois-Xavier Roger said.
""Super premium offerings such as Illuma (infant formula) and Purina (pet food) grew well while mainstream products like Yinlu peanut milk, congee and S26 (infant formula) were challenged,"" he added.
Unilever finance chief Graeme Pitkethly said sales growth at China's bricks-and-mortar retailers slowed to 1% in the third quarter from 2% a year earlier.
""There have definitely been signs of slowing markets in India and China,"" Pitkethly told Reuters.
Earlier this week, a poll showed that China's economic growth was expected to decelerate to a near 30-year low.. The economy in India is growing at its slowest rate in six years.
""In India, we are going from very high rates of market growth to growth rates in the mid-single digits,"" added Pitkethly.
In Argentina, another of Unilever's big emerging markets, hyper-inflation has kept shoppers away from stores and led to a 4% drop in volumes.
TARGETS HELD FOR NOW
Pernod Ricard's CFO Helene de Tissot blamed a softer trade environment for the drop in sales of its spirits such as Chivas in China.
However, she said Pernod was still confident of achieving its mid-term sales growth targets in India and China.
Nestle, known for KitKat chocolate bars and Maggi noodles, posted 3.7% organic sales growth in the third quarter, in line with expectations, while Unilever reported 2.9% growth, just shy of analysts' estimates. 
Both companies maintained their operating margin and sales targets for the year.
Unilever shares traded up 1.5% at 1345 GMT, while Nestle slipped 2.2%.
Pernod said its like-for-like sales rose only 1.3%, down from 10.4% a year ago and below analysts' expectations.
Pernod shares fell 4.6%, trimming gains for the year to under 11%. The French company is facing U.S. tariffs as a result of a long-running dispute over aircraft subsidies.

Nestle shares have been the better performer over the year to date, gaining 30% as investors warmed to Schneider's strategy. Unilever, under new CEO Alan Jope this year, has seen its share price increase by around 14%.

1653,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 09:59AM ET</span>","‘No Champagne Yet’ as Investors, Analysts Greet Brexit Deal With Caution ","(Bloomberg) -- For a while there, investors and analysts got a taste of what’s in store if they ever escape the long shadow of Brexit. Unfortunately, most of them think freedom is still a long way off.
Assets across Europe briefly surged on Thursday as markets embraced the news that a Brexit deal had been struck in Brussels. But as traders assessed the obstacles ahead, the giddy mood faded. The deal -- struck just in time to present to EU leaders as they gather in Belgium’s capital -- still needs the approval of the British Parliament. Northern Ireland’s DUP, whose votes may be key, have said they will not back the accord.
“It might not be time to pop open the champagne quite yet,” said Jim McCormick (NYSE:MKC), the global head of strategy at NatWest Markets. “But even if it is voted down by U.K. parliament the Tories will have a stronger hand heading into a general election. The dynamic clearly changed.”
Here are some early reactions from investors and strategists across Europe:
Petr Krpata, chief currency strategist, ING Bank:
“The deal announced but the key hurdle of the deal being voted into the U.K. Parliament remains. With the DUP not changing its position, it is questionable whether the deal will get through the Parliament. There is now risk the current deal will have the same fate of Theresa May’s.” The potential for sterling to rally is “watered down by the DUP comments and the subsequent uncertainty about the outcome of the Parliamentary vote.”Nick Wall, portfolio manager, Merian Global Investors:
“The worst case scenario seems to be off the table in this Parliament and probably in the next if Johnson gets a majority. A near-term deal approved by parliament would probably help risk assets the most, but a setback should be short lived.”Seema Shah, chief strategist, Principal Global Investors:
“Investors should not be too enthusiastic as the endless negotiations and uncertainty over the past three years will take its toll on the country. Even with a Brexit agreement, the country will suffer a lot of economic pain as a result of the exit from the bloc.”Uwe Maderer, head of fixed income, LBBW Asset Management
“Brexit cliff edge seems to be over and that changes the market dynamics a bit, although the Parliamentary vote is still pending. The political will has clearly changed towards achieving a deal.”“The deal as it is all about goods and not services and only a low level of alignment with EU standards. That is clearly negative for longer term growth in the U.K. but surely better than no-deal and a WTO-based relationship with the EU.”Lars Kreckel, global equity strategist, Legal & General Investment Management:
“It’s impossible to trade the twists and turns of the news flow. Generally, the stronger pound is bad for FTSE 100 versus other markets, but some of that should be offset by international flows returning to U.K. equities.”Jim McCormick at NatWest again:
“What is different is that no one sees kicking the can down the road as an option any more. So old red lines are less red. I’ve been bearish on German fixed income and this is certainly supportive. You may be seeing start of dollar turn as well. European political risks have been a dollar boost.”Jane Foley, head of currency strategy, Rabobank:
“We have to remember that PM May had a deal too.”Andreas Meyer, portfolio manager, Aramea Asset Management:
“An important political obstacle seems to be resolved that paralyzed the market. However I do see essential residual risks, whether Johnson is able to push the deal through at home. That means more surprises might be ahead. Further cooperation with the EU (and not a hard deal) increases the likelihood that regulatory requirements for banks and insurance companies will be taken over by U.K. institutions and the stability of issuers will be maintained. I like to invest in HSBC, Lloyds (LON:LLOY), RBS (LON:RBS),  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and now the bold Brexit stamp, which influenced them, is significantly weaker.”Ricardo Gil, head of asset allocation, Trea Asset Management in Madrid:
“The deal is positive as it removes uncertainty that was weighing on the market, although most of the optimism may have already been priced in. I don’t expect to increase our exposure to equity following the deal, but we will go longer on banks.”Artur Baluszynski, head of research, Henderson Rowe:
“Big win for Boris. If he manages to get it through parliament, we should see a wave of risk-on trades coming into U.K. market.”Michael Hewson, chief market analyst, CMC Markets:
“Market volatility is likely to continue. The U.K. and EU say they have a deal, but the DUP isn’t on board, so there’s little chance of it getting through the House of Commons. Why claim there’s a deal?”"
1654,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 09:53AM ET</span>",Netflix Rises Most Since January on Booming Overseas Growth,"(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) jumped the most in nine months after its third-quarter results allayed concerns about looming competition from Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) Co. and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
The company added 6.77 million subscribers in the third quarter, with stronger-than-expected growth overseas, it said Wednesday after markets closed. Earnings also topped Wall Street estimates, letting investors overlook a tepid forecast for the final quarter of the year.
Investors had been bracing for a weak showing after Netflix delivered a disappointing quarter three months ago. The stock had been flagging for weeks. The actual results -- though far from perfect -- were a relief, sending the shares up as much as 7.9% in New York trading Thursday.
“It was a really strong quarter -- not just around subscribers, the overall business performance,” Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann said in a taped interview with Guggenheim Securities analyst Michael Morris.
International markets account for almost all of Netflix’s growth -- and most of its total customers. The world’s largest paid online TV network signed up 6.26 million new users outside the U.S., beating forecasts. Netflix expects to sign 7 million more international customers during the current three months, ending the year with its strongest overseas growth to date.
The company benefited from new seasons of a couple of its most popular shows. The teen science-fiction show “Stranger Things” was viewed by 64 million households in its first four weeks, making it the most-watched season of original programming on Netflix. A new season of “La Casa de Papel,” a Spanish heist series, was viewed by 44 million households. It was Netflix’s most-watched show in non-English-speaking countries.
Netflix is looking to stoke demand outside the U.S. by investing more in international original series. The company has already released 100 seasons of local language scripted series from 17 countries, and plans to release more than 130 next year alone.
Overseas markets will be even more important in the face of new competition from Disney, Apple, Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA). and AT&T Inc. All four of those companies will introduce new streaming services in the next few months, starting in the U.S. While the final three months of the year are typically among the company’s strongest, Netflix expects to add a total of 7.6 million more customers in the fourth quarter -- fewer than it did a year ago.
‘Noisy’ Launch
The new services from Disney and Apple both launch next month. The Disney+ platform is geared toward kids and families, with hundreds of movies and shows, including Star Wars, Avengers and Pixar fare. Apple’s product is more adult-oriented and has less content.
“The launch of these new services will be noisy,” Netflix said in its quarterly letter to investors. “There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance.”
The stock has taken a beating lately, dropping 21% since the prior quarter’s miss was announced in July. Even after the latest rally, it’s not back to its summertime highs, but Netflix has restored the faith of many investors.
Third-quarter revenue grew 31% to $5.24 billion, just shy of Wall Street projections. Profit increased to $1.47 a share, easily beating analysts’ estimates of $1.05. This quarter, the company forecasts earnings of 51 cents a share on sales of $5.44 billion. Both are below Wall Street estimates.
Recent price hikes have lifted both profit and revenue. Those increases have slowed subscriber growth in the U.S., however. Gains in the U.S. last quarter amounted to just 520,000 new accounts, and the company is going to post its weakest growth at home in years, adding just 2.7 million customers this year.
The Los Gatos, California-based company will continue to use the junk-bond market to finance its programming costs, which are expected to total about $15 billion this year.
Netflix didn’t say whether it would increase prices again any time soon. It does plan to test more mobile-only and cheaper plans in poorer countries across Asia, where it has the most room to grow.
“We’re incredibly low-priced compared to cable,” Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings said. “We’re winning more and more viewing.”"
1655,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 09:49AM ET</span>","Norwegian Air, JetBlue tie up to expand transatlantic network","By Victoria Klesty and Terje Solsvik
OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) and New York's JetBlue Airways (O:JBLU) plan a partnership enabling passengers flying between Europe and the United States to continue to multiple destinations under a single booking, potentially boosting traffic and average fares. 
The airlines said in a joint statement on Thursday that if agreed the partnership would come into effect in the middle of next year.
Norwegian, Europe's third-largest budget carrier, has shaken up the market for travel across the Atlantic with cut-price fares that challenge traditional carriers such as IAG's (L:ICAG) British Airways, but its breakneck expansion left it with high debts and in the red.
The partnership with JetBlue will connect JetBlue flights from around 100 cities in the Americas to Norwegian's network in New York, Boston and Fort Lauderdale, from which the carrier serves more than 20 European destinations.
The deal could help both airlines to boost traffic and the average fares they earn as transatlantic services are extended beyond the biggest U.S. cities, Bernstein analyst David Vernon said.
Norwegian already has a European partnership with London Gatwick-based easyJet (L:EZJ), but until now lacked a U.S. partner.
While Norwegian and other low-cost long-haul operators have challenged the big network carriers on their main intercontinental routes, the incumbents' connecting traffic to smaller destinations has so far remained largely out of reach.
""If you compete on a purely point-to-point basis, you're in the most commoditized, lowest-yielding segment of the market with no subset of passengers to destinations that rivals can't get to,"" Bernstein's Vernon said.
""This is an opportunity for Norwegian to capture some extra, more profitable traffic,"" he added.
Shares in Norwegian Air, which is cutting costs to try and return to profit, surged 10% on the news before giving up some gains to trade up 3.8% by 1248 GMT, outperforming an Oslo benchmark index (OSEBX) up 0.6%.
""Customers will have the possibility to book connecting flights on both airlines' websites by combining the best of our complementary and expansive networks,"" the airlines said.
JetBlue Airways Corp has said that it hopes to break into the low-fare, transatlantic travel market.

""This new agreement ... seamlessly connects JetBlue's robust network throughout the U.S., Caribbean and Latin America with ... exciting European destinations,"" JetBlue Chief Executive Robin Hayes said in the statement.

1657,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 09:43AM ET</span>",Gunvor must pay $95 million for Congo oil corruption: Swiss prosecutors,"By Julia Payne
LONDON (Reuters) - Swiss federal prosecutors have found oil trader Gunvor Group criminally liable for corruption in Congo Republic and Ivory Coast, ordering it to pay almost 94 million Swiss francs ($94.8 million), the Swiss Attorney General's Office said on Thursday.
The settlement includes a fine of 4 million Swiss francs, out of a maximum of 5 million, as well as gross profit plus interest it gained from oil deals in the two west African countries in 2009-2011 worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
The decision is the first time in Switzerland that a major trading firm has been found guilty on such charges, Swiss campaign group Public Eye said. It published an investigation into the deals in 2017.
""The Geneva commodities trader has been convicted of failing to take all the organizational measures that were reasonable and necessary to prevent its employees and agents from bribing public officials in order to gain access to the petroleum markets in the Republic of Congo and Ivory Coast,"" a statement from the Swiss Attorney General's Office said.
Gunvor, one of the world's top energy traders, said in response to the ruling that there was ""no conscious or desired involvement of employees or members of management in these activities"". 
It added that no current employees or businesses of Gunvor Group were involved in any related ongoing litigation or investigations. 
WIDENING PROBE
The Attorney General (AG) began a money laundering probe in late 2011 into unknown individuals that grew over the years. It began investigating Gunvor as a company for organizational deficiencies in 2017.
A former employee, Pascal Collard, signed a plea deal in 2018 in which he admitted paying bribes to win contracts for the firm. He said senior management was fully aware and approved the transactions, according to a Swiss prosecution document.
As a result of the payments, Gunvor secured a three-year oil supply contract from Congo state oil firm SNPC in June 2010 and signed two deals to make prepayments for oil cargoes with SNPC worth $125 million and $500 million in July 2011. The firm also received Ivory Coast oil cargoes between 2009 and 2010.
The bribe recipients, according to the plea deal, included Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso, his family members and former senior Ivory Coast government officials. The Congo government denied the allegations.
In a recent interview, Gunvor Chief Executive Torbjorn Tornqvist said the process ""was very painful ... I promised my employees, stakeholders and my family that we will never find ourselves in this position again"".
Swiss prosecutors said Gunvor had no code of conduct, compliance or sufficient oversight at the time. The firm has since built up a compliance scheme and reduced the number of intermediaries and agents it uses to secure deals by a third.
The settlement amounts to about 3% of total trading profit for the firm between 2009-2011, Gunvor said. It had put aside funds last year in case of a financial settlement with Swiss authorities. 
Gunvor today conducts only 4% of its business within African countries, and has no business in Congo Republic.

(Reuters) -  Snap Inc . (N:SNAP) said on Thursday it is introducing dynamic advertising that automatically create ads and target audiences in real-time, as the parent company of photo messaging app Snapchat looks to compete for digital ad dollars.
Snap has grown revenue and its userbase as larger rivals Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) Google and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), which dominate the global digital advertising market, face regulatory scrutiny over their market control. Both Google and Facebook already offer dynamic ads.
Dynamic ad platforms pick items from advertisers' product catalogs and target them automatically to people with relevant interests, removing the need to manually advertise each product individually. Snap is betting the convenience will attract more advertisers.
For example, Snap could automatically show sneakers to Snapchat users that have an interest in sports, displaying items from retailers that have uploaded their product catalogs.
David Herrmann, an independent ad buyer based in Los Angeles who works with direct-to-consumer brands, said the new function was a compelling option for ""direct response-focused"" brands.
Snap said while global advertisers would be able to use dynamic ad platform immediately, their campaigns will initially only reach U.S. Snapchat users, with a global rollout scheduled later.
Snap remains a small player in the global digital ad market with 0.5% revenue share, compared with Google at 32% and Facebook at 21%, according to research firm eMarketer."

MUMBAI (Reuters) - An Indian court on Thursday sent the former managing director of Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank, Joy Thomas, to jail as a probe into an alleged 43.55 billion rupees ($610 million) fraud intensifies.
Thomas stands accused in a police complaint of criminal breach of trust, forgery and falsification of records in relation to PMC's dealings with the now bankrupt realty company Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd (NS:HDIL) (HDIL).
He had been detained for questioning earlier this month and kept in police custody.
On Thursday, the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's court in Mumbai ordered that Thomas be jailed while the probe into the fraud continues.
PMC allegedly made more than 21,000 fictitious accounts to hide loans it made to HDIL. Last month, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) took control of the functioning of PMC and initiated a forensic audit. It has also capped withdrawals by depositors, sparking protests.
PMC has not responded to the allegations, the latest scandal to taint India's troubled banking sector. The administrator appointed by the RBI to oversee PMC was not immediately available for comment on Thursday.
Thomas's lawyer told the court that his client was acting under instruction of the bank's board of directors.
Police late on Wednesday also arrested Surjit Singh Arora, a former director of PMC who was a member of its loan committee.
""He abused his official position to facilitate fraud and he needs to be interrogated thoroughly,"" police said of Arora in a court filing seen by Reuters.
HDIL's former senior executives Sarang Wadhawan and Rakesh Wadhawan and PMC's former chairman Waryam Singh are also in judicial custody and are being investigated.
Waryam Singh's lawyer denied any wrongdoing by his client and said he wasn't aware of the allegations. HDIL and Arora's lawyers were not immediately available for comment.
India's financial crime fighting agency this week said it had identified and seized assets worth more than 38.3 billion rupees, including two private jets, a yacht and several luxury cars which it says belong to HDIL's directors and promoters, PMC bank officials and other related entities."

Berneschi and the other defendants have always denied any wrongdoing.
Berneschi and the others will now be tried again in Milan, a lawyer for two of the defendants said on Thursday, citing a ruling read out in the court late on Wednesday.
Under Italian law, a trial has to be held in the city where the most serious offense took place. In previous rulings, criminal association had been deemed the most serious offense.
But Italy's highest court upheld a claim by the defendants' lawyers that the most serious offense is that of money laundering, which was allegedly committed in Milan.
""We still have to face the Milan trial but I can already tell you this: I'll ask for million of euros in damages for what I went through with my family, all the pain we endured,"" Berneschi said in an interview on Thursday with Genoa daily Il Secolo XIX.
""I look at this city ... I have financed all of Genoa's main projects ... and they treated me like the worst thief. Now I can start holding my head high again,"" he added.
Berneschi was ousted from his job in September 2013 after 20 years as Carige's chairman in a management overhaul imposed by supervisors following audits that revealed poor lending practices, a large derivatives exposure and questionable accounting methods.
After being placed under special administration by the European Central Bank in January, Carige was kept afloat by other Italian banks, which shouldered the bulk of a 900 million euro ($1 billion) rescue.
Shareholders in Carige last month approved a 700 million euro cash call, relinquishing control of the bank to save it from liquidation after years of losses.
Under Italian rules, the statute of limitations for the most serious offense in the new trial runs out in around five years, the defense lawyer said, indicating the trial may not reach completion given the lengthy duration of court proceedings in the country."

RIYADH/LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is setting the stage for a blockbuster listing of state oil giant Saudi Aramco in Riyadh, relying on easy credit for retail investors and pushing rich locals to invest with cash held abroad to achieve a $2 trillion valuation target.
The world's largest oil firm could announce plans next week to float a 1%-2% stake on the kingdom's Tadawul market before a possible international listing, launching an initiative that is central to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's economic diversification drive.
If the state raises more than $25 billion, it would be the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO), topping Alibaba's 2014 debut.
To capitalize on local interest, Aramco can take advantage of new market rules that allow issuers the flexibility to sell more shares to retail investors, likely exceeding the usual 10% seen in recent IPOs, two banking and one legal source said.
A government committee has met in the past few months with dozens of wealthy Saudi individuals to secure pre-sale agreements, two bankers and a potential investor said.
One source said those discussions included encouraging investors to repatriate cash held overseas to avoid draining too much liquidity from the Saudi banking system. ""The national interest requires bringing money from overseas,"" he said.
Aramco declined to comment and the government's media office did not respond to a request for comment.
""Listing first on the Riyadh exchange is a great opportunity for Aramco to access first the type of investors that might be most excited about the public offering,"" said Ellen R. Wald, president of Transversal Consulting and author of the book Saudi, Inc.
""Between the domestic Saudi enthusiasm for the company and government encouragement of investment in Aramco, Tadawul is bound to give Aramco the best opportunity for a high valuation.”
EASY LOANS
Large Saudi banks are facilitating loans for local retail investors, three other banking sources said, amid strong liquidity in the banking system where deposits exceeded loans by 215 billion riyals ($57 billion) in August.
Bankers expect at least 6 million-7 million local investors to participate, more than took part in the $6 billion 2014 IPO of National Commercial Bank (SE:1180), which was 23 times oversubscribed.
""The IPO will be a gift from the government to the Saudi people and they will want as many of them as possible to take part in it,"" said a Riyadh investment banker.
Saudi investors see the IPO as a chance to own part of the kingdom's crown jewel and an opportunity to show patriotism after the attack on Aramco oil plants on Sept. 14 that temporarily knocked out more than half the country's output, which is now about 10 million barrels per day.
Potential investors told Reuters they had been preparing for months -- saving money, selling land plots and exiting other stocks. Saudis flooded banks with phone calls asking how to participate after Aramco announced bank mandates last month.
""I have seven boys and I wish I could invest in Aramco IPO for each of them,"" said retired civil servant Abu Abdullah.
Online adverts promoting the IPO to locals have gone viral.
""The Aramco IPO is a chance that comes once in a lifetime, and one must seize it,"" said a Saudi real estate investor.
EQUAL TREATMENT
Some foreign funds fear the domestic focus may crowd them out.
""It's quite a valuable asset we think is fairly well-run, but if all the cream is taken by locals it will be harder to attract foreign investors,"" said Marshall Stocker, portfolio manager at U.S.-based investment firm  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance.
""It's an important economic principle that investors are treated equally regardless of their nationality,"" he said.
A person familiar with the deal said the process was transparent for all institutional investors, including Qualified Foreign Investors registered with the Tadawul bourse, who can bid for the share allocation.
Besides helping to hit the valuation target of $2 trillion - a figure cited by the crown prince although bankers have suggested a lower number - a local listing will also aid Riyadh's efforts to promote Tadawul to investors abroad.
Bankers say Tadawul's membership in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and FTSE Global Equity Index should boost demand for the IPO, but one source familiar with the transaction said the expected level of passive fund investment was uncertain.
""We are studying the opportunity. If we participate, most likely it would be the international space where we think liquidity should be greater,"" said Peter Marber, chief investment officer at active asset manager Aperture Investors.
Foreign funds bought more Saudi stocks this year after Riyadh entered both indices, but the Saudi market (TASI) is down 4% year-to-date, as local institutions sold shares to prepare for the Aramco deal, fund managers and analysts say.
Tadawul should have enough liquidity for a 1%-2% Aramco float given daily trading worth 5 billion riyals in August, analysts say. Inflows from foreign passive funds helped lift trading from 3.2 billion riyals a year earlier."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The negative effect of currency fluctuations on North American companies' second-quarter results eased slightly from the preceding quarter but remained at a historically elevated level, according to data from treasury and financial management firm Kyriba on Thursday.
The collective exchange rate impact, including on companies in the United States, Canada and Mexico, was $21.01 billion, Kyriba said in a report.
This was less than the $23.39 billion negative effect in the first quarter, but marks the third straight quarter that the hit has totaled more than $20 billion, the longest such streak in more than a decade.
""What's interesting about this is we continue to have this trend of north of $20 billion three quarters in a row. We have not seen that since we started this research in 2008-09,"" Wolfgang Koester, senior strategy officer of Kyriba, said.
""We've also never had a $44 billion loss for the start of a year since we've been reporting it.""
Kyriba, which acquired currency risk consulting firm FIREapps earlier this year, said 291 North American companies reported negative currency impacts in the second quarter, roughly the same as in recent quarters.
A stronger dollar can hurt large U.S. companies that derive much of their revenue from abroad as they repatriate foreign earnings.
At the end of the second quarter, the U.S. dollar had risen nearly 3% against the euro from a year earlier. (EUR=)
Investors have favored the dollar for many months, thanks to relatively high U.S. interest rates and a strong economy."

Net redemptions totaled about $1 billion in the three months ended September, the most since the second quarter of 2009, according to data compiled by Eurekahedge Pte. Analysts from the research firm said that while anti-government protests in Hong Kong have unnerved markets, the outflow was in keeping with redemptions from hedge funds globally after poor returns from a number of managers in 2018.
The withdrawals from Hong Kong were modest relative to total hedge fund assets in the city, which climbed $6.9 billion this year to $92 billion as of August thanks largely to positive market returns, according to Eurekahedge. Small-and medium-sized hedge funds managing $500 million or less accounted for the bulk of client outflows, with bigger funds seeing positive allocations, the research firm said. The industry has enjoyed net annual inflows every year since 2009.
“The political crisis in Hong Kong is yet to pose any meaningful threat,” Mohammad Hassan, head hedge-fund analyst at the firm in Singapore, said by email. “The opportunity and access that managers based in Hong Kong provide to Chinese onshore markets and to the broader region as whole is unlikely to be eclipsed in the near term unless things really spiral out of control.”
The protests have already impacted other parts of the city’s financial system. A rising number of family offices have made inquiries about shifting away from Hong Kong, while a recent  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). analysis suggested that some bank deposits have been transferred to Singapore."

1674,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 06:06AM ET</span>","Eyeing economic growth, South Africa seeks to renegotiate old renewables projects","By Alexander Winning
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa has started discussions with power producers to try to get cheaper electricity from some older renewable energy projects and give the economy a boost, several participants in the talks say.
But participant power firms - some of which are backed by big names such as EDF Renewables (PA:EDF) - say they can't give the government big savings on many of the 64 solar and wind projects that are part of the discussions, because most of the money has already been spent.
Putting too much pressure on them would risk deterring renewable energy investment just as the country is suffering nationwide power cuts. Business confidence is weak after corruption scandals under former president Jacob Zuma.
Climate activists are wary of any moves that could delay the country's sluggish transition from heavily polluting coal power, which still accounts for more than 80% of output and makes South Africa one of the world's top-20 carbon dioxide emitters.
""80%-90% of project costs are sunk costs, so as an industry we need to manage expectations (by showing) that there isn't that much room for savings,"" said Jan Fourie, general manager for sub-Saharan Africa at Scatec Solar (OL:SSOL), another company that owns projects under discussion.
He said the government had not yet made any formal proposals.
""A unilateral tariff reduction would shake investor confidence and undermine future public-private partnership projects,"" Fourie added.
Renewable energy projects are protected by more than 140 billion rand ($9.4 billion) of state guarantees, exposing the government to huge penalties if it were to terminate or breach existing agreements.
Twelve projects, including Scatec's, also enjoy protection from the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), part of the World Bank Group, which offers insurance against breach of contract, said Hoda Atia Moustafa, MIGA's Africa head.
EDF Renewables did not comment in detail on the talks but said they were constructive.
""GOOD CITIZENS""
Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan have stressed the talks are voluntary, asking for firms' cooperation as ""good citizens"" at an Oct. 4 meeting, according to minutes of the meeting seen by Reuters.
They asked for ""quick win"" projects that could support local businesses with cheaper electricity, offering a sweetener in the form of extensions to power purchase agreements for projects bid between 2011 and 2014.
Those projects are being targeted because they had larger tariffs, as funding and technology costs were higher.
Mantashe told power firms that the ""government isn't the enemy of renewable energy"" but that if administered prices such as those for electricity failed to come down then the economy would not grow, the minutes showed.
Mantashe's spokesman Nathi Shabangu said the discussions were private and at an early stage. Gordhan's spokesman Richard Mantu referred all questions to the energy ministry.
Lenders and lawyers said the government was being unrealistic by targeting quick reductions in power prices through a ""collective bargaining"" approach of the type used in wage talks with unions.
""Attempting to achieve a blanket tariff reduction is almost impossible because each project is different,"" said Alastair Campbell, managing director of Vantage GreenX, a sustainable energy fund with exposure to some affected projects.
Some solar and wind projects will be unable to extend the lifespan of their equipment, power producers said.
Jason van der Poel, a partner at law firm Webber Wentzel who represents power firms, said there were competition and procurement law obstacles to overcome.
""The risk is that this becomes an enormous drain on resources for a marginal benefit in terms of the tariff reduction,"" he said.
A simpler way to lower power prices could be to give the go-ahead for projects to refinance their debt. Power firms could then pass on some or all of the savings.
Fourie of Scatec said debt was the ""low-hanging fruit"" and that investors could give the government a lump sum from any savings.
Anton Eberhard, a member of President Cyril Ramaphosa's task team on struggling state power utility Eskom, said any marginal gains from a tough renegotiation would be outweighed by ""future investment uncertainty"".
Instead, the government could run more renewable energy bidding rounds, which could yield prices below 50 rand cents per kilowatt hour versus Eskom's average selling price of 102 rand cents per kilowatt hour, he said."

Investing.com - Wall Street’s third-quarter earnings season has gotten off to a strong start so far, with companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) all blowing past analysts’ expectations.

Earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to decline by 4.1% for the third quarter, according to FactSet, which would mark the first year-on-year contraction since the earnings recession that ended in 2016.
Lingering fears over the fallout from the prolonged U.S.-China trade war on U.S. companies prompted market players to brace for a grim earnings season. 
However, this trend has not played out so far this season. Of the 43 S&P 500 companies that reported earnings before the bell Thursday, 86% have come in better than consensus expectations.

The biggest name to report results this week was Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Shares surged 10% after the streaming giant added slightly more paying subscribers than Wall Street expected in the third quarter when it reported after Wednesday’s closing bell.
Earnings will continue to be the focal point for investors for the remainder of the month, with market heavyweights like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) all set to report quarterly results.

The Anglo-Dutch giant was the second-best performer in the Euro Stoxx 50 on Thursday morning after both companies reported their third-quarter earnings: it rose 1.6%, while Nestle fell 0.8% in Zurich, despite announcing a 20 billion-franc buyback over the next three years.
That's on a morning when the Euro Stoxx 600 was flat and the Swiss SMI up less than 0.1% as markets awaited a make-or-break summit for Brexit that starts later in the day. The U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.3% as the pound fell back on news that the agreement reportedly taking shape in Brussels had been rejected by the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, reducing the chance of any deal passing the U.K. House of Commons.
Appearances are deceptive. All these figures show, as far as the market is concerned, is that it's better to travel than to arrive. Under their previous leaderships, both companies were long-running underperformers, hobbled by slow growth and bloated costs. Nestle, in three years under Mark Schneider, has done more to address those concerns than  Unilever  (LON:ULVR), albeit under pressure from activist investor Dan Loeb. Its organic sales growth in the third quarter, at 3.7%, comfortably outstripped Unilever's 2.9%.
By contrast,  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) fended off an attempt by the buccaneering slash-and-burn experts of Brazil's 3G, and even though it too has changed its CEO, it's been able to go about improving margins and returns at its own pace, and its share price has performed with less vim accordingly. It's up 18% this year, while Nestle's has risen 32%, posting one record high after another.
On recent form, then, Nestle clearly deserves some kind of premium to its rival. But does it really deserve to trade at more than twice the trailing price-earnings multiple (over 34 times for Nestle to 15 times for  Unilever  (LON:ULVR))? Especially when the buyback is largely a payoff for historical actions (the disposal of Nestle's skin care business for 10.2 billion francs)? It's hard to see the Herta cold meats business freeing up anything like as much in cash (and indeed, the company said it may even retain the proceeds of that sale if it finds better ways to use it).
Additionally, although Unilever's sales growth is lagging, a good part of that is down to bumper ice cream sales in last year's scorching hot European summer, which made for a tougher comparison. Alan Jope, the company's new CEO, repeated that the company is still on track to meet its target of 20% operating margins by next year. For context, Nestle ran at a margin of 17.5% this summer. That's all to the credit of Schneider, who is clearly running a tighter ship than his predecessor. But  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) still has the best to come, and today's figures are not a clear reason to abandon that hope."

The group, best known for its Gommino loafers, has been struggling to rejuvenate its brands, which include Hogan, Fay and Roger Vivier, in an effort to boost sluggish sales.
Chiapponi will be able ""to combine Tod's Italian lifestyle with a touch of modernity, without ever losing sight of the high quality and craftsmanship that represents the brand's DNA,"" Tod's Chairman Diego Della Valle said in a statement.
After a period at Givenchy in Paris, Chiapponi, 41, returned to Italy in 2007 to work for brands such as Valentino, Gucci and Prada's (HK:1913) Miu Miu and Bottega Veneta, where he was design director until June.
As part of its revamping efforts, Tod's in February hired former Bottega Veneta CEO Carlo Alberto Beretta as general manager for the brand."
1681,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 05:14AM ET</span>",Exclusive: WeWork owner creates committee to decide on financing lifeline,"By Joshua Franklin, Greg Roumeliotis and Anirban Sen
NEW YORK (Reuters) - WeWork owner, The We Company, has formed a special board committee to consider proposals for a $5 billion financing lifeline from its largest shareholder SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) and its main lender JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), four people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The office-space sharing company is establishing the committee in an effort to ring-fence its financing deliberations from SoftBank's influence, the sources said. The Japanese technology conglomerate owns about a third of WeWork, and any new equity investment could potentially give it control. 
WeWork is rushing to raise new capital after scrapping plans last month for an initial public offering (IPO). Sources have said it could run out of cash as early as November unless it secures new financing. 
A WeWork spokeswoman declined to comment. We Company directors did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The committee will only have two members - both We Company board directors with the task of representing the interests of all investors in the company, the sources said. 
One is Bruce Dunlevie, who is a general partner at WeWork shareholder Benchmark Capital, according to the sources. The other is Lew Frankfort, who is the former CEO of luxury handbag maker Coach, they added.
SoftBank will not have a representative, the sources said. It is represented on We Company's seven-member board by its President Ron Fisher. Former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) investment banker Mark Schwartz, who served as a SoftBank director until earlier this year, also sits on the board. 
WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann, who resigned as CEO last month but retained his role as chairman of the board, does not have a seat on the committee either, according to the sources, who requested anonymity in discussing the confidential arrangements.
WeWork canceled its IPO following investor concerns about mounting losses, its business model and the way the company was being run. Its estimated valuation dropped from $47 billion in January to as low as $10 billion last month.
In response, WeWork is seeking to slow down its expansion, reducing the number of new property leases it is taking on and considering layoffs.
SoftBank has proposed up to a $5 billion investment in WeWork two of the sources said. It also wants to renegotiate a previous commitment for a $1.5 billion investment in the form of warrants that are due in April at the $47 billion valuation, the sources added. It has already invested some $10 billion in WeWork.
For its part, JPMorgan is scouring the market to raise financing commitments from banks and bond investors for as much as $5 billion, one of the sources said. It has not agreed to underwrite the debt, and WeWork wants to see how much debt can be raised without leading to a dilution for existing shareholders before making a decision, the source added.
WeWork may seek to combine the SoftBank and JPMorgan proposals in some form, according to the sources.
SoftBank declined to comment for this story. JPMorgan did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Publicly listed companies form special board committees to safeguard the interests of minority shareholders when considering transactions, usually when some board representatives face conflicts of interest. It is less common for a private company such as WeWork to form a special committee.
However, WeWork has been vulnerable to criticism of its corporate governance arrangements because of Neumann's prior grip on the company. 
Neumann's shares used to have the same voting power as 20 We Company common shares, before he agreed to partially reduce his grip last month - reducing the ratio to 3-1 - in an unsuccessful attempt to make an IPO more attractive to investors. 
Neumann had also entered into several transactions with WeWork, making the company a tenant in some of his personal properties and charging it rent. He has also secured a $500 million credit line from banks using company stock as collateral.
When Neumann gave up the CEO role last month under pressure from SoftBank, Benchmark Capital and other investors, he said he did so because the scrutiny directed towards him became a ""significant distraction"".

Artie Minson, previously WeWork's chief financial officer, and Sebastian Gunningham, who was a vice chairman at the company, are now serving as its co-chief executives.

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 05:01AM ET</span>",Elliott pushes Japan's Unizo to accept $1.6 billion Blackstone bid,"By Junko Fujita
TOKYO (Reuters) - Unizo Holdings' (T:3258) top shareholder Elliott Management pushed the Japan hotel operator to accept a $1.6 billion tender offer from Blackstone Group (N:BX), warning it would take ""all available measures"" if it fails to do its ""fiduciary duty"". 
Activist investor Elliott's warning comes after Unizo had previously rebuffed an offer from Blackstone. The buyout group this week ratcheted up its pursuit of the company by launching the buyout offer, to which Unizo is still deciding its response. 
""We strongly urge you to consider in good faith, and not unduly obstruct, the Blackstone proposal,"" Elliott, which owns 13.14% in Unizo, said in a statement.
It said Blackstone's offer of 5,000 yen is beneficial for shareholders and the employment conditions Blackstone has offered is ""very generous to your employees"". 
A Unizo spokeswoman said the company is unable to comment on Elliott's statement. 
Unizo was little known until travel services provider  H.I.S. Co Ltd  (T:9603) launched a hostile bid for it in July. Unizo ultimately rejected the bid but attracted the attention of other suitors who see the company as vastly undervalued.
But Unizo has played hard to get: Last week it rejected a proposal from Blackstone as well as one from an unidentified ""locally renowned"" fund. 
This month Elliott ended weeks of silence and started to address its concerns about Unizo's disclosure to its board. That included seeking explanation on its sudden withdrawal of support for a bid from SoftBank Group-owned (T:9984) Fortress Investment Group.
Unizo originally welcomed the ""white knight"" bid from Fortress but later back-tracked.
In a separate statement, Fortress said it would extend its tender offer period until Nov. 1 from Thursday. It did not sweeten its bid of 4,000 yen a share.

Unizo shares closed at 4,940 yen on Thursday.

1685,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 04:16AM ET</span>",Loosened lending rules in Hong Kong stoke optimism for small apartment sales,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Relaxed mortgage rules in Hong Kong that allow buyers to take on bigger loans will drive small-to-medium flat sales, property agents say, with the changes already prompting some sales.
Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam on Wednesday expanded borrowers' power by reducing the size of down payments required for home purchases as part of a slew of measures aimed at alleviating the city's housing shortage.
Under the Mortgage Insurance Programme, borrowers can carry a loan-to-value ratio (LTV) as high as 90% on properties worth up to HK$8 million ($1 million). Before, such a high ratio was only permitted on properties worth half as much.
Borrowers can get an LTV of 80% on properties worth as much as HK$10 million, previously capped at HK$6 million.
This means prospective home buyers will not need so much money up front; for example, the down payment on an HK$8 million home will fall to HK$800,000 from HK$3.2 million.
""Last evening, our agents sold three apartments in Fanling (in the New Territories), which was a lot because there haven't been 3 transactions for a whole month,"" said Centaline Property Agency Asia Pacific residential chief executive Louis Chan.
He said that the transactions ranged from HK$4 million to HK$6 million and that the buyers hastened their decision after Lam's announcement. The sellers also cut their price by 2-3%.
""The new mortgage policy will help the secondary market for flats below HK$10 million,"" Chan said. ""In the last 8 years the demand for this segment has been suppressed by the restrictive policies and the transaction volumes have been very low.""
Previously, buyers were more likely to consider new homes, for which developers provided high LTV loans.
Sammy Po, residential chief executive of property agency Midland Hong Kong, said that about 10% of sellers of apartments valued below HK$8 million were raising their price by 3-5%, and that he expected a 2-3% price rise in small to mid-sized apartments in the fourth quarter.
Property developers plan to push out new launches faster on the news, with China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) expected to release the price list for its new development this week.
Midland's Chan, however, stuck with his original forecast of a 5% decline in home prices over the rest of the year, as the current protests and trade tensions between the U.S. and China weigh on the market."

The list was published by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
This means ""the green light is fully given to Tesla for production in China,"" said Yale Zhang, head of the Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight. Tesla can start production any time, he said 
Tesla did not immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment. The $2 billion factory it is building in the eastern Chinese city of Shanghai is its first car manufacturing site overseas. 
Reuters reported earlier this month that Tesla plans to start production at its China factory this month. It is unclear when it will meet year-end production targets because of uncertainties around orders, labor and suppliers.
Tesla intends to produce at least 1,000 Model 3s a week from the Shanghai factory by the end of this year, as it tries to boost sales in the world's biggest auto market and avoid higher import tariffs imposed on U.S. cars.
The factory, China's first fully foreign-owned car plant, also reflects Beijing's broader shift to open up its car market.

Shanghai authorities have offered Tesla assistance to speed up construction, and China excluded Tesla models from a 10% car purchase tax on Aug. 30.

1690,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 02:51AM ET</span>",South Africa's Eskom forced to cut power for a second day,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African power utility Eskom warned of a second day of power cuts on Thursday citing a number of generating units still out of service.
A day earlier Eskom imposed its first power cuts in around seven months, highlighting the challenge facing President Cyril Ramaphosa in rescuing the state company.
Eskom said it would cut 2,000 megawatts (MW) of power from 9 a.m. (0700 GMT) until 11 p.m. (2100 GMT) on a rotational basis across the country.
""Contingency measures have been put in place to manually feed coal to Medupi (power plant) whilst we look into a permanent solution to the coal conveyor belt failure at the station,"" Eskom said.
""We have started receiving additional diesel supplies from the major oil service providers and as such we are comfortable that we can build the necessary diesel and water reserves to acceptable levels over the weekend.""
Late on Wednesday it said some generating units have already returned to service and it expects more units to return to service over the next few days.
South Africa's rand currency fell as much as 1% against the dollar on Wednesday after Eskom announced the cuts.
The announcement put more pressure on the country's weak economy ahead of a review by Moody's, the last of the big three credit rating agencies to have an investment grade rating on South Africa.
Eskom produces more than 90% of South Africa's electricity but has been hobbled by technical faults at its fleet of mainly coal-fired power stations.
It is also grappling with a debt pile which stood at around 440 billion rand ($31 billion) as of March.
Ramaphosa has pledged 59 billion rand of support for Eskom over the next two years, on top of 230 billion rand in bailouts spread over the next 10 years. Officials say its operational losses mean Eskom will also have to take other measures to make it financially sustainable."

Emerging markets, which account for 60% of Unilever's business, have been a key area of focus for Chief Executive Alan Jope since he took the reins in January.
Jope has been focusing investment in countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh, where growing populations and an emerging middle class are driving demand for household products.
Shares in the maker of Knorr soups, Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream have risen more than 11% this year, nearly double the rise in the broader FTSE 100 (FTSE) index, buoyed by a weaker pound and strong performance in markets such as Indonesia and the Philippines.
Yet two of its biggest emerging markets show signs of slowing growth, with the impact of trade wars hitting domestic consumption in China and irregular monsoons curbing rural spending in India.
""South East Asian markets continued to grow well, while growth in India softened further and China slowed a little,"" the company said on Thursday.
Unilever reported underlying sales growth of 2.9% in the quarter, missing an average forecast of 3%, according to a company supplied consensus.
Turnover was 13.3 billion euros ($14.7 billion), above the 13.24 billion euros analysts had expected.

TOKYO/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Sterling faltered on fading hopes of a Brexit deal on Thursday, while a five-session rally in Asian stocks ran out of steam as weak U.S. retail sales fanned fears about the health of the world's biggest economy.
South Korean, Australian and New Zealand indexes were all in negative territory. Chinese shares were slightly higher while Japan's Nikkei (N225) ended a tad lower. That left MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) mostly unchanged.
Investor focus was shifting to the United Kingdom where Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party said it could not support the Brexit deal as it currently stands.
The report fueled doubts whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson can gain approval from his government and Britain's fractious parliament to exit the European Union with a deal in place.
Sterling fell 0.5% to $1.2762 on the news, drifting from a six-month top of $1.2877 touched on Wednesday.
""Trading the British pound intra-day at the moment is not for the faint-hearted, with deep pockets required,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA.
""The street clearly wants to take GBP higher on any Brexit hope, but traders should be aware that the pullback will be equally as ugly if progress stalls or collapses yet again.""

U.S. stock futures (ESc1) were a shade weaker.
Sentiment in the equities market turned dour on Wednesday after data showed U.S. retail sales contracted in September for the first time in seven months, in a potential sign that manufacturing-led weakness could be spreading to the broader economy.
Given U.S. consumption has been one of few remaining bright spots in the global economy, the data fanned worries the Sino-U.S. trade war would tip the world into recession.
""It looks like the trade war has claimed yet another victim, in addition to diminished business confidence and reduced investment spending, as consumers are starting to chicken out,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank.
TRADE WAR
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday that U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators were working on nailing down a Phase 1 trade deal text for their presidents to sign next month.
But he also said there were no plans for another high-level meeting on the trade deal outlined last week.
""While the U.S. suspended a hike in tariffs, it hasn't gone as far as scrapping the tariffs altogether, so it is hard to expect a quick pick-up in the economy,"" said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management.
In the currency market, the dollar index (=USD) was last at 98.075, bouncing off its lowest since Aug. 27 touched on Wednesday.
Against the yen, it was a flat at 108.72 after peaking at 108.90 on Tuesday.
The euro stood at $1.1071 (EUR=), near a one-month high of $1.1085 hit in U.S. trade on Wednesday.
In commodities, oil prices slipped after industry data showed a larger-than-expected build-up in U.S. crude stocks, adding to concerns that demand for oil around the world may weaken amid further signs of a global economic slowdown.

""We have concluded that, whilst they represent attractive markets, we are not the best owners of these businesses,"" outgoing Chief Executive Officer David Wild said.
The company, which is a franchise of U.S.-based Domino's Pizza Inc (N:DPZ), said third-quarter group system sales rose 3.4% to 313.5 million pounds ($400.15 million) on strong demand in the UK and Ireland.
The British company owns Domino's operations in Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, and is a minority shareholder in the Germany operations as well.
However, it reported a 2.7% dip in international system sales, which have taken a hit from macroeconomic events, including declining tourist numbers in Iceland.
Europe's economy has slowed this year as the U.S.-China trade tensions weakened global growth, and consumers and businesses in and around the United Kingdom worried about the impact of Brexit on jobs and incomes.
The company, which has 57 stores in Norway, said it had implemented a turnaround plan in the country during the quarter, but early signs have been mixed and improvement in sales were weaker than expected.

The decision to exit these markets comes a few months after the company announced the retirement of its CEO Wild, while in the midst of trying to resolve a profit sharing row with disgruntled franchisees in the UK and Ireland.

1696,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 02:26AM ET</span>",Plastic bottles vs. aluminum cans: who'll win the global water fight?,"By Eric Onstad
LONDON (Reuters) - Global bottled water giants are ramping up trials of easily recyclable aluminum cans to replace plastic that pollutes the world's seas. Sound like a slam-dunk for the environment? Not entirely.
Aluminum cans might indeed mean less ocean waste, but they come with their own eco-price: the production of each can pumps about twice as much carbon into the atmosphere as each plastic bottle.
French group  Danone  (PA:DANO) has become the latest company to make a move, telling Reuters it had started to replace some plastic bottles with aluminum cans for local water brands in Britain, Poland and Denmark.
The shift, previously unannounced, comes as multinational rivals like  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO), PepsiCo (O:PEP) and Nestle (S:NESN) are also launching some canned versions of water brands.
The beverage industry has been scrambling to react to public anger over scenes of huge piles of plastic waste contaminating oceans, pledging to step up recycling efforts.
However it's not black and white on the green front. By increasing recycling via cans, companies could fall back in efforts to reduce their carbon footprints, illustrating the tough juggling act they can face to keep environmentally conscious investors, campaigners and consumers on-side.
""That's the dilemma you're going to have to choose between,” said Ruben Griffioen, sustainability manager of packaging materials at Heineken, adding the company was trying to reduce both plastic waste and emissions.
Recycling plastic is more complex, leads to degradation and has lower reuse rates than aluminum - so the metal has been heralded as a greener alternative. Cans have on average 68% recycled content compared to just 3% for plastic in the United States, Environmental Protection Agency data shows.
New water brands are also making a splash.
""Mananalu will rid the world of plastic water containers and start a wave of change,"" says the website of the new canned water launched by Hollywood actor Jason Momoa, of Aquaman fame. Another entrant, Liquid Death, meanwhile, hails its ""eco-friendly cans"" and uses the hashtag #DeathtoPlastic.
""The aluminum industry can play on the fact that its product is infinitely recyclable, and they're right,"" said Martin Barrow, director of footprinting at UK-based non-profit consultancy the Carbon Trust.
""But primary aluminum uses huge amounts of electricity and it's also got some chemical releases of greenhouse gas emissions.""  
Comparing the carbon footprints of aluminum and plastics is a complex calculation because making the metal with hydro power instead of fossil fuels reduces emissions while using recycled aluminum slashes it even further.
But when all types of metal are averaged out, however, cans still account for about double the greenhouse gases of plastic bottles, Barrow said, citing figures for Europe.
At aluminum's most polluting level, a 330 ml can is responsible for 1,300 grams of carbon dioxide emissions, according to the analysis compiled for Reuters, roughly equating to the emissions produced by driving a car 7 to 8 km.
A plastic bottle of the same size, made from the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic typically used, accounts for up to 330 grams.
'NEVER THAT CLEAN'
Bruce Karas, an executive at Coca-Cola North America in change of environment and sustainability, acknowledged the conflicting environmental pressures at play.
""When we look at a different material, you look at all of the levers: the carbon footprint, consumer preference, energy, water,"" he said. ""There's a mix, there are some things that are not that desirable, but if you have five good things and one that isn't, we'll all have to make decisions.
""It'll never be that clean.""
So aluminum has a larger footprint in production because of the vast power needed in the smelting process. But, in a further example of the complexities of environmental impact, the overall carbon equation becomes more muddied when other issues such as logistics are taken into account.
""It's a complex picture, certainly,"" said Simon Lowden, an executive who leads Pepsi's plastics drive. ""You have to think about transport, secondary packaging, time in store, all those considerations come into play.""
Because aluminum is lightweight and cans make efficient use of space, less transport is usually needed than for plastics or glass, while less power is also needed to chill drinks in cans - particularly useful in tropical climes.
""That means in some markets aluminum would actually not produce as much greenhouse gas,"" Lowden said.

PLASTIC STRIKES BACK
But while cans could well carve out a niche within the $19 billion-a-year bottled water industry, they are unlikely to sweep the board anytime soon, if ever, industry experts say.
Simple economics is a major factor; aluminum is more expensive than plastic - the raw material cost for a can is about 25-30% higher than a PET bottle of a similar volume, according to analyst Uday Patel at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
A broad shift to aluminum cans would raise costs for drinks companies, also including new manufacturing infrastructure, some of which are likely to be passed on to consumers, thus hitting products' competitiveness against plastic rivals.
Another key factor is consumer convenience.
How often do people down bottles of water in one go? While advances are being made in can technology, most cans are opened and stay open, while bottles can be recapped.
Plastic water bottles can also be sold in a range of sizes, while cans are more limited.
As a result of such factors, drinks giants are cautious.
""It's not necessarily saying we're pulling the plug on plastic, it's really looking at how do consumers react to canned water,"" said Coca-Cola's Karas.
In an example of this toe-in-the-water approach, Coke is planning a limited launch of its top U.S. water brand Dasani in aluminum cans and aluminum resealable bottles later this year.
Even while companies are beginning to sell water in cans, to assuage pollution concerns, they are also embarking on a green makeover for plastic. Scientific efforts include creating new compounds that are biodegradable or more easily recyclable.
Danone told Reuters it was replacing some plastic with aluminum cans for its Flyte brand in Britain, Sparkles in Poland and Aqua d'or in Denmark.
But the company, which uses 400,000 tonnes of PET plastic bottles each year, is also focusing on increasing recycling of plastic and plans to use an average of 50% recycled material in its water bottles by 2025 and 100% for its Evian brand.
And while Pepsi is testing aluminum for its Aquafina water at food service outlets, it is also introducing a plastic bottle made of 100% recycled material for another brand, LIFEWTR.
""The consideration for aluminum is much higher on the list than it has been for the last few years (but) the hardest thing to change is infrastructure,"" said Pepsi's Lowden.
    ""Hence our need to drive hard the recyclability of plastic as well as look at our mix of cans and glass.""
CAN SHORTAGES
Another obstacle to a large-scale shift from plastic bottles is that there may not be enough cans to go round, at a time when some beers and wines are also switching from glass to cans.
The world's top can maker  Ball Corp  (N:BLL), which supplies the likes of Coke and Pepsi, is already scrambling to add capacity to meet demand.
""This is a level of growth that we haven't seen in a long time. We're looking at a number of speed-up projects, new can lines,"" said Kathleen Pitre, chief commercial and sustainability officer for Ball's global beverage packaging business.
Ball told investors it planned to add 4-5 billion additional cans of capacity by mid-2021 to its existing 105 billion, but this does not even include potential expansion in the water sector.
A shift of only 1% of global soft drinks, beer and bottled water from plastic and glass to cans, would mean a surge of 24 billion more cans, said the company, the third-biggest stock gainer among the S&P 500 index (SPX) over the past 12 months.
That 1% change would increase aluminum demand by around 310,000 tonnes, according to Patel at Wood Mackenzie and further shifts could counter wider market weakness.
Major aluminum producers  Alcoa  (N:AA) and Norsk Hydro (OL:NHY) have cut estimates of global demand growth for aluminum recently, partly due to trade tensions between the United States and top metals consumer China. 
""You're talking about billions and billions of water bottles, so there's a potential revival for the aluminum can market,"" said Patel. ""But it'll take three or four years to see if this is a real trend."""

The state-backed lender said it had committed 5.6 billion pounds of the fund so far.
Paul Thwaite, the commercial banking managing director at RBS unit NatWest, said: ""We are very much open for business and want to be the bank that supports the UK's businesses through this uncertain time.""
RBS has repeatedly increased the size of its so-called 'Growth Funding Initiative' - which is also designed to back high-growth small firms - in response to business demand."
1698,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 02:16AM ET</span>",Controversial Mexican oil union boss resigns amid graft charges,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The longtime head of Mexico's powerful oil workers union, Carlos Romero Deschamps resigned on Wednesday, a day after the president hinted he should step down to face allegations of wrongdoing.
The departure of Romero Deschamps could allow President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to take a firmer grip of the future of national oil company Pemex, the world's most indebted.
Lopez Obrador this week said Romero Deschamps was under investigation, and on Wednesday revealed the union boss could face prosecution over two complaints filed against him.
In a statement, Romero Deschamps defended his record as union boss, pointing to positive changes for workers that include improvements in pensions and healthcare as well as salary increases. 
But Romero Deschamps said he was resigning and that there was no longer ""the cooperation that must exist between workers and administration to promote projects that allow Pemex's true progress toward consolidation.""
Romero Deschamps was a federal lawmaker with the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which ruled Mexico for most of the past century, five times. He served three times in Mexico's lower house of Congress, and twice in the Senate. The posts gave him immunity from prosecution.
After assuming leadership of the oil workers union in 1993, he wielded considerable power, keenly aware that taxes levied on the giant company accounted for a large chunk of the federal government's annual budget.
In 2000, Romero Deschamps was accused of helping divert 1.5 billion pesos from Pemex accounts to the presidential campaign of the then PRI contender Francisco Labastida.
While a government audit later revealed anomalies covering 2.3 billion pesos in the so-called Pemexgate scandal, Romero Deschamps himself escaped unscathed. Others were not so lucky and were punished and fined.
Now Romero Deschamps and ""other people"" face two complaints for ""the crime of (financial) operations with funds of illegal origin,"" according to information provided by the financial intelligence unit of Mexico's finance ministry.
Earlier this year, sources said the attorney general's office had accused him and several relatives of illicit enrichment and money laundering.
Romero Deschamps has previously denied all charges.
Past media reports of the lavish lifestyle of him and his family, which included trips on private jets and the purchase of a yacht and luxury sports cars, despite his modest official salary, had stoked accusations of corruption.
In 2012, his daughter Paulina posted pictures of a trip to Europe on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, including images taken in private jets and five-star hotels along with her British bulldog traveling companions. 
The photos created a media storm in Mexico, and the Facebook page was taken down shortly afterwards.
Lopez Obrador on Tuesday suggested that the veteran union leader and politician might consider quitting to address the allegations.
Lopez Obrador, who was himself a PRI member until the late 1980s, won office by a landslide in 2018 after years of campaigning against corruption.
The veteran leftist has promised to boost the fortunes of Pemex, which has suffered more than a dozen years of declining oil output, at a time when the company's payroll continued to rise.
For decades Pemex has been dogged with accusations that it is a hotbed for graft and kickbacks. Most of Pemex's employees are members of the oil workers union.
Manuel Limon Hernandez, a close confidant of Romero Deschamps, was picked to succeed him, according to the media reports, which cited sources inside the union.

Limon Hernandez, who served as the union's treasurer for over a decade up until last year, is also a federal congressman with the PRI representing the oil-rich state of Veracruz.
