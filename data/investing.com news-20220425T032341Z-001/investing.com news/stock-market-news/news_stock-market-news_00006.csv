The deal will also add 11 percentage points to its Swiss Solvency Test ratio and reduce credit risk exposure significantly, Zurich said.
The transaction is expected to increase Zurich's liquidity by about $200 million, Zurich said, including a cash consideration of roughly $148 million.
A back book consists of old policies that remain on the books as premium-paying policies.
""The sale demonstrates our commitment to improve capital utilisation across our life back book,"" Zurich finance chief George Quinn said in a statement. 
""The transaction also reduces our exposure to interest rates and credit risks and allows us to focus on the parts of the Italian life and pensions market where we can best serve our customers.""

The deal does not change contractual obligations toward policyholders and distributors, said Zurich which will continue to be active in the Italian life insurance and pension market. 
The Swiss company agreed a deal with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to buy its financial adviser network in Italy last year.

(Reuters) - Over 4,000 flights were cancelled around the world on Sunday, more than half of them U.S. flights, adding to the toll of holiday week travel disruptions due to adverse weather and the surge in coronavirus cases caused by the Omicron variant.
The flights cancelled by 8 pm GMT on Sunday included over 2,400 entering, departing from or within the United States, according to tracking website FlightAware.com. Globally, more than 11,200 flights were delayed. 
Among the airlines with most cancellations were  SkyWest  (NASDAQ:SKYW) and SouthWest, with 510 and 419 cancellations respectively, FlightAware showed. 
The Christmas and New Year holidays are typically a peak time for air travel, but the rapid spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant has led to a sharp increase in COVID-19 infections, forcing airlines to cancel flights as pilots and cabin crew quarantine.
Transportation agencies across the United States were also suspending or reducing services due to coronavirus-related staff shortages.
Omicron has brought record case counts and dampened New Year festivities around much of the world. 
The rise in U.S. COVID cases had caused some companies to change plans to increase the number of employees working from their offices from Monday.
U.S. authorities registered at least 346,869 new coronavirus on Saturday, according to a Reuters tally. The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 rose by at least 377 to 828,562.

U.S. airline cabin crew, pilots and support staff were reluctant to work overtime during the holidays, despite offers of hefty financial incentives. Many feared contracting COVID-19 and did not welcome the prospect of dealing with unruly passengers, some airline unions said.
In the months preceding the holidays, airlines were wooing employees to ensure solid staffing, after furloughing or laying off thousands over the last 18 months as the pandemic hobbled the industry.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's Airport Authority is aiming to raise up to $4 billion in a multi-tranche dollar bond offering, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity as the information has not yet been made public.
The authority has mandated 22 banks to work on the deal, a term sheet seen by Reuters on Monday showed.
Hong Kong's airport authority, which operates the city's main airport, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Raising up to $4 billion will be a major test of investor sentiment towards the airport which has been hit by an increasing number of flight bans ordered by the Hong Kong government as part of its pandemic restrictions.
Calls with Asian, European and U.S investors to judge demand for a deal will start Tuesday, according to the term sheet.
One of the proposed tranches will be a 5-year green bond, the term sheet said, which will be issued under the authority's recently established Sustainable Finance Framework.

The authority last year reported a HK$4.4 billion ($564.21 million) loss for the 2020-2021 financial year ended March, the most recent publicly available numbers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Twitter Inc on Sunday said it permanently banned the personal account of Republican U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene for tweets that repeatedly violated the social media's misinformation policy on COVID-19.
The congresswoman from Georgia is the first member of Congress to ever have a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account permanently banned. 
Twitter has previously issued https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-temporarily-blocks-us-republican-greene-covid-19-posts-2021-07-20 a short-term suspension for Greene's account, @mtgreenee, for tweets about COVID that it called ""misleading"". At least two other Republican members of the House have received temporary suspensions on Twitter -- Jim Banks and Barry Moore.
""Twitter is an enemy to America and can't handle the truth,"" Greene said in a statement on messaging app Telegram, adding that social media platforms ""can't stop the truth from being spread far and wide. Big Tech can’t stop the truth. Communist Democrats can't stop the truth.""
The official account of the congresswoman, @ReptMTG, remains active on Twitter and has 390,000 followers, slightly less than the 465,000 on her banned personal account.
Greene has come under fire before for remarks on the pandemic. Last June she apologized https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-congresswoman-marjorie-taylor-greene-apologizes-comparing-covid-19-masks-2021-06-14 after comparing COVID-19 mask requirements and vaccinations to the Holocaust that killed 6 million Jews.

Last January, Twitter temporarily locked Greene's account after she sparred with a state election official over voter fraud allegations.

Investing.com – China Evergrande Group’s Hong Kong shares will be suspended from trading from Jan. 3, 2022, onwards.
Shares in the developer’s EV unit, China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group, were up 3.69% to HK$3.650 ($0.468), after plunging as much as 10% earlier in the session.
Debt-embroiled China Evergrande did not provide the reason for the suspension. However, China Evergrande chairman Hui Ka Yan remained positive in his New Year’s speech to the company’s employees on Jan. 1. In the speech, Hui said that the resumption rate of the company’s national projects reached 91.7%, with 89,000 people resuming work and that the company delivered more than 53,000 houses in the fourth quarter of 2021.
The developer also adjusted its payment plans on billions of dollars of overdue wealth management products due to its ongoing liquidity crunch. It still has more than $300 billion in liabilities, nearly $20 billion of which is in international market bonds deemed to be in cross-default by two rating firms in December after China Evergrande missed new coupon payments worth $255 million. The two payments still have a 30-day grace period, however.
Meanwhile, Chinese developer Cifi Holdings offered to buy the outstanding notes of China Evergrande at $1,000.5 for 1,000 in principal amount with accrued and unpaid interest, it said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange. The offer will expire at 4 PM London time on 7 January 2022."

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Monday morning, with trade razor thin on the first trading day of 2022 for some markets.
South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.37% by 9:58 PM ET (2:58 AM GMT). Data released earlier in the day showed that the Nikkei manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) for December was 51.9, higher than the previous month’s 50.9.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.28%, while Chinese, Australian, and Japanese markets were closed for a holiday. There will be no cash trading of U.S. Treasuries in Asia on Monday.
Trader “sentiments may attempt to ride on the Santa Claus rally to deliver a positive start for the first trading day in 2022,” said Jun Rong Yeap, market strategist at IG Asia.
“While the rising omicron COVID spreads may warrant a cautious approach toward reopening, some expectations may be that improved vaccinations will aid to limit the eventual economic impact.”
Omicron-fueled outbreaks continue in countries from China to the U.S., with the global number of cases topping 290 million as of Jan. 3, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Investors’ focus was on China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333), whose Hong Kong shares were suspended from trading earlier in the day. The debt-ridden property developer did not provide a reason for the suspension.
However, fellow Chinese property developer Cifi Holdings has offered to buy China Evergrande’s outstanding 5.5% bond due in 2022. The offer was $1,000.5 for each $1,000 in principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, according to Cifi Holdings’ statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution has opened the books to investors to raise up to $10.8 billion in the country's largest initial public offering (IPO), according to a term sheet seen by Reuters.
The shares will be sold in a price range of 257,000 won to 300,000 won ($216.19-$252.36) apiece to raise between $9.2 billion and $10.8 billion, the term sheet showed.
The IPO will beat the previous South Korean record held by Samsung (KS:005930) Life Insurance's 4.9 trillion won ($4.12 billion) offering in 2010.
LG Energy Solution (LGES) will be valued at $51 billion to $59 billion. 
The company said on Monday it was continuing to ""execute remaining processes to launch a successful IPO"".
Cash raised will be mostly used to expand the company's current production facilities and debt repayment, according to the term sheet. 
LGES is LG Chem Ltd's wholly owned battery subsidiary and supplies Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, General Motor Co and Hyundai Motor Co , among others. 
The company will sell 34 million primary shares and its parent company will sell 8.5 million secondary shares in the IPO.
Demand from investors is expected to be high with the pricing, due to be finalised on Jan. 14, already likely to be at the top of the range, according to sources Reuters spoke to last month.
LGES will start trading on the KOSPI on Jan. 27.
Institutional shareholders will be allotted 55% to 75% of the shares on offer, depending on the retail subscription and employee share ownership plans take up rates, the term sheet said.
RED HOT
The IPO extends the red hot run of Korea's deals market over the past year.
There was $17.7 billion raised in 2021 IPOs, easily eclipsing the previous record of $7.6 billion in 2020.
A roadshow between management and investors will start Monday and run until Jan. 11, the day before books close, the term sheet showed.
Investor appetite to buy stock is expected to be closely tied to the booming demand for electric vehicles in major markets around the world.

Global EV sales, estimated at 2.5 million vehicles in 2020, are forecast to grow more than 12-fold to 31.1 million by 2030 and account for nearly a third of new vehicle sales, according to consulting firm Deloitte.

9,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2022 06:51PM ET</span>",Fauci warns of danger of hospitalization surge due to large number of COVID cases,"By Kanishka Singh
(Reuters) -Top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said there was still a danger of a surge in hospitalization due to a large number of coronavirus cases even as early data suggests the Omicron COVID-19 variant is less severe.
""The only difficulty is that if you have so many cases, even if the rate of hospitalization is lower with Omicron than it is with Delta, there is still the danger that you will have a surging of hospitalizations that might stress the healthcare system,"" Fauci said in an interview on Sunday with CNN.
The Omicron variant was estimated to be 58.6% of the coronavirus variants circulating in the United States as of Dec. 25, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The sudden arrival of Omicron has brought record-setting case counts to countries around the world and dampened New Year festivities around the world..
""There will certainly be a lot more cases because this is a much more transmissible virus than Delta is,"" Fauci said on CNN.
However, ""It looks, in fact, that it (Omicron) might be less severe, at least from data that we've gathered from South Africa, from the UK and even some from preliminary data from here in the United States,"" Fauci said.
Fauci added that the CDC will soon be coming out with a clarification on whether people with COVID-19 should test negative to leave isolation, after confusion last week over guidance that would let people leave after five days without symptoms.
The CDC had reduced the recommended isolation period for people with asymptomatic COVID to five days, down from 10. The policy does not require testing to confirm that a person is no longer infectious before they go back to work or socialize, causing some experts to raise questions.

""You're right. There has been some concern about why we don't ask people at that five-day period to get tested. That is something that is now under consideration"", Fauci told ABC News in a separate interview on Sunday. ""I think we're going to be hearing more about that in the next day or so from the CDC.""
U.S. authorities registered at least 346,869 new coronavirus on Saturday, according to a Reuters tally. The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 rose by at least 377 to 828,562.

10,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2022 06:30PM ET</span>","AT&T, Verizon CEOs reject U.S. request for 5G deployment delay","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The chief executives of AT&T (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) rejected a request to delay the planned Jan. 5 introduction of new 5G wireless service over aviation safety concerns but offered to temporarily adopt new safeguards.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Federal Aviation Administration chief Steve Dickson had asked AT&T CEO John Stankey and Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg late Friday for a commercial deployment delay of no more than two weeks.
The wireless companies in a joint letter on Sunday said they would not deploy 5G around airports for six months but rejected any broader limitation on using C-Band spectrum. They said the Transportation Department proposal would be ""an irresponsible abdication of the operating control required to deploy world-class and globally competitive communications networks.""
The aviation industry and FAA have raised concerns about potential interference of 5G with sensitive aircraft electronics like radio altimeters that could disrupt flights.
The exclusion zone AT&T and Verizon propose is currently in use in France, the carriers said, ""with slight adaption"" reflecting ""modest technical differences in how C-band is being deployed.""
""The laws of physics are the same in the United States and France,"" the CEOs wrote. ""If U.S. airlines are permitted to operate flights every day in France, then the same operating conditions should allow them to do so in the United States.""
The FAA said in a statement on Sunday that it was ""reviewing the latest letter from the wireless companies on how to mitigate interference from 5G C-band transmissions. U.S. aviation safety standards will guide our next actions.""
FAA officials said France uses spectrum for 5G that sits further away from spectrum used for radio altimeters and uses lower power levels for 5G than those authorized in the United States.
Verizon said it will initially only use spectrum in the same range as used in France, adding it will be a couple of years before it uses additional spectrum. The larger U.S. exclusion zone around U.S. airports is ""to make up for the slight difference in power levels between the two nations,"" Verizon added. 
Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA), representing 50,000 workers at 17 airlines, on Sunday wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that pilots, airlines, manufacturers and others ""have NO incentive to delay 5G, other than SAFETY. What do they think … we’re raising these issues over the holidays for, kicks?""
The Air Line Pilots Association also backed the delay.
Government and industry officials said the exclusion zones proposed by the wireless carriers is not as large as what has been sought by the FAA.
The FAA and Buttigieg on Friday proposed identifying priority airports ""where a buffer zone would permit aviation operations to continue safely while the FAA completes its assessments of the interference potential.""
The wireless carriers, which won the C-Band spectrum in an $80 billion government auction, previously agreed to precautionary measures for six months to limit interference but say the upgrades are essential to compete with other countries like China and to enable remote working.
Trade group Airlines for America, representing American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and other carriers, on Thursday asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to halt deployment around many airports, warning thousands of flights could be disrupted daily.
The airline group has said it may go to court Monday if the FCC does not act. The group urged the FCC and the telecom industry to work with the FAA and the aviation industry to ""enable the rollout of 5G technology while prioritizing safety and avoiding any disruption to the aviation system.""

An FCC spokesperson said Sunday the agency is ""optimistic that by working together we can both advance the wireless economy and ensure aviation safety.""
Wireless industry group CTIA said 5G is safe and spectrum is being used in about 40 other countries.

Three unions representing paper workers, managerial staff and electricians had previously warned they would strike if a new agreement about wages and working conditions was not reached before the previous agreement ended on Dec. 31.
UPM quit collective bargaining a year ago together with other forestry employers, saying the industry wants to improve profitability by seeking alternative ways to agree on wages and working conditions.
While workers have demanded UPM signs a company-wide labour agreement, the company has pushed for business-specific agreements and signed them with its plywood and timber divisions.
Workers in UPM's pulp, paper and biofuels businesses have said UPM wants to dictate new conditions instead of negotiating, the three trade unions have stated.
The strike will end on Jan. 22 unless an agreement is reached before that, the trade unions previously said in separate statements. 
Inderes analyst Antti Viljakainen earlier told Reuters UPM could expect the cost to be at least twice as big as the 30 million euros ($34 million) caused by a previous strike in 2020.

The government decided to speed up the phasing out of nuclear power following Japan's Fukushima reactor meltdown in 2011 when an earthquake and tsunami destroyed the coastal plant in the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.
The reactors of Brokdorf, Grohnde and Gundremmingen C, run by utilities E.ON and RWE, shut down late on Friday after three and half decades in operation.
The last three nuclear power plants - Isar 2, Emsland and Neckarwestheim II - will be turned off by the end of 2022.
Preussen Elektra, which runs the Brokdorf and Grohnde plants, said in a statement on Saturday the two had been shut down shortly before midnight on Friday. RWE said the Gundremmingen C plant also stopped generation on Friday evening.
PreussenElektra CEO Guido Knott thanked staff for their commitment to safety: ""We have made a decisive contribution to the secure, climate-friendly and reliable supply of electricity in Germany for decades.""
The phase-out of an energy deemed clean and cheap by some is an irreversible step for Europe's biggest economy even as it faces ambitious climate targets and rising power prices.
The six nuclear power plants contributed to around 12% of electricity production in Germany in 2021, preliminary figures showed. The share of renewable energy was almost 41%, with coal generating just under 28% and gas around 15%. 
Germany aims to make renewables meet 80% of power demand by 2030 by expanding wind and solar power infrastructure. 

Japan's government on Tuesday mapped out a plan for releasing contaminated water from the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant into the sea, angering neighbouring China and South Korea.

The aviation industry and FAA have raised concerns about potential interference of 5G with sensitive aircraft electronics like radio altimeters that could disrupt flights.
""We ask that your companies continue to pause introducing commercial C-Band service for an additional short period of no more than two weeks beyond the currently scheduled deployment date of January 5,"" the letter says.
Verizon and AT&T both said they received the letter and were reviewing it. Earlier Friday the two companies accused the aerospace industry of seeking to hold C-Band spectrum deployment ""hostage until the wireless industry agrees to cover the costs of upgrading any obsolete altimeters.""
Buttigieg and Dickson said under the framework ""commercial C-band service would begin as planned in January with certain exceptions around priority airports.""
The FAA and the aviation industry would identify priority airports ""where a buffer zone would permit aviation operations to continue safely while the FAA completes its assessments of the interference potential.""
The government would work to identify ""mitigations for all priority airports"" to enable most ""large commercial aircraft to operate safely in all conditions."" That would allow deployment around ""priority airports on a rolling basis"" -- aiming to ensure activation by March 31 barring unforeseen issues.
The carriers, which won the spectrum in an $80 billion government auction, previously agreed to precautionary measures for six months to limit interference.
On Thursday, trade group Airlines for America asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to halt deployment of new 5G wireless service around many airports, warning thousands of flights could be disrupted: ""The potential damage to the airline industry alone is staggering.""
Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, representing 50,000 flight attendants at 17 airlines, called the Transportation Department proposal ""the right move to successfully implement 5G without using the traveling public (and the crews on their flights) as guinea pigs for two systems that need to coexist without questions for safety.""

Wireless industry group CTIA said 5G is safe and spectrum is being used in about 40 other countries.
House Transportation Committee chair Peter DeFazio Friday backed the airline group petition warning ""we can’t afford to experiment with aviation safety.""

18,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2021 11:30PM ET</span>",Japan to help build Bill Gates' high-tech nuclear reactor in Wyoming -Yomiuri,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd are set to cooperate with the United States and Bill Gates' venture company to build a high-tech nuclear reactor in Wyoming, the daily Yomiuri reported on Saturday.
The parties will sign an agreement as early as January for JAEA and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to provide technical support and data from Japan's own advanced reactors, the report said citing multiple unidentified sources.
TerraPower, an advanced nuclear power venture founded by Gates, is set to open its Natrium plant in Wyoming in 2028. The U.S. government will provide funding to cover half of the $4 billion project.
Terrapower had initially explored the prospect of building an experimental nuclear plant with state-owned China National Nuclear Corp, until it was forced to seek new partners after the administration of Donald Trump restricted nuclear deals with China.
The United States has been competing with China and Russia which also hope to build and export advanced reactors.
Japan, on the other hand, has a bitter history of decommissioning its Monju prototype advanced reactor in 2016, a project which cost $8.5 billion but provided little results and years of controversy.

The Monju facility saw accidents, regulatory breaches, and cover-ups since its conception, and was closed following public distrust of nuclear energy after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.
Both JAEA and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries could not be reached for comment, as their offices were closed for the New Year holidays.

19,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2021 08:55PM ET</span>","United, Spirit offer higher pay to on board staff during January","By Abhijith Ganapavaram
(Reuters) - United Airlines and  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) Inc are bumping up pay for on board staff as they scramble to keep schedules intact after U.S. airlines were hammered by a week of mass cancellations.
While Spirit's flight attendants are receiving double pay on any work through Jan. 4, according to their union, United is offering triple time for pilots who pick up extra trips during January, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. 
The holiday season has been marred by delayed or canceled flights, causing chaos at most U.S. airports as sick staff and fear of contracting COVID-19 grow. Coupled with the prospect of dealing with unruly passengers, many pilots and cabin crew are even forgoing overtime incentives.
That hesitancy, combined with bad weather and tight staffing, has led to over 8,000 flight cancellations over the past eight days, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. 
""All flight attendants, regardless of how you have obtained your pairing, will be receiving 200% pay for any pairing that touches Dec. 28 through Jan. 4,"" the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA said in a statement. The union represents about 4,000 flight attendants at Spirit Airlines, according to the carrier's latest annual filing.
Earlier this year, Florida-based Spirit Airlines was forced to cancel nearly 3,000 flights due to bad weather and staffing shortages.
JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp said in a customer note on Thursday that 75% of its crew is based in the U.S. Northeast, a region that has been hit hard by COVID-19 infections. The carrier has already cut its schedule through Jan. 13 by about 1,280 flights.
 Alaska Air  (NYSE:ALK) Group Inc said while the pandemic had hit its operations, the vast majority of cancellations and delays were due to bad weather.
The airline last week agreed to offer some benefits such as instituting pay protections in case of any reassignments on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and New Year's Day, the AFA said.
Hawaiian Airlines said it had not offered new incentives to its crew for working during the holiday period.

 SkyWest  (NASDAQ:SKYW) Airlines said its operations continued to be hit due to weather and the Omicron variant, which is spreading rapidly and causing record-breaking cases across the United States.
CNBC first reported United's pay plans.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street closed near record highs in light trading on Friday, the last trading day of 2021, marking the second year of recovery from a global pandemic.
All three major U.S. stock indexes scored monthly, quarterly and annual gains, notching their biggest three-year advance since 1999. 
The S&P 500 gained 27% since the last trading day of 2020. Through Thursday, the benchmark index has registered 70 record-high closes, or the second-most ever. Using Refinitiv data back to 1928, the most record-high closes for the S&P 500 in a single year was 77 in 1995. 
The Dow added 18.73% for the year, and the Nasdaq gained 21.4%. 
Companies, consumers and the broader economy largely thrived in 2021 as they felt their way forward amid a constantly shifting landscape including a tumultuous transfer of power marked by the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Other factors included the ""meme stock"" phenomenon, new COVID-19 variants, a labor shortage, generous fiscal/monetary stimulus, hobbled supply chains, booming demand and the resulting price spikes. 
""What stands out to us this year among all the negatives, is the resiliency of Corporate America,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""In a sea of uncertainty and higher prices, you have to be extremely impressed by how agile and adaptive Corporate America was to sport 45% earnings growth in a very difficult year.""
Indeed, earnings results from S&P 500 companies blew past analyst estimates to deliver year-on-year growth in the first three quarters of the year of 52.8%, 96.3% and 42.6%, respectively, according to Refinitiv, which currently sees fourth-quarter annual earnings growth of 22.3%.
Energy (SPNY), real estate <.SPLRCR> and microchips (SOX), sectors associated with economic recovery and booming demand, were among 2021's top performers, with growth stocks' (IGX) 31% advance handily outperforming the 22% gain in value (IVX) stocks.
Market-leading tech and tech-adjacent megacap stocks, which outperformed the broader market in the first year of the global health crisis, were laggards as the economy slowly reopened and vaccines were deployed.
The NYSE FANG+ index (NYFANG), an equal-weighted group of 10 such stocks, notched a nearly 20% advance on the year. Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) posted the biggest annual advance among NYSE FANG+ constituents, enjoying its best year since 2009. [nL4N2TG1PT]
Dow Transports (DJT), considered by many a barometer of economic health, registered a yearly gain of more than 31%.
Steadily rising Treasury yields - along with a recent hawkish shift from the Federal Reserve, which now foresees as many as three rate hikes in the coming year - have supported interest rate-sensitive financials (SPSY) which gained nearly 33%.
The COVID-19 pandemic, which burst onto the scene in early 2020 and prompted the steepest, quickest economic contraction in history, continues to linger, pressuring travel-related stocks.
The S&P 1500 Airlines index <.SPCOMAIR> ended 2021 as one of the year's few losing sectors with an annual decline of nearly 2%.
But early data suggests https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/hospitalisation-risk-omicron-around-one-third-delta-uk-analysis-shows-2021-12-31 the Omicron variant, which has caused an abrupt spike in global infections, is less virulent than its predecessors and economic data is increasingly suggesting a return to normal, two years after the first cases of COVID-19 were reported. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 59.78 points, or 0.16%, to 36,338.3, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 12.55 points, or 0.26%, to 4,766.18 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 96.59 points, or 0.61%, to 15,644.97.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.6 billion shares, compared with the 10.55 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, consumer staples sector (SPLRCS) was up the most in Friday's session, with communications services (SPLRCL) suffering the biggest percentage drop.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.39-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.18-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 47 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 58 new highs and 143 new lows.

(Reuters) - Thousands of flights within the United States and internationally were delayed or canceled on Friday, adding to the travel disruptions during the holiday week due to adverse weather and rising cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant.
Over 3,090 flights were canceled globally as of early Friday evening, including nearly 1,550 flights within the United States or entering or departing it, according to a running tally on flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. There were over 8,650 global flight delays in total.
The Christmas holidays are typically a peak time for air travel, but the rapid spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant has led to a sharp increase in COVID-19 infections, forcing airlines to cancel flights as pilots and crew quarantine.
The sudden arrival of Omicron has brought record-setting case counts to countries around the world. Transportation agencies across the United States are suspending or reducing service due to COVID-19 staff shortages as the Omicron variant surges nationwide.
The number of new COVID-19 cases in the United States has doubled in eight days to a record high of 329,000 a day on average, according to a Reuters tally. Over that same period, the number of hospitalized COVID patients rose 32% and hit a record high in Maryland, Ohio and Washington, D.C. 
On Thursday alone, 23 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. set pandemic records for new cases, according to the Reuters tally.
The state of New York reported over 74,000 COVID-19 cases on Thursday from more than 336,000 tests at a 22% positivity rate, Governor Kathy Hochul said. 
New York said last week it will sharply limit the number of people it allows in Times Square for its New Year's celebration, which culminates with the dropping of a giant crystal ball at midnight, signaling the start of the new year. 
""We reduced the density of the crowd. This is a safer way to proceed,"" Tom Harris, the president of Times Square Alliance, told CNN on Friday. New York City Mayor-elect Eric Adams will be sworn in after the ball drop.
Some critics, however, have raised concerns over the celebrations https://www.reuters.com/world/gloomy-new-year-many-covid-19-crashes-party-again-2021-12-31 going ahead at all, given the high positivity rate.
The rise in U.S. COVID-19 cases has caused some companies to change course from earlier plans to increase the number of employees working from their offices starting next week.  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) was to start a full return to office from Jan. 3 but told employees this week it was postponing the plans to an unspecified date. 

U.S. airline cabin crew, pilots and support staff are reluctant to work overtime https://www.reuters.com/world/us/omicron-unruly-passengers-deter-us-airline-staff-holiday-overtime-2021-12-30 during the holiday travel season despite offers of hefty financial incentives. Many workers fear contracting COVID-19 and do not welcome the prospect of dealing with unruly passengers, some airline unions have said.
In the months preceding the holidays, airlines were wooing employees to ensure solid staffing, after furloughing or laying off thousands over the last 18 months as the pandemic crippled the industry.

22,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2021 05:45PM ET</span>",Trump-appointed McWilliams resigns as U.S. FDIC chair after power struggle,"By Katanga Johnson and Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Republican chair of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) said on Friday she will step down from her role effective Feb. 4, 2022, removing a key remaining obstacle to President Joe Biden's ambitious banking reform agenda.
Jelena McWilliams, a holdover from the Trump administration who was appointed to the role in June 2018, had previously said she intended to serve out her full term, which was set to expire in mid-2023.
However, McWilliams is now outnumbered on the FDIC's board - which must vote on key rule-makings - by Democrats, sparking a messy public fight https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-fdic-chair-mcwilliams-says-vote-initiated-by-majority-democratic-members-out-2021-12-14 in recent weeks over who should set the agency's agenda.
The five-member FDIC board currently has three members appointed by Democrats: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Rohit Chopra, FDIC board member Martin Gruenberg, and acting head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Michael Hsu. McWilliams is the lone Republican, with one other position vacant. 
Gruenberg, who previously ran the agency under President Barack Obama, will serve as interim director. 
McWilliams' unexpected resignation will hand full control of the agency to Democrats, speeding up Biden's banking reform agenda which in many instances must be jointly agreed by all three federal banking regulators - the FDIC, the OCC and the Federal Reserve.
Democrats are eager to take a tougher stance on banks, reverse breaks dished out by former President Donald Trump's regulators, boost competition, and tackle thorny issues including community lending rules, climate change and cryptocurrencies.
All this should be easier with McWilliams out the way, analysts have said. Earlier this month she tried to block efforts by the board's Democratic members to solicit public feedback on changes to bank merger rules, which Democrats want to toughen up.
""Chair McWilliams started a political fight she couldn't win,"" Dennis Kelleher, president of the Washington-based advocacy group Better Markets, wrote in a tweet on Friday. 
McWilliams did not say why she was resigning and could not immediately be reached for comment on the public holiday.
""Throughout my tenure, the agency has focused on maintaining and instilling confidence in our banking system while at the same time promoting innovation, strengthening financial inclusion, improving transparency, and supporting community banks and minority depository institutions,"" she said in a statement.

Analysts have previously suggested Gruenberg could be renominated to run the agency for another five-year term.
Other names floated https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-wallstreet-regulators-factb-idUKKBN28716L by analysts and Washington insiders to replace McWilliams include Mehrsa Baradaran, a law professor, and Michael Barr, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and former Obama administration Treasury official, both of whom had previously been seen as possibilities for the Comptroller role.

The S&P 500 finished up .9% for the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 1.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite bucked the trend, dropping  -.1% for the week.

Covid cases continue to set all-time highs, and with New Year celebrations in the offing, many officials are bracing for another jump from here. At the same time, the U.K. approved the use of Pavloxid,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s antiviral pill for Covid-19 treatment, for adults, and South Africa took off their curfew requirements.

Investing.com - While the major U.S. indices will end the year with over 20% gains across the board, marking the third consecutive strong year of U.S. market performance, underneath the surface there were some interesting trends. The Nasdaq 100 winners and losers for 2021 highlight the way some companies built on 2020's paradigm shift, while others snapped back to reality.
The top performer on the Nasdaq 100 in 2021 was Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID), which gained nearly 300% on the year. The electric vehicle technology company typifies several of 2021's trends - SPACs, as it came public via Churchill Capital Corp IV, electric vehicle associated companies doing well, and retail enthusiasm for more speculative companies. The company has a $59B enterprise value and is, if not totally pre-revenue, at least pre-gross profit, showing investor enthusiasm for these sorts of companies. Rivian Automotive's IPO late in 2021 also highlighted this enthusiasm.
  Moderna   (NASDAQ:MRNA) had a more obvious business model and track record to drive its success in 2021, as the vaccine maker became a household name for its first approved mRNA vaccine, which has been one of the key vaccines in the Covid-19 vaccination drive. The stock is poised to finish up 145% for the year.
  Fortinet   (NASDAQ:FTNT) highlights the growth of software and cybersecurity specifically, and the company finished 144% higher this year after a 39% gain last year, an impressive acceleration. Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) is a software as a service company selling monitoring software, and they also built on a boffo 2020 - up 160% last year - to gain another 82% in 2021, putting it 6th on this list.   Intuit   (NASDAQ:INTU) is an older line software company but continued to grow revenues in its small business lines, and is set to finish up 69% for the year.
The semiconductor value chain describes most of the remaining winners in the Nasdaq 100. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) ascended to be the most valuable semiconductor company in the world, as excitement around its graphic processing units dominance and the need for computing power pushed it 126% higher. Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) shares rose 85% on the back of a pair of data center and network solutions related acquisitions and continued growth. Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ:AMAT) and KLA-Tencor Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) are both semiconductor equipment makers, meaning semiconductor companies trying to solve shortage issues ordered more of their equipment; AMAT was set to close up 83% for the year while KLAC came in 10th in this list with a 66% gain.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) took 9th on this list, rising 66%, a formidable feat given that Alphabet is also the 3rd largest company in the U.S. market by market cap. 45% revenue growth at that scale, and with Google's profitability, is extraordinary, and so far anti-trust concerns have yet to really slow it down.
On the losers side of the ledger, we see a lot of names that would have been on the winner side a year ago.
Start with Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON), the exercise equipment maker that sold a must-have product during a time of social distancing, but is faced with people wanting to return to gyms and an unclear outlook for how many people are left who haven't bought a Peloton bike or signed up for a subscription. Shares dropped 76% over the year, and the back half of the year especially felt like one stumble after another for the company.
  Zoom Video Communications   (NASDAQ:ZM) had fewer visible stumbles - an aborted acquisition of Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) was probably the closest thing - as they met guidance and showed prodigious profitability. But with the same questions over growth and who might be left to sign up for Zoom, and with Zoom fatigue as a cultural meme, it didn't matter, and shares dropped 45% on the year, the 3rd biggest drop on the year. DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) was somewhere in between these two companies, as another pandemic must-have that has struggled to find out what the new normal could be. DocuSign did have to lower guidance, like Peloton, but it is getting a little bit more of a benefit of the doubt in its valuation and performance, dropping only 31%.
Rounding out software companies who had tough 2021s is Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), with a 32% drop, though in Splunk's case there was more self-inflicted or necessary pain as the company transitioned to a cloud-based model and said goodbye to its CEO. It may have struggled in competing with DataDog as well, a reminder of the increasing competition in SaaS.
China companies also struggled in 2021 amidst a bevy of new regulations, capital outflows, and concerns over whether investors will see returns on these companies in the current political environment.   Pinduoduo   (NASDAQ:PDD) did the worst of the bunch on the Nasdaq, dropping 67%, while Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) dropped 31%, and e-commerce retailer JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) dropped ""only"" 20%.
Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) struggled for a variety of reasons in 2021, many self-inflicted as the company had delays in releasing new game titles and had both senior management sexual misconduct allegations to address as well as allegations that management ignored the allegations. The gamemaker's shares dropped 28% on the year.
  MercadoLibre   (NASDAQ:MELI) also falls in the bucket of 2020 winners who underwent some market (in)digestion in 2021, as the Latin American e-commerce retailer dropped 20%. PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) may fall into this bucket as well, down 20% after more than doubling in 2020, though a number of fintech upstarts has pressured incumbents, and PayPal may be old enough to qualify as one.

29,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 31, 2021 02:00PM ET</span>",Fed Repo Facility Use Jumps to Record High on Final Day of 2021,"(Bloomberg) -- The amount of money that investors are parking at a major Federal Reserve facility climbed to yet another all-time high on the final trading day of the year as funds sought out places to stash short-term cash. 
More than 100 participants on Friday put a total of $1.905 trillion at the Fed’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility, in which counterparties like money-market funds can place cash with the central bank. The previous record, set on Dec. 20, was $1.758 trillion. Friday’s $208 billion leap was the biggest one-day increase in usage since June 17 after the central bank increased the offering yield to 0.05%. That compares to the last trading day of 2020 when a mere 15 counterparties tapped the facility for $9.65 billion. 
The current glut of cash in money markets -- and the resulting record use of the RRP facility -- stands in contrast to what has taken place in many years gone by. The final business day of each year has often proved to be a pressure point for funding markets, with borrowers clamoring for investors’ spare dollars and causing spikes in key lending rates. But the landscape has changed.
Usage of the facility has exploded this year as investors need somewhere to park their short-term cash, and there is an imbalance in Treasury-bill markets that’s been fueled in large part by a drawdown of the U.S. government cash balance and Fed asset purchases. Demand for the facility has also tended to surge at the end of each quarter as dealers curtail their activity in the market for repurchase agreements in order to shore up their balance sheets for regulatory purposes. 
That said, even without quarter-end factors in play, demand has regularly exceed $1 trillion since August and strategists think the robust appetite for using the facility is unlikely to abate until the central bank halts its asset-purchase program. The Fed earlier this month said it will double the pace at which it’s scaling back purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to $30 billion a month, putting it on track to conclude the program in early 2022, rather than mid-year as initially planned.

31,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 31, 2021 11:34AM ET</span>","After a Lost Year, Where will Hong Kong Stocks Go in 2022?","By Kay Li
Investing.com - It is not an overstatement to say that 2021 was a ""lost year"" for the Hong Kong stock market, especially for the technology and internet sector, which dragged the Hang Seng Index down 14.1% and the Hang Seng Technology Index down 34.8%, among the worst performing global indices.
Looking back at the trend of Hong Kong stocks in the past year, there has been a lot of pressure from various aspects.
First of all, the lack of foreign capital inflows has been a problem for the market's incremental capital. At the height of the pandemic, the world's central banks turned on their money printing machines, with the massive amount of money driving the global stock market upward.
Unlike European and U.S. stock markets, however, Hong Kong stocks do not have access to increased capital through monetary policy and quantitative easing that European and U.S. stock markets have.
On the contrary, Hong Kong's market relies heavily on the inflow of foreign capital, which was lukewarm in 2021. Although there was a great deal of southbound capital from China to support the market at the beginning of the year, significant outflows came in June and July: the net outflow of capital to Hong Kong to China was as high as HK$63.5 billion in July, the largest outflow in a single month since the establishment of the interoperability mechanism.
At the same time, foreign capital also did not stay idle, with outflows reaching HK$20.2 billion in a single month in July. And last month, Bloomberg data showed that foreign capital continued to flow out of the Hong Kong stock market, with a net outflow of over HK$35 billion in a single month, and a small outflow of HK$2.8 billion in funds to China, both of which mainly reflected selling Internet giants in Hong Kong stocks.
On the other hand, China's education policy, national data security and anti-trust mechanism and other new regulations also put pressure on the market. For example, on March 12, 2021, the official website of the State Administration of Market Supervision (SAMS) issued a news release against 12 Chinese Internet technology companies, including Tencent Holdings Ltd ADR (OTC:TCEHY) (HK:0700),  Baidu  Inc (HK:9888) (NASDAQ:BIDU), Meituan (HK:3690), Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd (SZ:002024),  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (HK:9988) (NYSE:BABA), JD Com (HK:9618) (NASDAQ:JD), Bytedance, and Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI) for their monopolistic practices, imposing maximum penalties on related parties controlled by them.
Shortly thereafter, in July 2021, the ""Opinions on Further Reducing the Burden of Assignment and Off-Campus Training for Students in Compulsory Education"" (the ""Double Reduction"" policy) was published, followed by a sharp drop in education stocks on the Hong Kong stock market: New Oriental Education & Technology (NYSE:EDU) fell 54.2%, TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL) fell 70.8%, and Gaotu Techedu Inc DRC (NYSE:GOTU) fell 63.3%, and several other online education and training businesses plunged in response. This led the Hang Seng Technology Index to a new record low.
Finally, the plunge of property and financial stocks in the Hong Kong stock market can also be considered as one of the direct culprits of the fall of Hong Kong stocks.
There is no denying that the Hong Kong stock market will still face pressure next year. On the one hand, China's education policy, national data security and new regulations such as the anti-trust mechanism will weigh on the market; on the other hand, there are still potential risks in global trade relations.
The Federal Reserve's recent tightening of its stance and policy has also led to a reduction in the flow of incremental capital into Hong Kong stocks. At the December FOMC meeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell retired the term “transitory inflation”, acknowledging that inflation may be more persistent. The market generally expects the Fed to speed up the tapering of bond purchases in response to inflationary pressures. Current interest rate futures show a 59.1% chance of a rate hike in May next year, and the Fed’s dot plot shows three rate hikes in 2022.
So, what impact will this have on Hong Kong stocks? With the Fed tightening monetary policy, overseas funds are likely to return to the U.S. stock market and U.S. dollar assets, and investors will choose to reduce their positions in risky assets, which will further reduce the inflow of incremental funds into Hong Kong stocks in the future.
It is important to note though that the linkage between Hong Kong and U.S. stocks has been significantly weakened since the beginning of the interoperability in 2014, when the influence of the surging capital on Hong Kong stocks gradually increased. In February 2020, under the disruption of the pandemic, Hong Kong stocks and U.S. stocks showed a complete divergence, with U.S. stocks plummeting and then starting a strong rebound, while Hong Kong stocks continued oscillating all the way down. This also pressured Hong Kong stocks to a certain extent, with limited willingness to allocate overseas capital inflows to Hong Kong stocks.
Secondly, the market is now predicting that next year will be the year when Chinese stocks will list in Hong Kong en masse, which may also bring about a siphoning effect and put pressure on the liquidity of the Hong Kong stock market.
However, we also note that by the end of the year, many investment banking institutions argue that the Hong Kong stock market is now significantly undervalued for 2022, and that the oversold Hong Kong stocks have a good chance for a rebound.
Looking at an Investing.com technical chart, we see the Hang Seng’s RSI, BOLL and MACD indeed show signs of bottoming. After several months of volatility, the downward momentum of Hong Kong stocks has slowed. Zhang Yidong, Global Chief Strategist and General Manager of Overseas Research Center of Singyes Securities, believes that Hong Kong stocks have reached support at the bottom and a technical bull market is expected to emerge next year, with gains of up to 15-20% from the end of 2021 to the high point in 2022.
On the other hand, the Hang Seng Index is right at the 168-month SMA, and breaking below that could lead to a new bottom.
Other positives include valuation and regulation. Everbright Securities believes that the valuation of Hong Kong stocks has come to a historic low, as from a price to book valuation, both the Hang Seng Index and the Hang Seng Composite Index are about two standard deviations from the average, a historic low.
From the policy perspective, the market now generally believes that China's policy regulation has stabilized, providing a solid foundation for the Hong Kong stock market. The view of CICC is that as China's policy tilts in the direction of easing, the Hong Kong stock market will turn positive, and against this backdrop, Hong Kong stocks are in a position to outperform overseas Chinese stocks because of their relatively advantageous valuation levels and loose liquidity.
According to CICC, as of the end of the third quarter, in terms of absolute size, public funds had their biggest positions in the media and entertainment, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, automotive and parts, consumer durables and apparel, general finance, technology hardware and equipment and retail sectors in the Hong Kong stock market. The institution suggested that investors should focus on ""stable growth"" in the near future and opt for quality growth targets in the long term. These include some financial, real estate and midstream and downstream industrial chains, midstream and downstream consumer sectors that benefit from upstream price reductions and policy support, as well as quality growth stocks that are under greater selling pressure in the early stages.
In addition, Guoxin Hong Kong pointed out that the Internet era has entered a period of decline, and the market is moving to growth investment themes like zero-carbon environmental beneficiaries, the meta-verse, and electric vehicles especially, the latter of which are at the equivalent of 2009 for smartphones, when those just began to gain mainstream acceptance. The next 5-10 years is expected to see explosive growth for electric vehicles, so it is a good time to invest in both domestic and foreign electric vehicle makers and related industry participants.
UBS is bullish on Hong Kong's local bank stocks and retail stocks. The institution believes that major central banks in some developed economies may start to cut bond purchases while inflation is peaking, a situation that could boost real interest rates in these economies, and the performance of Hong Kong's local bank stocks is often positively correlated with real interest rate performance, with a dynamic price-to-earnings ratio of about 1.1x and a dividend yield of about 5%. The dividend yield for Hong Kong bank stocks is about 5%. At the same time, Hong Kong local retail stocks may benefit from some favorable policy factors."

(Reuters) - Purdue Pharma is seeking to appeal to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals a judge's decision to unravel its restructuring plan that would have insulated its owners from liability in civil opioid-related cases, according to a court filing late on Thursday. 
The appeal came after U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New York, extended temporary protections until Feb. 1 against opioid-related litigation for the Sackler family members who own Purdue Pharma, giving Purdue and the Sacklers time to pursue the appeal. 
The decision Purdue seeks to appeal was made on Dec. 16, when U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon overturned Drain's ruling that freed the billionaire Sackler family from liability in civil litigation over opioids in exchange for a $4.5 billion payment. 
In the court's decision on the OxyContin maker’s bankruptcy settlement, McMahon found the bankruptcy court did not have authority to grant the release and had asked the appeals court to address whether such releases were legally acceptable.

Purdue argues in the Thursday filing that the Bankruptcy Code permits non-consensual third-party release in its case. It also says the U.S. Trustee, which appealed Drain’s approval of the plan, does not oppose its ability appeal to the 2nd Circuit.
Purdue filed for bankruptcy in September 2019 amid 3,000 lawsuits accusing the company and Sackler family members of contributing to a public health crisis that has claimed the lives of about 500,000 people since 1999.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's competition watchdog on Friday ordered an investigation into Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s business practices in the country, saying it was of the initial view that the iPhone maker had violated certain antitrust laws.
The order from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) comes after a non-profit group alleged this year that Apple was abusing its dominant position in the apps market by forcing developers to use its proprietary in-app purchase system. 
The complainant, ""Together We Fight Society"", argued that Apple's imposition of a 30% in-app fee for distribution of paid digital content and other restrictions hurts competition by raising costs for app developers and customers, while also acting as a barrier to market entry.
The CCI said Apple's restrictions prima facie result in denial of market access for potential app developers and distributors. 
""The Commission at this stage is convinced that a prima facie case is made out against Apple which merits investigation,"" it said.
Apple did not respond to requests for comment. 
The company denied the allegations in a filing to the CCI last month, seen by Reuters, and asked the regulator to throw out the case, stressing that its market share in India was an ""insignificant"" 0-5%.
CCI however said in the order that Apple's argument on its market share was ""completely misdirected"" as the allegations were about anti-competitive restrictions on app developers and not end-users.
The allegations are similar to a case Apple faces in the European Union, where regulators last year started an investigation into the U.S. tech giant.

The CCI ordered its investigations unit to complete the investigation and submit a report within 60 days of the order. Typically such investigations go on for several months.
The watchdog is separately conducting an investigation into Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s in-app payment system as part of a broader probe into the company after Indian startups last year voiced concern.

36,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 31, 2021 07:23AM ET</span>","U.S. Airlines Cancel Over 1,000 Flights on Day Before New Year’s Eve","(Bloomberg) -- Airline cancellations are already piling up in the U.S., with 1,125 flights scrubbed as rising coronavirus cases hobbled staffing. Winter storms threatened to further disrupt travel over New Year’s weekend.
JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp. scratched 175 flights, accounting for 17% of its schedule, by 4:20 p.m. Thursday in New York, according to FlightAware.com. Allegiant canceled 96 flights, or 19% of its service. United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc. scrubbed 199 flights, representing 9% of its schedule. 
The disruptions come after thousands of flights were canceled over the Christmas holiday weekend and into early this week as winter storms combined with staffing shortages caused by the spread of coronavirus cases from the omicron variant.
“Like many businesses and organizations, we have seen a surge in the number of sick calls from omicron,” JetBlue said by email. To give customers time to make other plans, the New York-based carrier pared its schedule through Jan. 13. 
While federal guidance reducing the isolation period for many people testing positive to five days from 10 is expected to help staffing, “we expect the number of Covid cases in the Northeast -- where most of our crew members are based –- to continue to surge for the next week or two,” JetBlue said.
United and Allegiant Travel Co. also cited omicron-related staff shortages. 
Weakening Outlook
Along with personnel issues, border restrictions tied to the surge in cases have also dampened the global outlook for travel. Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd. almost halved the number of flights into Hong Kong from outside China next month. British Airways plans to scrap flights to the territory through March.
The impact looks set to persist well into the new year. Airlines worldwide eliminated about 8.4% of the flights they had planned for January during the past four weeks, based on data from BloombergNEF, which tracks demand for jet fuel. 
 
The drop is even more severe in Europe, at 15% of January flights canceled, after some countries imposed new restrictions on cross-border travel to try to stem the spread of omicron. France eased one concern for U.K. nationals, saying they will be allowed to travel through to other destinations by car, train or plane, though most Britons aren’t able to stay in France without a compelling reason.
U.S. Weather
By comparison, the U.S. flight schedule is holding up well, with just 3.9% of flights planned for next month on the chopping block, according to BloomergNEF.
The Transportation Security Administration said it screened 2.02 million people around the U.S. on Wednesday.
Denver, Atlanta and Los Angeles were among the hardest hit for cancellations and delays Thursday afternoon, according to FlightAware, amid strong winds and precipitation.
No relief is expected through the weekend.
Heavy snow is expected in much of the West on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service, while snow and an icy mix are “expected to paint a swath of hazardous travel conditions New Year’s Day from the front range of the Rockies to the Midwest and Great Lakes.” More than 650 flights already have been canceled for Friday and about 400 are already scratched for Saturday.
U.S. airlines probably won’t see much impact on earnings, said Cowen analyst Helane Becker. Most canceled flights will be rebooked and carriers may use larger planes to consolidate service, she said.
“The airlines are doing their best to accommodate passengers,” Becker said by email. “But as it affects earnings, we don’t think it’s going to be significant to fourth-quarter results.”

Investing.com - The party hats are about to come out as we hit the last day of trading for 2021. Who will be celebrating? With stock futures pointing lower amidst light holiday week trading volume, oil also taking a breather, and the world hoping that this may be the last New Year's Eve where Covid is a loud guest, it may just be enough to reach the finish line. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, December 31st.
Thursday's U.S. trading session closed on an off-note, with each of the major indices closing down for the day, and Friday's pre-market session seemed poised to follow that. At 7:15 AM ET (1215 GMT) on Friday, Dow Futures were down 110 points, or -3%. S&P 500 Futures traded down 14 points or .3%, and Nasdaq 100 Futures traded down .34%. Small cap index Russell 2000 Futures were down .5%.
The indices are still poised to finish higher for the week, with slow trading volume and not much resistance making for a typical holiday finish. They will certainly finish higher for the year, with each of the main indices up more than 20% for the year on a total return basis.

Oil was pointed lower in the pre-market session, with Crude Oil WTI Futures down 1% to $76.2/barrel, and Brent Oil Futures down .9% to $78.8/barrel. Oil is still on track for its best year since 2009 as resurgent demand and limited production rises helped support demand for the commodity. An inflationary climate and supply chain bottlenecks was a boon for commodities more widely, with US Coffee Futures up 77% for the year and Natural Gas Futures up 43%. 
Of course, there are still concerns that demand may not get all the way back to 2019 levels, which is where the next item comes in.

A long week of cancellations due to covid cases, weather, and reluctance to deal with unruly passengers has led to a disruptive holiday schedule for airlines and travelers. As of this morning, flight tracking website FlightAware reported that over 1,000 flights in, into, or out of the United States were canceled, while nearly 500 were delayed. Airline stocks have mostly weathered the storm this week, as investors seem to be betting on the disruption being short-lived, but it serves as a reminder that getting back to whatever normal one might have in mind will not be a straight line in the year ahead.
Two asset classes viewed as hedges to inflation and alternatives to equities and bonds are poised to finish the year on a strong note. Gold Futures is trading up .35% to 1820.35/oz, while Bitcoin is up 2.2% and Ethereum up 2.1% for the day. While they are trading in line today, the two asset classes have seen their fortunes diverge over the course of the year, with Bitcoin up 63% for the year in USD terms, Ethereum up 404%, and gold down 4% for the year, its worst performance in six years.
How the hedges perform in 2022 will obviously hinge in part on how much inflation persists and how quickly the Fed takes action to address that inflation, and thus how attractive the more classic asset classes are in relation. Sentiment will as always be a major driver for cryptocurrencies and gold as well, and 2021 is a win in the newcomer's favor as it stole some of the yellow metal's thunder this year as the leading anti-establishment investment option.

We can't end 2021 without thinking about Covid, as cases worldwide spike to new reported records driven by the new omicron variant of Covid-19. The variant, first reported in South Africa at the end of November, has driven cases to new heights around the world, and the increase of at-home testing and questions over whether rapid tests are accurately detecting the variant suggest that case counts are underreporting by a meaningful number.
The good news so far is that hospitalizations are rising, but much more slowly, and that deaths from Covid are dropping worldwide and not seeing a spike. Many in the investing community are betting on either an end of the pandemic scenario - where omicron resembles a common cold and provides immunity against other variants, leading to an endemic virus - or at least a quick spike and then drop. News out of South Africa has so far supported that view, as the government continues to ease limits there. And the U.K. today approved the use of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s pavloxid, an antiviral pill to combat Covid-19, for people over 18, another sign of improved treatment for the effects of the virus.
While it remains too early to tell, investors and people around the world can't be blamed for hoping this is the last December 31st where COVID is a headline event.

38,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2021 06:56AM ET</span>",China warns Walmart and Sam's Club over Xinjiang products,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's anti-graft agency on Friday accused U.S. retail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and its Sam's Club chain of ""stupidity and shorted-sightedness"" after Chinese news outlets reported Sam's Club had removed Xinjiang-sourced products from stores.
Last week, Sam's Club came under fire in China after several news outlets shared videos and screenshots on the Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) social media platform that they said showed products from the far-western Chinese region of Xinjiang had been removed from the store's online app.
The social media row erupted after U.S. President Joe Biden signed into law on Dec. 23 legislation banning imports from Xinjiang over concern about forced labour there. 
Walmart is the latest foreign firm to be tripped up by Western pressure over Beijing's treatment of Uyghurs and other minority Muslims in Xinjiang and China's importance as a market and supply base.
China rejects accusations of forced labour or any other abuses in Xinjiang.
Neither Walmart nor Sam's Club has made public statements on the backlash against them in China, and Walmart did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. 
The ruling Communist Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) accused Sam's Club of boycotting Xinjiang products and trying to ""muddle through"" the controversy by remaining silent. 
""To take down all products from a region without a valid reason hides an ulterior motive, reveals stupidity and short-sightedness, and will surely have its own bad consequences,"" it said on its website.
China is a huge market for Walmart, which generated revenue of $11.43 billion in the country during its fiscal year that ended Jan. 31. Of 423 retail units Walmart operates in China, 36 are Sam's Club stores, according to its website.
A search for popular Xinjiang goods like raisins on the Sam's Club China store app did not yield any relevant results, but neither did searches for products from other places, such as Fujian tea, according to a Reuters review on Wednesday.
OUT OF STOCK?
Chinese media outlets have cited Sam's Club customer service representatives explaining that the products were not removed but rather out of stock.
The CCDI on Friday called that a ""self-deceptive excuse"" and said the chain should respect China's position on Xinjiang if it wanted to ""stand firm in the Chinese market"".
It is not unusual for a foreign brand to be targeted by Chinese social media users or official outlets, and the impact can be damaging.
Earlier this week, the Weibo hashtag ""Sam's Club card cancellation"" went viral, with over 470 million hits. On Friday, the state-run China Daily newspaper reported that domestic rivals had organised campaigns to promote goods from Xinjiang.
In July, Swedish fashion retailer H&M reported a 23% drop in local currency sales in China for its March-May quarter after it was hit by a consumer boycott in March for stating publicly that it did not source products from Xinjiang.
This month, U.S. chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) faced similar calls after telling its suppliers not to source products or labour from Xinjiang, prompting it to apologise for ""the trouble caused to our respected Chinese customers, partners and the public"".

On Friday, CCDI accused H&M, Intel, and Sam's Club of collaborating with ""western anti-China forces"" to destabilise Xinjiang by suppressing and boycotting products from the region. 
""These Western companies, which once boasted that they were free from political interference, have slapped themselves in the face with their own actions.""

Investing.com - AMD and Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) announced that the former's acquisition of the latter will now close in Q1 of 2022.
“We continue making good progress on the required regulatory approvals to close our transaction,"" the press release stated. ""While we had previously expected that we would secure all approvals by the end of 2021, we have not yet completed the process and we now expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2022. Our conversations with regulators continue to progress productively, and we expect to secure all required approvals.”
In pre-market trading, AMD ticked up .34% while Xilinx traded down 1.7% on the extended timeline for the deal.
AMD announced the deal in October 2020. It is an all-stock merger, with XLNX shareholders receiving 1.7234 shares of AMD for each XLNX share. At current pre-market levels, that would be worth roughly $251/share for Xilinx, vs. its current share price of $210.2, a 19% spread. It appears doubts over whether China's regulatory bodies will approve the merger are the biggest cause of the spread.
AMD continued its impressive turnaround story in 2021, rising 58% for the year as it continues to threaten Intel's market share and compete with Nvidia. Xilinx rose 51% as its value is mostly pegged to AMD's share price, spread notwithstanding.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group on Friday dialled back plans to repay investors in its wealth management products, in a move that highlights the deepening liquidity squeeze at the property developer that has failed to meet its offshore debt obligations.
Evergrande, whose $19 billion in international bonds are deemed to be in cross-default by rating agencies after the developer missed a deadline to pay coupons earlier this month, did not pay offshore coupons due earlier this week. 
The developer has been scrambling to raise cash by selling assets and shares to repay suppliers and creditors.
Evergrande said on Friday that each investor in its wealth management product could expect to receive 8,000 yuan ($1,257) per month as principal payment for three months starting this month irrespective of when the investment matures. 
Once China's top selling developer and now reeling under more than $300 billion in liabilities, Evergrande had earlier not mentioned any amount and had agreed to repay 10% of the investment by the end of the month when the product matures.
It had also agreed to make follow up payments to the wealth management product investors every three months afterwards, until the debt Evergrande owed to an investor is cleared, according to state media reports earlier this year.
Evergrande said in a statement posted on the wealth unit's website on Friday that the company would ""actively raise funds"", and update the repayment plan in late-March. The company did not elaborate.
The situation is not ""ideal"", the statement said, as the development's wealth unit tries to recover capital from the projects it invested in previously and, therefore, the original repayment plan was hard to implement.
Evergrande, in common with other heavily-indebted conglomerates, had issued high-yielding wealth management products to investors - a popular way of borrowing from mom-and-pop investors that sidesteps government lending restrictions.
As the liquidity crisis deepened at Evergrande, the firm's wealth unit https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/with-gucci-bags-dyson-appliances-evergrande-wooed-retail-investors-2021-09-21 in late September missed a payment on one of its products, leading to protests by investors who fear they will never get their money back.

Some of its wealth investors had refused to accept the embattled company's plan to provide payment with discounted apartments, offices, stores and parking units.

Investing.com - Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) shares took another leg lower in pre-market trading after the latest analyst downgrade.
Shares of the exercise equipment maker were down 2% in the last morning session of the year. JMP analyst Andrew Boone may be the trigger, as he downgraded the stock to Market Perform from Outperform on concerns that the December quarter is not going well.
Boone cited year over year declines in web traffic per  SimilarWeb  (NYSE:SMWB) as a sign that Peloton is struggling to catch up to past growth trends amidst the pandemic pull forward effect. He also wanted to see consensus estimates rise before regaining confidence in the stock.
Peloton rallied 7.6% yesterday amidst a recovery day for a lot of 2021's losers, but that came off of its previous 52-week low. The company is down 75% year to date, the biggest loser on the Nasdaq 100, as the giddiness over pandemic-induced demand has worn off and management has struggled with both forecasting the business for the current fiscal year (which ends in June 2022), and ancillary controversies like its morbid role in the Sex and the City tv show's return and CEO/Founder John Foley's holiday party."

Investing.com – Starting the year just under $49 a barrel, U.S. crude prices rose to a high of $85.41 in October and is poised to finish with its best year since 2009. That pretty much decided which sector and companies was going to top S&P 500.
Oil and gas explorer  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) is the best performing S&P 500 stock S&P 500 in the year through December 30, as soaring sales and profits, helped by booming economies, buybacks and higher dividends, boosted returns to over 180%.  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) comes in second but still up with gains of more than 145%. Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG), at eighth spot but still managing to more than double, comes in as the third energy stock among top 10 winners in S&P 500.
 Fortinet  (NASDAQ:FTNT) is the third on the podium with more than 142% gains, successfully riding both product and services to meet needs for cybersecurity solutions in a Cloud environment where everything -- from studies to shopping – has gone digital.
And then there’s  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) at fourth position – up around 141% -- riding on the huge success of its life-saving mRNA Covid-vaccine and the ongoing demand for vaccinations worldwide.
Investors rewarded Ford for its pivot to electric vehicles, best exemplified by the demand for its electric truck F-150 Lightning. The stock ended the year as the fifth best in the index. This week, its market cap topped General Motors' (NYSE:GM) for the first time since 2016.
With a rise of 132%, Bath Body Works (NYSE:BBWI) is the other big winner after spinning off Victoria's Secret & Co (NYSE:VSCO).
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a favorite of most analysts, is also up there with gains of nearly 127% as demand for its chips that power graphics in laptops and go into Cloud servers refuses to abate.
Steel-maker  Nucor  (NYSE:NUE) and tech research agency  Gartner  (NYSE:IT) round up the top 10 winners in S&P 500.
Casino-owner and sports-betting company Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) is the worst performing S&P 500 stock this year. It briefly rode the wave of meme stocks and retail investor enthusiasm for both sports betting and David Portnoy, founder of Penn subsidiary Barstool Sports and a face of the irrational exuberance in the beginning of 2021, but lost around 41 % of its value as the pandemic raged and the business continued to suffer.
 Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) were the other sector laggards, hit by the pandemic and the clampdown on casinos in Macao by the Chinese authorities. They fell around 37% and 24%, respectively, this year, ""good"" for second worst and eighth worst performer on the index.
Activision (NASDAQ:ATVI) was another big loser as a series of allegations of sexual misconduct by senior staff and charges of the company ignoring the behavior rattled investors. Delay in releases of some popular video games made it worse. The pandemic hit the video games publishers in many ways. Not only were developers and creative people in short supply, shortage of chips at console-makers  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also hurt business. Activision ended down 27% for the year, 6th worst.
 Global Payments  Inc (NYSE:GPN) was the 3rd biggest loser, down 37%, amidst fears of disruption in the payments space, and Fidelity National Information Services Inc (NYSE:FIS) suffered from the same pressure, down 22% for the year. Interestingly, the two held unsuccessful merger talks at the end of 2020, suggesting they saw the challenges ahead. MarketAxess Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MKTX) saw a more direct type of challenge to its electronic bond-trading platform business, as  Tradeweb Markets Inc  (NASDAQ:TW) took share over the course of the year, bringing MarketAxess's shares down 27%, 5th worst in the index.
Viatris Inc (NASDAQ:VTRS) struggled in its first full year as a public company, as the generic drug maker merged from Mylan and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s spin-off UpJohn dropped 28%. Citrix Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CTXS) ended up down 26%, 7th on this list, even with a late-year pop on reports that Elliott Management and Vista Equity might be plotting a buyout of the networking systems company. IPG Photonics Corporation (NASDAQ:IPGP) rounds out the list, down 23%, as the laser maker and its sector were among the rare losers in the semiconductor and tech supply chain as a whole.

44,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2021 04:55AM ET</span>",Tesla recalls almost half a million electric cars over safety issues,"By Hyunjoo Jin
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is recalling more than 475,000 of its Model 3 and Model S electric cars to address rearview camera and trunk issues that increase the risk of crashing, the U.S. road safety regulator said on Thursday. 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has been discussing another camera issue with the automaker, while probing the company's driver assistant system.
The model years affected in the recall range from 2014 to 2021, and the total number of recalled vehicles is almost equivalent to the half a million vehicles Tesla delivered last year. 
Around 200,000 Tesla vehicles will be recalled in China, the country's market regulator said on Friday. 
The U.S. electric vehicle manufacturer is recalling 356,309 2017-2020 Model 3 vehicles to address rearview camera issues and 119,009 Model S vehicles due to front hood problems, the federal regulator said. 
Tesla could not be reached for comment. 
For Model 3 sedans, ""the rearview camera cable harness may be damaged by the opening and closing of the trunk lid, preventing the rearview camera image from displaying,"" the NHTSA said. 
Tesla identified 2,301 warranty claims and 601 field reports regarding the issue for U.S. vehicles. 
For Model S vehicles, latch problems may lead a front trunk to open ""without warning and obstruct the driver's visibility, increasing the risk of a crash,"" Tesla said. 
Tesla said it was not aware of any crashes, injuries or deaths related to the issues cited in the recall of Model 3 and Model S cars, the NHTSA said.
Tesla shares fell as much as 3% in the morning but rebounded and were last trading slightly higher around $1,088.76. The world's most valuable automaker is expected to report record quarterly vehicles deliveries as early as Saturday.
China's market regulator said that Tesla will recall close to 200,000 vehicles in the country, including 19,697 imported model S, 35,836 imported model 3, and 144,208 China-made model 3.
Tesla is recalling these electric cars produced ranging from 2015 and 2020 due to possible security risks such as sudden opening of the trunk lid during movement, according to a post on the website of State Admistration for Market Regulation.
CAMERA ISSUE
This month, the NHTSA said it was talking with Tesla about sideview camera issues in some vehicles. [L1N2SU2EA] 
CNBC had reported that Tesla was replacing defective repeater cameras in the front fenders of some U.S.-made vehicles without recalling the parts.
The NHTSA has been investigating 580,000 Tesla vehicles over the automaker's decision to allow games to be played on car screens while they are in motion.
Tesla has subsequently agreed to remove such gaming features while its cars are moving, according to the NHTSA.

Under pressure from NHTSA, Tesla in February agreed to recall 135,000 vehicles with touch-screen displays that could fail and raise the risk of a crash.
In August, the NHTSA opened a formal safety probe into Tesla Inc's driver assistance system Autopilot after a series of crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles.

45,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 31, 2021 04:28AM ET</span>",2021 Review of the Russian Economy and Equity Markets,"by Timur Aliyev
For the Russian market, the end of 2021 saw the outflow of foreign investors’ monetary assets and an accelerated fall of the key indices, against the backdrop of foreign policy tensions and mixed signals from international stock exchanges. Talks about Russia's conflict of Ukraine, aggressive rhetoric between Russia and the West and the risk of imposing a new set of sanctions played a determining role. Geopolitical risks and the toughening tone of Western countries towards Russia make investors forget about external factors for the time being. 
The pandemic, and in particular the emergence of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, also continues to have a significant impact on the dynamics of both the global and Russian markets. Additionally, the suspension of trade for Rusnano bonds caused uncertainty and alarm for the whole Russian market.
One of the results of the year was the withdrawal of $220 million of foreign assets from Russian stocks - a record amount since April 2020. However, this behavior went beyond the Russian market. International investors sold assets in almost all emerging markets, fearing a tightening of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy, with investors transferring money into shares of U.S. companies as a result. Ahead of the last Fed meeting in 2021, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell sharply tightened his rhetoric, abandoning the term “transitory inflation,” and the Fed’s last meeting suggested three rate hikes are possible in 2022. Global investors reassessed risk and hedged in response, and as a result, cash flows are shifting from emerging markets to the more solid and crisis-resilient developed markets. According to EPFR, developed markets funds raised nearly $34 billion month-to-date by mid-December.
September was the best month for the Moscow Exchange this year, as the index rose to new  historical highs through most of the month, peaking near the end of September. However, Russian indices noticeably declined toward the end of the year amid high inflation and negative expectations from the Central Bank policy. In mid-December, for the first time since April 2021, the MOEX Russia Index dropped to 3,532.29 points, though it then was able to recoup most of its losses. However, experts believe that the decline is primarily due to foreign investors, as Russian investors have long been accustomed to geopolitical tensions, sanctions, rhetoric and other factors that discourage foreign capital. Russian investors know the situation from the inside, they are less susceptible to panic: they observe the growth of dividend yields and plan their buys.
The emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant, as well as news of its rapid spreading, and the accompanying increase in global inflation, have all had an adverse effect on the dynamics of the Russian market. A series of new lockdowns in European countries also greatly affects the situation with stocks in Russia. The U.S. market, however, has taken the corona news from Europe in stride, and there also have not been new lockdowns in the U.S.
At the same time, due to the black swan in the form of a pandemic, a liquidity overhang has been created, with states having to spend significant funds to combat the spread of the virus, and to treat and vaccinate the population. These costs have contributed to inflation. Economic stagnation and pressure on small and medium-sized businesses have led to a significant decline in GDP growth in Russia. It will take time to restore the normal functioning of economic processes and the labor market.
Towards the end of the year, the Central Bank of Russia decided to raise its key rate to 8.5%. This step was not a surprise, especially since the regulator itself had warned about the increase in advance. The reason for such a step was inflation, which exceeded the Bank of Russia’s expectations. The Central Bank expects that this increase of the key interest rate will help slow down the rate of price growth and return inflation to the earlier targeted level of 4% by the end of 2022. The regulator does not rule out that it will need to raise the rate again in the future.
As for the performance of specific companies, VK Company (MCX:VKCODR) (Mail.ru),  Petropavlovsk PLC  (MCX:POGR) and  X5 Retail  Group NV (MCX:FIVEDR) are among this year's biggest losers. VK (Mail.ru) is down 40% since the beginning of the year, a record drop among all stocks in the index. Its shares continue to drop past historical lows, trading already below 1,200 rubles. Experts link this trend to the fact that the billionaire Alisher Usmanov sold his stake in VK, followed by Gazprombank buying in and then transferring its stake in VK to Gazprom-Media Holding.
Gold miner Petropavlovsk's shares have fallen 33% since the beginning of the year. In the first half of the year the shares were pressured by the corporate conflict of owners and reduction of production capacities.
Shares of the leading retailer X5 Group also failed to please investors this year, one in which shares dropped 25% from levels seen 18 months ago. The impact of inflation is evident here, as price pressure in the economy led to a widespread rise in the cost of goods and services, as well as food products. It would seem that retail should skim the cream off the top and pass on price increases to customers. But this is not the case - people save more on products where a high marginal markup of the intermediary is allowed, and in the pricing of essential products there are taxes built in.
Despite all the above negative factors, there were success stories in the Russian stock market this year. Some companies demonstrated stable growth and profitability against the background of a shaky market, among them Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), Sberbank Rossii PAO (MCX:SBER), VTB (MCX:VTBR), and NK Rosneft PAO (MCX:ROSN).
Gazprom posted an IFRS profit of 1.59 trillion rubles in the first 9 months of the year, compared to a loss of 202 billion rubles a year earlier. The company expects that it will receive record dividends and have a double-digit dividend yield by the end of 2021.
As for Sberbank, its shares have become the most popular securities in Russian-language social media in 2021, according to a study by Brand Analytics. The second place in the ranking was taken by shares of the already named Gazprom, with third place taken by   Yandex  NV  (MCX:YNDX) (NASDAQ:YNDX). Since the beginning of the year, ordinary and preferred shares of Sberbank went up by about 20%.
VTB's IFRS net profit in the first half of the year increased by 307.2% year-on-year and amounted to 170.6 billion rubles. Moreover, VTB is often cited by experts as one of the best investment opportunities among Russian companies in 2022. The head of the bank Andrei Kostin predicted that by the end of the year VTB's profit will exceed 300 billion rubles. At the same time, top managers have repeatedly announced that they are going to keep plans to pay 50% of net profits to ordinary shares. Presumably, next year VTB will show an unprecedented high dividend yield of about 15%.
At the end of Q3 2021, Rosneft's financial results exceeded forecasts, with net income up 35% on Q2 2021. In addition, a strong factor in the attractiveness of investment in Rosneft is the implementation of a major project, Vostok Oil. Many analysts also consider it an attractive target for investment. The Russian broker BCS included it in a similar list in December. In addition, the largest U.S. investment bank J.P. Morgan also put Rosneft on the list of best global opportunities in 2022. Analysts believe that the oil sector will be the driving force behind economic activity in Russia. The oil price is projected to continue its rise in 2022, with an average expected price of $74 - a level above the annual average for the past 7 years.

Investing.com - 3G Capital is acquiring leading windows covering maker  Hunter Douglas  NV (AS:HUDN) in a deal announced after yesterday afternoon.
The global investing firm will pay €175/share for Hunter Douglas's shares, buying out minority shareholders as well as the Sonnenberg family, which owned 88% of the company. The Sonnenberg family will maintain a 25% stake in the business as part of the deal.
This concludes a tumultuous if profitable year for Hunter Douglas shareholders. The Sonnenberg family had attempted to buy out minority shareholders at €64/share in a deal announced last December. Due to shareholder appeals about what was perceived as an opportunistic, lowball offer, the family raised the bid to €82 in a tender deal. That tender offer failed as only .18% of shares were tendered, and the Sonnenberg family withdrew the offer.
Meanwhile, Hunter Douglas's business benefited from the hot global housing market, with its first nine months of 2021 producing 23% higher sales compared to 2019, along with an 81% increase in EBITDA and a 106% increase in net income, underlining the opportunistic nature of the original Sonnenberg family offers.
This is 3G Capital's first major announced deal since merging Kraft Foods with Heinz in 2015. The firm, once highly praised for its ""zero-based budgeting"" philosophy and for partnering with Warren Buffett on several deals (including Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC)), has seen its reputation take a hit after Kraft Heinz and Anheuser Busch Inbev (BR:ABI) NV ADR (NYSE:BUD), another of its companies, struggled with debt, slow growth, and dividend cuts over the past five years. It also came under fire for a failed hostile takeover bid of Unilever in 2017.
The 3G Capital offer is 73% above yesterday's close. The deal is expected to close in Q1 2022. João Castro Neves, a senior partner at 3G, will assume the role of CEO after the merger."

The government lifted a curfew that was in place from midnight to 4 a.m. with immediate effect and allowed establishments selling alcohol to operate beyond 11 p.m. Wearing of masks in public will remain mandatory, according to a statement.
“All indicators suggest the country may have passed the peak of the fourth wave at a national level,” Minister in the Presidency Mondli Gungubele said in emailed statement issued after a cabinet meeting on Thursday. He cited a drop in new cases for the week ending Dec. 25 and the availability of hospital beds.
The move to ease restrictions may stem from South Africa’s push to recover from its biggest economic contraction in at least a quarter century last year, and spur spending during the holiday season. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg estimate gross domestic product expanded 4.9% in 2021, slower than a previous projection. Meanwhile, test positivity rate rose on Thursday to 28.1%, far exceeding the 5% that the World Health Organization deems tolerable.
“Numbers are still up in South Africa, especially the positivity rate,” Tulio de Oliveira, the head of gene sequencing institutions in South Africa who presented findings about omicron last month, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). “We are still not out of the woods.”
Africa’s most-industrialized nation also reported 126 deaths on Thursday, the most since the discovery of the omicron variant. Hospitalizations also increased.

Revenue for the year is expected to be 634 billion yuan ($99.48 billion), rotating chairman Guo Ping said in a New Year letter to employees on Friday.
That represents a fall of 28.9% from 2020 revenues of 891.4 billion yuan.
Guo said next year ""will come with its fair share of challenges"" but that he was satisfied with Huawei's 2021 business performance.
""An unpredictable business environment, the politicisation of technology, and a growing deglobalisation movement all present serious challenges,"" the letter, published on the company's website, read.
In 2019, the U.S. Trump administration imposed a trade ban on Huawei, citing national security, which barred the company from using Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Android for its new smartphones, among other critical U.S.-origin technology.
The U.S. sanctions, together with weaker domestic consumption due to the coronavirus, weighed on Huawei. 
""We need to stick to our strategy and respond rationally to external forces that are beyond our control,"" Guo said.
Huawei will continue focusing on information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure and smart devices, the letter said.

Third-quarter revenue fell 38% compared with a year earlier, Huawei's latest earnings report shows. The first three quarters' revenue was down by almost a third year-on-year.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Friday morning, potentially boosted by better-than-expected Chinese data and a rally in U.S.-listed Chinese equities. Trade was thin, with it being the last trading day of 2021 in some countries.
China’s Shanghai Composite gained 0.52% by 10:03 PM ET (2:03 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component was up 0.21%. Data released earlier in the day showed that December’s manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was 50.3, and the non-manufacturing PMI was 52.7. Both figures were above the 50-mark indicating growth.
Investors also continued to monitor China’s property sector, particularly some initial coupon payment deadlines for  Kaisa Group  Holdings Ltd.'s (HK:1638) dollar bonds.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 1.94% while in Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.48%. Both markets will close early, while Japanese and Korean markets are closed all day.
The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index soared 9.4% on Thursday, the most since 2008, but is still down more than 40% for 2021.
Global equities are closing out a strong year, mainly due to a U.S. rally while Asia Pacific lagged behind. Bond investors are also nursing losses as central banks move to tighten monetary policy to curb high inflation. How this policy shift and COVID-19 will shape economic reopening are key for the outlook in the new year.
“As we look forward to 2022 the gains are probably going to be more modest than they’ve been in the past year or so” partly given where valuations are now, Glenmede chief investment officer for private wealth Jason Pride told Bloomberg.
But there is reason to be optimistic since “we’re still in the recovery from COVID-19,” he added.
In the U.S., data released on Thursday showed that initial jobless claims unexpectedly fell to 198,000 last week, while the Chicago PMI was a higher-than-expected 63.1 for December.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden had a 50-minute conversation with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin on Thursday, ahead of three sets of negotiations on European security in January 2022.
During the call, Biden urged Putin to de-escalate tensions with Ukraine, warning that the U.S. and its allies would “respond decisively” if Russia invades. Russia, for its part, was “happy and satisfied” with the “constructive” conversation in which the two leaders agreed to keep in regular contact during the negotiations."

(Reuters) - U.S. airline cabin crew, pilots and support staff are reluctant to work overtime during the holiday travel season despite being lured with hefty financial incentives because of the growing fear of contracting COVID-19 and the prospect of dealing with unruly passengers, three airline unions said.
That reluctance, combined with bad weather and tight staffing at pandemic-battered airlines, led to massive flight cancellations over the past week, the unions said. The issues will likely result in more strain in the weeks ahead as the spread of the Omicron variant accelerates.
""We have negotiated holiday incentives to help with operational challenges, but there's only so far you can stretch people,"" Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA), representing 50,000 flight attendants at 17 airlines, said in a statement. 
In the months leading up to the holidays, airlines were wooing employees to ensure solid staffing, after furloughing or laying off thousands over the last 18 months as the pandemic crippled the industry.
The airline sector is also feeling added pressure as employment numbers still trail pre-pandemic levels, but the total hours worked by fewer staff has almost fully rebounded. 
The industry was hopeful that staff would pick up overtime to fly a record number of passengers since the pandemic began, according to the AFA.
But the fast-spreading Omicron variant, which is leading to unprecedented COVID-19 cases in the U.S., has caused staff to re-think workloads. On Thursday, over 1,200 flights were canceled within, into, or out of the United States as of 3:29 p.m. ET, data from flight-tracking website FlightAware.com showed. 
United Airlines said the nationwide spike in Omicron cases has had a direct impact on its operations. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co said it had yet to see any impact on its operations.
JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp said it was cutting its schedule through Jan. 13 by about 1,280 flights due to crew members getting sick.
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) said incentive pay is being offered to flight crews but did not elaborate further.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc,  Alaska Air  (NYSE:ALK) Group Inc,  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) Inc, Skywest Inc and  Hawaiian Holdings  (NASDAQ:HA) Inc did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Thursday that an increasing number of agency employees had tested positive for COVID-19.
""To maintain safety, traffic volume at some facilities could be reduced, which might result in delays during busy periods,"" an FAA spokesperson said.
TESTY, DIFFICULT PASSENGERS
Violent skirmishes between passengers and flight crew have also hit a record high this year, prompting U.S. regulators to crack down harder. The FAA in early November said it had referred more than three dozen unruly passengers to the FBI for potential criminal prosecution.
Still, many cabin crews fret about their safety on board.
""It's not worth the risk when tensions are high to go out there and risk getting hurt or possibly disabled on the job,"" said Thom McDaniel, International Vice President at the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU), which represents over 150,000 members across several sectors, including airlines. 
For example, U.S. prosecutors in Colorado charged a 20-year-old California man with assaulting a flight attendant on an Oct. 27 American Airlines flight bound for Santa Ana, California, that forced the pilots to divert the flight.
Both AFA and TWU have made public calls for regulators to address the rising incidents on board. 
JUICY INCENTIVE PAY NOT ENOUGH
Airlines have offered bonuses and up to triple pay for employees working during the holidays, but few are biting.
""A lot of flight attendants are not willing to pick up (extra shifts), even for extra pay because they fear for their own safety,"" McDaniel said.
Some pilots have also rebuffed extra pay. The American Airlines' pilot union had declined the company's offer of as much as double pay for working during the holidays, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters last month.
""We have limits by the FAA and those sometimes are approached, but what you have is a human limit,"" said Allied Pilots Association spokesman Dennis Tajer, who represents American Airlines pilots.

The Air Line Pilot’s Association, Int’l representing Delta pilots said resolving scheduling issues will be a priority when the union returns to contract negotiations with the airline in January.

The bank told workers it was not changing the long-term plans of working from the office. ""With the increase in holiday travel and gatherings, we are allowing for more flexibility during the first two weeks of January to work from home (if your role allows) at your manager's discretion,"" the memo said.

The bank had said to it employees at its New York City office on Dec. 15 they could work from home if they were able to through the holidays. 

U.S. banks have been more proactive than other industries in encouraging employees back to the office, but those plans have come under renewed scrutiny due to the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant. 
Earlier this month, JPMorgan instructed unvaccinated staff in Manhattan to work from home, while relaxing mask requirements for vaccinated staff working in its Manhattan offices.

(Reuters) -Chevron on Thursday said it was postponing a scheduled January full return to office for its two largest U.S. work sites as the Omicron variant spreads across the United States. 
This week, the United States reported a record number of coronavirus cases based on the seven-day average, with over 290,000 new infections each day, according to a Reuters tally.
 Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), which postponed return to work plans for its San Ramon and Houston offices, joined several big U.S. employers that have reversed course in recent weeks on plans to bring employees working from home to their corporate campuses. A spokesperson for Chevron did not specify when employees would return to the office full time.

The North American unit of energy firm Engie also was set to bring its U.S. employees back to their offices next month, but pushed the start date to late February, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company did not respond to a request for comment. 
In mid-December, asset management firm Fidelity Investments said it was pausing a voluntary return-to-office for employees in New England amid surging Omicron cases, while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) instructed unvaccinated staff members to work from home and moved an annual healthcare conference set to be held in January online amid concerns of the fast-spreading Omicron variant.

(Reuters) -A U.S. trade group representing major passenger and cargo airlines asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Thursday to halt deployment of new 5G wireless service around many airports, warning thousands of flights could be disrupted.
AT&T (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) are set on Jan. 5 to deploy C-Band spectrum 5G wireless service that they won in an $80 billion government auction. The petition from industry group Airlines for America seeks a deployment delay near numerous U.S. airports including ones in Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, New York, Boston and Seattle.
The aviation industry and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have raised significant concerns that 5G might interfere with sensitive aircraft electronics like radio altimeters, which could delay or divert flights. 
""Aircraft will not be able to rely on radio altimeters for numerous flight procedures and thus will not be able to land at 
certain airports,"" the group said in its emergency FCC petition.
It said wireless interference will ""jeopardize the function of critical aircraft safety systems, which in turn threatens to divert or cancel thousands of flights"" daily. It said this would disrupt ""millions of passenger reservations"" along with flight crew schedules and global supply chains.
The petition seeks an FCC decision by noon EST Monday or the group warned it will ""seek judicial or other relief"" to avoid ""immediate and unacceptable safety risks."" 
Wireless industry group CTIA said 5G is safe and the spectrum is being used in about 40 other countries.
CTIA said Thursday ""the FCC considered and rejected these claims nearly two years ago after an exhaustive review"" and the industry still plans a Jan. 5 launch for 5G service.
The FAA declined to comment on the petition. The agency has been preparing to issue notices further detailing impact of potential interference but has delayed release as intensive talks continue between the Biden administration, wireless carriers and the aviation sector.
Airlines for America, which represents American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and other major carriers, said it wants the FCC and FAA ""to work together on a practical solution."" The petition is aimed at preserving legal options if discussions do not result in an agreement.
This month, the group warned interference from 5G networks could cause 4% of U.S. flights to be diverted, delayed or canceled, and the FAA issued airworthiness directives warning 5G interference could result in flight diversions.
Airlines for America has said that if the FAA 5G directive had been in effect in 2019, about 345,000 passenger flights and 5,400 cargo flights would have faced delays, diversions or cancellations impacting 32 million passengers.
""The potential damage to the airline industry alone is staggering,"" the petition says.

In November, AT&T and Verizon delayed commercial launch of C-band wireless service by a month until Jan. 5 and adopted precautionary measures to limit interference.
Aviation industry groups said that was insufficient. The aviation industry made a counterproposal that would limit cellular transmissions around airports and other critical areas.

(Reuters) - Wall Street closed lower on Thursday, retreating late in thin holiday volume from record highs set early in the session on strong U.S. data including a drop in weekly claims for U.S. unemployment benefits.
With one trading day left, the S&P 500 was set to end the year more than 27% higher, with the Nasdaq up about 23% and the Dow's annual rise just shy of 20%. Each of Wall Street's main indexes was poised for its sharpest three-year surge since 1997-99.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 90.55 points, or 0.25%, to 36,398.08, the S&P 500 lost 14.33 points, or 0.30%, to 4,778.73 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 24.65 points, or 0.16%, to 15,741.56.
Four of the 11 major S&P 500 sector indexes traded higher, led by the real estate sector.
Investors cheered a U.S. Labor Department report that the number of Americans filing for new unemployment claims dropped to a seasonally adjusted 198,000 in the week leading up to Christmas, from a revised 206,000 a week earlier. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast weekly applications would rise to 208,000.
In other strong U.S. data, the Chicago purchasing managers' index (PMI) delivered a print of 63.1, a monthly increase of 1.3 points and 1.1 points above consensus.
A PMI number over 50 signifies expanded activity over the previous month.
Equities have rallied recently on some of the thinnest trading volumes that U.S. stock exchanges have seen due to the holidays. Investors were encouraged by growing evidence that the Omicron variant causes less-severe infections of COVID-19 than the Delta strain.
On Wednesday, top U.S. infectious disease adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci said the surge in cases of the Omicron variant should peak by the end of January.
""The strong manufacturer data out of Chicago and an impressive initial jobless claims continue to show an economy that is quite healthy, omits the continued worries obviously over the Omicron variants,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Detrick cautioned that low holiday season trading volume could exaggerate price moves.
Stock markets have been in a seasonally strong ""Santa Claus Rally"" that typically occurs in the last five trading days of the year and the first two of the new year.
Among individual stocks, Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) slipped 7.09%, giving back gains from the prior session as Samsung (KS:005930) BioLogics denied a media report that said the South Korean firm was in talks to buy the U.S. drugmaker.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co stock saw over 20% losses year-to-date while the overall Dow Jones stock index is on track for a 19% gain for the year.
In 2022, investors will shift their attention to expected U.S. interest rate hikes and midterm elections for U.S. Congress, where President Joe Biden's Democrats now hold a slim majority.
“Midterm years tend to be the most volatile out of the four-year cycle. There's actually a 17% average peak to trunk correction during a midterm year, which is the largest of the four years.” Detrick added, “Investors were pretty spoiled this year. So be aware that next year won’t be as easy.”
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.08 billion shares, compared with the 10.83 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.26-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.47-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Exxon Mobil Corp on Thursday signaled a return to annual profit for 2021 as stronger oil and gas prices drove a gain of up to $1.9 billion in operating profits that exceeded one-time charges.
The largest U.S. oil producer issued a snapshot of final quarter results that showed it expects sequentially higher profit from oil and gas production. Operating profits in refining and chemicals will be flat to lower, a securities filing showed. Official results are due out Feb. 1.
In 2020, Exxon (NYSE:XOM) suffered a historic $22.4 billion loss on writedowns from falling oil prices and lower refining margins. Cost cuts coupled with energy price gains have allowed it to pay down debt and plot a share buyback program next year. 
Analysts forecast an adjusted profit of $1.76 per share for the quarter, according to Refinitiv IBES data, compared to 3 cents a share excluding writedowns a year-ago.
Thursday's regulatory filing signaled one-time charges for asset impairments and contractual costs could lower oil and gas earnings by up to $1.2 billion. It did not provide details on the production assets affected. 
Exxon also said lower margins in chemicals could lower results by $600 million to $800 million, compared to the $2.14 billion third-quarter chemicals profit. Refining margins could stay flat or drop by $200 million compared to the $1.23 billion profit the previous quarter.
Offsetting the negative impacts, Exxon signaled mark-to-market gains of up to $1.1 billion for oil and gas and in refined products. It also said proceeds from asset sales including its U.K. North Sea assets could deliver up to $500 million.
The rosier outlook allowed Exxon to extend planned a $20-25 billion per year outlay on new projects through 2027, including $2.5 billion per year on carbon reductions, the company has said, adding it expects to double its pre-pandemic annual profit by 2025, the company has said.

About 60% of its spending will be in key growth areas of U.S. shale, Guyana, Brazil, LNG, and chemical products.
Exxon shares fell 36 cents or about 0.59% on Thursday to close at $60.79. The stock is up 47% so far this year but down 33% over the last five years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Global stock markets reversed gains after a day-long rally on Thursday even as fresh U.S. economic data indicated that a recent uptick of Omicron COVID-19 variant-related infections has not yet led to a surge in layoffs, a positive sign for the economy. 
Thin trading volumes, which led to a dip in oil and a climb in the dollar, have outweighed earlier investor sentiment that high vaccination rates and signs of milder symptoms caused by the variant mean the economy will avoid a repeat of the disruption seen at the start of the pandemic.

The so-called G7 is a group of five partners that holds a majority stake in BTG but is different from the board.
Reuters reported in July that Esteves was closing in on a comeback, as he was awaiting legal regulatory approval from the European Central Bank to regain his 61.55% voting stake in the G7. Brazil's central bank had already allowed him to return to the G7 group two years ago.
Esteves left BTG's controlling group after he was arrested in 2015, accused by former congressman Delcidio Amaral of offering to pay off witnesses in the ""Car Wash"" corruption probe to prevent them from striking plea bargain deals.
BTG faced a liquidity crunch, was forced to shed assets and to take a loan from Brazil's deposit insurance body.
Esteves first returned to the bank as a senior partner in April 2016, but without a formal management role. Still, he has taken some of the bank's main decisions, as Reuters reported earlier, including its recent push into retail banking.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd fueled opioid addiction in New York state, a jury found on Thursday, a setback for a company still facing thousands of other opioid-related lawsuits around the United States.
The verdict, which followed a nearly six-month New York state court trial in a case brought by the state and two of its counties, does not include damages, which will be determined later. The jury deliberated more than eight days before reaching a verdict. 
Teva shares, which had been trading higher, fell more than 7 percentage points in New York following the decision. In afternoon trading they were down 40 cents, or 4.7%, at $8.03.
New York Attorney General Letitia James called the outcome ""a significant day"" for the state and for ""every family and community torn apart by opioids."" Jayne Conroy and Hunter Shkolnik, who represent Suffolk and Nassau counties respectively, also hailed it as a ""massive victory.""
In a statement, the company said: ""Teva Pharmaceuticals strongly disagrees with today's outcome and will prepare for a swift appeal as well as continue to pursue a mistrial."" It said the state and counties presented ""no evidence of medically unnecessary prescriptions, suspicious or diverted orders.""
New York and the counties had accused the Israel-based drugmaker of engaging in misleading marketing practices that fueled opioid addiction in the state, including by pushing drugs for off-label use.
They focused on Actiq and Fentora, cancer pain drugs made by Cephalon Inc, a company Teva bought in 2011, as well as generic opioids sold by Teva.
ONE OF 3,300 LAWSUITS
The New York lawsuit is one of more than 3,300 filed by state, local and Native American tribal governments across the country accusing drugmakers of minimizing the addictiveness of opioid pain medications, and distributors and pharmacies of ignoring red flags that they were being diverted into illegal channels. 
The judge in the case is still considering a request Teva made for a mistrial after a lawyer for the state cited an inaccurate statistic about opioid prescriptions in his closing argument. If the verdict stands, it could put pressure on Teva to reach a nationwide settlement with other states and local governments over opioid claims. 
The evidence at trial included a parody video made for a Cephalon sales meeting in 2006 in which the villain, Dr. Evil from the ""Austin Powers"" films, talks about promoting the drugs for non-cancer pain, and another video, based on a courtroom scene in the film ""A Few Good Men,"" in which a Cephalon employee tells a lawyer played by Tom Cruise that he ""can't handle the truth"" about what sales representatives need to do to meet quotas.
Teva at trial attributed a surge in opioid prescriptions to a change in medical standards of care emphasizing pain treatment beginning in the 1990s.
It also said that its opioid sales complied with federal and New York state regulations. The jury found the state partly to blame, assigning it 10% responsibility.
U.S. officials have said that by 2019, the health crisis had led to nearly 500,000 opioid overdose deaths over two decades. More than 100,000 people died from drug overdoses during the 12-month period ending April 2021, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a report in November, a record driven in large part by deaths from opioids like fentanyl. 
Other defendants in the case settled before or during trial - major pharmacies, distributors McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH), and drugmakers Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Endo International (NASDAQ:ENDP) Plc and  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV). AbbVie's settlement, for $200 million, came at the very end of the trial, on the day of closing arguments.
The settlement with J&J and the distributors was part of a nationwide deal worth up to $26 billion. Teva did not take part in that deal.

Teva previously prevailed in a similar case when a California judge on Nov. 2 ruled that it and other drugmakers were not liable in a lawsuit brought by several counties in the state.
OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma filed for bankruptcy in 2019 and had hoped to resolve a flood of lawsuits over the painkiller through a deal in which the company's former owners, the Sackler family, would pay $4.5 billion in exchange for immunity from future lawsuits. However, a federal judge on Dec. 17 scrapped the deal, a decision the company was expected to appeal.

Investing.com —  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:ZM) shares rose more than 5% Thursday after Citic analyst Junyun Chen initiated coverage of the stock with a buy rating and $260 price target.
The analyst noted the company's 43% share price decline for the year to date. Chen said concerns about the stock arose because of the ""decline in revenue growth after the pandemic, the loss of small and medium-sized business (SMB) customers, the competition from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams and other factors."" 
However, Chen investors in a research note that ""current market concerns are clearly excessive. And after being oversold, Zoom's medium/long-term investment value has gradually manifested.""
The Citic analyst outlined three reasons for the buy rating on Zoom, including the current global video conferencing market, the company encouraging core video products on the platform, and the increase in offline channels and international expansion.
""Considering Zoom's expected revenue growth of close to 20% and an operating profit margin of over 30%, we assign 16x FY2023 EPS,"" explained  Chen.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's government said on Thursday it would give additional aid to El Al Airlines to help compensate for the reimposition of a COVID-19 entry ban on foreign tourists and restrictions on overseas travel by Israelis.
Israel's flag carrier will receive tens of millions of dollars from the state and El Al's controlling shareholders to help it weather the pandemic, and the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, according to a Finance Ministry statement.
The aid will be given over the next few months, and Israel's other main airlines, Arkia and Israir, will also be offered a similar deal, the ministry said.
El Al has been pressing the government for another aid package, with Israelis barred by the government from travelling to dozens of countries, including the United States and Britain, and an entry ban on foreigners back in force.
""The new outline will allow (airlines) to overcome the pandemic while maintaining the principle that state aid will be provided along with external capital to strengthen their capital structure,"" said Finance Minister Avigdor Lieberman.
""I hope that in the coming month we will open the skies to those entering and leaving.""
Israel had closed its borders in March 2020 at the outset of the pandemic. In November 2021, foreigners were briefly allowed in but the rapid spread of the Omicron variant led Israel's government to tighten travel restrictions.
El Al has laid off 1,900 employees - nearly one-third of its staff - as part of a recovery plan mandated by the government to receive a $210 million aid package earlier in the year. It also reduced its fleet to 29 from 45.
The airline also was set to receive another $30 million in aid due to the restrictions over the summer. 

El Al lost a net $136.2 million in the third quarter, a period that is typically its strongest, compared with a $146.6 million loss a year earlier. Revenue jumped to $253 million from $39.2 million a year ago, when borders were largely shut.
It had initially believed sales for the fourth quarter would be higher in the wake of the government’s approval for tourists vaccinated within the prior six months to enter Israel as of November 1.

69,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2021 01:51PM ET</span>","The Year of the Doge? 2021, crypto's wildest year yet","By Tom Wilson and Elizabeth Howcroft
LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin close to $70,000, ""memecoins"" worth billions of dollars, a blockbuster Wall Street listing and a sweeping Chinese crackdown: 2021 was the wildest yet for cryptocurrencies, even by the sector's volatile standards.
Digital assets started the year with a stampede of cash from investors large and small. And bitcoin and its kin were rarely out of the spotlight since, with the language of crypto becoming firmly entrenched in the investor lexicon.
Here is a look at some of the major trends that dominated cryptocurrencies this year. 
1/Bitcoin: Still no.1 
The original cryptocurrency held its crown as the biggest and most well-known token - though not without a host of challengers biting at its heels. 
Bitcoin soared over 120% from Jan 1. to a then-record of almost $65,000 in mid-April. Fuelling it was a tsunami of cash from institutional investors, growing acceptance by major corporations such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) and an increasing embrace by Wall Street banks. 
Spurring investor interest was Bitcoin's purported inflation-proof qualities - it has a capped supply - as record-breaking stimulus packages fuelled rising prices. The promise of quick gains amid record-low interest rates, and easier access through fast-developing infrastructure, also helped attract buyers.
Emblematic of bitcoin's mainstream embrace was major U.S. exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN)'s $86 billion listing in April, the biggest yet of a cryptocurrency company.
""It's graduated into the sphere where it is traded by the sort of people that are taking bets on treasuries and equities,"" said Richard Galvin of crypto fund Digital Capital Asset Management. 
Yet the token stayed volatile. It slumped 35% in May before soaring to a new all-time high of $69,000 in November, as inflation spiralled across Europe and the United States. 
Prominent sceptics remain, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) boss Jamie Dimon calling it ""worthless"". Graphic: Peaks and troughs: Bitcoin's 2021 rollercoaster, https://graphics.reuters.com/FINANCE-YEARENDER/mypmnaljavr/chart.png 
2/The rise of the memecoins 
Even as bitcoin remained the go-to for investors dipping their toes into crypto, a panoply of new - some would say joke - tokens entered the sector. 
""Memecoins"" - a loose collection of coins ranging from dogecoin and shiba inu to squid game that have their roots in web culture - often have little practical use. 
Dogecoin, launched in 2013 as a bitcoin spinoff, soared over 12,000% to an all-time high in May before slumping almost 80% by mid-December. Shiba inu, which references the same breed of Japanese canine as dogecoin, briefly muscled its way into the 10 largest digital currencies. Graphic: Who let the doge out? https://graphics.reuters.com/FINANCE-YEARENDER/gdvzymlzkpw/chart.png 
The memecoin phenomenon was linked to the ""Wall Street Bets"" movement, where retail traders coordinated online to pile into stocks such as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), squeezing hedge funds' short positions. 
Many of the traders - often stuck at home with spare cash during coronavirus lockdowns - turned to crypto, even as regulators voiced warnings about volatility. 
""It's all about the mobilisation of finance,"" said Joseph Edwards, head of research at crypto broker Enigma Securities.
""While assets like DOGE and SHIB may in themselves be purely speculative, the money coming into them is coming from an instinct of 'why shouldn't I earn on my money, savings?'"" Graphic: Rise of the memecoins, https://graphics.reuters.com/FINANCE-YEARENDER/klpyknyxwpg/chart.png 
3/Regulation: The (large) elephant in the room
As money poured into crypto, regulators fretted over what they saw as its potential to enable money laundering and threaten global financial stability. 
Long sceptical of crypto - a rebel technology invented to undermine traditional finance - watchdogs called for more powers over the sector, with some warning consumers over volatility.
With new rules looming, crypto markets were skittish to the possible risk of a clampdown. 
When Beijing placed curbs on crypto in May, bitcoin tanked almost 50%, dragging the wider market down with it.
""Regulatory risk is everything because those are the rules of the road that people live by and die by in financial services,"" said Stephen Kelso, global head of markets at ITI Capital. ""The regulators are making good progress, they're catching up."" 
4/NFTs 
As memecoin trading went viral, another formerly obscure corner of the crypto complex also grabbed the limelight.
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) - strings of code stored on the blockchain digital ledger that represent unique ownership of artworks, videos or even tweets - exploded in 2021. 
In March, a digital artwork by U.S. artist Beeple sold for nearly $70 million at Christie's, among the three most expensive pieces by a living artist sold at auction.
The sale heralded a stampede for NFTs. 
Sales in the third-quarter hit $10.7 billion, up over eight-fold from the previous three months. As volumes peaked in August, prices for some NFTs rose so quickly speculators could ""flip"" them for profit in days, or even hours.
    Soaring crypto prices that spawned a new cohort of crypto-wealthy investors - as well as predictions for a future of online virtual worlds where NFTs take centre stage - helped fuel the boom.
    Cryptocurrencies and NFTs' popularity may also be linked to a decline in social mobility, said John Egan, CEO of BNP Paribas-owned research company L'Atelier, with younger people drawn to their potential for swift gains as soaring prices put traditional assets like houses out of reach.

    While some of the world's top brands, from Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) to Burberry, have sold NFTs, still-patchy regulation meant larger investors largely steered clear.
    ""I don't see a situation where licensed financial institutions are actively and aggressively trading (these) digital assets in the next three years,"" Egan said. Graphic: NFT sales on OpenSea, https://graphics.reuters.com/FINANCE-YEARENDER/CRYPTO-CURRENCY/gdpzymljbvw/chart.png

The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.3%, up for the second straight week with the tech sector, healthcare and travel stocks (SXTP), in the lead.
Most European bourses including Germany's DAX, France's CAC40, Spain's IBEX and London's FTSE 100 were on-track to record gains for the second consecutive week.
However, risks of hawkish central banks decisions on rising inflation pressures and lingering concerns of recent jump in global Omicron cases have limited gains so far. 
The European Central Bank is close to meeting its 2% medium-term inflation target and can unwind stimulus quicker than planned if price growth continues to surprise on the upside, Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot told a German newspaper.
""Traders continue to shake off the headlines about the rising number of patients with the omicron variant ... It is worrying that case numbers are high, but the low hospitalisation rates are determining the mood in the markets,"" said David Madden, an analyst at Equiti Capital.
Spain's IBEX rose 0.5% even as flash data showed consumer prices in December rose 6.7% across the country from the same month last year, the fastest annual pace of inflation since 1989.
The index has underperformed its regional peers in 2021, gaining a near 8%, compared with the STOXX 600's 22% rise.
France's CAC 40 has jumped 29.2% year-to-date, eclipsing the STOXX 600's gains, as hopes of an economic recovery boosted luxury stocks, even though the outlook for demand from Asia remains bleak into the new year.

Global COVID-19 infections hit a record high over the past seven-day period, Reuters data showed on Wednesday, as countries try to fight the pandemic while keeping economies open.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week he would not bring in new pandemic-related restrictions this year, while a curfew has been ruled out in mainland France.

Researchers said on Thursday a booster dose of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine was 84% effective at preventing hospitalisation in South African healthcare workers who became infected as Omicron spread.
Several European markets including Italy, Germany and Spain will be closed on Friday, while Paris and London will trade for half a session, ahead of the New Year.

Investing.com —  Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Inc (NASDAQ:ALNY)shares have risen over 2% after analysts at BofA and Cantor Fitzgerald singled the stock out. 
Alnylam has been the focus of analysts this week after its shares fell in sympathy with BridgeBio after reporting that its phase 3 trial, investigating acoramidis for the treatment of a rare heart disease, failed to meet its primary endpoint.
Shortly after, Stifel said the news was positive for Alnylam, which is currently conducting its phase 3 Study of patisiran. However, the company's shares fell, closing the day down 17%. 
Alnylam shares have begun to reclaim those losses but are still down 11% in the past week. 
Nevertheless, the stock remains a top pick for next year at BofA, with analyst Tazeen Ahmad maintaining a buy rating and $211 price target on the stock. The analyst said that the volatility in Alnylam shares is due to the company using the same primary endpoint as BridgeBio, but Alnylam's ""more stringent enrollment criteria is an advantage.""
Elsewhere, Cantor Fitzgerald said Alnylam could be a top M&A target for 2022, with mergers and acquisitions being important for industry valuations.

U.S. cruise ships have been gradually returning to the seas since late June, but an increase in Omicron cases has sparked calls https://twitter.com/SenBlumenthal/status/1475823507015708678 for a temporary ban on cruising, including from Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat.
Since the Celebrity Cruises parent resumed operations from U.S. ports in June, the company's cruise ships have ferried 1.1 million passengers, with 1,745 people testing positive for COVID-19 and 41 being hospitalized.
""Our case count has spiked, but the level of severity is significantly milder,""  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL)'s chief medical officer, Calvin Johnson, said.
The company said load factors for sailings in the first half of 2022 remain below historical levels, although it said the recent disruption was not as severe as that experienced during the Delta variant wave earlier this year.
Royal Caribbean shares rose nearly 2% in early morning trade as it said bookings for the second half of 2022 continue to be within historical ranges. 
Some cruise liners recently had to hold off on disembarking https://ssj.jalisco.gob.mx/prensa/noticia/10211 passengers due to active COVID-19 cases on board, or to bring in more workers as a precautionary measure.

Investing.com – RR Donnelley & Sons Co's stock (NYSE:RRD) climbed 5% Thursday after the company got a sweeter offer than that made by affiliates of private investment firm Chatham Asset Management.
The stock touched $11.20 in the session underway, topping the latest cash offer of $11 made by a ""strategic party.""  
For now though, the company said it is committed to Chatham’s $10.85 per share offer even as its board feels the unsolicited non-binding proposal from the strategic party could reasonably be expected to lead to a “superior proposal.”
“At this time, the board has not determined that the strategic party proposal constitutes a superior proposal,” RR Donnelley said in a release.
RR Donnelley was at the center of a bidding war between Chatham and Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Holdings for more than a month until its board decided on Dec. 10 to go with the former. Chatham already owns around 15% stake in the company.
If RR Donnelley does agree for purchase by the strategic party, the latter will pay both the expense reimbursement and the Atlas termination fee refund to Chatham on the company’s behalf. This will amount to at least $32 million, according to the RR Donnelley release.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks traded higher in Thursday morning trading, leaving them poised to end the year strongly amid growing confidence the Omicron Covid variant won’t cause serious economic damage.
At 11 AM ET (1600 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 34 points, or 0.1%, the S&P 500 traded 6 points higher, or 0.12%, higher and the Nasdaq Composite rose 63 points, or 0.4%. The Russell 2000 outgained its large-cap peers, trading up .8%. 
All three major indices are on course to close the year higher, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average entering the day up 28% and 19%, respectively, and the Nasdaq Composite up 22%.
Stock markets are rising on hopes fresh coronavirus-related curbs and restrictions may not be needed going into the new year, even as Covid-19 cases, largely of the Omicron variant, surge.
Helping the tone Thursday was the news of a study showing a booster dose of Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) single-dose vaccine was 84% effective  at preventing hospitalization in South African healthcare workers who became infected by the Omicron variant. Shares were up .6% in early trading.
Additionally, Covid-19 deaths and hospitalizations are ""comparatively"" low, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said on Wednesday, as cases in the United States reached a record high.
Elsewhere, Micron (NASDAQ:MU) is in the spotlight after the chipmaker warned that strict Covid-19 curbs in the Chinese city of Xi’an could disrupt its chip manufacturing unit in the area. Shares are down 1.5% in morning trading.
Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) stock dropped 7.1% after Samsung (KS:005930) Biologics scotched media reports that it is buying the American biotech company. Biogen is slightly ahead of where it was when the reports came out, and several analysts have written notes supporting the rationale for BIIB to sell itself, whether to the Korean conglomerate or someone else. 
Thursday’s main economic release, the weekly initial jobless claims number, showed a drop of 8K to 198,000 from the previous week’s 206,000, as last week's number was revised up 1,000. Claims are a level that is generally consistent with pre-pandemic levels, though the 4-week moving average set a 52-year low.
Oil prices fell Thursday, handing back some recent gains but set to end the year with growing optimism that energy demand will prove resilient in the face of the omicron virus wave.
U.S. crude oil inventories fell by 3.6 million barrels in the week to Dec. 24, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, released Wednesday, suggesting demand remains strong in the world’s largest energy consumer.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $76.93 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.4% to $79.53. The contracts are on course to post gains of between 50% and 60% in 2021, the biggest annual advances in more than a decade. This rise came amidst cuts from China to their import allocations, a bearish sign for oil demand.
Additionally, gold futures reversed earlier losses to trade up .27% to $1,810.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1324.
Other notable movers on Thursday include a bevy of casino stocks, including Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) (4.3%), Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) (+3%), and  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) (+2.8%). A handful of media and social media stocks, including Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) (+3.9%), ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) (3.8%) and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) (3.6%) are also seeing a bid. Both groups may be benefiting from the end of tax-loss selling as they have been either down for the year or significantly down from highs as we close out 2021.
On the flipside, Pool Corporation (NASDAQ:POOL) is down 2.2%, while CF Industries Holdings Inc (NYSE:CF) is down 1.6% and APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA) is down 1.6%. Each of those have been big winners this year, so again there may be some rebalancing going on.

(Reuters) - U.S. media and digital solutions firm Insignia Systems extended its month-long rally into the final hours of December, setting itself up for the best month in decades, as retail investors scooped up shares of the heavily shorted micro-cap company.
Insignia added nearly 20% on Thursday as of 0322 GMT and has gained more than fivefold in December, heading for the best monthly performance since its debut in 1991. 
The company has surged 130% so far this week, but the jump still pales in comparison to a 319% weekly rise in early December when it said it was exploring strategic options.
Insignia currently tops Fintel's leaderboard used to track companies that have the highest likelihood of experiencing a short squeeze, while analytics firm S3 Partners estimates a short interest of 63.6% on its free float. 
The Minneapolis-based company is among the top trending companies on investor-focused social media Stocktwits.com and also the third-most ordered stock by individual Fidelity investors, according to Fidelity Research.
Stocks with high short interest have been in spotlight this year, ever since individual investors coordinating on online message boards helped fuel stunning rallies in shares of companies such as AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop (NYSE:GME) and cost short sellers billions of dollars.
Over the past thirty days, the short interest in Insignia rose by 543,000 shares, worth $6 million, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analysis at S3 Partners. There was slight short covering last week with 16,000 shares worth $182,000.
""It has to be long buying,"" said Dusaniwsky. ""This is a stock with a small market cap, small float and tiny amount of borrows available – there will be virtually no new short selling in this stock due to lack to stock loan supply.""
Insignia had 1.77 million shares outstanding and a market capitalization of $40.7 million as of Dec. 29, Refinitiv data showed.

CHENNAI (Reuters) - Foreign automakers have indicated an interest to the government of India's Tamil Nadu state in acquiring Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's plant there, the state industries minister said on Thursday, after inconclusive talks with the Tata Group. 
Ford India said in September it would wind down operations at a factory in Western Gujarat state by end-2021 and vehicle and engine manufacturing at the Tamil Nadu plant by 2022, as it did not see a path to profitability in the country. 
""Early stage talks are going on,"" Thangam Thennarasu, industries minister of Tamil Nadu told Reuters, adding that he could not give details of which firms were interested. 
""It is eventually up to Ford as it will be a commercial arrangement. We are merely facilitating talks between the companies,"" he said. Thennarasu said the Tata Group had also shown an interest in buying the Ford plant, having met the state's chief minister and visited the plant for a preliminary study but the state government had yet to hear from them about any deal. 
""It is now up to them to make an official announcement,"" Thennarasu told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. 
Ford, asked about which firms might be interested in buying the Tamil Nadu plant, told Reuters in a statement: ""We continue to explore possible alternatives for our manufacturing facilities but have nothing further to share."" 

Tamil Nadu, a state of more than 70 million people and one of the country's most industrialised, is sometimes called the ""Detroit of Asia"". It is home to factories of companies including BMW, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), Hyundai, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) and  Renault  (PA:RENA). 
Thennarasu said the state has been receiving interest from electric vehicle manufacturers and battery makers. Ride-sharing company Ola, which has started an electric scooter manufacturing facility in the state, has expressed plans to expand, he said.

85,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2021 11:00AM ET</span>","Analysis-Hoping for cheaper gas to come, Europe reverses Russian link to tap storage","By Vladimir Soldatkin
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Gas traders are relying on stockpiles to supply European buyers and avoid paying near record-high prices, industry sources and market analysts said, explaining the unusual reverse in direction of flows through a major Russian pipeline.
The 33 billion cubic metre (bcm) Yamal-Europe Pipeline, which accounts for about one sixth of Russia's exports to Europe and Turkey, has been in reverse mode since Dec. 21, meaning gas is being shipped east from Germany to Poland.
In Poland, which failed to conclude a new gas supply deal with Russia last year, some traders have already used their annual contracted volumes from Russian supplier Gazprom (MCX:GAZP). 
That would mean paying high spot prices if they buy extra gas from Russia, so they are instead drawing from storage. Their hope is that by the time stocks run low, prices will be cheaper, but the risk is over-reliance on stocks will keep the market high for longer.
""Gas is being lifted from Europe's underground storage facilities in Germany,"" Gazprom spokesman Sergey Kupriyanov told Russia's NTV channel on Saturday.
He said it was ""not rational"" to drain stockpiles in the peak demand winter season.
Gazprom's clients from Germany and France had also used up their annual contractual gas purchasing volumes, he said further.
In France, Gazprom's main partner is Engie, while in Germany, it is Uniper, Wingas, Shell (LON:RDSa) and Wintershall Dea.
The companies have not responded to requests for comment. 
Gazprom on Thursday said Europe has withdrawn more than 45% of the gas it has injected into storage this year.
NEW YEAR, NEW DIRECTION?
A source close to Gazprom, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the press, said the pipeline was expected to resume its usual westward gas flows early in January. For January, Gazprom has booked 8.3 million kilowatt hours per hour (kWh/h) of gas transit capacity via the pipeline.
In the absence of Poland's usual long-term gas deal, Gazprom has booked the short-term transit capacity, but it has not done so in the last 10 days, prompting criticism from the West it was deliberately adding to price pressure, which Russia has denied.
Russia is at odds with the West over a series of issues and is waiting for German and European Union approval for its new Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said supply from the new link could calm prices. https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/putin-declares-nord-stream-2-ready-gas-exports-2021-12-29
He has also said Germany was reselling Russian gas to Poland and Ukraine and blamed the pipeline reversal, and rocketing prices, on German gas importers.
The German Economy Ministry has declined to comment on Putin's remark.
""The current flow direction reflects the behaviour of the market players. The German market is supplied via other transport routes,"" Germany's Federal Grid Agency said.
The consistent reverse flows have added to the price frenzy in Europe. Benchmark gas price reached an all-time high last week of more than 180 euros per megawatt hour, compared with 19 euros at the start of 2021. 
Prices have eased to below 100 euros since last week, helped in part by arrivals of LNG shipments.
Alexei Grivach of the Moscow-based National Energy Security Fund said current spot prices were unaffordable for most industrial consumers.
""For some (gas buyers), it's more profitable to lift more gas from underground storage facilities, some seek to redirect LNG (liquefied natural gas) volumes to Europe,"" he said. 
A spokesman for Polish energy company PGNiG acknowledged the reverse flows were happening but would not go into detail.
""I cannot confirm whether the gas coming back from Germany is going to PGNiG, as there are many companies on the market and we consider this a trade secret,"" the spokesman said.

Katja Yafimava a senior research fellow from the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies Gas Research Programme, said there was no need for Gazprom to book capacity on Yamal if it does not have requests for gas on the other side of the pipeline. 
""So the European buyers have a choice of drawing gas from storages and liquefied natural gas  - or asking Gazprom to conclude new contracts/amend existing contracts allowing for higher volumes,"" she said.

87,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2021 10:31AM ET</span>",Germany to pull the plug on three of its last six nuclear plants,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will pull the plug on three of its last six nuclear power stations on Friday, another step towards completing its withdrawal from nuclear power as it turns its focus to renewables.
The government decided to speed up its phasing out of nuclear power following Japan's Fukushima reactor meltdown in 2011 when an earthquake and tsunami destroyed the coastal plant in the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl 25 years earlier.
The reactors of Brokdorf, Grohnde and Gundremmingen C, run by utilities E.ON and RWE, will be shut down on Friday after three and half decades in operation. 
The last three nuclear power plants - Isar 2, Emsland and Neckarwestheim II - will be turned off by the end of 2022.
The phase-out of an energy deemed clean and cheap by some is an irreversible step for Europe's biggest economy, facing ambitious climate targets and rising power prices.
""For the energy industry in Germany, the nuclear phase-out is final,"" said Kerstin Andreae, the head of energy industry association BDEW.
The six nuclear power plants contributed to around 12% of electricity production in Germany in 2021, BDEW preliminary figures showed. The share of renewable energy was almost 41%, with coal generating just under 28% and gas around 15%. 
Germany aims to make renewables meet 80% of power demand by 2030 through expanding wind and solar power infrastructure. 
The new government, which plans to step up climate protection efforts, stood by the nuclear power phase-out in its coalition agreement.
Economy and Climate Protection Minister Robert Habeck on Wednesday said he did not see the anti-nuclear consensus weakening in Germany.
Environmental groups welcomed the move but warned that 2022 was not the real end of the nuclear era in Germany.
""We have to say that there will still be uranium enrichment plants in Germany, like the one in Gronau,"" Arne Fellermann, a manager at the BUND environmental group, told Reuters.
""There is also a research reactor in Garching that still works with weapons-grade uranium,"" Fellermann added.
Asked about possible job losses, Gundremmingen mayor Tobias Buehler said the plant's employees would be busy with dismantling the reactor after the shutdown. 
""And this period of dismantling will certainly take another one or two decades,"" Buehler said.
Total costs for the dismantling are estimated by E.ON at 1.1 billion euros ($1.25 billion) per plant. In 2020, E.ON made provisions of 9.4 billion euros for the nuclear post-operational phase, including dismantling the facility, packaging and cleaning up the radioactive waste.
The dismantling is expected to be completed by 2040.

Japan's government on Tuesday mapped out a plan for releasing contaminated water from the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant into the sea, angering neighbouring China and South Korea.

Investing.com – Lucid stock (NASDAQ:LCID) rose 3% Thursday after Citi rated it a buy with a potential to hit $57, a 48% appreciation from the current levels.
While not ignoring the risks the company faces, Citi analyst Itay Michaeli said the company has demonstrated leading EV technology “credentials with a best-in-class blend of range, performance, charging dynamics and price.”
According to the analyst, the company is still early to the premium EV market with the launch of its first vehicle, the Air, upcoming.
Lucid aims to produce 20,000 vehicles in 2022 and 50,000 the following year.
The analyst believes the company’s updates on the launch of Air, the build up of manufacturing capabilities, brand awareness and its financial performance compared with prior projections are some factors that could take the stock price to its target.
On the risk side, he believes the company, still being pre-revenue, is yet to “successfully navigate production ramp-ups.”
Over three months ago, the Environmental Protection Agency certified that Lucid’s Air Dream Edition Range of cars outstrips any other in the EV space, including the most popular Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Lucid’s 19-inch wheel secured a rating of 520 miles on one full charge, making it the longest-range EV yet rated by the body. That title once belonged to Tesla's Model S Long Range Plus.
The company got a subpoena from the SEC on Dec. 3 to furnish documents pertaining to its merger with blank-check firm Churchill Capital.
The SEC request pertains to certain projections and statements surrounding the combination. It said it is cooperating fully with the SEC in its review.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - More than 50,000 Finnish industrial workers plan to go on strike in January in a wage dispute, potentially shutting down plants in mining, metals and technology, three labour unions said on Thursday.
Finnish industrial employers say higher wages threaten competitiveness while unions say the current pay offer will worsen employees' standard of living.
The 10-day strike planned to start on Jan. 14 would affect operations at over 200 companies in Finland including Nokia (NYSE:NOK), Kone, Metso (OTC:MXTOF) Outotec and Outokumpu as well as Swedish firms Sandvik and SSAB and Swiss ABB.
The unions will meet with Finland's National Conciliator on Jan. 4 to try to find a solution on wage increases in the new collective labour agreement, the conciliator's office said on Thursday.
Another strike is set to shut down forestry company UPM's Finnish plants for three weeks starting Jan. 1 after UPM rejected workers' demands for a company-specific collective labour agreement. 

In October 2020, Finnish Forest Industries, the federation representing forestry companies, said it would quit collective bargaining and replace industry-wide agreements with companies negotiating with directly with staff. 
UPM rival Stora Enso (OTC:SEOAY) signed company-specific collective agreements in October

Investing.com — Future Fintech Group Inc (NASDAQ:FTFT) shares rose 21% on Thursday after the company said it has established a new blockchain division that will manage its existing blockchain sector business.
The blockchain-based e-commerce company said the new division will help it execute its strategic growth plan.
Future Fintech's stock price is still down more than 34% for the year.
The new division's goal will be to develop, operate and manage the company's Bitcoin mining farm plans in the United States and Paraguay. Earlier this month, the company revealed it entered a pact with APC Service Ltd to establish a joint venture to build a crypto mining farm in the U.S.
In addition, the new division will also coordinate its Dubai-based digital currency trading service and crypto asset management business through its subsidiary FTFT Capital Investments.
Shanchun Huang, CEO of Future Fintech, told investors that the company is ""actively developing a sophisticated and cutting-edge financial services platform,"" and is also intent upon ""executing a global expansion strategy for our cryptocurrency mining business."" 
""The establishment of this new division with responsibility for executing this strategy underscores our commitment to being a leading firm in this sector,"" added Huang."

Investing.com – Johnson & Johnson stock (NYSE:JNJ) edged 0.3% higher Thursday in premarket trading as a real-world study showed that a booster of the drug maker's single-dose Covid-19 vaccine was 84% effective at preventing hospitalization in South African healthcare workers who were infected with Omicron.
The study showed the J&J vaccine's effectiveness at preventing hospitalization rose from 63% shortly after a booster was administered to 84% 14 days later. Effectiveness touched 85% at one to two months post-boost.
The findings were from a study involving a homologous (same vaccine) booster shot. The findings have not been peer-reviewed.
A separate study involving the application of the J&J booster in case of people initially vaccinated by Pfizer-BioNTech's (NASDAQ:BNTX) two-dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine also threw up positive results against the mutant.
The second analysis showed the J&J booster generated 41-fold increase in neutralizing antibodies and a five-fold increase in immunity-enhancing T-cells against Omicron.
J&J has trailed  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) in vaccinations in the U.S., which has approved only these three firms to market their vaccines in the country. It is also the only single-dose vaccine available in the country.
The company wasn’t seen as a big beneficiary of the FDA decision earlier to allow boosters – the time when Omicron wasn’t the threat it emerged to be -- but with Omicron now raging in U.S. and rest of the world, the findings could boost its prospects.
Fresh cases of Covid topped 488,000 on Wednesday in the U.S., according to the New York Times, a new record."

Over 1,000 flights were canceled within, into, or out of the United States as of Thursday morning, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.com.
""We expect the number of COVID cases in the northeast – where most of our crew members are based – to continue to surge for the next week or two,"" JetBlue's spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Shares of China Evergrande Group tumbled on Thursday after the embattled real estate developer did not pay offshore coupons due earlier this week.
Evergrande, whose $19 billion in international bonds are in cross-default after missing a deadline to pay coupons earlier this month, had new coupon payments worth $255 million due on Tuesday for its June 2023 and 2025 notes.
At least some investors holding the two bonds have not yet received the coupons, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter. Both the payments have a 30-day grace period.
Evergrande's shares ended down 9.1% on Thursday, while the benchmark Hang Seng index edged up 0.1%.
Bloomberg News reported earlier that the due date passed with no sign of payment by the property developer.
Evergrande's Thursday decline wiped out gains from earlier this week, when the market cheered the initial progress made by the firm in resuming construction work.
Company Chairman Hui Ka Yan vowed in a meeting on Sunday to deliver 39,000 units of properties in December, compared with fewer than 10,000 in each of the previous three months.
""(The non-payments) show Evergrande is still not doing okay even though it is delivering homes,"" said Thomas Kwok, head of equity business of CHIEF Securities in Hong Kong.
The market confidence in Evergrande and the China property sector is weak, as there could be more defaults with many bonds due in January, Kwok added.

Evergrande has more than $300 billion in liabilities and is scrambling to raise cash by selling assets and shares to repay suppliers and creditors.
The fate of Evergrande and other indebted Chinese property companies has gripped financial markets in recent months amid fears of knock-on effects, with Beijing repeatedly seeking to reassure investors.

95,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 30, 2021 09:00AM ET</span>",2022 Outlook: How Will India's Nifty Perform Amid Global Uncertainties?,"by Malvika Gurung
After setting record highs in a roller-coaster ride of a year largely dominated by bulls, Dalal Street has seen more volatile trading recently. High global inflation has led to foreign investors withdrawing money from India’s markets amid headwinds like the US Fed looking to accelerate tapering plans and hike interest rates three times next year. All this along with an uptick in Covid-19 cases and supply chain disruptions led to a bumpier finish to the year.
With that as a backdrop, here’s what can be expected from the Indian equity benchmark index Nifty 50 in 2022.
The calendar year 2021 has been nothing short of a bumper year for equities. Buoyed by positive market sentiment, liberal monetary policy, massive liquidity, lower interest rates, an uptick in economic recovery, and highly valued asset prices, the Indian benchmark equity indices rallied in 2021.
The Nifty 50 surged 23% and the BSE Sensex 21% on a YTD basis as of December 29th’s close. This even with a roughly 10% correction in the Sensex and the Nifty 50 from all-time highs on October 19th. The MSCI India Index  grew 24.7% in USD terms, compared to a 4.9% gain for the MSCI AC Asia Pacific ex Japan index. 
Despite the second wave of the pandemic in India, this year witnessed a strong gain in momentum, led by better-than-estimated macro recovery, increased vaccination drive, the government’s policy reforms encouraging investments, stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings results and a flurry of new listings. Indian markets also appeared to be less affected by the Delta variant than developed markets.
In its final meeting for the year, RBI (Reserve Bank of India) announced it would keep key rates like repo and reverse repo unchanged, in line with investor expectations. This contrasted with the US Federal Reserve, which announced plans to accelerate cutting back its pandemic-era bond purchases by March 2022 and indicated it would raise the interest rates three times next year to curb rising inflation.
This year was also marked by fluctuations in the money from Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) flowing into the capital market. On the one hand, their net investments in domestic equities and debt instruments accounted for $3.8 billion in September 2021, the highest in 9 months. Major investments were made in the telecom, media, oil & gas and construction material stocks.
However, due to several headwinds over the past two months, the domestic market has witnessed a heavy outflow of foreign investment, with an almost 10% correction, due to surging Omicron cases in developed markets and rapid withdrawal of incentives from the US. As of November, there were five months of outflows, making this one of the weakest years for inflows in the last five. 
2021 also witnessed a flurry in new public listings on the Indian exchanges at premium valuations, and that pace is now slowing as inflation and liquidity drainage enter the frame, setting the stage for a further market correction. The contrasting fortunes of  Zomato  Ltd (NS:ZOMT) (BO:ZOMT), which listed in July and popped 65%, and then went on to maintain those gains, and One 97 Communications Ltd (BO:PAYT) (NS:PAYT), the largest ever IPO in India, which fell 27% and then continued to drop towards the end of the year after listing in November, highlights this change in market behavior. 
Looking at the record highs and the standout year asset classes have had in 2021, analysts are bracing for more moderate performance in 2022.
Market experts peg the Indian economy to grow by 8-9% in the 2022-23 period. With the economy gradually moving towards pre-Covid levels, the economic outlook is an obvious positive for Dalal Street.
At the same time, major factors like the resurgence of Omicron-induced lockdowns and global monetary policy tightening may make it difficult for equities to recover recent losses or for flows to come into the Indian market until later in the year.
The question of valuation matters as well, and in that sense the recent correction might help reset the market perceptions, leading to a stronger 2022 for the Indian equity market, the Chairman of Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd (NS:MOFS) suggests.
Some experts believe that once the market reaches about 15% correction, FPIs will return to Indian equities in force given the buying opportunities. The return of FPIs and institutional money might spur the huge retail investor base in the domestic market to  buy back into the market, supporting growth. 
Market veterans and brokerages forecast Nifty to end 2022 in the range of 17,000 to  20,200 points, from the current 17,214-level, backed by a strong outlook of corporate earnings growth. Its EPS is estimated to have increased 15% annually from FY19-21, and going forward net profit margins on the Nifty50 are expected to be 16% in FY23E. 
Global inflation will remain a threat. The US is witnessing its highest inflation figures in 40 years, with the CPI at 6.8%. UK inflation is at 5%, the highest in 10 years. Rising global inflation could cause knock-on effects in emerging markets like India. Indian equities are the most expensive in the APAC region, making them especially vulnerable to this effect. 
Indian CPI for 2022 is estimated at 5.8% from 5.2% in 2021. The inflation could seep into the upcoming year and companies will have to choose between passing price hikes on to consumers or sacrificing margins.
However, despite the downsides of inflation, some strategists expect corporate earnings to improve over the next 6 months, led by a slow but growing economic trajectory. Moreover, analysts have yet to cut back their overall estimates on corporate earnings growth for Nifty 50 companies.
Due to a healthier fiscal and current account position, India is better-placed to counter global headwinds like accelerating inflation, hiccups in the pandemic recovery, and supply chain disruptions.
Furthermore, as the China Plus One global investment policy has started to pick up pace, along with buoyant start-up capital and IPO market, and an impressive private equity sector, India’s economic outlook should remain positive, with domestic demand continuing to be robust.
Whether valuations mean that Indian indices will first consolidate or pull back before rising again remains to be seen. However, in the long term, the factors driving India’s growth are trending well, which over time should be reflected in earnings and stock prices, as stated by an analyst at Federated Hermes.
Going forward, experts are overweight on the stocks of financials (including banking, financial services, and insurance), capital goods, FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods), real estate, and technology.

Investing.com – Didi Global ADRs (NYSE:DIDI) traded 4.3% lower in Thursday’s premarket as the ride-hailing firm slipped deep into red in the third quarter, hurt by falling revenue and higher regulatory costs.
The company today revealed a 30.4-billion-yuan ($4.7 billion) loss for the quarter ended September 30, compared to a 665-million-yuan ($103 million) net profit in the same period a year ago.
Revenue fell to 42.7 billion yuan ($6.7 billion) from 43.4 billion yuan a year earlier.
The company booked an investment loss of almost 21 billion yuan, mainly on account of its recent foray into the highly competitive business of delivering hyper-local groceries.
Didi's public career has been tumultuous from the start. Authorities in China, after finding that Didi ignored their advice on delaying its public issue pending a scrutiny of its data handling practices, first placed limits on its onboarding new users while also mandating online app stores to take its apps off their platforms.
The company later decided to delist from the NYSE, and list in Hong Kong, a move that reports attribute to pressure from the Chinese regulators. The Hong Kong listing is a work in progress.
The regulatory upheaval has cost the company customers while also raising compliance costs for it.
Spending rose 16% during the quarter after Didi was forced to comply with new requirements to better compensate its drivers and improve data governance. Interest income fell by more than a third.

A December 21 notice posted on National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s website said Tesla is recalling all 2017-2020 Model 3 vehicles.

Tesla will inspect and install a guide protector and new cable harness as necessary, free of charge.
The second matter affects the company’s Model S vehicles made between 2014 and 2021. Here, the vehicles’ front trunk latch assembly may be misaligned, preventing the secondary hood latch from engaging. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of federal motor vehicle safety standards, NHTA said.
In both the cases, Tesla will do the necessary repairs free of charge. According to the safety body, Tesla is likely to mail the vehicle owners by February 18 to inform them about the proposed remedy.

(Reuters) -Samsung Electronics and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), two of the world's largest memory chip makers, warned that strict COVID-19 curbs in the Chinese city of Xian could disrupt their chip manufacturing bases in the area.
The lockdown in the city puts further pressure on global supply chains and adds to a torturous year for exporters facing sharply higher freight costs even as prices for raw materials including semiconductors skyrocket amid the two-year long pandemic. 
The curbs could cause delays in the supply of DRAM memory chips, widely used in data centres, Micron said on Wednesday. 
The stringent restrictions, which went into effect earlier this month, may be increasingly difficult to mitigate and have resulted in thinner staffing levels at the manufacturing site, Micron added.
Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) also said on Wednesday that it would temporarily adjust operations at its Xian manufacturing facilities for NAND flash memory chips, used for data storage in data centres, smartphones and other tech gadgets.
Samsung (KS:005930)'s Xian semiconductor facility is currently operating normally, Chinese media group Yicai reported on Thursday. Analysis provider TrendForce also said Samsung's Xian plant is manufacturing without significant disruptions for now and supply of raw materials seems sufficient, but there may be a slight decline in output if the pandemic is not controlled. 
""The impact on global supply is controllable, though there are uncertainties,"" said Yan Chengyin, consultant and manager at Beijing-based Bayes Consulting.
""The uncertainty is how soon the spread of the virus can be stopped and factories can return to work as normal. In our experience, clusters of cases will be under control very soon in China. Also I think the local government will try to support large foreign companies like Samsung.""
Seoul-based analysts said chips made in Samsung's Xian NAND plant mainly go to China with limited shipments heading overseas. Some of the biggest demand for the kind of chips made in the plant come from Chinese server companies, they added. 
TrendForce said on that smartphone and notebook computer makers may be directly impacted by any changes in operations at the Xian production base, but noted that Samsung's relatively high inventory level can supply buyers without any snags in the short run. 
Chinese officials have imposed tough curbs on travel within and leaving Xian from Dec. 23, in line with Beijing's drive to immediately contain outbreaks as they appear. 
The COVID-19 outbreak in Xian is the biggest seen by any Chinese city this year, with over 1,100 cases in total during the latest flare-up.
""We are tapping our global supply chain, including our subcontractor partners, to help service our customers for these DRAM products,"" Micron said in a blog post https://www.micron.com/about/blog/2021/december/micron-statement-on-current-situation-in-xi-an-china.
""We project that these efforts will allow us to meet most of our customer demand, however there may be some near-term delays as we activate our network,"" the company said.
Micron added that it was working to minimize the risk of virus transmission and had employed measures including physical distancing and on-site testing and was encouraging vaccination.

Samsung's memory chip operation in Xian is one of the largest foreign projects in China. The tech giant has two production lines in Xian making advanced NAND Flash products, which account for 42.5% of its total NAND flash memory production capacity and 15.3% of the overall global output capacity, according to TrendForce. 
Samsung is expected to announce October-December earnings results in January.

Any such deal would be the biggest overseas acquisition ever by a South Korean company, easily eclipsing Samsung Electronics  Co Ltd (KS:005930) (OTC:SSNLF) $8 billion acquisition of auto electronics maker Harman International Industries in 2016.
Earlier this month, Biogen nearly halved the prices of its Alzheimer’s drug aduhelm to $28,200 per year for an average weight person.
The cut came as sales have been slow to take off because of the high-cost treatment. Many hospitals have refused to support the treatment.
On June 7, aduhelm became the first drug in 18 years to secure the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s nod for treatment of patients suffering from the neurodegenerative disease.
The company now believes with insurance coverage, and access to diagnostics and specialized centers, approximately 50,000 patients may initiate treatment with aduhelm in 2022."
105,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2021 05:16AM ET</span>","Women force change at Indian iPhone plant, sick from bad food, crowded dorms","By Sudarshan Varadhan, A. Ananthalakshmi and Ahmed Farhatha
SRIPERUMBUDUR, India (Reuters) -For women who assembled iPhones at a Foxconn plant in southern India, crowded dorms without flush toilets and food sometimes crawling with worms were problems to be endured for the paycheck.
But when tainted food sickened over 250 of the workers their anger boiled over, culminating in a rare protest that shut down a plant where 17,000 had been working.
A close look by Reuters at the events before and after the Dec. 17 protest casts a stark light on living and working conditions at Foxconn, a firm central to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s supply chain.
The tumult comes at a time when Apple is ramping up production of its iPhone 13 and shareholders are pushing the company to provide greater transparency about labour conditions at suppliers.
Reuters spoke to six women who worked at the Foxconn plant near Chennai. All of them requested they not to be named because of fear of retaliation on the job or from police.
Workers slept on the floor in rooms, which housed between six to 30 women, five of these workers said. Two workers said the hostel they lived in had toilets without running water.
""People living in the hostels always had some illness or the other -- skin allergies, chest pain, food poisoning,"" another worker, a 21-year-old woman who quit the plant after the protest, told Reuters. Earlier food poisoning cases had involved one or two workers, she said.
""We didn't make a big deal out of it because we thought it will be fixed. But now, it affected a lot of people,"" she said.
FOXCONN PLANT ON PROBATION
Apple and Foxconn said on Wednesday they found that some dormitories and dining rooms used for employees at the factory did not meet required standards.
The facility has been placed ""on probation"" and Apple will ensure its strict standards are met before the plant reopens, an Apple spokesperson said.
""We found that some of the remote dormitory accommodations and dining rooms being used for employees do not meet our requirements and we are working with the supplier to ensure a comprehensive set of corrective actions are rapidly implemented.""
The spokesperson did not elaborate on the improvements that would be made for workers at the plant or the standards that would be applied.
Laws governing housing for women workers in Tamil Nadu mandate each person be allocated at least 120 square feet of living space and require housing to adhere to hygiene and fire safety standards as laid out by local authorities.
Foxconn said it was restructuring its local management team and taking immediate steps to improve facilities. All employees would continue to be paid while it makes necessary improvements to restart operations, the company said.
Venpa Staffing Services, a Foxconn contractor that runs the dorm where workers were sickened by food poisoning, declined to comment.
The food poisoning and subsequent protests have also led to investigations, some of which are ongoing, by at least four Tamil Nadu state agencies. Officials have also privately told Foxconn to ensure better conditions, senior state government officials said.
""It is Foxconn's responsibility,"" Thangam Thennarasu, the industries minister of Tamil Nadu state told Reuters.
The Tamil Nadu state government said in a statement last week that the state had asked Foxconn to ensure that working and living conditions were improved, including the quality of housing and drinking water.
Foxconn has agreed to ensure that worker living conditions follow government recommendations and meet legal requirements, the statement said.
Apple and Foxconn did not indicate when the plant would reopen.
Foxconn had told state officials that it had ""ramped up production too quickly,"" though production was curtailed during April and May when the Delta variant of COVID-19 was raging in India, a senior government official from the state's industries department told Reuters.
Taiwan-based Foxconn opened the plant in 2019 with the promise of creating up to 25,000 jobs, a boost to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Make in India"" campaign to create manufacturing jobs.
Sriperumbudur, a town outside Chennai where the factory is situated, is a busy industrial area with factories that make Samsung (KS:005930) and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) products nearby.
The factory is central to Apple's efforts to shift production away from China due to tensions between Beijing and Washington. Reuters reported last year that Foxconn planned to invest up to $1 billion in the plant over three years.
Foxconn contracts out the staffing of the factory to labour brokers, who are also responsible for housing the workers – mostly women – employed there.
RATS AND POOR DRAINAGE
Following the protests, food safety inspectors visited the hostel where the bout of food poisoning occurred and closed the dorm's kitchen after finding rats and poor drainage, Jegadish Chandra Bose, a senior food safety officer in the Thiruvallur district where the hostel is located, told Reuters.
""The samples analysed did not meet the required safety standards,"" he said.
The women who work at the Foxconn plant make the equivalent of about $140 (10,500 Indian rupees) in a month and pay Foxconn's contractor for housing and food while they work at the plant. 
Most workers are between 18 and 22 and come from rural areas of Tamil Nadu, the head of a women workers' union said. The monthly pay at the plant is more than a third higher than the minimum wage for such jobs, according to state government guidelines.
The 21-year-old worker who quit following the protest, told Reuters that her parents are farmers growing rice and sugarcane. She said she looked for a city job like many others in her village and considered the Foxconn wages good.
Several activists and academics said women recruited from farming villages to work in Sriperumbudur's factories are seen by employers as less likely to unionise or demonstrate, a factor that made the protests at the Foxconn factory - which isn't unionised - even more notable.
V. Gajendran, assistant professor at Madras School of Social Work in Chennai, said women recruited to work in nearby factories ""typically come from larger, poor, rural families, which exposes them to exploitation and reduces their ability to unionise and fight for their rights.""
'WE WERE ALARMED'
The food poisoning incident sent 159 women from one dorm to hospital on Dec 15, workers told Reuters. Some 100 more women needed medical attention but were not hospitalised, the Thiruvallur district administration said last week.
A rumour - later proved to be false - circulated that some of the women who had fallen sick had died. When some sick workers failed to show up for work at the factory two days later, others staged a protest when shifts were changing.
""We were alarmed and we talked among each other in the hostel and decided to protest. There was no one leader,"" one of the workers told Reuters.
On December 17, about 2,000 women from the nearby Foxconn hostels took to the streets, blocking a key highway near the factory, the district administration said.
Male workers, including some from a nearby auto factory, joined a renewed protest the next day, the Foxconn workers Reuters spoke to said.
Police responded to the larger, second protest by striking the male workers and then chasing and striking some of the women involved, two workers and Sujata Mody, a local union leader who had interviewed workers told Reuters.
Police detained 67 women workers and a local journalist, confiscated their phones, and called their parents with a warning to get their daughters in line, three of those detained, local union leaders, and a lawyer who was trying to help those detained told Reuters.
Reuters could not independently confirm the descriptions of the police response.
M Sudhakar, the top police official in Kancheepuram district, denied that protesters were beaten, phones were confiscated, or that workers were intimidated by police.
""We strictly adhered to guidelines and respected the rights of those who were detained. All rules were followed,"" he told Reuters.
K. Mohan, a village-level administrator who went to the hostel where the food poisoning incident occurred to investigate living conditions on Dec 16, found no safeguards to prevent COVID-19 infections, he told police in testimony reviewed by Reuters.
""I went to that place to investigate since there is a chance that this place could become a COVID cluster,"" Mohan told police. ""The women were made to stay in the hostel where no coronavirus guidelines were being followed.""
The unrest at Foxconn was the second involving an Apple supplier in India in a year. In December 2020, thousands of contract workers at a factory owned by Wistron Corp destroyed equipment and vehicles over the alleged non-payment of wages, causing estimated damage of $60 million.

Apple had then said it placed Wistron on probation and that it would not award the Taiwanese contract manufacturer new business until it addressed the way workers were treated at the plant.
At the time, Wistron said it had worked to raise standards and fix issues at the factory, including the payroll systems. Wistron restarted operations at the plant earlier this year. Apple had no immediate comment on Wistron's status when asked by Reuters. ($1=74.53 rupees)

Investing.com – Micron stock (NASDAQ:MU) traded 0.6% lower in Thursday’s premarket after the chipmaker warned a day earlier that strict Covid-19 curbs in the Chinese city of Xi’an could disrupt its chip manufacturing unit in the area.
Micron said while it is meeting most of its customer demand, there may be some near-term delays. But it warned that new or more stringent Covid-19 restrictions could be increasingly difficult to mitigate.
Authorities in Xi’an, which is around 600 miles southwest of Beijing, ordered a strict lockdown last week with residents barred from leaving home as Covid cases in the country touched levels last seen in 2020.
Micron said the city’s closure has reduced Micron’s team member and contractor workforce at its Xi’an site, resulting in some impact to output levels of its DRAM assembly and test operations there.
The company said it is working with suppliers in the region that also face similar challenges.
Dynamic random access memory chips or DRAM, which go into both personal computers and servers, accounted for 72% of the company’s FY21 revenue.
Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) was another company issuing a similar warning Wednesday. Its shares closed 0.6% lower in Seoul today.
The warnings couldn't come have come at a worse time for the broader supply chain. Shortage of chips, fueled by the pandemic-driven demand for gadgets and the general pivot of the automobile industry to smarter cars, has meant longer wait for consumers for their mobiles and laptops which are also only more expensive than they were a year ago. At the same time, consistent demand has helped drive Micron to near all-time highs.

107,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2021 04:25AM ET</span>",SenseTime shares jump as much as 23% on debut after $740 million Hong Kong IPO,"By Scott Murdoch and Kane Wu
(Reuters) - SenseTime Group shares surged as much as 23% from their IPO price on Thursday, adding billions of dollars to the artificial intelligence start-up's market value as it debuted in Hong Kong in the city's final major float for the year.
Some analysts had expected the shares to struggle due to weak demand during the IPO process and worries about SenseTime's inclusion on a U.S. investment blacklist that prompted the Chinese firm to shelve its first attempt to list.
""The main reason that support is coming to the share price is that the market had already digested the U.S. sanction issue,"" said Kenny Ng, Everbright Sun Hung Kai analyst.
""SenseTime set the IPO price at the lower end of the range which left room for the price performance after listing.""
The Chinese company raised $740 million in its initial public offering and priced its shares at HK$3.85 ($0.4937) each.
The deal valued SenseTime at $16.4 billion, while at the session's high its market capitalisation had added some $3.8 billion. 
SenseTime ended at HK$4.13 in its debut session, up 7.3% from its IPO price. It was the fifth most actively traded stock by turnover with 329.97 million shares changing hands worth HK$1.406 bln. 
The broader Hang Seng Index gained just 0.11% while tech stocks in Hong Kong were marginally positive on the day. 
SenseTime's IPO was Hong Kong's fifth largest in 2021, Dealogic data shows. 
Hong Kong has struggled to attract big ticket deals this year due to a regulatory crackdown on a number of sectors by Chinese authorities.
'POOR INTERNATIONAL SUBSCRIPTION'
SenseTime sold 1.5 billion shares in the IPO.
It shelved its first attempt on Dec. 13 after it was placed on the U.S. blacklist just as the institutional book build for the deal was being concluded. 
The U.S. Treasury added SenseTime to a list of ""Chinese military-industrial complex companies"" on Dec. 10, accusing it of having developed a facial recognition programme to determine ethnicity, with a focus on identifying ethnic Uyghurs.
U.N. experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people, mainly Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities, have been detained in recent years in a vast system of camps in China's far-west region of Xinjiang.
While SenseTime has said its inclusion on the blacklist did not impose any restrictions on its business operations, the ban meant U.S. investors could not participate in the IPO. 
SenseTime relaunched the deal on Dec. 20, but with a higher cornerstone investor stake.
Cornerstone shareholders, all Chinese institutions, bought about 67% of the stock on offer in the IPO, up from the 58% stake flagged in the company's first attempt.
Institutional investors placed orders for just 1.5 times the amount of stock on sale in the international tranche, regulatory filings with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange show. 
Analysts said it was one of the poorest take up rates for a major deal in Hong Kong this year.

The retail oversubscription rate was 5.12 times, which analysts said was also low for a Hong Kong IPO. 
""We think the exclusion of U.S. investors from the IPO led to poor international subscription,"" said Shifara Samsudeen, LightStream Research analyst who publishes on SmartKarma.

ZURICH (Reuters) -A preliminary investigation by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) found that its Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio attended the Wimbledon tennis finals in July during a visit to Britain when the country's COVID-19 rules required him to be in quarantine, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
It's the second time the Portuguese banker, who joined the Swiss bank in April to clean up its culture following a string of scandals, has been found to have broken coronavirus curbs.
The findings of the investigation by Credit Suisse's legal team were passed to the audit committee on the bank's board before Christmas. It will now investigate and decide whether any further action needs to be taken, the sources said.
Spokespeople for Credit Suisse and Horta-Osorio declined to comment when asked about the investigation and its findings. 
Horta-Osorio admitted to breaching Switzerland's COVID-19 rules during a visit to the country on Nov. 28. Swiss rules stipulated that he should spend 10 days in quarantine upon arrival but he left the country again on Dec. 1. 
Reports of the Swiss breach prompted the bank's board to commission the internal investigation. 
In the course of their investigation, the bank's legal team found that Horta-Osorio had also broken Britain's rules when he made the trip to attend Wimbledon for the finals on the weekend of July 10 and 11, the sources said.
At the time, Switzerland and most other European countries were on Britain's ""amber list"", which meant visitors had to quarantine for 10 days when they arrived in the country. 
A UK government spokesperson said they would not comment on specific cases.
""Passengers are responsible for ensuring they comply with all travel rules, including providing accurate information on their Passenger Locator Form, and failure to do so could lead to a fine or imprisonment,"" the spokesperson said.

Horta-Osorio's Swiss breach is being reviewed by prosecutors in the canton of St Gallen after he reported it to them and he could face a fine of up to 5000 Swiss francs ($5,450).

Daniel Zhang, the chief executive officer of Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding, who had served as a director on Didi's board since 2018 has resigned, the company said.
He is succeeded by Yi Zhang, a senior legal director of Alibaba Group.
Chinese authorities have come down hard on Didi, after its New York Stock Exchange listing in June, demanding it take down its app from mobile app stores while the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) investigated its handling of customer data. 
The restriction hit Didi, co-founded in 2012 by former Alibaba employee Will Wei Cheng and backed by SoftBank Group, which was the dominant ride-hailing company in China. 
The company now faces stiff competition from ride-hailing services by automakers Geely and SAIC Motor.
Under pressure from Chinese regulators concerned about data security, Didi in December decided to delist from the NYSE and pursue a Hong Kong listing.
Shares of Didi, which had soared in their IPO giving the company a valuation of $80 billion and marking the biggest U.S. listing by a Chinese firm since 2014, have since declined 65%.
Didi said on Wednesday its board had authorized it to pursue a listing of its class A ordinary shares on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
""The company is executing above plans and will update investors in due course,"" Didi said.
Revenue for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 fell to 42.7 billion yuan ($6.71 billion) from 43.4 billion yuan a year earlier. 
Didi, which is expanding its presence in Europe and South America, said revenue from its international operations nearly doubled to 966 million yuan in the quarter.

Net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was 25.91 yuan.

The stock gained as much as 17% in early trading. The SoftBank Group Corp.-backed company raised HK$5.78 billion ($741 million) selling 1.5 billion shares at HK$3.85 apiece, the bottom of its marketed range.
SenseTime, which early on sought at least $2 billion in its IPO, has been one of the most high-profile Chinese tech firms targeted by the U.S. The firm’s debut comes weeks after the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned it over its alleged involvement in human rights abuses in Xinjiang, a charge it has vigorously denied. The curbs follow a blacklisting by the Commerce Department under the Trump administration. 
The company pushed ahead with the listing, securing $512 million from nine cornerstone investors including the state-backed Mixed-Ownership Reform Fund and Shanghai Xuhui Capital Investment Co.
“Due to the dynamic and evolving nature of the relevant U.S. regulations, we have required to exclude U.S. investors” from the global offering including the issuance in Hong Kong, it said in a revised filing to the city’s stock exchange earlier this month.
Founded in 2014 by computer scientists, SenseTime specializes in AI-powered software that analyzes faces and images on an enormous scale and works with policing bodies, retailers and health-care researchers around the world. The firm competes with  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.-backed Megvii Technology, which is seeking a share sale in Shanghai.

Chinese companies that debuted in Hong Kong since July, when Beijing extended the clampdown over several industries, have seen their shares rise an average 1% on the first day of trading, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nine firms that have listed this month prior to SenseTime have seen an average drop 2.8% in their stocks.
About 60% of the capital raised from SenseTime’s IPO will be used on research and development, Chief Executive Officer Xu Li said in a Bloomberg Television interview taped before the new sanctions were announced.
The firm has invested heavily in building super computers that can train client-facing AI models, an effort that’s set to pay off as the loss-making company scales up. Revenue in the six months ended June 30 nearly doubled to 1.65 billion yuan ($259 million), while net losses narrowed to 3.7 billion yuan from 5.3 billion yuan in the first half of 2020.
“Cost is key for the commercialization of a technology,” said Xu, adding that the investments offer the company a clear path to achieving profitability.
In the comments made earlier this month, Xu also acknowledged that the Commerce Department’s sanctions had impacted its overseas expansion. Still, the executive sought to downplay the impact, saying that more people embracing the technology will help to bring down barriers.

116,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 29, 2021 08:36PM ET</span>",Didi Reveals $4.7 Billion Loss Ahead of 2022 Hong Kong Debut,"(Bloomberg) -- Didi Global Inc. disclosed a $4.7 billion loss after revenues shrank in the September quarter, revealing the rising cost of a series of regulatory actions that will force China’s ride-sharing leader to shift its listing to Hong Kong next year.
Didi, one of the highest-profile targets of a broad Beijing campaign to rein in the country’s giant tech sector, reported $6.6 billion of sales, down more than 13% from the June quarter and 1.6% from a year earlier. The surprise disclosure comes as the company prepares to delist from New York.
The ride-hailing giant is planning to work with  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., CMB International and CCB International on the shift, which could be a so-called listing by introduction, people familiar with the matter said. That arrangement, which doesn’t involve any fundraising, requires little marketing and would allow U.S. investors to swap their shares for the new stock in Hong Kong.
Once hailed for ousting Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. from China, Didi has become one of the highest-profile targets of Beijing’s campaign to rein in its increasingly powerful tech sector. But it incensed regulators after going ahead with the New York debut despite concerns about the security of its data, triggering a series of probes that culminated in the forced delisting. Its shares slid more than 8% in New York.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Didi Global Inc.’s longer-term growth outlook is clouded by Chinese regulators’ crackdown on its use of consumer data, as restrictions could inhibit its ability to efficiently grow its core mobility business and introduce new products. Its near-monopoly of China’s $50 billion domestic ride-hailing market, which is expected to more than double by 2025, is a solid foundation for growth as long as Didi can navigate the regulatory situation. Yet its international ride-sharing business and other initiatives may continue to rapidly burn cash. A planned delisting from New York and listing in Hong Kong suggests a messy road ahead.

The unprecedented move underscored the depth of Beijing’s concern about the potential leakage of sensitive data to a geopolitical rival, as well as the extent to which the government will go to punish Didi for contravening its wishes. In Wednesday’s surprise disclosure, the company announced  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. Chairman Daniel Zhang had resigned from the board, to be replaced by a lower-ranking Alibaba executive.
The regulatory turmoil has both increased the cost of business for Didi and allowed rivals like Meituan to encroach on its market share. Didi posted a net loss of 30.4 billion yuan for the September quarter, down from a 665 million yuan profit a year earlier.
Spending rose 16% during the quarter after Didi was forced to comply with new requirements to better compensate its drivers and improve data governance. Worker rights protections for drivers were formalized into a set of guidelines from Chinese regulators in November. It also booked a 20.8 billion yuan investment loss, mainly from its nascent community group buying business, which focuses on intensely competitive hyper-local groceries.
It’s unclear if more punishments are in store for Didi, which is controlled by the management team of co-founder Cheng Wei and President Jean Liu and backed by big names including Alibaba and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.
Beijing’s moves against Didi have been particularly harsh, even by the standards of a year-long crackdown that’s engulfed giants like Alibaba and Tencent. The Cyberspace Administration of China saw Didi’s IPO decision as a challenge to the central government’s authority, which led to the CAC, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of State Security and several other agencies initiating on-site inspections at Didi’s offices in July.

117,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2021 07:20PM ET</span>","Dow, S&P close at record highs as Omicron worries ease","By Echo Wang
(Reuters) - The Dow and S&P 500 closed at all-time highs on Wednesday on a boost from retailers including Walgreens and  Nike , as investors shrugged off concerns on the spreading Omicron variant. 
The Dow has now risen six straight trading days, marking the longest streak of gains since a seven-session run from March 5 to March 15 this year.
Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) rose 1.59% and 1.42% respectively against the backdrop of recent reports suggesting holiday sales were strong for U.S. retailers.
Data on Wednesday showed the U.S. trade deficit in goods mushroomed to the widest ever in November as imports of consumer goods shot to a record, as the coronavirus pandemic has limited spending by Americans on services.
Some early studies pointing to a reduced risk of hospitalization in Omicron cases have eased some investors concerns over the travel disruptions and powered the S&P 500 to record highs this week.
""The market started to recognize that the Omicron variant was in a strange way good news, because it will burn itself out more rapidly because it's easily transmissible, but it's less likely to overwhelm hospitals,"" said Jay Hatfield, founder and chief executive of Infrastructure Capital Management in New York. Still, he said Omicron arguably is going to be a headwind for at least the next month.
Meanwhile, the S&P 1500 airlines index dipped. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and  Alaska Air  (NYSE:ALK) Group canceled hundreds of flights again on Tuesday as the daily tally of infections in the United States surged.
Three of the 11 major S&P sector indexes declined, the energy index, the consumer services sector .SPLRCL and the financial sector are in the red.
Typically, the final five trading days of the year and the first two of the subsequent year are seasonally strong for U.S. stocks, known as the ""Santa Claus Rally."" However, market participants warned against reading too much into daily moves as the holiday season tends to record some of the lowest volume turnovers that can cause exaggerated price action.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 90.42 points, or 0.25%, to 36,488.63, the S&P 500 gained 6.71 points, or 0.14%, to 4,793.06 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 15.51 points, or 0.1%, to 15,766.22.
The S&P 500 dipped on Tuesday in the lowest trading volume session of 2021, snapping a four-day winning streak.
As 2021 draws to a close, the main U.S. stock indexes are on pace for their third straight year of stunning annual returns, boosted by historic fiscal and monetary stimulus. The S&P 500 is looking at its strongest three-year performance since 1999.
The focus next year will shift to the U.S. Federal Reserve's path of interest rate hikes amid a surge in prices caused by supply chain bottlenecks and a strong economic rebound.
Among other stocks, shares of Victoria’s Secret & Co rose more than 12% after the intimate apparel retailer announced a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program. The retailer also said they had strong sales over the holidays. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s CEO Elon Musk exercised all of his options expiring next year, signaling an end to his stock sales. Its shares dropped 0.21% but were still on course to end about 54% for the year.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.89 billion shares, compared with the 11.15 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.43-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 76 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 77 new highs and 374 new lows.

In exchange, SK Hynix will pay $7 billion out of the deal's total $9 billion price tag, the world's second-largest memory chip maker said in a statement on Thursday. 
The deal, signed in 2020, will allow Intel to focus on its smaller but more lucrative Optane memory business. For SK Hynix, it is the biggest acquisition ever as it seeks to boost its capacity to build NAND chips, used to store data in smartphones and data centre servers.
""This acquisition will present a paradigm shifting moment for SK Hynix's NAND flash business to enter the global top tier level,"" said Park Jung-ho, vice chairman and co-CEO of SK Hynix. 
A SK Hynix subsidiary called Solidigm, headquartered in San Jose, California, United States, will manage the newly acquired NAND solid-state drive (SSD) business. 

SK Hynix co-CEO Lee Seok-hee will be appointed executive chairman of Solidigm, while Rob Crooke, former senior vice president of Intel, will be appointed CEO of Solidigm, SK Hynix said in the statement. 
The second phase of the deal is expected to close in or after March 2025 along with the payment of the remaining $2 billion, and will include SK Hynix's acquisition of Intel's remaining assets in the NAND business including intellectual property and workforce, the statement added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major global stock indexes closed mixed on Wednesday as uncertainty over the surge in Omicron variant infections tempered optimism that harsh new curbs on business and travel may not be needed.
After a weak session in Asian shares, European stock markets traded mixed.
The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index closed at all-time highs on strong U.S. retail sales. The Dow has risen six straight trading days, in the longest winning streak since a seven-session run from March 5-15 this year.

121,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2021 05:06PM ET</span>",Biden inks $137 million contract to boost supply of key material for COVID tests -source,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration plans to announce on Wednesday a $137 million contract for Millipore Sigma, a unit of Germany's Merck KGaA, to boost production capacity of a highly constrained component of rapid coronavirus tests, a senior administration official told Reuters. 
    The money will allow the company over three years to build a new facility to produce nitrocellulose membranes, the paper that displays test results, in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. That, in turn, will allow for 85 million more tests to be produced per month, the official said. 
It was not immediately clear when the facility would ramp up to full production. 
    ""It's probably the most constrained piece of technology in expanding capacity, in making more of these over-the-counter or point-of-care tests,"" the official said. ""This amount they're going to produce is roughly equivalent to another billion over-the-counter tests being able to be made,"" he added.
    Millipore Sigma is a supplier to major U.S. COVID-19 antigen test manufacturers, he said, without providing further details. 
    The contract, which will be announced by the Department of Defense for the Department of Health and Human Services, is part of a bid by the Biden administration to ramp up production of scarce rapid COVID-19 tests, which has taken on more urgency as nations grapple with the highly infectious Omicron variant of the coronavirus. 
    The average number of daily COVID-19 cases in the United States has hit a record high of 258,312 over the past seven days, according to a Reuters tally.
    Earlier this month, President Joe Biden announced a plan to distribute 500 million at-home coronavirus test kits to help address the crisis, building on prior pledges to invest $3 billion in test kits. 
    But U.S. testing is behind the curve because of a lack of skilled workers, a shortage of at-home tests and under-investment in recent months, and health experts in the U.S. said Biden's latest plan was ""too little, too late.""

The government is invoking the Defense Production Act (DPA) to award the contract and has many more similar contracts in the works, the official said.
The Biden administration has used the DPA - a 1950s Korean war-era law which gives federal agencies the power to prioritize procurement orders related to national defense - to speed production of swabs and pipettes for COVID-19 test production previously.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -The U.S. National Labor Relations Board on Wednesday impounded ballots that will decide whether the United Steelworkers (USW) continues to represent workers at an  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) oil refinery in southeast Texas.
The NLRB said it sequestered the ballots while it reviews unfair labor practice complaints filed by the union representing workers at Exxon's Beaumont, Texas, complex. The USW alleged that a worker lockout, after contract talks failed to produce a new agreement, was an attempt to break the union and that Exxon improperly aided a union-removal campaign.
It may be several weeks ""before we have the results or know what the next steps are,"" NLRB spokeswoman Kayla Blado told Reuters. 
Exxon expects the allegations will be dismissed once the investigation is completed, said company spokesperson Julie King. ""Exxon Mobil remains confident that it has acted in accordance with the law at all times.""
The union charges ""not only prevented our employees' voice from being heard but also denied them an opportunity to end the lockout,"" she said.
USW International Representative Bryan Gross said the union has provided the NLRB with information and affidavits to support its stance. ""We hope this lets the company know they need to get back to the bargaining table,"" Gross said.
Exxon locked out union members from the 2,700-acre refinery and lubricant oil packaging plant on May 1. The facility produces fuels and Mobil 1 motor oil, and has continued to run with managers and replacement workers.
The eight-month-long lockout will end if union-represented workers sign a petition to remove USW local 13-243 or accept the company's last contract offer, Exxon said. Union members rejected the contract offer in October.
The refinery has continued to operate with managers and supervisors from around the nation at its controls. Exxon has said the 369,024 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery is operating at maximum capacity.
Ousting the union would require a 50%-plus-one share of votes cast.
Exxon proposed a contract with terms it said would allow the plant to be competitive in low-margin environments. The union has said it wants to keep provisions that give workers a say in job assignments. 
Negotiators have agreed to some parts of a possible contract, including a six-year term and pay increases that would match those to be set by national USW contract talks that begin in January.
Workers were locked out at Beaumont because of a strike notice issued by Local 13-243 that could not allow for safe, continuous operations, Exxon has said. 

The union said Exxon was preparing to lock out workers before the strike notice, pointing to portable housing for replacement workers installed inside the Beaumont complex in the weeks prior to the lockout.
During the lockout, the number of workers at the refinery represented by the USW has dwindled from 650 to about 580, as workers took jobs at other refineries or chemical plants in the region, people familiar with plant operations said.

123,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 29, 2021 04:18PM ET</span>",Chinese Oil Refiners in Limbo as Beijing Delays Releasing Quotas,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s an anxious end to the year for many Chinese oil refiners as they wait for Beijing to announce crude import and fuel export quotas. 
The import allowances are for independent refiners, accounting for around a quarter of the country’s processing capacity, while the export limits cover the entire sector including state-owned companies. Both types of quota had already been released at this point last year. 
The delay is the latest headwind for China’s refining sector, the world’s largest crude importer and processor, which is already facing an economic slowdown and the threat posed by the omicron virus variant. The private refiners, or teapots, have also been hit with taxation and pollution probes.
The complexity of the tax investigations, rising competition between private and state-owned firms and the uncertainty caused by omicron and China’s zero-Covid policy were likely reasons for the delay in issuing quota, according to several oil traders. Beijing is also thought to be considering limiting both the import and export allowances to cut carbon emissions.
See also: China’s Oil Demand Hemmed in by Virus, Pollution and Probes
The lack of import quota is causing frustration, according to officials at three teapots who asked not to be identified as the matters are private. The refiners have run out of crude and are unable to start planning processing, financing and hedging for next year, they said.
If the import quotas are delayed until January, it could mean the teapots will face demurrage fees for cargoes they booked for arrival early next year.
The delay has seen some teapots resort to an old trick: import fuel oil, which can be used as a feedstock to produce other oil products, instead of crude. The number of Chinese private refiners and traders applying for fuel oil import quota for 2022 has almost doubled from a year earlier, the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement last week.

Investing.com — A report from The Korea Economic Daily Global said South Korea's Samsung Group is in talks to acquire U.S. drugmaker Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB). 
Citing investment banking sources, the article says Biogen approached Samsung to sell its shares to the company, which could be valued at more than $42 billion. 
However, Adam Feuerstein, a senior writer at Statnews, said in a tweet: ""The reported price seems very low, particularly if Biogen shopped itself to Samsung, as the article states. But I guess this stirs the pot in what's been a sedate week.""








Korea Economic Daily added that ""Samsung Group's major arms will likely participate in the proposed megadeal.""
Biogen and Samsung already work together through a partnership in Samsung's Bioepis business. Biogen has a 50% stake minus one share in the company, with Samsung Biologics holding the remaining stake. 
Biogen shares spiked 9% following the report.

A new survey shows that 72% of chief executive officers are worried about losing their jobs in 2022 because of business disruptions, tracking closely with the 94% of bosses who say their corporate models need to be overhauled within three years. 
“That’s eye-poppingly high,” says Simon Freakley, the CEO of management consulting firm AlixPartners, the source of the survey. “Disruptive forces like the supply chain and labor market are all playing out simultaneously.”
Big bosses are always worried about losing their jobs, especially at public companies, where the potential for a sudden adios comes with the cushy chair. But the fear-of-imminent-firing figure surged from 52% in 2020, which itself was a high-anxiety year. AlixPartners took the pulse of 3,000 CEOs and executives at the director level and above across 10 industries, half with revenues more than $1 billion. The pool was dispersed across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.
Supply chain, labor market and digitalization topped the executives’ lists of concerns. While the global pandemic exacerbated the situation, Covid-19 itself was notably missing from the top 10 concerns for 2022. Only 3% of executives cited the virus as their main worry.
Freakley, in an interview, said he has a theory as to what’s driving the fear of getting ousted: Leaders who were relieved to survive 2020 with their business intact discovered in 2021 that, instead of pressures ebbing, they were mired in a continuing pandemic even as shareholders demanded growth. 
“They realized that their business models, which have served them well for a number of years, are largely now not fit for the purpose” and they’re rushing to build local, regional and global supply chains, Freakley said. “We went from what was a rolling sea of worry about economic cycles to a choppy sea of all these disruptive forces.” 
So far, the anxiety isn’t yet showing up in data. CEO departures in the U.S. -- regardless of whether they were axed or just retired or moved to different jobs -- rose just 1.1% through November from the same period in 2020, according to researcher Challenger, Gray & Christmas. 
One exception was in technology, where departures are up 17% from last year. Thirty-nine CEOs left top companies in October and November alone -- totaling 162 exits through November. Last year 126 technology CEOs left throughout the entire year. Among the biggest tech names who decided to move out of CEO roles in 2021 were Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).com’s Jeff Bezos and Jack Dorsey at Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), both of whom were co-founders of their respective companies. Dorsey is still CEO at another of his companies,  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ).

128,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2021 03:06PM ET</span>",Purdue bankruptcy judge extends temporary litigation shield for Sacklers,"By Maria Chutchian
(Reuters) - A bankruptcy judge has extended temporary protections against opioid-related litigation for the Sackler family members who own Purdue Pharma until Feb. 1 after another judge overturned the OxyContin maker’s bankruptcy settlement this month.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New York, extended the litigation shield on Wednesday, giving Purdue and the Sacklers time to discuss a path forward. The judge in September had approved Purdue’s reorganization plan and underlying settlement that aimed to resolve widespread litigation accusing the company and the Sacklers of fueling the U.S. opioid epidemic through deceptive marketing.
The settlement included protections for the Sacklers against future opioid-related lawsuits in exchange for a $4.5 billion contribution to the plan, which would steer money toward opioid abatement efforts. The protections, known as nondebtor releases, prompted appeals from several states and the U.S. Department of Justice’s bankruptcy watchdog.
U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon reversed Drain’s approval of the deal on Dec. 16, finding the bankruptcy court did not have authority to grant the releases. Purdue, which plans to appeal that decision, then asked Drain to extend temporary protections for the Sacklers that have been in place for two years. 
The current protections were set to expire on Thursday, meaning lawsuits on hold could have resumed absent an extension.
Drain approved Purdue’s request over objections from two states that argued that negotiations would be more effective without the shield. 
He also warned that if the parties, including the Sacklers, did not negotiate in good faith over the next month on an amended deal, there would be “consequences.”
A lawyer for the two states, Connecticut and Washington, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The reorganization plan obtained support from 95% of the company’s creditors, which were largely plaintiffs suing Purdue and the Sacklers.
Purdue filed for bankruptcy in September 2019 in the face of 3,000 lawsuits accusing the company and Sackler family members of contributing to a public health crisis that has claimed the lives of about 500,000 people since 1999.

129,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2021 02:31PM ET</span>",Tesla's Musk exercises all of his stock options expiring next year,"By Hyunjoo Jin
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk has exercised all of his options expiring next year, signaling an end to his stock sales which triggered a fall in the share price of the world's most valuable carmaker. 
He has sold $16.4 billion worth of shares since early November when he said he would sell 10% of his Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock if Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) users agreed. They did.
Musk said last week that he would be done selling shares after his programmed sales ended.
Musk in September set up a prearranged plan for stock sales related to options expiring next year and Tesla in a filing on Tuesday said the program was complete. 
The last trades, reported on Tuesday, included exercising an option on 1.6 million shares and selling 934,090 of those shares to pay for taxes. 
In total, Musk has sold 15.7 million shares in Tesla late in this year, approximately the 10% stake the billionaire had pledged to sell.
Tesla shares lost about a quarter of their value after Musk in November asked his Twitter followers if he should sell 10% of his holdings. They rebounded last week when he said he was almost done with stock sales, although the shares are still below the record closing high of $1,229.91 in November. 
Tesla shares were trading down 1.1% to $1,077.03 each on Wednesday. 
Two days before Musk's Twitter poll, Tesla shares hit a record high, extending gains sparked by an order for Tesla cars from rental company Hertz.
SURTAX 
In 2012, Musk was granted the stock options that vested when Tesla achieved specific milestones on market capitalization and other goals. He did not have to pay taxes on the vested options until he exercised most of them since November. 
He exercised options to buy nearly 23 million shares at $6.24 each, a fraction of Tesla's share price. 
Democrats, who control Congress, have proposed a surtax on income taxes and capital gains taxes that may take effect next year.
""Exercising the options in 2021 would avoid the increased taxes next year,"" Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said.
Tesla did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
Musk, the world's richest person with a net worth of $276 billion according to Forbes, said he would pay more than $11 billion in taxes this year.
Musk has moved from California to Texas, where there is no state income tax. 
He initially said his sale of 10% of his stock was in response to criticism that wealthy people avoid taxes. 
He recently suggested that he needed to sell some of the stocks regardless of the Twitter poll, to pay taxes associated with his options exercise. 

""I have some Tesla options that are expiring next year so I needed to exercise those options no matter what,"" he said in an interview with conservative satirical website Babylon Bee.
He added that he sold additional stocks to ""try to get up to the 10% level.""

(Reuters) -Carnival Corp's Cunard cruise line said on Wednesday its Queen Mary 2 ship would skip a scheduled stop at New York and instead extend its stay in Barbados until Jan. 2 to bring in more staffers.
Cunard said its decision to add more crew members was a precautionary measure, but it did not detail why it needed more workers.
The ship, Cunard's flagship liner named by Queen Elizabeth, is among the more than 85 vessels the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is investigating for COVID-19 cases.
The CDC starts an investigation if 0.10% or more of passengers on guest voyages test positive for COVID-19.
The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has sparked fears that the CDC may reintroduce a temporary ban on cruising, months after cruise operators resumed operations. 
Queen Mary 2, the only ocean liner from Southampton to New York, left the British port city on Dec. 13 and will sail back to the United Kingdom from Barbados to ensure it reaches Southampton on Jan. 10 as planned.
""The trip started out well. The entire ship was tested on our fourth day out of the Brooklyn Red Hook port. As far as we could tell there were five or six cabins affected,"" retired architect Sandy Weinberg Benjamin, who is cruising with her husband, said.
Few passengers on the 28-night voyage said the mood on Queen Mary 2 had been largely upbeat, although family members of a few guests were concerned due to connectivity issues on the liner.

Cunard said it would arrange flights for guests due to disembark in New York on Jan. 3, but Benjamin said she could not figure out how the cruise line would find flights for more than thousand guests out of Barbados.
Carnival (NYSE:CUK), whose shares fell marginally, said its other brands are not canceling any cruises.

(Reuters) - Major U.S. retailers' longer return policies, launched during the pandemic this year to lure consumers, could leave them facing much higher costs if shoppers bring back a record-setting $112 billion in gifts bought during the extended holiday shopping season. 
Retailers entered the 2021 holiday season facing a supply-chain logjam, with inventories at lows unseen since 1992.
Many began Christmas promotions as early as September, to spread out the impact caused by shipping- and labor-related shortages over more months than the traditional peak shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. 
Retailers also lured shoppers with ""extended"" return policies. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Saks Fifth Avenue and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) are among chains allowing shoppers to return holiday purchases after 60 or 90 days, rather than the industry standard of 30 days. 
But this extended return process, which can include shipping costs, cleaning fees and repackaging, can drive higher costs for retailers and weigh heavily on profit margins. 
With global supply-chain snarls not expected to ease until at least 2023, the ""returns"" problem is not expected to go away soon.
""The returns problem is likely to be a big focus area in the coming two years, since the costs associated with the activity are bound to impact earnings ... significantly,"" RSR Research analyst Brian Kilcourse said in an email.
U.S. shoppers are expected to return a record $112 billion to $114 billion worth of merchandise in coming weeks, representing a 24% to 27% increase over 2019 post-holiday returns, according to B-Stock Solutions, which manages online liquidation sites for retailers including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) and  Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) . 
Of that, between $43 billion and $45 billion in returns are likely to be merchandise purchased online, B-Stock said.
According to the National Retail Federation, a trade group, consumers returned an estimated 10.6% of goods purchased at U.S. retail in 2020. That percentage is estimated to have risen 13.3% during the holiday season, costing retailers $101 billion. 
Optoro, which works with retailers and manufacturers to manage and resell returned merchandise, said it expects shoppers to return $120 billion in goods between Thanksgiving and Jan. 31. 
While longer return windows may not directly add to retailers' expenses, it does impact their ability to use working capital for other things, said Paula Rosenblum, managing partner at retail research firm RSR Research. ""It's an unknown payable."" 
Retailers do not usually break out return rates or related expenses, but signs are emerging that the wave of returns started much before Christmas this year as consumers started shopping sooner, leading to higher costs because of the longer grace period, according to some retailers. 
Over the past six weeks, privately owned office supplies retailer Staples has seen a 30% increase in drop-offs and returns, said Craig Grayson, vice president of general merchandise management.
UK-based online fashion retailer Boohoo said UK return rates its quarter ending Nov. 30 were already 12.5 percentage points higher than the same period last year and 7 percentage points higher than pre-pandemic levels. Those higher rates and related logistic costs led it to cut its annual margins forecast twice in the past four months.. 
'LIVING IN A RATS' NEST'
Consider a sweater priced at $100. Most retailers' margin on the sweater could be $33 if a shopper purchased it in-store, but only $17 if bought online and shipped to the customer's home from a store, according to an AlixPartners report from May 2020.
If a customer returns the sweater to the store and it is not resold, the retailer loses $25 in margin. The lost margin spikes to $31 if it had to collect the online purchase and return it from a customer's home to a distribution center, according to the report that reviewed returns policies of retailers including Walmart, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Macy's (NYSE:M), Aldi and Kroger (NYSE:KR).
And with online shopping growing, retailers have boosted orders to account for items not available because they are in transit or sitting unsold in stores, Rosenblum said. But further exacerbating the problem is the risk of all that excess inventory also going unsold. 
""We are living in a rats' nest at the moment, and it’s really hard to untangle what’s going to happen,"" she said.
Apple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters the impact of supply-chain disruptions would be worse this holiday season as persistent shortages of software chips were affecting ""most of its products,"" leading the iPhone maker to fall short of demand by more than $6 billion.

Apple introduced a policy this year allowing customers up to 68 days to return a product, instead of 30 days.
Similarly,  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN)'s Nordstrom Rack has extended its return policies on many products to 45 days, Nike to 60 days and Macy's, Walmart and Saks Fifth Avenue to as much as 90 days.

Equipment, leasing and other input costs for oil explorers and the contractors they hire surged to an all-time high during the current quarter, the Dallas Fed said in a report released on Wednesday. Drillers also are seeing the universe of willing lenders shrink in the Eleventh Federal Reserve District that includes Texas and parts of Louisiana and New Mexico.
“The political pressure forcing available capital away from the energy industry is a problem for everyone,” an unidentified survey respondent said. “Banks view lending to the energy industry as having a ‘political risk.’ The capital availability has moved down-market to family offices, etc., and it is drastically reducing the size and availability of commitments regardless of commodity prices.”
Meanwhile, supply-chain snarls are hindering efforts to replace diesel-burning pumps with cleaner, electric-powered gear in the Permian Basin, where components such as transformers are in “extremely short supply,” another respondent said.

Investing.com —  Chembio Diagnostics Inc  (NASDAQ:CEMI) shares fell over 20% Wednesday after it revealed in a regulatory filing that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration declined to review the company's application for emergency use authorization for its DPP Respiratory Antigen Panel.
Chembio shares are currently trading around the $1.30 mark, more than 16.6% below Tuesday's close. 
The DPP Respiratory Antigen Panel is a test system designed to detect Influenza A, Influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2 antigens from a single patient sample using a nasal swab.
The FDA's decline, according to Chembio, stems from clinical trials in which the company encountered delays due to a ""near absence of influenza"" in the United States. As a result, the company had to include ""foreign-sourced influenza-positive samples.""
However, the FDA told Chembio that to proceed, it would need to prospectively collect Influenza A and B samples and then submit a new EUA application.
Furthermore, Chembio said that it cannot confirm it will be able to collect the new samples in a timely manner or at all and cannot confirm that it will be able to submit a new EUA ""at any specific time in the future or at all.""
While the comments from Chembio have caused its shares to tumble, Benchmark analyst Bruce Jackson said the news does not affect his near-term estimates for the stock, which is mainly driven by orders from outside of the U.S."

Creditors representing more than 90% of outstanding claims voted in favor of the draft restructuring proposal at an investors' meeting on Wednesday, Unigroup said in a statement.
Unigroup's two shareholders, Tsinghua Holdings - owned by China's prestigious Tsinghua University - and Beijing Jiankun Investment Group also voted for the plan, it added, without providing details of the proposed restructuring.
The 21st Century Business Herald reported earlier on Wednesday that the 60 billion yuan would be in place by the end of March.
Earlier this month, Unigroup said a consortium led by Beijing Jianguang Asset Management, also known as JAC Capital, and Wise Road Capital would become a strategic investor.
Unigroup, under former real estate magnate Zhao Weiguo, made aggressive investments in various chip companies but these bets were mostly unsuccessful and caused the company to cross-default on bonds worth about $3.6 billion by end-2020.

Administrators will now submit the draft restructuring proposal to Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court for approval in accordance with Chinese bankruptcy laws, Unigroup said on its website.

Investing.com –  Alibaba  ADRs (NYSE:BABA) slipped 2.3% Wednesday on a Bloomberg report that the online giant is in talks with Shanghai Media Group about a potential deal involving its 30% stake in Weibo, a Twitter-like social media platform.
Weibo's stock (NASDAQ:WB) fell 2%.
The discussions could lead to the state-owned conglomerate purchasing all of Alibaba’s stake in Weibo, the report said.
Alibaba and its affiliates have over the years built a sprawling portfolio of media assets that include newspapers, television-production companies, social media and advertising.
A wary government, concerned about the company’s influence on public opinion, wants Alibaba to offload some of those holdings, Bloomberg reported in March.

Catalonia-based engineering group QEV plans to turn the facility into a hub for electric vehicles, including participation from Swedish producers Inzile and Volta.
Spain is rushing to find a buyer for the plant, which Nissan will vacate at the end of the year. Great Wall had been slated to take it over but pulled out this month.
A commission comprising Spanish and Catalan politicians, union representatives and Nissan executives has been meeting regularly to evaluate various proposals for the plant. 
""The partipants ... have backed the general lines for the electromobility hub plan led by QEV Technologies,"" Nissan said in a statement. ""The hub meets all the set objectives.""
Further talks will focus on the concrete requirements of the plant in terms of space and assets and to determine whether other complementary projects could be included. 

An alternative proposal by Belgian automaker Punch will be considered as a secondary option, Nissan said. 
Negotiations to sell two smaller Nissan plants in the region to QEV and electric motorcyle maker Silence are now at a very advanced stage, the Japanese automaker said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged  Medallion Financial  (NASDAQ:MFIN) Corp and its president with fraud for trying to inflate the stock price of the lender to taxicab medallion buyers, amid competition from Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT).
Medallion shares plummeted $3.83, or 45.3%, to $4.62 in morning trading, after earlier falling to $3.50.
In a complaint filed on Wednesday in Manhattan federal court, the SEC said Medallion and President Andrew Murstein paid a California media strategist to anonymously promote Medallion on websites including Huffington Post, Seeking Alpha, TheStreet.com and Crain's New York Business.
Murstein, 57, a Medallion founder whose family is the New York-based company's largest shareholder, allegedly kept touters on Medallion's payroll for nearly two years and paid hush money to keep one quiet.
According to the complaint, Murstein also fraudulently inflated the value of Medallion's banking unit to offset loan losses, and against his auditor's advice fired a valuation firm that refused to vet the scheme.
The alleged schemes occurred from 2014 to 2017, as the growing popularity of ridesharing companies such as Uber and Lyft led to sinking prices for medallions, which are licenses to operate taxis and collect fares.
Medallion paid Murstein $11.4 million over that period, SEC filings show.
""Murstein allegedly paid for more than 50 articles and hundreds of positive comments, which were really paid advertisements,"" Richard Best, director of the SEC's New York office, said in a statement. ""Companies also cannot shop for higher valuations when there is no evidence to support them.""
In a statement, Medallion said it intended to defend against the SEC's ""unfounded"" charges, and was confident the record would show that the company and Murstein complied with the law.

The SEC also charged the media strategist Ichabod's Cranium Inc and its owner Lawrence Meyers with fraud. Their lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to the SEC, the value of New York City medallions fell to $150,000 in 2017 from $1.3 million in 2013. Some medallion lenders went bankrupt as owners defaulted on their loans.

Investing.com – Rivian stock (NASDAQ:RIVN) fell nearly 5% on Wednesday on reports of the company delaying deliveries of its electric pickup truck and sports utility vehicle with big battery packs to 2023.
The bigger battery pack, called the Max pack, is expected to have mileage of 400 miles on a single charge. Only 20% of the preorders were for the Max pack, according to Reuters.
According to the report, in a mail Tuesday to customers, Chief Executive RJ Scaringe said majority of Rivian's roughly 71,000 preorders for its R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV in the U.S. and Canada were for a version of the vehicles with a small battery pack option, which provides 314 miles on one charge.
""In order to serve the largest number of preorder holders, we will be prioritizing building the Adventure Package with large pack battery during the next year,"" Scaringe said in the mail that was posted by a Rivian customer on Reddit, Reuters reported.
Earlier this month, higher R&D spending and losses on convertible debt pushed the company’s third-quarter loss more than four times higher, to $1.2 billion. The company said it expected production to fall a few hundred vehicles short of its 2021 target of 1,200 units.
Compounding the disappointment were the pre-orders for the two vehicles that at 71,000 units, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas quoted by Reuters, were at the low end of expectations.
The lack of chips has strangled production of vehicles at automakers, particularly tech-heavy vehicles built by startups such as Rivian. The company made its public debut last month and commands a market value of around $93 billion even though it has yet to book any meaningful revenue."

Investing.com –  FuelCell Energy  stock (NASDAQ:FCEL) tanked 15% Wednesday after the company’s fourth-quarter sales fell and losses widened to come in short of analysts’ expectations.
The company closed October with an order backlog of $1.29 billion, unchanged from a year ago.
Revenue in the quarter ended Oct. 31 fell 18% year-on-year, to $13.93 million. The company attributed the fall to a $5.6 million decrease in service agreements and license revenue. There were no module exchanges during the fourth quarter, it said, which hurt revenue.
The company also recorded a $1 million reduction in service revenue as a result of higher future cost estimates related to future module exchanges compared to the company’s prior estimates.
The net loss widened by $5 million to $24 million. Higher operating expenses contributed to the loss, but there were other factors.
Heavy impairment charges related to some of its projects also contributed. The company also factored in cost estimate adjustments related to future module replacements, which resulted in a negative margin impact of approximately $2.6 million.
The company also took a hit of $1.8 million because of development costs for two projects that are no longer being pursued."

Of course, the CDC will swiftly follow as soon as we hear from them, and I'm hoping to have that in the days to weeks ahead.""
It was not immediately clear, however, that  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and its partner, BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) -- the only manufacturer whose COVID-19 vaccine is approved for kids -- has formally sought FDA approval for a booster in children ages 12-15.
Representatives for Pfizer and the FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Third booster shots are approved for U.S. children ages 16 and 17 and all U.S. adults. 
Questions over boosters for some older children come as the United States faces a new wave of infections from the Omicron variant as cases reach a record high.
While U.S. officials have said vaccinations protect against serious infection and death with Omicron, some children ages 12-15 are now more than six months out from their earlier inoculations. 
U.S. children ages 5-12 were recently cleared for the vaccine so have just begun their inoculations in recent weeks. 
No vaccine is approved for children under age 5, something Walensky said she did not expect anytime soon.

""The companies and manufacturers are working toward data for children under 5. That will not be in the month ahead,"" she told CNN. 
Pfizer earlier this month said it was looking at a three-dose regimen of its COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 2 to 16 while results showed three doses among people older than 16 offered greater protection.

156,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 29, 2021 08:58AM ET</span>",Big S&P 500 Bear Market Case Sees Inflation Finally Eating Everything,"(Bloomberg) -- Corporate America’s well-oiled earnings machine has been the backbone of virtually every bullish equity argument this year. It’s helped stocks power past the Federal Reserve’s hawkish pivot and each new variant of the coronavirus. But stubbornly high price pressures may end up forcing a rethink of those ever-increasing profitability predictions.
So goes the main bear case on U.S. stocks, which notes that after a steady climb since last year, 12-month estimates for the S&P 500’s operating margins have stalled out since mid-October. The plateau coincided with the start of an earnings season that saw companies sound the alarm on rising input costs and labor difficulties.
While enough companies were able to successfully pass along those costs to consumers, boosting index-level profit margins to all-time highs, the recent leveling in estimates could make a repeat performance difficult. While demand is robust, persistently high inflation will erode it, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Gina Martin Adams. It’s unclear whether shoppers will continue to be willing to pay higher prices, she said.
“Consumers are starting to get fed up with price increases and they’re starting to fight back, and we’re seeing that manifest itself in margins,” said Martin Adams, BI’s chief U.S. equity strategist. “Prices don’t rise as long as operating margin forecasts are falling.”
Signs that the American consumer is starting to buckle under the fastest pace of inflation in decades emerged last week. Data showed that purchases of goods and services, after adjusting for higher prices, were little changed in November. That stagnation in spending came in a month when real wage growth declined by 1.9%.
So far, inflation’s impact on the stock market has been ambiguous at best in a year when the S&P 500 is poised to close 27% higher. Despite supply-chain snarls and labor shortages, every sector has posted double-digits gains in 2021 -- helped by the fact that net-profit margins climbed across most major industries last quarter.
And Wall Street analysts aren’t fussed by the prospect of price pressures. They see S&P 500 profits climbing almost 9% next year to $220.40 a share. Still, even with that increase, the index trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of almost 22 -- very much at the high end of the historical range and a level that suggests riskiness should results fail to hit the mark.
The emergence of the omicron variant may make it difficult to pull off that lofty profits goal. While data indicate the strain is less deadly than predecessors, it has the potential to further exacerbate supply bottlenecks as countries fight to contain the spread, according to Richard Bernstein Advisors’s Dan Suzuki. 
“It’s a pretty fragile supply chain as it is, just as we’re starting to see potentially some signs of relief. To see it continue, that’s definitely putting upward pressure on inflation,” said Suzuki, the firm’s deputy chief investment officer. “When the Fed has just recently started to have serious concerns about inflation, it’s clearly going to move the needle.”
Put together, it may lead to a market environment similar to the first few months of 2021, when long-dated Treasury yields spiked in response to building inflation expectations. Richly valued technology shares -- which make up the bulk of the biggest benchmarks -- are vulnerable in that environment, Suzuki said. Meanwhile, the Fed is expected to deliver three interest-rate hikes in 2022, adding to the pressure. 
Despite months of sustained inflation and deeply negative inflation-adjusted wage growth, American consumers have hung tough -- the University of Michigan’s final sentiment index actually rose in December. However, the inflection point for demand is nearing, in the eyes of Miller Tabak + Co.’s Matt Maley.
“If inflation remains strong, consumer confidence will begin to wane,” said Maley, the firm’s chief market strategist. “At some point, the higher prices causes consumers to pull in their horns and that will hurt profits in our consumer-driven economy.”

The company aims to get back to a cumulative profit dating from the last quarter they paid a dividend, which came in last winter's quarter. The total cumulative loss remaining to be offset before Cal-Maine pays a dividend is $21.1 million.
For the second quarter ended November 27, net average selling price for all eggs rose 12% to $1.37 per dozen. Total dozens sold increased to 276 million compared to around 274 million in the prior-year period, according to a company release.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dolph Baker attributed higher volume sales to continuous improvement in food service demand as restaurant traffic increased. In addition, a stronger export market supported demand for shell eggs and egg products, he said.
Farm production costs per dozen for the second quarter were up around 22%, which the company was owing to 29% higher feed costs per dozen produced.
Net sales in the second quarter rose over 12% to $391 million. The company managed to report a profit of $1.17 million, less than a tenth of its profit in the second quarter of last financial year."

Investing.com – NRX Pharmaceuticals stock (NASDAQ:NRXP) surged 11.5% in Wednesday’s premarket trading after the company said it had placed a fresh request to the FDA to give the ‘breakthrough therapy’ label to its drug that’s meant to help patients severely ill with Covid-19 and respiratory failure who have been already treated with Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD)’ remdesivir.
Patients who received NRx’s zyesami (aviptadil) after remdesivir had three-fold increased odds of being alive and free of respiratory failure after both 28 days and 60 days, compared with those that received a placebo, the company said.
Patients at the highest risk -- those on ventilators -- demonstrated a ten-fold higher odds of survival, the company said.
Aviptadil is a synthetic form of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) first discovered by the late Professor Sami and owes its branded name, ‘Zyesami’, to him. Although primarily concentrated in the lung, it was first purified from the intestinal tract.
VIP binds specifically to the alveolar type II cell in the air sac of the lung, where it has been shown have potent anti-inflammatory/anti-cytokine activity. VIP stimulates ATII cells to make the surfactant that must coat the lining of the lungs in order for them to exchange oxygen with the blood.  Loss of surfactant causes respiratory failure and alveolar collapse, hallmarks of Covid-19.
NRx claims that other than zyesami, no currently proposed treatments for Covid-19 specifically target this mechanism of action.
The fresh request by the company comes after the FDA rejected its previous request for emergency use authorization and breakthrough therapy designation for zyesami. The regulator asked the company to file a new plea based on new clinical evidence that aviptadil may demonstrate a significant improvement in treatment over existing therapies.

(Reuters) - Paris Hilton commands as much as $1 million a night working as a celebrity DJ, entertaining partiers at clubs in China, Dubai and on the Spanish vacation island of Ibiza. 
This New Year’s Eve, she will be playing an electronic set for the revelers who drop by a venue of a different sort -- her virtual island on Roblox.
Hilton created an island in the online virtual world, dubbed Paris World, where visitors can explore digital replicas of her Beverly Hills estate and its dog mansion, stroll a boardwalk inspired by the neon carnival wedding celebration she and husband Carter Reum hosted earlier this year at the Santa Monica Pier in California, and explore the island in a luxury sports car or Sunray yacht. 
Like other virtual hangouts, Paris World will collect small payments for purchasing virtual clothing or booking a ride on a jet-ski.
“For me, the metaverse is somewhere that you can do everything you can do in real life in the digital world,” said Hilton, who worked to create aspects of her globe-trotting life for fans. “Not everybody gets to experience that, so that’s what we’ve been working together on over the past year -- giving them all my inspirations of what I want in that world.”
Hilton, 40, joins a clutch of celebrities and brands rushing to embrace the metaverse, a broad term referring to a persistent virtual world. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg popularized the term this year he renamed the company to Meta to emphasize the metaverse's central role to the company's future. 
Brands such as Tommy Hilfiger brand launched a line of digital ready-to-wear fashion for Roblox avatars.  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) opened a virtual world called Nikeland in November, where visitors can play dodgeball with friends, lace on a pair of virtual Air Force 1 sneakers and win medals. Rappers Lil Nas X and Travis Scott have also held concerts last year for millions of virtual concertgoers.
For the socialite and reality TV-star turned entrepreneur, Paris World is the latest venture launched by her new media company, 11:11 Media. She and veteran media executive Bruce Gersh aim to capitalize on the burgeoning creator economy, in which celebrities like Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James leverage their influence to produce films, television shows and podcasts, brand marketing and to sell merchandise.
Hilton is most widely known for the reality television show “The Simple Life,” in which she and celebrity socialite, Nicole Richie, ditched their limos to travel America aboard a Greyhound bus. 
Hilton says the dumb blonde act was a put-on, “I was always in on the joke, but I knew exactly what I was doing. Behind the scenes, I was building a brand.” 
She has leveraged her gossip pages notoriety into 19 different consumer product lines, including perfumes, apparel, lingerie, cosmetics, sunglasses watches, shoes, handbags and jewelry, which together generated an estimated $4 billion in revenue over the past decade, the company disclosed. 
Investment-banker husband Reum introduced Hilton to Gersh, a former Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co and Time Inc executive, to create a media enterprise around one of pop culture's original influencers.
Since those early discussions, 11:11 Media has launched “This Is Paris,” a podcast in which she speaks candidly about her family and friends, and a pair of reality TV series, “Cooking With Paris” on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and “Paris In Love,” about her engagement and marriage to Reum. 

Hilton has also tapped into the mania for non-fungible tokens, collaborating with designer Blake Kathryn to sell three unique pieces of digital art -- one of which fetched in excess of $1.1 million, according to online auction platform Nifty Gateway.
“The final piece of the digital space is the metaverse,” said Gersh. “ We think that there's a real opportunity for Paris to influence, even at a younger level than who her core customer is. We've built a fantastic, whimsical world that we believe her fans and new fans will just love.”

Investing.com – Quidel stock (NASDAQ:QDEL) traded 2% higher in Wednesday’s premarket after the company said its testing kits are able to detect omicron, the coronavirus variant that’s raging across the world, resulting in record levels of infection.
Quidel said additional testing, using live virus, has proven that its QuickVue and Sofia SARS antigen tests are able to detect the live Omicron variant with similar efficacy as with other variants.
The company performed the additional tests after the FDA backed the company’s QuickVue antigen tests that used heat-inactivated omicron samples.   
Quidel said it continues to expand the weekly production of Covid-19 antigen tests to reach more people.
Fresh cases in U.S. have reached a record as the third year of the pandemic looms. Cases in the country topped 267,000 Tuesday with the consolation being that hospitalization remain below early 2021 peak levels. In most countries now, omicron is dominating delta and hopes are that it will box out the deadlier mutant through the immunity offered.
Quidel stock has been under pressure in last four sessions because of its proposed purchase of Ortho Clinical Diagnostics (NASDAQ:OCDX), with it sparking concern of equity dilution and higher debt.

162,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 29, 2021 07:00AM ET</span>",Tech Sector 2022 Outlook: Slowdown Or Reacceleration?,"By Daniel Shvartsman
The tech sector has led the market for much of the past decade, and the pandemic environment only accelerated that trend. 2021, however, put a slight crimp in that pattern. As of market close December 28th, the Nasdaq (23.2%) trailed the S&P 500 Index (29.2%) and was about slightly ahead of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (21.1%) on a total return basis year to date. The Nasdaq will finish comfortably in the double-digits return range, with the year-end rally pushing it over the 20% mark, but that is still a come-down from 45% total return in 2020, more than twice its peer indices. Underneath the surface, the action in the tech sector has been a lot more volatile, as early year speculation in SPACs and newly public companies gave way to selling off “pandemic winners”, as their forward growth looks much foggier.
As the end-of-the-year period has made clear, we’re entering a different environment, one of inflation and potential rate hikes on the one hand, and of continued pandemic-related twists on the other hand, including even the possibility that (one can hope) it has finally faded to being a background issue. The immediate and secondary effects on tech, from consumer spending to supply chain snarl to continued software adoption, will be hard to avoid, but also hard to predict.
Here are five things to watch for in tech in 2022. All figures as of market close December 28th.
If 2020 saw software players lead the sector, 2021 has been all about the semiconductors. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) more than doubled, becoming the highest valued semiconductor maker in the world, while the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) rose 45% for the year. Challenges to the supply chain, designed for maximum efficiency rather than redundancy, have caused logjams in phone production, car production, and just about everything that uses a chip in between.
High demand - driven by increased electronification of cars, the internet of things, artificial intelligence, and computing devices and power in general - combined with supply constraints suggest the boom can stretch out. “Longer-term secular trends are driving the semiconductor and wafer fab equipment markets structurally higher,” is how leading semiconductor equipment provider Applied Materials' (NASDAQ:AMAT) CEO Gary Dickerson put it. Semiconductors have been notoriously cyclical in the past, so the question is whether the increased capacity leads to an overbuild environment or is just enough to keep up with demand; if it’s the latter, semiconductors could continue to soar.
Software players were among the hardest hit in 2021, as the enormous pandemic-fueled growth rates they posted a year ago couldn’t be sustained. Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) continued to beat and raise this year, but especially slowing billings growth foretold a less exciting future, and the stock dropped 45% for the year and 59% from highs. That’s just the headline example, and while there are stocks which bucked the trend, many of the top software sector performers are SaaS 1.0 names like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) or  Teradata  (NYSE:TDC).
2022 and the outlook for 2023 should give investors clarity on whether a new normal will entail re-accelerating growth, or whether expectations need to be reset after the boom times of the early pandemic. Within the scope of higher interest rates and perhaps a renewed focus on profitability, the pressure on the sector may only increase.
Social media was another sector to struggle in 2021, and several new media peers fell along with it. Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) and  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) typified the pullback in these two industries with more than 30% drops for the year and more than 50% drops from highs, but it spread more widely to names like Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and even Snap (NYSE:SNAP).
At the same time, the longer-term secular trends - advertising dollars and content subscription dollars moving online - are unchanged. Moves like AT&T's (NYSE:T) spin-off of Warner Media to merge with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) suggest the importance of scale in the media industry, and the report of  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) (unconsummated) interest in Pinterest is just an example of the potential consolidation/strategic value in companies that capture consumers’ attention. So the question is where users’ attention goes, and whose investors benefit from it.
Market performance as a whole was reliant on the biggest companies in the world leading the way. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) were head of the pack, but Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (a.k.a. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) all finished in the green this year, with the latter two being the only ones to trail the wider indices. They have shrugged off antitrust scrutiny and the challenges of size by continuing to post impressive profit and revenue growth numbers, and generally outperformed their industries. And for all that, there’s an argument at least in some cases that the valuation is not crazy, whether it’s Meta’s 25x EV/free cash flow multiple or Alphabet’s 27.75x multiple. As more rate-sensitive names get hit, FAANMG will be on watch as the flight-to-safety play.
A changing and slowing environment might be the spur for increased acquisitions in the tech sector. While 2020 saw Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) take out Slack and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) buy Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX), 2021 was slower. Microsoft bought  Nuance Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:NUAN), and several data-center-related deals went through, but 2021 tech M&A was more about deals that didn’t happen: Zoom dropping its bid for Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN), Pinterest/Paypal talks not coming to fruition, and most notably, continued scrutiny for Nvidia’s planned takeover of Arm Holdings.
While antitrust concerns might stay the buying habits of some of the giants, a slower growth and still low rate environment could lead to renewed M&A action. This could come in sectors with abundant competition like software or media, especially. With news in the last weeks of 2021 of Oracle buying Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN), the starting gun for tech M&A in 2022 may have been fired.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Wednesday in holiday-thinned trade, continuing the recent positive tone as investors reassess the potential economic impact from the Omicron Covid variant.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 10 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 4 points, or 0.1%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 30 points, or 0.2%.
U.S. equities have rebounded since the hefty losses in late November when news of the fast-spreading Omicron Covid variant first emerged. The broad-based S&P 500 index has gained almost 5% in December, while the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed almost 100 higher on Tuesday, its fifth straight day of gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has underperformed, dropping 0.6%.
This positive tone exists despite the average number of daily Covid-19 cases in the United States climbing to a record high of 258,312 over the past seven days, according to a Reuters tally.
The Omicron variant was estimated to make up 58.6% of the coronavirus variants circulating in the United States as of Dec. 25, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday.
Recent studies have suggested the number of patients needing hospitalization with Omicron was sharply lower relative to Delta, the previous dominant variant, while vaccine makers have expressed confidence that their drugs will also offer protection.
Adding to the feeling of confidence, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky stated Tuesday that the center was not currently considering recommending a vaccine mandate for domestic flights. 
U.S. economic data has tended to be strong of late, including consumer confidence improving more than expected in December despite the resurgence in Covid-19 infections, suggesting that the country’s recovery remains on track. 
Turning to the corporate sector, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is likely to be in the spotlight with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk having exercised all of his options expiring next year, probably removing the vast bulk of the stock overhang on the EV-maker after his pledge of selling 10% of his stake.
Elsewhere, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) announced plans to boost its share buyback plan by 50%, now spending up to $3 billion, while also taking a five-year, $2 billion loan to fund its green projects and other corporate purposes.
Oil prices edged lower Wednesday, handing back some of the previous session’s gains on the back of a sharp decline in U.S. crude stockpiles.
Data from the American Petroleum Institute, released late Tuesday, showed U.S. inventories fell by 3.1 million barrels last week. If this is confirmed by  weekly data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due later Wednesday, it would be a fifth consecutive weekly decline, the longest run of draws since September.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% lower at $75.45 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $78.31 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.8% to $1,796.65/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1301.

164,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2021 06:31AM ET</span>",Western banks brace for extra scrutiny for Chinese offshore listings,"By Scott Murdoch, Kane Wu and Selena Li
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global investment banks will not reduce their appetite for lucrative work on Chinese companies' overseas listings despite the extra scrutiny and increased paperwork proposed under new regulatory changes, multiple sources said this week. 
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) last week proposed rules on overseas listings that include a requirement that banks that manage a Chinese firm's offshore listing register with the regulator.
Foreign banks will also have to file annual reports by Jan. 31 that detail the offshore listings of Chinese companies that they worked on during the year.
It is not clear how onerous the registration process will be or what will have to be included in the reports, but the requirement is unprecedented and unique, said the sources, which included several investment bankers and lawyers who work on overseas listings.
Going ahead, western banks will have to balance their desire for the millions of dollars in fees they earn by helping Chinese companies list on offshore bourses with the cost of tighter oversight. 
""They want to hold the international banks as responsible as they do for any of the A-share listings,"" said one of the sources, a capital markets banker with an European investment bank in Hong Kong, referring to the initial public offerings (IPOs) on Chinese exchanges.
""I don't think its great but also its not surprising. It's a move to increase their transparency and give themselves a much better view of what is going on in overseas deals that they did not have previously.""
The banker declined to be named due to sensitivity of the matter. 
Chinese firms' public offerings in the United States generated $1.6 billion in fee income for their underwriters from 2016 to 2020, according to Refinitiv data. This year, the listings generated $486 million in fees.
However, that was all earned in the first half of 2021 and since June there have been no new offshore listings as regulators announced plans to frame new rules to crack down violations such as anti-competitive behaviour and data privacy infractions.
Plans to tighten scrutiny over mainland companies' overseas share sales may ease the regulatory uncertainty that roiled financial markets this year and stalled listings, bankers and analysts have said.
TIGHTER CONTROL 
Hong Kong and New York bankers do the bulk of the work related to offshore listings by Chinese companies and they are not required to register with regulators in those jurisdictions or submit annual reports to them. 
Also, capital market underwriters are typically supervised by the securities regulator in the markets where they operate. 
Requiring offshore underwriters to register with the CSRC was an ""unprecedented"" move as Chinese authorities have not exercised ""extra territorial jurisdiction"" previously, said a Shanghai-based partner of a Chinese law firm.
The tighter regulatory control is aimed at fixing accountability in case of any wrongdoing or violation of rules by a company detected after the listing process, according to the banking and legal sources.
""This effectively means the Chinese regulators are further scrutinising the coverage and business of international underwriters,"" said Frank Bi, a Hong Kong-based partner at Ashurst LLP who focuses on international capital markets.
""It is likely to raise concerns from various international banks for mandate approval due to this unprecedented request.""
Under the proposed rules, the CSRC will report any malpractice to the offshore regulatory authority of the offending bank and the underwriter may be banned for three months or up to one year from filing new listings.

However, some bankers seem unfazed by the proposed changes.
""If we are required to file, we will file. It's not a big deal for us,"" said a Hong Kong-based senior investment banker with a Wall Street bank, who declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

165,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2021 06:30AM ET</span>",Explainer-How China's new offshore listing rules will work,"By Kane Wu and Xie Yu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Two Chinese regulators announced draft rules for Chinese firms' offshore listings over the past week, providing some clarity on how they plan to scrutinize capital market activities amid a broader regulatory crackdown.
• WHAT ARE THE NEW RULES FOR OFFSHORE LISTING BY CHINESE COMPANIES?
The China Securities and Regulatory Commission (CSRC) on Dec. 24 proposed tightening rules governing Chinese companies listing abroad, which it said would improve oversight. 
The new rules will target companies incorporated offshore using a structure known as Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). Previously, the regulator would only examine firms incorporated in China and wanting to do an offshore listing.
Under the proposed rules, an offshore IPO applicant will have to submit materials including its prospectus and opinions from industry regulators, if applicable, to the CSRC within three work days after it submits offshore application documents or makes the first overseas announcement of the planned deal. 
The CSRC will make a decision on whether the candidate can go ahead with their offshore listing plan or need clearance from other relevant regulatory bodies within 20 working days if adequate materials are submitted.
International banks that underwrite a Chinese firm's offshore listing will also be required to register with the securities regulator under the new rules.
China's state planner the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) separately said on Monday Chinese companies in sectors off-limits to foreign direct investment, such as Internet news and publishing, will require clearances from regulators before they can list their shares outside the mainland.
• WHAT MORE IS TO COME?
CSRC has given market participants until Jan. 23 to send their feedback on the draft rules.
Another Chinese regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), published draft rules on a cybersecurity review of certain companies seeking offshore listings in mid-November.
The CAC completed its consultation by Dec. 13 and is expected to publish final rules soon.
• WHAT'S STILL UNCLEAR ABOUT THE OFFSHORE LISTING REGIME?
Both the CSRC and NDRC guidelines are draft rules. There are some expectations that the final rules will be announced by the middle of 2022.
There is no clarity on whether there will be a single point of regulatory contact for offshore IPO-bound companies. 
Also, a State Council statement last week said it will set up a coordinated regulatory board among different government bodies to vet offshore listing plans, but it is unclear how the board will look, how it will work, or which department will have the authority to lead the decision-making process.
CSRC said the rules will not apply retroactively but it remains unclear whether companies that have filed for listings but haven't been listed will fall under the new rules, law firm JunHe said in a Dec. 25 note.
It is also unclear which and how many regulators’ opinions a company might need before submit their CSRC filings, or under what conditions a company should seek opinions from those regulators, the law firm said.
The draft rules also did not state clearly whether Hong Kong is considered as an offshore listing venue, although bankers and lawyers have expected Hong Kong to be put under the offshore listing regime.
• WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE NEW RULES ON CHINESE COMPANIES' OFFSHORE LISTING?

China-based law firm Han Kun said in a note that regulators at the listing venue will likely view CSRC clearance as a condition for the approval of the offshore listing, which may affect the timing of listings.
Bankers have said the new rules will provide transparency to listing prospects and will incentivise them to turn to public markets, especially firms in the technology and media sectors that were at the centre of a regulatory crackdown this year.

Investing.com – Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) traded 2.3% higher in Wednesday’s premarket trading as Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk exercised all of his options expiring next year, an indication that he is close to meeting his pledge of selling 10% of his stake in the EV-maker if he hasn’t already honored it.
With Tuesday’s option exercise on 1.6 million shares on Tuesday, Musk, already the company’s largest shareholder, has exercised all of the options on 22.8 million shares, which were due to expire in August. He also sold 934,090 shares for $1.02 billion to pay for taxes, the filings showed. The filings said the preset 10B5-1 trading plan was completed on Tuesday.
The maverick CEO has sold Tesla shares in several tranches since he conducted a Twitter poll November 7 asking whether he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla.
While the poll made it look like Musk would be directed by popular opinion – and the voting eventually favored him selling the stake – it was always likely to happen, as he needed money to pay a large tax bill on his newly acquired Tesla stock from the options due to expire, or else give up billions of dollars worth in options.
The latest sale takes Musk’s total to about 15.6 million shares, for around $16.4 billion.
According to Bloomberg, Musk needs to sell another 1.4 million shares to complete his pledge of offloading 10% of his stake, assuming the pledge excludes exercisable options.
If his exercisable options are factored into his overall ownership, he’ll need to sell even more.
Tesla has dropped 11% since the Musk poll, though that poll also coincided with an all-time high for shares. The company's shares are up over 50% year to date, and it drew sell-side price target hikes yesterday.

The Shanghai-based state-owned company said on Wednesday that it had decided to sit out the capital injection, which effectively allows its ownership to dilute to 5.94% from the previous 10%.
The change requires the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and other government authorities.
Morgan Stanley declined to comment.
The Wall Street bank acquired 39% of the joint venture from China Fortune in July, taking its ownership to 90%. It rebranded the unit as Morgan Stanley Securities China Co Ltd.

Global banks and asset managers have been boosting their stakes in their Chinese joint ventures since China first permitted foreign-majority ownership in some financial businesses in 2019.
Eight international banks have become the majority shareholders of their brokerage joint ventures in China. ($1 = 6.3683 Chinese yuan renminbi)

Land plots auctioned in the fourth quarter through Dec. 20 only fetched an average 3% premium over their starting prices, according to data compiled by China Real Estate Information Corp. That’s down from a 17% premium in the second quarter and 8% in the third, said the research agency, which tracks auctions across 300 Chinese cities.
Faced with slumping home sales, limited access to funding and rising borrowing costs, many Chinese developers have been refraining from replenishing their land banks this year. While Beijing is fine-tuning its long-running crackdown on the property sector and recently called on banks to help maintain its “steady and healthy development”, it has so far offered little help to boost developers’ confidence. 
“It’s unlikely the market sentiment will be restored in the short term, and we wouldn’t expect any notable recovery in land sales in the first half next year,” the CRIC said in the report.
Weaker land sales bode ill for the world’s second-largest economy, which slowed in the third quarter as the property and construction sectors shrank. It’s also set to worsen the debt problem at local governments, which, according to E-house China Research and Development Institute, rely on land sales for about 40% of their revenue. Municipalities are already facing revenue pressure from the flagging economy and struggling under a mountain of debts following years of investment binges. 
Earlier this year, more than a dozen large Chinese cities limited the number of land auctions in 2021 to three, instead of holding multiple smaller-scale events throughout the year, to prevent developers from inflating land prices. In November, however, some eased transaction requirements for developers, such as by reducing deposits ahead of bidding or refraining from asking for full payment within a month, according to the official Securities Times.

Investing.com –  Deutsche Bank  stock (NYSE:DB) (DE:DBKGn) traded 0.5% lower in Germany Wednesday after the lender was fined €8.66 million  ($9.8 million) by the country’s financial watchdog for lacking controls in its submissions for Euro Interbank Offered Rate.
Euribor is derived from the average interest rate at which banks borrow from one another, similar to the more widely known London Interbank Offered Rate. The rates are used to price consumer loans as well as complex derivatives.
""The bank at times did not have in place effective preventive systems, controls and policies,"" BaFin said.
Deutsche Bank accepted the fine and said it was implementing measures to improve its controls.
While BaFin said Deutsche Bank has a right to appeal, the company said it accepts the fine to create “legal certainty.” 
Banks including UBS (NYSE:UBS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) have in the past been fined for rigging the rates, the reason why they are being phased out now.
Germany’s largest lender has had a tumultuous time last few years, facing multiple legal and regulatory challenges while its management has struggled to restore profitability. The U.S. Justice Department recently told Deutsche Bank it might have violated a criminal settlement by failing to inform prosecutors about an internal complaint tied to the lender’s asset-management arm, Bloomberg said.

172,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2021 04:26AM ET</span>","Delta, Alaska cancel hundreds of flights due to bad weather, Omicron cases","By Kannaki Deka
(Reuters) -U.S carriers Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and  Alaska Air  (NYSE:ALK) Group cancelled hundreds of flights on Tuesday due to adverse weather conditions and rising cases of the Omicron variant. 
Delta said it expected to cancel more than 250 of 4,133 scheduled flights on Tuesday, while Alaska cancelled 170 flights across its network and warned of more cancellations and delays throughout the week.
Total cancellations as of 14.00 ET (19.00 GMT) within, into, or out of the United States stood at 1,034, with 2,694 flights delayed, marking a fifth day of flight cancellations.
Delta said it was working to re-route and substitute some planes. 
Alaska Airlines said as it heads into Wednesday and Thursday, it is proactively thinning Seattle departures by about 20% to allow for additional time to de-ice aircraft, a requirement during winter weather. 
Despite the ongoing disruption, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday it is not currently considering recommending a vaccine mandate for domestic flights, responding to a suggestion the previous day by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert.
""Right now, what we're talking about is ways to get people vaccinated. Certainly domestic flights has been a topic of conversation, but that is not something we're revisiting right now,"" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said on National Public Radio when asked about Fauci's comment.
Walensky said the CDC considers all potential policy and it strongly recommends vaccinations, noting that unvaccinated people have a much higher chance of being hospitalized from COVID-19.
U.S. carriers also canceled more than 1,000 flights on Monday after grounding thousands of planes over the Christmas holiday weekend as airlines struggled with staff shortages from COVID-19 infections and bad weather in parts of the country.
Snowy weather in the Pacific Northwest on Monday contributed to the cancellation of more than 110 flights scheduled to land at Seattle-Tacoma Airport.
Rising infections causing pilots and cabin crew to quarantine have also forced many flight cancellations.

The average number of new COVID-19 cases in the United States has risen 55% to over 205,000 per day over the last seven days, according to a Reuters tally.
The CDC said on Monday it was shortening the recommended isolation time for infected Americans to five days from 10 days previously, if they are asymptomatic. The move could help airlines and other businesses mitigate staff shortages.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York state appeals court on Tuesday put on hold part of a trial judge's decision blocking the New York Times from reporting on documents prepared by a lawyer for the conservative activist group Project Veritas.
Justice William Ford of the Appellate Division in Brooklyn said the Times does not have to turn over or destroy its copies of documents prepared by Project Veritas' in-house lawyer Benjamin Barr while it appeals the coverage ban.
On Friday, in a ruling that alarmed First Amendment advocates, Justice Charles Wood of the state Supreme Court in Westchester County said Barr's memos were not a matter of public concern, and rejected the Times' claim that barring coverage would unconstitutionally restrain its journalism.
The newspaper's editorial board called Wood's decision dangerous and his rationale ""breathtaking,"" saying no court should tell news media how to conduct their reporting and risk subjecting them to frivolous libel lawsuits as a means of controlling news coverage.
Ford directed Project Veritas to address by Jan. 14, 2022, why Wood's decision should not be thrown out, or at least stayed through a possibly expedited Times appeal.
Elizabeth Locke, a lawyer for Project Veritas, in an email said the group ""joined The Times in its very limited request to maintain the status quo to allow appellate review because the proper administration of justice is paramount to American democracy, the First Amendment, and the press' freedom under it.""
Times spokesman Jordan Cohen in an email said the newspaper was pleased that parts of Wood's ""unconstitutional order"" were stayed, and looked forward to having the Appellate Division vacate the order.
Led by James O'Keefe, Project Veritas has used what critics view as deceptive tactics to expose what it describes as liberal media bias.
The group is the subject of a U.S. Department of Justice probe into its possible role in the theft of a diary from President Joe Biden's daughter Ashley, which a right-wing website excerpted.
Project Veritas had been suing the Times for defamation over a September 2020 article describing a video it released concerning alleged voter fraud in Minnesota.

It subsequently objected to a Nov. 11 Times article that drew from Barr's memos, calling the publication an attempt to embarrass a litigation adversary.
The Times had not faced any prior restraint since 1971, when the Nixon administration unsuccessfully sought to block the publication of the Pentagon Papers detailing U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.

The tech giant suspended operations for its iPhone product line at Foxconn in Sriperumbudur, India, until the inadequate working conditions are addressed. 
Reuters reported that protests erupted earlier this month after 250 women suffered food poisoning.
An Apple spokesperson stated: ""We require our suppliers to meet the highest standards in the industry. Regular assessments are designed to ensure standards are met... We found that some of the remote dormitory accommodations and dining rooms being used for employees do not meet our requirements and we are working with the supplier to ensure a comprehensive set of corrective actions are rapidly implemented.""
Foxconn has struggled with worker conditions in the past, including a spate of suicides in 2010, with ten workers jumping from the roofs of its factories and dormitories. In response to these issues, Foxconn said it was restructuring management at the plant.
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) are trading slightly higher in pre-market trading with all eyes on how the company navigates Covid-related store closures and whether it can cross the $3 trillion mark in market cap, which is less than a 2% move away."
175,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2021 03:21AM ET</span>",Exclusive-California commission claims retailers violating plastic bag law,"By Valerie Volcovici
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Big retailers are breaking California law and misleading consumers by selling plastic shopping bags bearing language and symbols that falsely suggest the bags can be recycled, a state-appointed commission alleged this month.
The group has asked California to force retailers to strip these bags of the ubiquitous ""chasing arrows"" logo and the words ""recycle"" and ""recyclable,"" Reuters has learned. If successful, that move could make the sacks ineligible for sale at checkout counters throughout America's most populous state. The commission also is taking aim at padded envelopes and packaging materials used for home delivery, and plastic films on some grocery items.
In a Dec. 3 letter viewed by Reuters, the California Statewide Commission on Recycling Markets and Curbside Recycling asked the California attorney general and regulator CalRecycle to crack down on what it claims is illegal labeling that's undermining the state's efforts to tackle plastic pollution.
Fooled by recycling symbols, Californians mistakenly are tossing this material into curbside collection programs that don't accept it, the commission said. That's driving up costs for recycling companies to fish the stuff out of the waste stream and fix equipment jammed by these soft plastics.
The complaint did not single out any retailers by name. The California Grocers Association (CGA) said it does not believe current recycling labels on reusable bags are misleading. CGA spokesperson Nate Rose said the bags meet the law's certification guidelines - including requirements that they be made of a minimum of 40% post-consumer recycled material and be durable enough to be used 125 times. 
In an interview with Reuters, Heidi Sanborn, chair of the recycling commission, said it's not surprising that Californians are confused. 
""It is a Wild West of recycling labeling in California and there is no sheriff in town,"" said Sanborn, founding director of the National Stewardship Action Council, which works to cut product waste. The 16-member commission is comprised of waste industry executives, environmental advocates and public officials. It is tasked with advising CalRecycle and providing recommendations for improving the state's recycling system.
The commission's complaint comes as California grapples with what critics say has become a loophole in the state's 2017 ban on single-use shopping bags. That legislation, the first of its kind in the nation, came amid fierce opposition from the plastics industry, which spent nearly $6 million in a failed bid to stop it, according to state lobbying records. 
A compromise provision in the measure allowed retailers to sell reusable plastic bags for a minimum of 10 cents each. The legislation also states the bags must be capable of being recycled in California.
It's that provision that has the recycling commission clamoring for enforcement by the state. In practice, converting soft plastics such a shopping bags and packaging films into new products is so cost-prohibitive that recyclers say no market exists for this material. Thus, these items are not widely accepted in curbside recycling programs across California. For that reason, the commission says, they should not be labeled ""recyclable."" 
Similarly, the commission alleges that some retailers, amid rising public pressure to reduce waste, are deceiving consumers with language stating that their bags and plastic films can be returned to participating stores for recycling. 
Four commission members told Reuters that retailers have not shown evidence that these programs are, in fact, recycling this material. In-store recycling bins, they said, tend to attract a jumble of trash that ends up in landfills. 
Among retailers touting bag-return programs is CVS Pharmacy, the drug store unit of Rhode Island-based CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS). The chain sells reusable plastic sacks bearing the chasing arrows logo and fine print instructing consumers to ""recycle this bag in participating stores.""
CVS Health spokesperson Eva Pereira did not respond to questions about how many of the company's more than 1,100 California stores participate. She said CVS hires outside firms to handle its store take-back recycling initiatives ""and expects that those partners' processes are compliant with applicable law."" One of the company's main recycling solutions vendors, g2 revolution, did not respond to requests for comment.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), too, promotes a plastics take-back program in California. Spokesperson Saige Kolpack said the Seattle-based retailer is ""making rapid progress"" in reducing its use of single-use plastic packaging. When asked by Reuters to provide evidence that waste returned through its California initiative is being recycled, she said: ""We don't have anything to share for that question.""
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) spokesperson Lauren Willis said the bags the retail giant sells in California are designed to meet the requirements of the state's plastic bag law and ""are 100% recyclable through our in-store collection program along with other polyethylene film items that aren’t typically curbside recyclable."" She did not respond to requests to provide documentation on how materials collected this way are recycled or how many of its California locations participate. Walmart has 311 retail units in California, including supercenters, neighborhood markets and Sam's Club warehouse stores.
Lance Klug, a spokesperson for CalRecycle, said the regulator supports ending ""deceptive"" labeling on plastic bags and packaging films. But he said enforcement lies with local district attorneys and California Attorney General Rob Bonta.
Bonta's office said it is committed to enforcing state environmental laws, but said it could not comment on a ""potential or ongoing investigation."" 
If the state follows the advice of the commission, it could effectively end the sale of these bags and films in California, or force retailers to make them truly recyclable, said commission member Jan Dell, founder of environmental group The Last Beach Cleanup. 
""This will destroy their ability to claim that their products are recyclable,"" she said.
RECYCLING MENACE
Globally, less than 10% of all the plastic ever produced has been recycled, according to the United Nations, because it's cheaper to bury or burn it.
This waste is clogging landfills, despoiling the oceans and harming wildlife. Governments worldwide have responded with polluter-pays laws and bans on single-use plastic such as drinking straws and shopping bags.
In California, the often thicker plastic bags now sold by retailers are supposed to be used dozens of times. In reality, environmentalists say, many consumers quickly toss them in the garbage. Worse yet, they said, those that end up in recycling bins are complicating the work of recycling firms.
Recyclers have to devote time and labor plucking bags out of the waste stream lest they damage their sorting machinery, said Pete Keller, vice president at  Republic Services Inc  (NYSE:RSG), one of the largest U.S. waste managers. Errant bags frequently wrap around the rotating discs that separate waste by size and weight, he said, forcing recyclers to shut the equipment down.
Keller said he supports stripping recycling language from these bags as part of a wider education effort to get Californians to stop throwing them into their curbside bins.
The plastic industry said that would be a mistake as more would end up as garbage. Some labels direct consumers to a website called How2Recycle, which gives instructions for recycling through store programs, according to Zachary Taylor, director of the American Recyclable Plastic Bag Alliance. The alliance is part of the Plastics Industry Association lobbying group that led the opposition to California's bag ban.
""Removing state-mandated labeling...will drive more plastic to landfills,"" Taylor said.
It remains to be seen whether California responds to the recycling commission and forces retailers to prove their reusable bags are truly recyclable. 
Green groups say the state needs to begin cracking down now in preparation for an even bigger enforcement task ahead. In October, Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law a new environmental ""truth in labeling"" measure for all products and packaging sold in California - not just shopping bags. That legislation makes it illegal for companies to use the word ""recyclable"" or the chasing arrows symbol on items that aren't recyclable in the real world.

That legislation goes into effect in June 2025. Between now and then, regulator CalRecycle must come up with a list of plastics which it deems recyclable in curbside programs.

The plans come as Didi is moving towards withdrawing from the New York Stock Exchange under pressure from Beijing after running foul of Chinese authorities by pushing ahead with an initial public offering (IPO) there earlier this year despite being asked to put it on hold while a review of its data practices was conducted.
The Hong Kong mechanism, known as 'listing by introduction', would allow owners of Didi U.S. shares to transfer them to the city's bourse gradually, said the people. They declined to be identified as the plan was not yet public. 
Didi aims to file for the Hong Kong listing by end-April and list by June, one of the people said. 
The plans are being prepared six months after Didi, sometimes dubbed the Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc of China, made its debut in New York after raising $4.4 billion in a conventional IPO. 
It said earlier this month that it plans to delist from the U.S. bourse and pursue a Hong Kong listing.
A spokesperson for Didi, whose apps, in addition to ride-hailing, offer products such as delivery and financial services, did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.
Unlike typical IPOs, companies listing stock by introduction in Hong Kong raise no capital and issue no new shares. The mechanism was popular among companies in the past looking to build a brand in Hong Kong and the rest of Greater China. 
Didi has picked Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), China Merchants Bank International (CMBI), and China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) International (CCBI) to manage the Hong Kong listing process, said the people.
Goldman declined to comment, while CMBI, and CCBI did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Reuters reported this month Didi planned to hire Goldman to work on the Hong Kong listing before embarking on the New York delisting. It had asked the bank to come up with proposals on how a Hong Kong listing and New York delisting would work.
Goldman was one of the main underwriters of Didi's New York IPO, along with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).

In a statement issued on Tuesday, Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) also said it had secured a warrant seeking a police arrest of Serba chief executive officer and group managing director Mohd Abdul Karim Abdullah. The regulator said the CEO is ""currently at large"".
Serba declined to comment while the police did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters wasn't able to contact Abdul Karim for comment, nor establish his location.
The regulator said the false statement was in relation to a 6.014 billion ringgit ($1.44 billion) revenue figure published by Serba in its quarterly report for the period ended Dec. 31, 2020.
The investigation into Serba was launched in May following a report by external auditor KPMG.
The latter had raised concerns about not being able to verify contracts and transactions worth 3.5 billion ringgit with 11 of Serba's customers. KPMG resigned in June after Serba filed a lawsuit against it.
KPMG had said it will vigorously contest any court proceedings, but declined to comment after resigning from the auditor role.
Serba appointed EY Consulting in July as a special independent reviewer after stock exchange Bursa Malaysia's issued a directive that the company should review the issues raised by KPMG.
But Serba last month filed a lawsuit against EY Consulting, seeking to block it from releasing any findings on the group.
Bursa Malaysia and EY Consulting did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Serba's shares have been suspended since Dec. 15 after it defaulted on a $222.22 million sukuk. It said in a bourse filing that the incident may significantly impact the group's financial performance.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Wednesday morning, thanks to the continuous impact from a megacap technology selloff that weighed on U.S. shares overnight.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.96% by 9:26 PM ET (1:26 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.93%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 jumped 1.04%, with markets re-opening after a holiday.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.77%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.45% and the Shenzhen  Component was down 0.44%.
U.S. shares closed on an upward trend, however, in a sign that they could claw back some of the previous session’s losses. U.S. Treasuries saw little change.
A U.S. index of Chinese shares also fell as regulatory tightening of overseas share sales and the economic risks from a property slowdown weight on investor sentiment. However, the People’s Bank of China is expected to add more stimulus to boost the economic recovery in 2022.
Investors took advantage of a 17% jump in global equities to lock in some profits as the year draws to an end. But central banks’ monetary policy tightening, China’s outlook, and COVID-19 remain key risks in 2022, even as the evidence suggests that the omicron COVID-19 variant is milder than first thought.
“We are pretty constructive going into 2022... we’re having fits and starts related to this omicron of course. This will create maybe demand delayed but not destroyed,”  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Wealth Management chief investment officer Katie Nixon told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, China will need much stronger policy action in 2022 to bolster growth and help reignite interest in emerging-market equities, which otherwise will remain one of the big uncertainties for investors, Nixon added.
Other investors also remained cautious as markets enter the last few days of trading in 2021 and even into 2022.
“We’re sober about potential headwinds that still could be coming, even the rest of this year, but early in 2022; the Fed is going to be raising rates, that will change things for the markets,” Allspring Global Investments head of active equity Ann Miletti told Bloomberg.
However, Miletti also struck a more positive note, saying, “we are also hopeful because as you look at a lot of the economic data, it remains strong.”

Chinese companies reduced investment and remained reluctant to borrow in the fourth quarter, with small business’ financing costs soaring despite favorable policies, the Beige Book showed. While there was a surprising improvement in the property industry from the third quarter, an easier credit environment seen in November reversed this month, according to the report.
Evergrande has been turning its attention to delivering homes and paying workers even as debt payments loom. Its shares, which lost most of their value this year, advanced as much as 10% on Tuesday. The embattled developer was labeled a defaulter by international ratings firms for the first time earlier this month after it failed to repay liabilities on time.  
Key Developments:
Chinese Firms Slowed Investment, Unwilling to Borrow: Beige Book (7 a.m. HK)
Amid an environment of reduced investment, only the retail and manufacturing sectors borrowed more this quarter compared with the previous three months, China Beige Book International said in a report released Wednesday, while services growth slowed “across the board.”
In addition, it became more expensive for smaller firms to borrow, with the gap between the interest rates on loans for small and large companies surging to 2.73 percentage points, the highest level since the survey began in 2012, according to the report.
That’s despite a series of policies aimed at helping smaller companies, and the central bank guiding overall credit growth to pick up in November to counter a slowing economy dragged down by a property downturn and sporadic Covid-19 outbreaks. 
China’s Stable Economy Clouded by Property and Export Outlook (5 a.m. HK)
China’s economy expanded at a moderate pace in the final month of the year, supported by better business sentiment, easing factory inflation pressures and faster car sales. However the slumping property sector and slowing external demand are clouding the outlook for the world’s second-largest economy. 
That’s the outlook from Bloomberg’s aggregate index of eight early indicators for this month. The overall number stayed unchanged in December, indicating the economy is still improving at a stable pace, but there are mixed signals from some of the real-time economic data.

A group of nearby homeowners who said their houses were destroyed by the fire had filed a lawsuit against Exxon.
An Exxon spokesperson told Reuters the company was reviewing the order. 
The company said on Monday the refinery continued to operate at reduced rates following the fire, and the unit involved remained shut down. 
""The Baytown Refinery will not be fully restored to service until safe to do so,"" the spokesperson said. 

Four workers were hospitalized as a result of the incident, two of whom were confirmed to have been released from the hospital.
The Baytown facility houses a chemical plant, an olefins plant and the country's fourth-biggest oil refinery, with a capacity to process 560,500 barrels per day of crude.

(Reuters) -The S&P 500 closed slightly lower after hitting a record intraday high on Tuesday, as a four-day rally lost steam in thin trading and investors weighed Omicron-driven travel disruptions and store closures.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday shortened the recommended isolation time for Americans with asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 to five days from the previous guidance of 10 days.
The update follows approvals for new pills and more vaccines to fight COVID-19. It helped investors shrug off concerns over thousands of flight cancellations and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shutting its New York stores due to surging cases, and put U.S. stocks on pace for monthly gains.
""This is a holiday-shortened week. So daily movements will likely be exaggerated because of a low relative volume,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.
Seven of the 11 major S&P 500 sector indexes rose on Tuesday. Technology and Communications Services led declines.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 95.83 points, or 0.26%, to 36,398.21; the S&P 500 lost 4.84 points, or 0.10%, to 4,786.35 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 89.54 points, or 0.56%, to 15,781.72.
In company news, Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co rose 1.46% as Indonesia lifted a ban on its 737 MAX, three years after the crash of one of the aircraft and loss of all 189 people on board.
Markets are in the seasonal Santa Claus rally, with CFRA Research data showing the S&P 500 has on average risen 1.3% in the last five trading days of the year, and first two days of the new year since 1969.
""Investors are digesting the gains from the last three days, ... but there are concerns such as how will the Omicron variant affect the market? Would that end up undoing the Santa Claus rally? What about the Fed raising interest rates, could that cause challenges for the year ahead?"" Stovall said.
The Federal Reserve signaled earlier this month three quarter-percentage-point interest rate hikes by the end of 2022 as the economy nears full employment and the U.S. central bank copes with an inflation surge. [L1N2SZ1G5]
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.55 billion shares, compared with the 11.56 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.04-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.88-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 81 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 105 new highs and 264 new lows.

Scaringe said majority of Rivian's roughly 71,000 preorders for its R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV in the United States and Canada were for a version of the vehicles with a small battery pack option, which provides 314 miles of range on one charge.
""In order to serve the largest number of preorder holders, we will be prioritizing building the Adventure Package with Large pack battery during the next year,"" Scaringe said in the mail that was posted by a Rivian customer on Reddit, a social media platform.

After the electric vehicle maker reported its first quarterly results as a listed firm earlier this month, Scaringe had outlined production challenges citing global supply-chain constraints, the COVID-19 pandemic, a tight labor market and short-term issues around building electric battery modules.
Rivian has delivered 386 of the 652 vehicles it has built, including its pickup and SUV.

The bigger battery pack, called the Max pack, is expected to give a mileage of 400 miles on a single charge. Only 20% of the preorders were for the Max pack.

The world's largest cruise operator, however, said a few destination ports were reviewing their protocols and processes due to the fast-spreading new variant.
Many passengers and media reports, including those from CNN and Euronews, said authorities of a few ports in the Caribbean, Puerto Rico and Mexico disallowed passengers to disembark from cruise ships that were carrying active COVID-19 cases.
""Looks like my cruise this Friday is a cruise to no where,"" wrote one Reddit user on a  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) forum late Monday.

(Reuters) - American shoppers flocked to brick-and-mortar stores this holiday season, with especially strong sales in several states where the rate of full vaccinations against the COVID-19 virus is less than 60%, according to an analysis of Mastercard (NYSE:MA) SpendingPulse holiday sales data.
About halfway through the more than $800 billion U.S. holiday shopping period, the highly contagious Omicron coronavirus variant began spreading rapidly. Despite some concerns, many U.S. holiday shoppers visited stores from the start of November, through Black Friday and the Saturday before Christmas. 
Arkansas, Kentucky and West Virginia, all of which are less than 55% fully-vaccinated the least vaccinated U.S. state, against the COVID-19 virus, were among the states with the highest sales growth between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24 versus last year, according to the Mastercard data provided exclusively to Reuters.
In each of these states, in-store holiday sales rose by more than 10%. Overall, in-store sales rose 8.1%, according to Mastercard. (Graphic: U.S. holiday shoppers rushed stores even as Omicron rages U.S. holiday shoppers rushed stores even as Omicron rages, https://graphics.reuters.com/RETAIL-HOLIDAYSHOPPING/USA/jnvwejgwjvw/chart.png) 
Consumers went out shopping because they already had low concerns about getting infected and saw little risk in doing so, said David Marcotte, a senior vice president at retail consultancy firm Kantar.
""I don't think it was to make a statement or because they lack e-commerce access. I live in Arizona - the relationship between mask-wearing, vaccination and perception of risk does impact shopping,"" he said. 
In Idaho - the least-vaccinated U.S. state according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - brick-and-mortar sales rose between 6% and 8%.
""Those states tend to have more libertarian leanings and have been less careful about being out and about,"" Forrester research analyst Sucharita Kodali said.
In-store sales growth was more moderate in parts of the East Coast, where vaccine rates are among the highest in the country. In New York, where about 72% of people are fully vaccinated, store sales grew between 5-6% during the holidays. New York has been especially hard-hit by Omicron.
In Illinois, where only about 64% of people are fully vaccinated, brick-and-mortar sales rose between 9-10%, the Mastercard data showed. 
""Because of all the shipping delays, people were worried about the risk of something not being available so they went out to have it in hand,"" said Chicago toy store owner Katherine Nguyen, who saw higher store traffic than usual this holiday season. 

""I have never seen traffic and revenue like this in 25 years. Never seen this increase,"" Nguyen said, adding that even though Omicron is keeping two of her employees at home, it has not hurt consumer foot traffic.
To be sure, there were some highly vaccinated states, including Minnesota and New Mexico, where store sales also increased by more than 10%.

190,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2021 05:27PM ET</span>","Analysis-South America, battered by COVID-19, now winning global vaccination race","By Gram Slattery and Augustin Geist
RIO DE JANEIRO/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Throughout much of 2020 and early 2021, South America was ground zero in the global fight against COVID-19.
Oxygen ran low in Peru. Gravediggers worked through the night in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Bodies were stuffed into shipping containers in Guayaquil, Ecuador.
Brazil, the largest country in Latin America, saw its COVID-19 death toll rise to the second-highest in the world, while Argentina and Peru reported some of the heaviest death per capita figures anywhere.
But in recent months, despite patchy health services and lower income levels than in Europe or the United States, the region has emerged as a surprise winner in the vaccination race. 
South America is now the most vaccinated region in the world, with 63.3% of the population fully inoculated, according to the Our World in Data project, which collects official numbers from governments worldwide. 
Europe comes in second with 60.7%. In Africa, just 8.8% of the population has completed a full vaccination regimen.
Infection and death rates have plummeted compared to the middle of the year when Latin America and the Caribbean accounted for almost half of global deaths and infections. Now it is Europe where - due to the spread of the Omicron variant - contagion is rebounding. 
Epidemiologists point to several factors to explain the speedy vaccination drive. But the most important, they say, has been decades of successful inoculation campaigns that have created the infrastructure needed to deliver jabs en masse, while instilling trust among the population.
In Brazil, successful inoculation drives in the last half century against smallpox, meningitis, polio and measles means that very few people are opposed to vaccines, said Paulo Lotufo, an epidemiologist and professor at the University of Sao Paulo.
In some major cities, including Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, over 99% of the adult population has received at least one dose, authorities say. Brazilians commonly claim with pride that the nation has a ""cultura de vacinacao,"" or ""vaccine culture.""
The same can be said for several other nations in the region, which have previously launched expansive inoculation campaigns after traumatic infectious disease outbreaks in recent decades.
""This confidence, built up over several years, is based on the benefits of our extensive vaccination schedule,"" said Leda Guzzi, a Buenos Aires-based infectious disease expert.
Effective public health messaging has been key, too, said Albert Ko, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health and a collaborating researcher at Rio de Janeiro's Oswaldo Cruz Foundation.
In Brazil, for instance, a mascot resembling a docile white droplet, known as ""Zé Gotinha,"" has been heavily used by health officials to promote the vaccine, even as President Jair Bolsonaro has himself declined to be jabbed.
Earlier this year, baile funk star MC Fioti released a viral video with a modified version of one of his hits in association with the Butantan biomedical institute in Sao Paulo promoting the vaccine. 
STORM CLOUDS GATHER
The region, however, is far from out of the woods, particularly as the Omicron variant spreads across the globe.
Even with an impressive 63.3% of the population vaccinated, the region remains below the threshold that most scientists say is needed to offer mass protection. Omicron is now raging in much of Europe despite similar levels of inoculation. 
Among children, vaccination rates also vary dramatically from country to country in Latin America, with authorities in Mexico and Brazil relatively slow to approve shots for minors. 
Another potential issue is the vaccines used.
Many countries, such as Chile, Uruguay and Brazil, relied heavily on Coronavac, a vaccine produced by China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd, particularly in the initial phase of their vaccination drives.
While the vaccine is credited with getting jabs into arms quickly, its efficacy is lower than that of its peers, and at least one initial study has indicated it may not produce antibodies against the Omicron variant. Earlier in December, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that recipients of Sinovac - as well as all other ""inactivated"" vaccines - should get boosted.

Epidemiologists also say, Omicron may be more adept at dodging the immunity generated by previous COVID-19 infections. That could be bad news in a region where the virus ripped through entire neighborhoods in earlier stages of the pandemic.
""Many people, particularly in vulnerable communities in Brazil, have been infected,"" said Ko, the Yale epidemiologist. ""We see this virus infecting people who had already gotten infected before.""

The airline said winter weather conditions in the Pacific Northwest and Midwest and the Omicron variant are affecting its operations.
Although the variant is said to be milder compared to previous ones, it is more transmissible, meaning that workers who test positive, even if asymptomatic, have to isolate. It has resulted in businesses such as airlines being unable to stay open or being forced to cut services because of worker shortages.  
On Monday, U.S. public health officials changed their recommendation on isolation after infection, saying those who are asymptomatic only have to isolate for five days, compared with the previous guidance of 10 days while also shortening the time that close contacts need to quarantine.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden is considering former Federal Reserve Governor Sarah Bloom Raskin to lead regulation and supervision at the central bank as part of a slate of three nominees to its Board of Governors, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.
Raskin, who served in the Treasury Department in the Obama administration, could bring a tougher regulatory profile to the country's most powerful bank oversight role, a position recently vacated by Randal Quarles, a Donald Trump appointee who riled progressives with a more Wall Street-friendly approach.
Biden is also considering two Black economists - Lisa Cook from Michigan State University and Philip Jefferson from Davidson College in North Carolina - for seats on the Fed Board, which would help fulfill a goal of diversifying the leadership of the U.S. central bank. All current governors including Chair Jerome Powell are white, and the Fed has had just three black governors in over a century of existence, all men. Cook, if appointed, would be the first-ever Black woman on the Fed Board.
Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the Journal's report, and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Raskin, Cook and Jefferson could not be reached for comment.
The vice chair of supervision is the most consequential of the vacancies on the Fed's seven-member board available to be filled by Biden, giving the first-term Democrat an opportunity to leave a lasting imprint on both Wall Street oversight and U.S. monetary policy. 
The industry, progressive lawmakers and advocacy groups have been waiting anxiously for the White House to name the new supervision chief who will drive policy on thorny issues including climate change financial risks, community lending rules, and financial technology companies.
Biden has already decided to renominate Powell to a second term as Fed chair, which rankled progressive Democrats. He also nominated Governor Lael Brainard to the Fed's other vice chair slot, which is focused on the Fed's economic and monetary policy agenda. 
Progressive groups want Biden to install a tougher Wall Street cop who will tighten up rules introduced following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and which Quarles has eased. These include regulations on speculative bank investments, derivatives, capital and liquidity. 
Quarles, who formally stepped down from the supervision role in October and plans to leave the Fed by year end, said he tailored the rules to banks' risks and that the industry's stellar performance https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/top-us-banks-smash-profit-estimates-rebounding-economy-2021-07-14 amid the pandemic shows he did not weaken the system.
Powell, who like Quarles is a former partner at private equity giant  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG), backed Quarles' changes but has said he will allow the new supervision chief to take the lead on regulation. 
Jeff Hauser, founder and director of the Revolving Door Project, said Biden was under pressure from progressives. 
""The Biden Administration is under considerable pressure to mitigate how much Biden's financial regulation and bank consolidation agenda was undermined by renominating Powell, and a strong Vice Chair for Supervision actually empowered by the Fed Chair would help,"" he said.
EYES ON MONETARY POLICY, TOO
Raskin's name has been among several in circulation for the supervision role in recent months. That includes Richard Cordray https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/white-house-consider-richard-cordray-top-fed-banking-regulator-wsj-2021-11-30, the former head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, who like Raskin is looked on favorably by some of the party's most vocal Wall Street critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
For its part, the industry had been pushing for Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, seen as a more moderate pick willing to listen to the industry, according to two industry insiders. 
Whoever Biden nominates must be confirmed by a closely divided Senate. Raskin has been confirmed twice before, although those votes predated the current partisan rancor that pervades Capitol Hill.
A Harvard-trained lawyer with an undergraduate degree in economics from Amherst College, Raskin served on the Fed Board from 2010 to 2014 before moving to Treasury as deputy secretary. 
While her role then did not specifically involve bank oversight, Raskin made her positions clear on key elements of the regulatory reform efforts the Fed undertook after the 2008-2009 financial crisis. She slammed, for instance, proprietary trading as of ""low or no real economic value"". She also pushed for a strict interpretation of the ""Volcker Rule,"" a major reform curbing such speculative investments that Quarles then helped to relax over the past four years.
If appointed, Raskin and the other prospective new Board members will also arrive at the Fed at a critical juncture for the central bank's stewardship of the U.S. economy and its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic that triggered a short but historically deep recession in 2020.
While employment remains nearly 4 million jobs below pre-pandemic levels, the Fed in late 2021 shifted its policy stance in the face of an inflation rate that is running at nearly three times the central bank's 2% flexible annual target. 
The surging prices for consumer goods and services, initially dismissed as a pandemic-oriented overhang that would be ""transitory,"" has grown into a substantial headache for both Biden and the Fed.

Earlier this month the Fed opted to accelerate the winding down of its bond-buying program, and projections from policymakers have signaled as many as three interest rate increases next year.
Raskin appears to have leaned to the dovish side in her four years at the Fed, transcripts of policy-making meetings show. But even the central bank's most ardent advocates of loose policy have recently shifted given the hefty toll they fear inflation is inflicting upon American workers.

Investing.com — Shares of cryptocurrency exchange Eqonex Ltd (NASDAQ:EQOS) fell more than 6% after H.C. Wainwright analyst Kevin Dede downgraded the stock.
The analyst made the decision following news last week that Eqonex CEO Richard Byworth was stepping down amid a strategic review and being replaced by COO Andrew Eldon.
""The December 20 bomb. A somber end-of-year surprise came in the announcement that CEO Richard Byworth was replaced by COO Andrew Eldon, effective immediately, while ""transformational"" strategic opportunities were actively pursued,"" Dede said.
The analyst added that they had hoped Eqonex would bounce back on the sharp acceleration of trading volumes, with more users understanding the value of Eqonex's platform.
However, he said Eqonex daily trading volume is thought to be ""hovering at flattish levels through the fall season instigating the board's re-thinking leadership and the end game within a rapidly advancing crypto environment.""
Pointing to Eqonex's press release in which it said it is engaged in ""ongoing strategic discussion with third parties,"" Dede explained that it implies the company is evaluating merger or takeover options.
""With no clearly articulated strategy in the terse December 20 press release and a nebulous prognosis, we are taking our licks and moving to the sidelines with a Neutral rating and no PT, downgraded from our previous Buy,"" Dede said."

204,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2021 12:00PM ET</span>","BNP's Italian bank, unions spar over strike take-up","MILAN (Reuters) -Italian banking unions on Tuesday challenged the figure provided by BNL, the Italian arm of French banking group BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), over the take up of the previous day's strike in a rare show of open confrontation in the sector.
BNL on Monday said 29.8% of its workers had joined the strike - the first such protest since the 1990s.
The bank said it had ensured it could continue to operate thanks to its digital capabilities at time when workers were also absent due to year-end holidays.
Unions on Tuesday said BNL should clarify how it had calculated the number given than 80% of branches had remained shut.
""Embracing the clear challenge launched by the company unions will strive to render even louder workers' cries of protest,"" Fabi, First-Cisl, Fisac-Cgil, Uilca and Unisin said in a joint statement.
Such a degree of confrontation is unusual in Italy's banking sector, where workers are only laid off through early retirement schemes offered to older employees on a voluntary basis and very costly for lenders to fund.
Under such schemes, workers receive up to 80-90% of the salary from a fund financed by the banks laying off staff until they actually qualify for pension.
Employees' requests to join the scheme normally exceed the number of departures planned by banks.
The animosity highlights the difficult phase the industry is enduring with negative rates making lending unprofitable, while it faces a digital challenge from non-banking players which are not subject to the same tight regulation and oversight. 

Workers at BNL protested against its decision to use external providers for IT and back office services, a move that unions said affects 900 out of a total of 11,500 BNL employees in its central offices and around 700 branches across Italy.
Unions have also voiced grievances about BNL's sale to Worldline in July of an 80% stake in its card payment processing business Axepta Italy.

The stock has more than halved since the December 23 move by the healthcare manager that prompted several brokerages, including Barclays, to cut their ratings and price targets for the stock.
The company’s decision came after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) froze enrollment at its Colorado centers based on deficiencies detected in a focused audit.
To make matters worse for the company, the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing has also issued sanctions against the company.
CMS indicated that the suspension will remain in effect until the company remedies the deficiencies to its satisfaction.

In the lawsuit filed in June 2020, users accused Google of illegally invading their privacy by tracking internet use while Google Chrome browsers were set in ""private"" mode.
The plaintiffs are arguing that Pichai has ""unique, personal knowledge"" of issues relating to the Chrome browser and privacy concerns, a Monday court filing showed. 
Google spokesman José Castañeda told Reuters the new requests were ""unwarranted and overreaching"".
""While we strongly dispute the claims in this case, we have cooperated with plaintiffs' countless requests ... We will continue to vigorously defend ourselves,"" Castañeda said.
Pichai in 2019 was warned that describing the company's Incognito browsing mode as ""private"" was problematic, yet it stayed the course because he did not want the feature ""under the spotlight,"" according to a court filing in September. 
In her order on Monday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen in San Jose, California, said ""a few documents establish that specific relevant information was communicated to, and possibly from, Pichai,"" and therefore supported a request from the plaintiffs' lawyers to question him.

Google has earlier said it makes clear that Incognito only stops data from being saved to a user's device and is fighting the lawsuit.

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge dismissed a lawsuit accusing  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s LinkedIn of inflating the number of people who watched video ads so the networking platform could overcharge hundreds of thousands of advertisers.
In a decision on Monday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen said that while some LinkedIn statements may have been misleading, the plaintiffs failed to show their legal remedies were inadequate before suing under two California laws that offered only equitable relief such as restitution.
The San Jose, California-based judge also said LinkedIn had no implied duty to provide ""accurate ad metrics,"" citing its disclaimer that it was not responsible for click fraud or illicit third-party activity that could affect ad costs.
Advertisers in the proposed class action accused LinkedIn of inflating its metrics by counting video ad ""views"" from users' LinkedIn apps, even when videos played only off-screen because users scrolled past them.
The lawsuit began after LinkedIn said in November 2020 https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/blog/linkedin-news/2020/how-we-re-working-to-improve that its engineers had fixed software bugs that may have led to more than 418,000 overcharges, most under $25. LinkedIn said it provided credits to virtually all affected advertisers.
Judge van Keulen had in August dismissed some of the advertisers' claims while letting others proceed https://www.reuters.com/technology/linkedin-must-face-narrowed-us-lawsuit-claiming-it-overcharged-advertisers-2021-08-04.
Monday's dismissal was with prejudice, meaning the lawsuit led by advertisers TopDevz Inc of Sacramento, California, and Noirefy Inc of Chicago cannot be brought again. LinkedIn is based in Sunnyvale, California.

Lawyers for the advertisers did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment. LinkedIn and its lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.

Investing.com — Shares of  Fubotv Inc  (NYSE:FUBO), the television streaming firm, dropped Tuesday after Roth Capital lowered its price target.
FuboTV's shares are down over 3%, to $16.30, in early trading after Roth analyst Darren Aftahi lowered the firm's price target on Fubo to $28 from $45.
Aftahi told investors that the ""stay-at-home"" premium many stocks had benefitted from during the pandemic is waning, and the analyst doesn't believe it is relevant now.
The analyst also said the stock has been pressured by the renormalization in streaming multiples and the possible slower rollout to gaming or sportsbooks than expected earlier in the year.
In addition, Aftahi said the company's acquisition of Molotov could provide an easier entry to the European market through subscriber acquisition. 
Roth Capital kept a buy rating on the shares, as it did earlier this month when Aftahi initially set a $45 price target and told investors he expects FuboTV to post a loss per share of 74 cents for the fourth quarter 2021."

Investing.com –  Novavax  stock (NASDAQ:NVAX) jumped 4.2% Tuesday after the company’s Covid-19 vaccine secured emergency use approval from India’s drug regulator.
The approval to Novavax comes at a time when Omicron-related cases are beginning to spike in the country though they are still few in number and hospitalization rates remain low.
Earlier this month, the company said its two-dose Covid-19 vaccine demonstrated “strong immune responses” against Omicron and other variants. A third dose given six months after showed an even stronger response, the company said.
The vaccines will be made by Serum Institute of India, which also makes AstraZeneca's (NASDAQ:AZN) Covid-19 shots for both Indian and foreign markets.
India, the world’s second most populous nation, was one of the world’s most affected by the pandemic, mostly owing to the delta variant that raged through the country in April-May.
The country has mostly relied on AstraZeneca’s vaccine and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin to vaccinate its citizens. More than 1 billion people have got at least one shot of the vaccine in the country. More than 61% of the eligible population has got both the doses.
Novavax’s vaccine has been approved by the WHO, the EU, Indonesia and the Philippines. The company expects to apply for FDA approval by Friday.

According to StreetInsider, analyst Aaron Kessler is maintaining his market perform rating on the fitness equipment-maker while pointing out to the latest data indicting softening demand and increasing costs amid supply chain bottlenecks.
Peloton, one of the biggest winners of the pandemic when people stayed home and bought the company’s equipment to keep fit, was left shocked as people junked its gear to exercise outside once the economy reopened. Its attempts to tap the mass market by lowering the price of its flagship exercise bike also fell flat, its image of being a maker of high-end items coming in the way.
In the ongoing quarter, Peloton expects revenue to come in between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. For the full year, the company has guided for revenue of $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion.
According to Kessler, both the quarterly and the annual estimates are aggressive, believing that the company factored in a stronger seasonality return in the current quarter."

Analyst Alex Henderson believes the company is pivoting to the cloud and the multiple should thus advance, according to StreetInsider. 
Henderson’s target is around 25% higher than the stock’s Monday closing of $243.32. Analyst Alex Henderson earlier had a target of $266 for the stock.
According to the analyst, recent hacker-related attacks should strengthen demand for F5's security products. The year should see software exceed 50% of product revenue and that should help the annual operating margins improve by at least 200 basis points, Henderson wrote.
For the ongoing financial year ending September 30, 2022, F5 expects to deliver revenue growth of 8%-9%. This forecast, given in October, was 2%-3% ahead of the Street’s, according to Needham. Software revenue growth for the year is seen at 35%-40%.
In the current quarter that ends Friday, F5 expects to deliver revenue of $675 million at center of its guidance range, with adjusted earnings around $2.77 per share at midpoint of the range.

The Paxlovid drug is “extremely promising” because it can help people who risk falling seriously ill, Health Minister Karl Lauterbach told German news agency DPA. The country’s health authorities reported a total of 10,443 omicron cases as of Tuesday, a 43% jump from the previous day.
Doctors will be looking for the Pfizer pill to fill a gap for high-risk patients, who until now have been treated with monoclonal antibody therapies. Germany expects first deliveries of the medication in January, according to DPA.
So far omicron hasn’t shown signs of making an overall impact on Germany’s outbreak, as contagion rates continue to recede from record levels in late November. 
On Tuesday, the country reported 215.6 cases per 100,000 people over the past seven days, the lowest level since Nov. 9. Germany, which is discussing making shots compulsory, aims to fully inoculate 80% of the population by the end of January, compared with 71% currently.

HERZLIYA, Israel (Reuters) - Israeli foodtech firm SavorEat on Tuesday launched a plant-based burger system personalized to each customer, one of the first companies to use 3D printing technology to cook food.
Typically, vegan burgers from companies like Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) are frozen and later cooked on a grill. 
SavorEat's technology, however, are made on site by a self-contained 3D printer with three cartridges containing oils and other ingredients. Customers can choose how much fat and protein they want in each burger, which takes about six minutes to cook.
""It's a mix of innovation of meat alternative and digital manufacturing where we can also cook the product,"" Racheli Vizman, SavorEat's chief executive, told Reuters.
She said the firm's burgers are made with a combination of potato and chickpea and pea protein. 
Demand for meat alternatives by health and environmentally conscious consumers has jumped in recent years, while alternative protein startups raised more than $3 billion in 2020.
Another Israeli company, Redefine Meat, last month started to deploy meatless whole cuts in European restaurants. 
SavorEat, funded mainly by Israeli institutions and whose Tel Aviv-listed shares rose 11% on Tuesday, said its products would initially be served at a local burger chain. 
The company is also collaborating with food service firm Yarzin Sela that supplies Israeli high-tech companies and forged a deal with Sodexo (PA:EXHO) to serve its vegan burgers to U.S. universities.

""There is a growing segment of people called 'flexiterian' -- people that are actively trying to look for meat alternatives to reduce their meat consumption,"" Vizman said, citing about one-third of the U.S. population. 
Oded Shoseyov, chairman and chief scientist of SavorEat, said the firm is also working on a plant-based version of a pork breakfast sausage for the U.S. market.

Investing.com – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock traded 0.4% higher in Tuesday’s premarket as traders ignored the company's recent store closures in the wake of a rampaging omicron Covid-19 variant.
The iPhone-maker has closed at least 16 stores in New York City including some major ones -- Fifth Avenue, SoHo, Grand Central and World Trade Center locations -- to shoppers because of rising Covid-19 cases, according to Bloomberg. In a slight departure for its New York customers, the company is letting customers place orders online and pick them up at the stores.
The company had already temporarily shut its Carnegie Library store in Washington, as well as outlets in Ohio, Texas, Georgia and Florida. Earlier this month, CEO Tim Cook sent a memo to staff informing them of the company delaying its corporate return-to-office deadline from February 1 to a “date yet to be determined.”
According to New York Times, the seven-day U.S. average of new daily cases climbed past 214,000 Sunday, an 83% jump over the past 14 days. Omicron is now the dominant variant of the virus in many cases and spreading at least twice as fast as delta.
The market has been anticipating Apple’s climb to $182.86, a price that will give what is already the world's highest valued publicly traded company a market cap of $3 trillion.  
The stock had closed 2.3% higher Monday at $180.33. The stock touched a lifetime high of $182.13 on December 13 to hit a market cap of $2.98 trillion. It's only four years since the company became the world's first trillion-dollar enterprise.
Several brokerages recently upgraded the stock. BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan and JPMorgan’s Samik Chatterjee see the stock at $210. Evercore’s Amit Daryanani has a target of $200 for the shares.

225,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 28, 2021 07:11AM ET</span>",15 E-Mobility Stocks That Could Become The New Sector Leaders In 2022,"by Marco Oehrl and Robert Zach
Investing.com - Sooner or later, there will be no way around switching from a combustion engine to an electric vehicle. This is no longer just the view of politicians, but also of the stock market. This can be seen in the KraneShares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility Index (NYSE:KARS), which lists companies such as the largest Chinese manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd Class A (SZ:300750) or the Japanese manufacturer of electric motors  Nidec Corp  (T:6594), as well as the American electric car manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), in its list of holdings and has been able to gain 25 percent this year despite sometimes violent price fluctuations.
But that is in the past. What counts now is the future. Which of the manufacturers will be ahead in the next twelve months and which e-mobility stocks can benefit most from this megatrend?
Registration of new electric vehicles seems to be stagnating in some regions of the world, but in Europe, e-mobility is being pushed forward with vigor. In Brussels, people are aware that this is a must to achieve ambitious climate targets.
Alongside the UK and France, Germany is the main driver behind this current development. As early as 2020, sales of plug-in hybrids and pure electric vehicles in the German market reached almost 16 percent market share.

See image in top of article. Source: IEA Global EV Outlook 2021
However, the level of commitment from the different vehicle manufacturers to shift to electric vehicle production is varied, which is ultimately also related to the legal framework conditions in the respective target markets.
If a manufacturer fails to comply with the specified limits for CO₂ emissions, they either have to purchase expensive CO₂ certificates to compensate or pay penalties.

See image in top of article. Source: IEA Global EV Outlook 2021
Among the long-established manufacturers, Volvo AB ADR (OTC:VLVLY) (50 percent), Faw Car Co Ltd (SZ:000800) (40 percent) and SAIC Motor Corp Ltd (SS:600104) (30 percent) are targeting the largest share of electric cars in terms of total vehicle sales by 2025.
This rapid development will lead to tougher competition for the newcomers (Tesla, Nio (NYSE:NIO), & co.) in the automotive sector that are relying on purely electric drives.
In the long term, it will probably not be easy for them to convince Generation X and Millennials, who have already built up brand loyalty to the Teslas of the world, to switch to “legacy” brands. Especially given how loyal they are to their beloved cars and how used they are already to planning their next road trip based on the availability of charging stations.
Either way, the car of the future is electric, as several countries have already decided by law that the transportation sector must be converted to a CO₂-neutral variant.
Norway is the clear front-runner in this respect, as the country is committed to achieving this goal as early as 2025. This means that passenger car manufacturers who want to continue to exist in this market are forced to act accordingly. The fact that Norway is on the path to achieving this goal is shown by the fact that the 11,274 electric passenger cars newly registered in November already accounted for 73.8 percent of total sales.
The transformation of the automotive industry has set an avalanche rolling that will also help some other industries to achieve exorbitant growth. And that's regardless of whether Tesla or the long-established manufacturers emerge victorious from the transformation.
The basic material from which the CO₂-neutral dreams are made is lithium, because without this raw material there would be no lithium batteries, which are found in almost every electric vehicle. The electric motors themselves, in turn, consist of a significant amount of copper, and semiconductors are again needed for operation and communication between the technical components.
Then, of course, there is electricity, without which no electric car would budge even an inch. Not to mention the charging stations, which should ideally be available in sufficient numbers throughout the country.
The latter is of particular importance if we want to avoid the warnings from ADAC, Europe’s largest motoring association, of waiting at too few charging stations during the coming vacation travel waves. Or rows and rows of empty batteries weighing tons having to be collected by tow trucks on the highways.
Just a few days ago, Enbw (DE:EBKG) opened Germany's largest fast-charging station to date at the Kamener Kreuz interchange, where up to 52 electric cars can be recharged for the onward journey.
It is hubs like this that need to be set up in the shortest possible time so that drivers no longer base their purchase decision solely on battery range. With a conventional combustion engine, no one asks how far you can get on a tank of gas because gasoline is available on every corner.
Corporations like EnBW have recognized this, and it is no longer a question of operating the charging stations economically from the outset. The goal is to cherry-pick the busy routes and earn money from the new trend in the long term.
So let's take a look at the fifteen e-mobility stocks that Wall Street analysts believe have the greatest upside potential over the next twelve months.
Investing.com used our stock screener for this, filtering for stocks from the e-mobility sector that are followed by at least five analysts and have at least five buy recommendations and where there is the greatest upside potential. To make the list, the stocks had to have a market capitalization of at least $5 billion. The list includes companies from the traditional automotive industry such as manufacturers and suppliers, the semiconductor industry, as well as charging station operators that can benefit from the electric mobility trend:
Note: All calculations refer to the respective closing price on December 15, 2021.
Analysts see the greatest share price potential in charging infrastructure provider ChargePoint. On average, the 16 experts surveyed by Investing.com predict a potential return of 62.69 percent for the CHPT share price in the next 12 months. Of those, 10 advise buying and 6 advise holding, with no sell recommendations. The average target price for ChargePoint stock is $31.56.
The facts: ChargePoint is the largest among the publicly traded charging specialists, which also include EVgo, Blink Charging and Volta, and at the same time currently the cheapest, considering its forward EV-to-Sales ratio, which is just 24.5x, according to InvestingPRO, while Blink Charging, EVgo and Volta come in at 50.9x, 56.8x and 33.1x, respectively.
Recently, however, ChargePoint shares came under pressure after the company presented its quarterly results. While the company raised its revenue guidance, it reported an unexpectedly large loss for the third quarter. Still, the bulk of the numbers speak for themselves: Revenue for the quarter rose 79 percent to $65 million, at the high end of the company's guidance. Adjusted gross margin for the period was 27 percent, up from 20 percent in the year-ago period. As of Oct. 31, ChargePoint had about 163,000 charging points in operation, including about 45,000 in Europe. Through roaming agreements, customers can also charge their vehicles at more than 290,000 stations operated by other providers. ChargePoint expects revenue of $73 million to $78 million for the final quarter ending Jan. 31, 2022, and raised its full-year revenue guidance, also ending Jan. 31, 2022, to $235 million to $240 million from $225 million to $235 million.
If the mobility revolution is really to succeed, it needs a functioning charging network. Having the market leader in the depot is probably not the worst idea, especially since the Biden administration wants to have at least 500,000 charging stations installed by 2030, as stated in the current EV Charging Action Plan in the U.S., which totals an investment volume of $7.5 billion.
""The future of mobility in our country and around the world is electric,"" Vice President Kamala Harris recently told the Associated Press at an electric vehicle charging station in suburban Maryland.
The next stock Wall Street sees as having great potential over the next 12 months is Plug Power, a maker of fuel cell engines for e-mobility and the associated hydrogen infrastructure that enables green, sustainable energy for businesses. The average price targets of the 24 analysts surveyed by Investing.com indicate a potential upside of 58.77 percent. The target price is $49.22.
As recently as mid-November, Morgan Stanley raised its price target for PLUG shares from $43 to $65, citing a much better electrolyzer and hydrogen production business.
""We are raising our revenue estimates significantly, particularly for electrolyzers (+131 percent) and hydrogen production (+86 percent), driven by management's comments on the growth of these businesses over the next several years. This leads to a 51 percent increase in our price target to $65, a 61 percent increase from current price levels,"" Morgan Stanley’s analysts said.
The U.S. infrastructure bill also plays an important role for Plug Power, with $8 billion earmarked for the development of regional clean hydrogen centers. That includes $500 million for clean hydrogen production and $1 billion to reduce the cost of producing clean hydrogen with electrolyzers.
According to McKinsey, the industry remains in its infancy. According to one study, total investment in hydrogen projects and along the entire value chain is expected to reach an estimated $500 billion by 2030. The basis for this is electrolyzers, i.e. devices in which hydrogen and oxygen are decomposed with the aid of electric current to produce hydrogen. This is then stored and used as final energy in a variety of applications. It is precisely in this area that Plug Power is a leader, which makes the stock still interesting despite the recent volatility in this sector.
The return potential of Chinese e-car manufacturer Li Auto should not be neglected either. Analysts see a price appreciation potential of almost 47 percent for the company, which was founded in 2015 and is in direct competition with Tesla and Nio.
The average price target of 20 analyst estimates is $44.40. The company unveiled its first and so far only model, an electric hybrid SUV called Li ONE, in December 2019, but it received an update in May this year. The vehicle is priced between $29,000 and $76,000, depending on features. In 2020, it was among the top ten best-selling vehicles in China across all fuel types. Li Auto set another monthly delivery record as recently as November. The Chinese electric car maker reported a total of 13,485 Li ONEs delivered last month. This represents an increase of 190 percent compared to the same month last year. By comparison, Nio sold only 10,705 cars in the same period, while Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) came in at 15,613. Li Auto's total deliveries so far this year stand at 76,404.
In the third quarter, Li Auto increased its revenue to $1.2 billion, up nearly 230 percent from the same quarter last year. Li Auto's sales growth in the third quarter was even higher than that of rival companies Xpeng and Nio.
For the fourth quarter, Li Auto expects to sell 30,000 to 32,000 cars. That would be a year-on-year increase of more than 100 percent. The company's Changzhou production facility has an annual production capacity of 100,000 units, but can be expanded to 200,000 units.
And valuation-wise, Li Auto (6.1x) is also cheaper than its peers Nio (7.8x) and Xpeng (10.3x) based on forward EV-to-sales ratio, according to InvestingPRO data.
In the long run, Li Auto should continue to benefit from strong growth in domestic demand for e-cars. The Chinese electric vehicle market was valued at $98 billion in 2019 and is expected to register a compound annual growth rate (""CAGR"") of 31 percent over the forecast period (2021 - 2026), according to Mordor Intelligence.
Overall, Li Auto's stock certainly looks promising and definitely belongs on the watchlist for all investors who are concerned with electric mobility and are looking for a low-cost alternative to Nio or Tesla.
Alternatives: Other companies in the e-mobility sector that are also seen as having greater upside potential by analysts over a 12-month period are: BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF) Ltd Class A (SZ:002594) (+17.37%), BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) (+16.87%), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) (+15.5%).

226,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 28, 2021 07:00AM ET</span>",European Markets Trade Higher in Quiet Tuesday Trading,"by Daniel Shvartsman
European markets traded higher Tuesday as general market bullishness - or complacency appears to have set in for investors.
At 12:50 CET (1150 GMT) the DAX traded up .6%, the CAC 40 was up around .4%, as was the Euro Stoxx 50, while the FTSE MIB was up .7% and the IBEX 35 traded .5% higher. This comes on the heels of a moderate gain for European indices to kick off the holiday week, and the S&P 500 closing at an all-time high during the U.S. session. The FTSE 100 remains closed in observance of Boxing Day.
Among the Euro Stoxx 50 winners are  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE) (+2%), perhaps in response to a decline in energy prices as Europe has booked more LNG cargoes from the U.S. to address the recent shortage. Italian utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI) was also up, trading 1.3% higher. Koninklijke Philips NV (AS:PHG) is also up 1.8%, though still well below November levels after news of FDA concerns over recalled ventilators. Prosus (AS:PRX) leads losers on the index, as the internet conglomerate is down 2.6%, likely related to Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) trading lower on the day as concerns over recent Chinese regulations catch up to the stock, though Just Eat Takeaway (AS:TKWY) trading down 2.3% doesn't help either, with Prosus being a shareholder in both firms.. 
Coronavirus case counts remain on watch across Europe, but the market seems to be more focused on continental governments' lighter responses. France has imposed restrictions on public gatherings and remote work requirements, but is leaving schools open; Spain has so far responded to record case counts by reimposing the requirement to wear masks outside but no other national changes. While this is in part response to the reports that the omicron variant poses a lesser risk of serious illness, especially for vaccinated individuals, it may also reflect people's fatigue with harsher restrictions. In any case, the market's response has been favorable.
Oil traded higher as well Tuesday morning, following a strong finish yesterday. Brent Oil Futures are up 1.3% at 10:40 CET (920 GMT), with Eni SpA (MI:ENI) up .9%, and Royal Dutch Shell PLC Class A (AS:RDSa) and TotalEnergies SE (PA:TTEF) each up .7%.
Among active stocks, Genfit (PA:GNFT) is down 3.3%, though still well up from when it announced a partnership with  Ipsen  SA (PA:IPN). Veolia Environnement VE SA (PA:VIE) moved up 2%, reaching a new 52-week high. Novavax Inc (TG:NVV1) (-5.1%) and BioNTech SE (DE:22UAy) (-2.6%) traded off on the German market, continuing the recent slide for vaccine makers, while  HelloFresh SE  (DE:HFGG) traded up 2.2%. Healthcare company  Grifols  SA (MC:GRLS) also traded 1.3% higher in mid-day trading.

Holiday trading brought gifts for bulls, as the S&P 500 set an all-time high yesterday, with the good cheer spreading to other indices and asset classes. Is there room for an encore, or might this be too much of a good thing? With oil prices climbing, natural gas prices calming in Europe, and covid cases rising but hospitalizations and government restrictions trailing, there's a lot in the air.
Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, December 28th.
Yesterday, oil started lower before reversing for a more than 2% gain. Today, Crude Oil WTI Futures are up 1.4% while Brent Oil Futures are up 1.2%, each setting one-month highs. It fits with the markets' theme for the last week - demand will return and any hurdles from the Omicron variant of Covid-19 will be temporary. The question in oil's case is whether this ends up pressuring the economy via higher input costs and inflationary pressures.

S&P 500 Futures are up .27% and above the 4800 mark for the first time, fresh off the index closing at an all-time high yesterday. Nasdaq futures were up .5%, reflective of the tech sector's continued strength, and Dow futures are up 83 points, or .23%. The Santa Rally - the tendency for markets to rise during the last five trading sessions of one year and the first two of the next year - appears upon us, and unless surprising bad news pops up, it's unclear what will slow down the momentum.
In line with the momentum theme, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are up 1.2% pre-market after Wedbush analyst Dan Ives hiked his price target for the automaker from $1100 to $1400/share. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is up 1.5% as well, on no specific news.

Dutch TTF Natural Gas Futures in Europe continued to drop, marking the fifth straight day of declines, as LNG cargoes from the U.S. and news of a planned meeting between the U.S. and Russia may have eased concerns of an energy shortage in the region. European utilities such as  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE) and  Enel  (MI:ENEI) traded higher as a sign of relief on the continent. Eyes are on the forecast, with mid January expected to bring a blast of cold weather, increasing demand for gas as an energy and heating source.

After a positive start to the week, leading cryptocurrencies have fallen off. Bitcoin is down 3.3% while Ethereum is down 3.5%. Solana is down 4.5% while Cardano, yesterday's leader, is down 6%. The sector didn't get the ""bulls went home for the holidays and talked family members into buying"" bump, but it's unclear what news might be driving the sell-off today, if any.
On the flipside, gold futures are up .5% in early trading, whether attributable to concerns over spiking COVID-19 cases or perhaps the renewed emergence of inflation.

Covid cases continue to set new heights in places around the world, but so far governmental responses have been muted. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) announced that quarantines for COVID could be only 5 days instead of 10 days; France enforced public gathering restrictions but kept schools open; and Spain has so far only required outdoors mask wearing. While people wait to see how reduced the severity of the omicron variant might be and what the full impact will be on hospitals and lives, governments around the world are exercising caution in taking the sorts of measures seen last year around this time or at the outset of the pandemic.
Whether omicron means the end of the pandemic from a health standpoint or just from a policy standpoint remains to be seen, and fingers are crossed that omicron is indeed mild. So far, the market has taken things in stride with only a couple short-lived sell-offs, and nothing that has restricted Santa's effect on the markets.

Investing.com – Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) was up 1.4% in Tuesday’s premarket trading after a Wedbush analyst raised his target to $1,400, citing the clear pivot to electric vehicles and the company’s dominance of that as reasons for his optimism.
Analyst Daniel Ives’s target is 28% higher than the share’s previous closing price of $1,093.94. Ives earlier had a target of $1,100 for the stock.
According to reports, the analyst believes the stage is now set for the entire EV ecosystem to take a “significant step forward”. The higher customer adoption will accelerate the biggest transformation of the auto industry in 70 years, Ives wrote.
Ives believes Tesla’s successful tackle of the chip shortages, better than any other automaker, puts it in a position of strength heading into the new year. The analyst also has a bull case price target of $1,800 for the stock, assuming Tesla’s successful navigation of the Chinese market, the world’s largest market for EVs.
According to Ives, Tesla is now on an about 50,000 monthly run-rate for China in the fourth quarter that could ramp further early next year. He believes the chip shortage is a transitory issue.
Gigafactory openings in Austin and Berlin should solve the problem of demand exceeding supply, Ives said.
The analyst sees the automaker delivering between 1.4 million and 1.5 million vehicles in 2022 with an improving profitability. Tesla has delivered 6,27,572 units in the first nine months of the current financial year.

229,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2021 06:16AM ET</span>","Telefonica reaches agreement to cut about 2,700 jobs in Spain","MADRID (Reuters) -Spain's Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) has reached an agreement with labour unions to cut some 15% of its domestic workforce via voluntary redundancies in a plan estimated to cost it 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) this year, the telecoms group said on Tuesday.
The plan to cut around 2,700 jobs in an increasingly competitive market in early 2022 will yield annual savings of more than 230 million euros from 2023, Telefonica said in a filing to the stock market regulator.
""The impact on cash flow generation will be positive in 2022 as will the booking of savings, since the employees will leave during the first quarter of 2022,"" the company said.
The programme, open to all those born in 1967 or earlier and with at least 15 years of employment at the company, will limit the percentage of departures from some areas, the company said. 
Telefonica had initially intended to spare business units dedicated to cybersecurity, marketing and artificial intelligence, though unions opposed. The company intended at first to offer a package to about 1,800 workers. 
The company is Europe's third-largest telecoms firm and employs 18,500 people in Spain. The redundancies follow similar moves by rivals Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) and Orange in recent months. 
Globally, Telefonica employs nearly 114,000.

Telefonica has been grappling with intense competition in an increasingly low-cost Spanish market as well as pressure from investors at a time when it needs funds to finance 5G infrastructure.

Investing.com – Didi Global ADRs (NYSE:DIDI) traded nearly 2% higher in Tuesday’s premarket after the conclusion of a post-listing lock-up of shares took them down to a record low of $5.29 in the previous session.
The ride-hailing company listed on the NYSE on June 30 and its backers, including Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) and Uber (NYSE:UBER), were barred from selling their shares till the expiry of the 180-day lock up period, based on the June 29 date of its listing prospectus.
The company’s ban on staff selling its shares till it lists in Hong Kong – reported first by Financial Times -- also weighed on the shares Monday. There was another factor behind that weakness that swept other Chinese shares too with it – that of Chinese authorities bringing in new rules to curb new offshore listings in sectors restricted from foreign investment.
But for a brief IPO pop, Didi stock has traded below its issue price of $14 since listing as it has faced scrutiny from regulators. The stock closed at $5.30 Thursday.
Didi has had to bear the brunt of the Chinese authorities’ wrath for ignoring their advice to delay its public offering, pending scrutiny of its data handling practices. That didn’t go down well with the regulators in China, which then asked it to stop onboarding new users while also mandating online stores to take its apps off their platforms.
The fate of the investors was sealed when the company earlier this month decided to delist from the NYSE and list in Hong Kong. Didi has said it will ensure its NYSE-listed stock is convertible into tradable shares on another stock exchange.

Company chairman Hui Ka Yan vowed in a meeting on Sunday to deliver 39,000 units of properties in December, compared with fewer than 10,000 in each of the previous three months.
Evergrande, grappling with over $300 billion in liabilities and at risk of becoming China's biggest ever default, has been scrambling to raise cash by selling assets and shares.
The firm missed a deadline to pay offshore coupons worth $82.5 million earlier this month, threatening to trigger cross-default on its roughly $19 billion of international bonds. 
Fitch and S&P downgraded Evergrande to ""restricted default"" and ""selective default"" respectively following the missed payment.

Evergrande has new coupon payments worth $255 million due on Tuesday for its June 2023 and 2025 notes.

Investing.com – Shares of Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) traded 0.8% higher in Tuesday’s premarket following on yesterday's gains on reports of there being a strong demand for its Oculus virtual reality headsets in the current holiday season.
Citing the rankings of the app in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) store, KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson put out a report Sunday saying that Oculus was likely a popular gift over the holiday season.
According to Bloomberg, Patterson wrote that Oculus was “a top 5 entertainment app in five countries and a top 10 overall app in the U.S.” on Christmas Eve, and that the ranking “was even greater on Christmas Day,” as it was the number 1 overall app in the U.S. Christmas also put it among the top 5 entertainment apps in 14 countries.
According to StreetInsider, by December 26, the app’s ranking slightly worsened, but was still among the top 5 entertainment apps in 11 countries and number 2 overall in the U.S.

Investing.com –  Vipshop Holdings  stock (NYSE:VIPS) traded 1.5% lower in Tuesday’s premarket after the online discount retailer cut its guidance for the current quarter.
The company now expects its total net revenue for the fourth quarter to be between RMB34 billion and RMB35.8 billion (around $5.33 billion-$5.62 billion). In the worst-case scenario, this translates into a year-on-year range of flat to 5% down. The company had earlier guided for a 0-5% growth.
The China-focused retailer for brands attributed the revised outlook to its view of market and operational conditions. Times have been challenging for retailers in China as they battle slowing demand while complying with tighter regulatory oversight.  
Some signals for the weakness in the business were visible in the company’s third quarter when adjusted profit slipped to RMB1 billion from RMB1.4 billion in the same period a year ago. In the quarter ended September 30, Vipshop’s total net revenue rose 7.5% to nearly RMB25 billion.
Total orders were largely unchanged around 173 million while gross merchandise value rose 5% to just over RMB40 billion. GMV is the most commonly used barometer to determine the size and health of an e-commerce site and signifies the total value of products and services sold on the platform.
Vipshop found itself in the news for all the wrong reasons earlier this year after it was caught up in the investment strategy and then forced liquidation of Bill Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management, leading to 60%+ gains in the first 2+ months of the year and then giving away all of those gains in the following month.
The company announced a $500-million buyback in March to capitalize on the fallen share price. Vipshop shares are down almost 69% this year when the S&P 500 is up over 29%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Global stock markets rose on Monday and oil prices eased as investors hailed strong U.S. holiday season sales and some grew less fearful about economic damage from the Omicron variant of COVID-19.
Still, fears that the pandemic could hurt economic growth pushed gold prices to the highest in more than a week despite pressure from a firmer U.S. dollar.
A Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) survey showed a substantial rise in U.S. holiday season retail sales. This fueled investor optimism, boosting Wall Street and lifting a gauge of stocks across the globe by 0.87%. European gains offset earlier weakness across Asian markets.
Some investors grew confident a global recovery would regain steam next year even though the pandemic has prompted U.S. airlines to cancel or delay thousands of flights due to staff shortages, while several cruise ships had to cancel stops after COVID-19 outbreaks aboard.
In Asia, China reported its highest daily rise in local COVID-19 cases in 21 months as infections more than doubled in the northwestern city of Xian, its latest hotspot.
In France, the government convened a special meeting that could trigger new restrictions after the country hit another infection record.
Spot gold added 0.1% to $1,811.92 an ounce.
Wall Street's main stock indexes notched their fourth straight session of gains, after reports last week that the highly infectious Omicron variant may not be as deadly as earlier types of COVID-19.
""Heading into 2022 we will still have COVID uncertainties but the good news is that, according to the WHO, we may be see the end of the pandemic towards the end of year,"" said Jawaid Afsar, sales trader at Securequity. 
He added that next year markets must also contend with other issues, ranging from inflationary pressures to policy tightening and geopolitical risks.
Looking ahead, thin trading volumes ahead of New Year could make markets volatile. Still, since 1945, the last five trading days of December and the first two days of January have boded well for U.S. stocks 75% of the time, according to CFRA Research data.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.62%, nearing its highest level in over a month.
Mainland Chinese shares weakened, with Shanghai's benchmark sliding 0.4% and an index of blue chips retreating less than 0.1%. Property stocks did get a lift, though, after China's central bank vowed to promote healthy development of the real estate market.
Australia, Hong Kong and Britain were among markets closed on Monday for holidays. 
DOLLAR RANGEBOUND
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.98%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.38% after hitting a record high during the session. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.39%. 
In debt markets, U.S. Treasuries 10-year yields held below Thursday's high of just above 1.5%.
In foreign exchange markets, the dollar was rangebound, despite a hawkish turn at the Federal Reserve this month that saw policymakers signal three quarter-point rate hikes in 2022.

The dollar index fell 0.026%, with the euro up 0.01% to $1.1326

An engineering analysis is the next step in a process that could lead to a recall, although sometimes NHTSA closes such probes without requiring any action.
The agency had opened an investigation in 2019 covering the 2011-2014 Kia Optima and Sorento and the 2010-2015 Kia Soul, along with the 2011-2014 Hyundai Sonata and Santa Fe to investigate instances of non-crash fires.

SEATTLE (Reuters) -Rising COVID-19 cases, along with bad weather, caused airlines to cancel more than 1,000 flights on Monday, and the spread of the Omicron variant prompted the U.S. government's top infectious disease expert to suggest the government consider mandating vaccines for domestic flights.
Monday's travel woes marked a fourth day of flight cancellations, capping a glum Christmas weekend for thousands of passengers who were left waiting in airport queues and on customer service phone lines to re-book flights.
Airlines have struggled with staffing shortages as the spread of infections blamed on the Omicron variant forced many pilots, cabin crew and other workers to isolate at home.
Winter storms also took a toll on travel. On Monday, airlines canceled more than 1,300 commercial flights within or into and out of the United States. Travel-related stocks fell. 
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious disease expert, said a vaccine mandate for domestic air travel should be considered.
""That is just another one of the requirements that I think is reasonable to consider,” Fauci told MSNBC in an interview. 
President Joe Biden, speaking to reporters on Monday, declined to say whether he endorsed a vaccine mandate for domestic air travel. The president has previously said he did not consider them necessary.
Fauci appeared to walk back his remarks in a second interview on MSNBC later on Monday, and told CNN in another interview that he did not expect to see a vaccine mandate anytime soon.
""I did not say I support mandates on domestic flights. I said that is something on the table for consideration,"" Fauci told MSNBC host Joy Reid. 
In the CNN interview Monday evening, Fauci said he doubted the Biden administration would call for vaccine mandates for domestic flights ""in the reasonable foreseeable future.""
CDC SHORTENS QUARANTINE TIME
The average number of new COVID-19 cases in the United States has risen 55% to over 205,000 per day over the last seven days, according to a Reuters tally. 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday it was shortening the recommended isolation time for infected Americans to five days from 10 days previously, if they are asymptomatic. The move could help airlines and other businesses mitigate staff shortages.
The CDC also said on Monday it was investigating https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-cdc-investigating-nearly-70-cruise-ships-hit-by-covid-19-cases-2021-12-27 68 cruise ships after reports of COVID-19 cases on board. 
On Monday, snowy weather in the Pacific Northwest contributed to the cancellation of more than 110 flights scheduled to land at Seattle-Tacoma Airport.
A representative for Alaska Airlines, which canceled more than 140 flights on Monday due partly to snowy conditions in Seattle, told a passenger on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that it would take hours to speak by phone to someone from customer service, a sign of how airlines were overwhelmed with frustrated passengers.
""The hold time is about 7 hours. I am so sorry,"" Alaska Airlines wrote on Twitter in response to a customer complaint. 
Aisling Daniel, an 18-year-old college student, was trying to return home to Anchorage, Alaska, with her younger sister and two black Labrador retrievers on Monday after visiting family in Kansas City. She was stuck in the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and holding out hope that her newly booked flight out Monday afternoon would not be canceled.
""The weather and the airport being understaffed is a really big problem here right now,"" she said. 

Harley Garner, a 27-year-old creative strategist from Portland, Oregon, and his brother from Seattle were staying with their parents in Pahrump, Nevada, over the holidays and had planned to fly home Sunday evening. Both brothers' flights - to Portland via Alaska Airlines and to Seattle via Allegiant Airlines - were canceled Sunday afternoon. 
After those flights were canceled, the brothers' father was driving them to Bakersfield, California, where they planned to rent a car and then drive to Portland and Seattle, a total of some 17 hours on the road.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Tuesday morning, with U.S. counterparts ending on another record high over optimism that the global economic recovery can weather the risks posed by COVID-19 and tightening monetary policy.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.10% by 9:06 PM ET (2:06 AM GMT), with data released earlier in the day saying that industrial production grew a better-than-expected 7.2% month-on-month in November. The data also said that the jobs/application ratio was 1.15, while the unemployment rate was 2.8%, in November.
South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 0.04%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.25%, re-opening after a holiday while Australian markets remained shut.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.01% while the Shenzhen Component was up 0.39%.
In the U.S., the S&P 500 posted its 69th record close for 2021, although volumes were lower than average due to the holidays.
Meanwhile, a U.S. index of Chinese stocks fell, taking its 2021 losses past 44% over China’s latest regulatory tightening. This includes new curbs on offshore listings by firms in sectors where foreign investment is prohibited, which aims to plug a loophole long used by the tech industry to raise capital overseas.
Global shares are set for a third year of double-digit returns, boosted by the U.S. rally. These gains come despite persistent waves of COVID-19 cases, the latest including the omicron variant, and central banks tightening monetary policy in response to high inflation.
However, concerns remain that those variables could lead to increasing volatility.
“The remedies that we put in place to counter the COVID-19 recessions, they were so substantial, we had massive stimulus,” Whittier Trust chief investment officer Sandip Bhagat told Bloomberg.
“We’ll be left with a legacy of those policy responses well into the future” and stocks can continue advancing, he added.
Investors also digested comments from the People’s Bank of China that reiterated that the yuan exchange rate will be more flexible in 2022 and will remain stable overall at a reasonable and balanced level. The central bank added that it will ensure the overall size of credit keeps growing in 2022.
All eyes are also on China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) as it faces the initial interest payment deadline for two of its dollar bonds Tuesday. The property group now faces its biggest test of investor confidence after being labelled a debt defaulter earlier in the month."

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 index ended at a record high on Monday, its fourth straight session of gains, as strong U.S. retail sales underscored economic strength and eased worries from Omicron-driven flight cancellations that hit travel stocks.
U.S. retail sales increased 8.5% year-over-year this holiday season, powered by an ecommerce boom, according to a Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) report, giving the S&P 500 retailing index a boost. 
Travel-related stocks, typically sensitive to coronavirus news, declined after U.S. airlines canceled about 800 more flights on Monday after nixing thousands during the Christmas weekend, as Omicron cases soared.
The S&P 1500 airlines index shed 0.57%. Cruise operators Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings,  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) and Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp fell 2.55%, 1.35% and 1.18% respectively, among the biggest decliners on the benchmark S&P 500.
""The market is in this interesting place where we have a strong consumer, with spending up 8% year over year. Personal consumption makes up 70% of our GDP, and that remains flush,"" said Sylvia Jablonski Kampaktsis, chief investment officer and co-founder at Defiance ETFs in New York.
""Omicron reminds us that we still exist in this corona ecosystem. And it'll probably be one of many things that we will continue talking about with this virus but the doomsday COVID scenario of 2020 feels like it's far behind us.""
All 11 main S&P 500 sector indexes advanced, with energy and tech leading percentage gains.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 351.82 points, or 0.98%, to 36,302.38, the S&P 500 gained 65.4 points, or 1.38%, to 4,791.19 and the Nasdaq Composite added 217.89 points, or 1.39%, to 15,871.26.
The S&P 500 has climbed 4.9% during its recent run of gains, its biggest percentage gain over a four-day period since early November 2020.
The Nasdaq Composite got a boost from megacap companies, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platform.
Main U.S. stock indexes are on track for a third straight yearly gain, with the benchmark S&P 500 poised for its best three-year performance since 1999.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.76 billion shares, compared with the 11.74 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 2.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.09-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 58 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 101 new highs and 145 new lows.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) will require that employees and visitors to its U.S. offices receive booster shots of the COVID-19 vaccine starting next year, a bank spokesperson said on Monday.
Starting in February, anyone eligible to receive a booster shot must have obtained one in order to enter Goldman offices. And beginning in January, the bank will require staff to get tested twice weekly for COVID, the spokesperson said. 
Goldman's new policies, communicated to staff on Monday, follow a week of rising COVID infections across the United States. 
Over the last seven days, the average number of new cases in the United States, where Goldman Sachs is based, has surged 55% to over 205,000 new infections per day, according to a Reuters tally.
Several Wall Street banks and investment firms cancelled holiday gatherings and allowed staff to work from home for the remainder of the year in response to the fast-spreading Omicron variant. 
Before the Christmas holiday,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) told staff in the New York City area, where COVID cases were spiking, to work remotely, and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co delayed its planned Jan. 10 office return.
Jefferies Financial Group, one of the first firms to send staff home, is now targeting Jan. 17 to get workers back.

Goldman was among the Wall Street banks that have pushed hardest to bring staff back into offices. Since August, the bank has required vaccines for all staff and visitors entering its offices in the United States, and staff received COVID tests onsite once a week.
Goldman's new policy on the booster shots was originally reported by Bloomberg earlier on Monday.

Investing.com —  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:ZM) announced Monday that it has acquired ""certain assets"" from Liminal, a start-up that offers event production solutions.

According to Liminal, Zoom OSC integrates Zoom with third-party software and hardware, while ZoomISO ""generates individual video outputs of the participants in a Zoom Meeting / Webinar, allowing you to easily recomposite them inside of a vision mixer, switcher, or media server.""
Two of Liminal's co-founders, Andy Caluccio and Jonathan Kokotajilo will join Zoom.
Zoom shares are down 2% Monday, adding to their recent decline, which has put its stock price 44.5% in the red in 2021 as investors wonder where growth for the pandemic must-have tool will come from next. 
With the acquisition, Zoom could be positioning itself to prepare for life after the pandemic, with bigger virtual events and experiences bridging in person and virtual.
In its announcement, the company said the acquisition of Liminal's assets will ""help bridge Zoom with traditional and emerging event control applications and hardware to help theaters, broadcast studios and other creative organizations address complex technical production needs.""
In comments made to technology website CNET, Zoom stated: ""Like the future of work, we believe that the future of events will include a combination of virtual and in-person formats."" "

Investing.com — In a research note Monday, Oppenheimer analyst Leland Gershell told investors that  Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Inc (NASDAQ:ALNY) shares appear oversold following the  BridgeBio Pharma Inc  (NASDAQ:BBIO) news.
Alnylam's competitor, BridgeBio Pharma, told investors earlier today that its Phase 3 Study investigating acoramidis for treating rare heart disease symptomatic transthyretin (TTR) amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) did not meet its primary endpoint. As a result, the shares of BridgeBio declined by over 70%, while Alnylam's stock price fell 17% on the day.
However, Gershall feels the sell-off in Alnylam is due to increased investor concern that a similar placebo response could interfere with upcoming results from Alnylam's Onpattro's Apollo-B trial .
""While we await further clarity on the circumstances of ATTRibute-CM, we believe today's selloff in ALNY shares is disproportionate to any incremental concerns around Apollo-B's prospects for success,"" said the analyst. 
Providing a boost for Anlylam shareholders, Gershall said they ""would look to take advantage of current levels to add to a position."""

Investing.com - In a fitting note to start the last week of 2021 trading, two of the year's top sectors -  energy and tech - took the lead in driving markets to all-time heights, kicking off the famed ""Santa rally."" 
The S&P 500 Index closed at an all-time high, ending the day at 4791, up 1.4% for the day and close to the day's highs. The NASDAQ Composite also closed up 1.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded up 352 points, good for a .98% gain. The leading small-cap index, the Russell 2000, rallied from a low open to be close up .88%.
The standout sectors for the day's trading were the energy sector and the tech sector. On the energy front, Crude Oil WTI Futures recovered from a pre-market sell-off to trade up 2.7%, as concerns that the various travel cancellations might impede the demand recovery for oil in the short term faded and hope over demand resurged. Brent Oil Futures closed up 3.4%. APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA) was the top performer on the S&P 500 on the day, riding the oil tailwind as well as good news over an agreement with Egypt to finish up 7.3%.  Devon Energy  Corporation (NYSE:DVN) and  Diamondback Energy Inc  (NASDAQ:FANG) were also standouts, up 6.1% and 4.9% respectively.
The tech sector traded higher on no specific news. Semiconductors were the standout performer, with the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) up 2.7%. Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) was the biggest large-cap semiconductor mover, up 5.6%, though smaller caps like Himax Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:HIMX) (+12.75%) and semiconductor equipment makers like Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ:AMAT) (4.65%) also joined in the fun. The tech sector's rise went across the board, with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) leading the Dow at +2.3% and finishing just shy of its all-time high and the $3T market cap level. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) pulled back from highs but finished up 2.5%, security software provider  Fortinet  (NASDAQ:FTNT) closed up 5.3%, and networking equipment maker  Arista Networks  (NYSE:ANET) finished up 3.5%. 
While the holiday week started with both low trading volumes and limited market moving events, the steadiest news stemmed around the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite a bevy of flight cancellations in the U.S. and beyond, investors have been content to focus on reports of Omicron's lower severity as a sign that biting restrictions on the economy and consumer behavior are unlikely.
Airlines, including Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL), and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), pared earlier losses on news of the cancellations, with DAL down .76%, UAL down .65% on the day, and AAL down .5%.  Boeing Co  (NYSE:BA) closed down .5%, and  Expedia  Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE) finished .8% lower, perhaps related to these concerns, though trading in the travel sector was uneven on the whole.
Cruise lines were also among the day's losers, trading lower on reports of Covid-19 outbreaks on ships operated by  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) (-1.3%) and Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) (-1.1%), with  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd  (NYSE:NCLH) down 2.5% amid additional reports of the issue. 
Beyond that, a couple small-cap stocks in the medical sector are showing the feast or famine nature of the industry: Microbot Medical (NASDAQ:MBOT) finished up 65% on news it will collaborate with  Stryker  (NYSE:SYK)'s Neurovascular unit to combine its neurovascular instruments with Microbot's LIBERTY Robotic System to create what they described as the world's first dedicated robotic procedural kits for use in neurovascular procedures. BridgeBio Pharma (NASDAQ:BBIO), meanwhile, closed down 72% after its Phase 3 trial failed to reach its primary endpoint.
Bitcoin was up nearly 2% on the day, below its highs but still above $51,000. Ethereum was up .4% while Cardano was the cryptocurrency standout of the day, up over 6.4%.
Other leading stocks on the day included Ralph Lauren Corp Class A (NYSE:RL) (4.2%),  Rivian Automotive  Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) (10.6%), and Upstart (NASDAQ:UPST) (8%). Among losers are  Las Vegas Sands  Corp (NYSE:LVS) (-1.9%),  Shopify Inc  (NYSE:SHOP) (-2.7%), and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) (-11%).
Meme stocks were also in the spotlight again to round out 2021, as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) close down 2.5% after Ascendiant Capital reiterated its sell rating on the video game retailer and lowered its price target. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) flipped from red to green and then lost some of its gains, ending up .6%, as the news of the new Spiderman movie crossing the $1B box office mark, the first movie to do so since the onset of the pandemic, may have driven the shares higher (though these stocks tend to generate their own energy).
News Corp A (NASDAQ:NWSA) closed up 1.1% with the market after news it would be buying Base Chemicals, a data publication, from S&P Global Inc (NYSE:SPGI) and IHS  Markit Ltd  (NYSE:INFO) as part of the latter two companies' merger process.

(Reuters) -Shares of U.S. airlines and other travel-related companies fell on Monday as rising Omicron cases and weather-related problems forced the cancellation of hundreds more flights, leaving travelers stranded across the country during the holidays.
Over 1,000 flights were canceled within, into, or out of the United States on Monday, data from flight-tracking website FlightAware.com showed. Globally, more than 2,600 flights were scrapped.
That was on top of over 3,000 U.S. flight cancellations during the Christmas holiday weekend, typically a peak time for travel for Americans.
Shares of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc, United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc and Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) were down about 1% in afternoon trade. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co's shares recovered losses to trade about flat.
Most airline stocks have rallied this year on hopes of a travel boom as travelers start visiting friends and family after dealing with pandemic-related restrictions last year.
However, staff shortages at airlines, weather-related disruptions and now the fast-spreading Omicron variant have disrupted flights frequently this year.
As long as the Omicron variant continues to infect people who are vaccinated and quarantine restrictions remain in place, air travel is expected to be hit by staffing shortages, research firm Third Bridge Group's Peter McNally said.
Southwest Airlines said it had canceled about 50 of the 3,600 flights scheduled Monday due to weather-related problems. United Airlines said it had called off 115 of the 4,000 flights that were scheduled, while Delta expects to cancel over 200 of 4,166 its scheduled flights.
American Airlines pointed to its statement on Saturday that said the carrier had to cancel flights due to ""COVID-related sick calls"".
Separately, the Shanghai government said on Monday that the country's aviation regulator would suspend two China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) Corp Ltd flights from New York to Shanghai from Jan. 3 due to rising COVID-19 cases.
Other travel stocks also came under pressure as Omicron triggers fears of tougher restrictions. 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday it was investigating nearly 70 cruise ships after reports of COVID-19 cases on board.
Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp said it had isolated a small number of passengers on board its Carnival Freedom cruise ship due to positive COVID-19 test results. All passengers from the cruise trip disembarked on Sunday, and the ship departed Monday afternoon on its next planned voyage, it added.
Shares of Carnival were down 1.1%, while its peers Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises Ltd were down about 2%.

Travel firms  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) Group Inc and Tripadvisor Inc fell between 1% and 1.6%.
Vacation rental firm Airbnb Inc , hotel operators Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) Inc and  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (NYSE:HLT) Inc all recovered losses to trade about flat in the afternoon.

The North African nation has signed the previously announced agreement to modernize and consolidate APA's current production sharing contracts with Egypt's Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation.
APA and Sinopec will collect the costs over 5 years starting April 1.
APA — previously named Apache — said the new agreement will see the joint venture further increase its rig count to 15 rigs in 2022 after more than doubling it to 11 in 2021. It will also increase production and consolidate 90% of gross output into a single concession.
The APA-Sinopec joint venture is expected to increase investment by approximately $235 million in Egypt during 2022, while it forecasts a 13% to 15% year-over-year increase in the country's gross oil production. In addition, the joint venture will also pay a signing bonus of $100 million to the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation.
""This agreement is a win-win for Egypt and the APA-Sinopec Joint Venture.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he’s monitoring the latest data and urged people to be careful, particularly at New Year celebrations. 
His comments came as the U.K. reported 98,515 new coronavirus cases on Monday. While that’s the first reading below 100,000 in almost a week, the figures have been affected by spotty data over the Christmas holidays.
“We don’t think there’s any need for any further measures until the New Year, but we will keep that under review,” Javid said in comments broadcast on Sky News on Monday. “We’ll watch the situation very carefully, and should in the future we need to act, we won’t hesitate to do so.”
The worry is that the health service gets overwhelmed by the explosion in Covid cases driven by the highly-transmissable omicron strain. Infections have jumped by more than a quarter of a million in the past week, heaping pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to respond. 
The U.K.’s devolved administrations have already toughened their rules, with changes coming into effect Monday in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
While many experts say Johnson needs to do more in England, he’s facing backlash within his own party over curbs.
“When we get into the new year, of course, we’ll see then whether we do need to take any further measures, but nothing until then at least,” Javid said.

Investing.com – Pluristem Stock (NASDAQ:PSTI) plummeted more than 18% Monday after the company’s candidate for treating severe effects related to Covid-19 failed to meet the desired endpoints in a phase-II study.
The treatment is intended to use intramuscular injections to administer cells that Pluristem calls PLX-PAD to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with the viral infection.
The treatment did not statistically improve the number of ventilator-free days for patients over the 28-day studies, the company said.
The analysis is based on 89 patients enrolled in two phase-II studies -- one in the U.S. and another combined research in Europe and Israel, the company's home country.
The company had earlier planned to have 180 patients in the two studies collectively but reduced the number in response to changes in the standards of care for Covid-19. That change led to a reduction in the statistical power of the studies.
Pluristem said with the emergence of a new threat in the form of omicron, it intends to explore opportunities based on the efficacy trends obtained from the recent studies."

Investing.com — Despite opening up Monday's session over 6%,  FuelCell Energy  Inc (NASDAQ:FCEL) has retraced and currently sits down over 1% after news it has reached a settlement agreement with POSCO Energy and its subsidiary, Korea Fuel Cell.
The settlement relates to POSCO claiming a breach of contract regarding FuelCell's Asian market access. 
FuelCell — who described the settlement as ""favorable"" — said the agreement confirms its exclusivity to sell its differentiated platform technology throughout Asia, including South Korea. 
In addition, all licenses formerly granted to POSCO are amended so that it has the right to service its existing installed customer base. 
All of the claims between the parties are now settled, except for 2 claims being negotiated that have no impact on market access.The settlement will also see a firm order of a minimum 20 SureSource replacement modules to service existing South Korean operating projects during 2022.
Despite the dispute between the 2 companies, FuelCell shares hit a high of $29.44 in February, though it has since declined steadily, with its stock price slide 42% in 2021."

Investing.com — Biopharmaceutical company  BridgeBio Pharma Inc  (NASDAQ:BBIO) told investors Monday that its Phase 3 Study investigating acoramidis for treating rare heart disease symptomatic transthyretin (TTR) amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) did not meet its primary endpoint at month 12.
BridgeBio shares plunged over 71% on the news.
BridgeBio said the decline observed in both arms of the ATTRibute-CM study was similar to the expected functional decline in healthy elderly adults. They were also ""substantially less"" than the declines observed in previous untreated arms reviewed.
The placebo group's decline was over 70% lower than the decline seen in the ATTR-ACT treatment group.
The company's Founder and CEO Neil Kumar revealed he is baffled by the results: ""This result is disappointing and baffling. I am, along with many others, searching for answers regarding the 6MWD."" 
He later added: ""The drug seems to be doing what we are asking of it. If we observe enough clinical outcome events at Month 30, I am still hopeful that we will demonstrate the benefit of acoramidis treatment.""
Reacting to the news, Stifel analyst Paul Matteis said it was positive for  Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Inc (NASDAQ:ALNY) as it suggests ""acromadis is probably less effective than Pfizer's tafamidis."" Matteis believes it ""sets the stage"" for Alnylam's Onpattro/Vutrisiran to ""be best-in-class in TTR cardiomyopathy.""

Investing.com – Shares of cruise operators traded lower on Monday as cases of Covid-19 outbreak on board the running ships continue to rock the companies.
Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) fell 3.2% while  Royal Caribbean  Cruises (NYSE:RCL) and Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corporation (NYSE:CCL) lost around 2.4% each.
Last week saw at least three outbreaks affecting cruise ships operated by Royal Caribbean and Carnival.  
Royal Caribbean-operated Symphony of the Seas -- the world's biggest cruise ship– had 48 guests and crew members test positive on the ship that first sailed December 11. The case was reported last Monday. There were 6,091 people on the ship and Royal Caribbean said 98% of those who tested positive were fully vaccinated.
Cruise operators have been among the worst hit by the pandemic as lockdowns and aversion to travel, particularly discretionary, dealt a big blow to companies’ health.
Stringent conditions laid down by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for running cruises have also meant higher costs for the operators. Periodic cases of outbreaks have ensured that those stringent norms stay in place, also acting as a dampener for some keen to travel without restrictions of tests and other barriers.

Shares of GoDaddy, which have dropped 8% so far this year, rose 2.6% in premarket trading.
Starboard said that GoDaddy's shares were undervalued and represented an attractive investment opportunity, according to the filing.
The Wall Street Journal was the first to report the acquisition of the stake. The report also said that Starboard plans to push the company to improve its performance.

Investing.com –  Moderna  stock (NASDAQ:MRNA) traded nearly 3% lower in Monday’s premarket a day after Financial Times reported that the company is battling a shareholder proposal that wants it to share its Covid-19 vaccine technology with poorer countries.
The proposal also wants the company to answer why its prices are so high given the amount of government assistance it has received.
Legal & General Investment Management, the London-based asset manager, is arguing that even as the vaccine-make got at least $2.5 billion from the US government, it has shipped vaccines to mostly wealthy countries and has not transferred its technology to manufacturers in low- or middle-income countries.
Moderna is fighting the proposal at the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Meanwhile, FT also said that Oxfam, a global confederation of 21 charitable organizations, has teamed up with investors to file petitions against Moderna and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) to demand that they do more to share vaccine technology.
Both Pfizer and Moderna have been under pressure from lawmakers and activists to cut their vaccine prices and ramp up production to take the life-saving shots to poorer countries.
Moderna is in a peculiar position because it developed its vaccine with the US National Institutes of Health. Barney Graham, one of the NIH scientists involved in the development process, told the paper earlier the government’s role in producing the vaccine gave it a “leverage” over Moderna in setting prices, something the company has aggressively pushed back against.

At GoDaddy’s Thursday closing price of $76, the activist investor’s stake would be worth over $810 million.
The website of the New York-based fund says it “seeks to invest in deeply undervalued companies and actively engages with management teams and boards of directors to identify and execute on opportunities to unlock value for the benefit of all shareholders”.
GoDaddy shares have been a laggard in a record year for the equity market, falling more than 10% at a time when the Nasdaq Composite NASDAQ Composite has returned more than 22%.
The shares got a little bump early November when the company reported an over 14% jump in third-quarter revenue to $964 million and forecast full-year revenue of around $3.8 billion, banking on the continued momentum in its core business of domains registry and demand for its e-commerce tools. It then slid on reports of a data breach.

Investing.com - The last week of the trading year has started off on an unsurprisingly quiet note. While investors hope for a Santa rally to cap off a boffo year on the leading indices, there are still challenges on the Covid front, as holiday weekend flight cancellations make clear. News out of China on new IPO listing restrictions mark another reminder of the challenges the economic giant has posed to investors this year, and oil starts the week off on the wrong foot. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, December 27th.
While much of last week's rally and finish at all-time highs was predicated on reports that the Omicron variant of Covid-19 is proving milder than previous variants, or at least poses less risk of hospitalization, the holiday weekend was a reminder of the havoc the virus can still cause on the economy.
Airlines canceled nearly 1,000 flights on Christmas Day in the U.S. due to staffing shortages and, in Southwest's attestation, weather issues. The U.S. airlines are trading lower as a group in pre-market trading. As case counts continue to hit new heights in places stretching from New York to Australia, the cancellations are a reminder that even if cases are less severe, as we all hope, necessary quarantining or recuperation from mild cases can still gum up an already stretched economy.

China came out with new guidelines for companies to list shares overseas. The guidelines are likely to make it more difficult for Chinese firms to list variable interest entities - V.I.E.'s - abroad, but does provide a legal framework that will allow them to do so.
It remains to be seen whether, in the context of a long year for Chinese stocks and several regulatory crackdowns in industries spanning from education to gaming to casinos to technology, the new guidelines will be received as a welcome relief as they provide certainty, or whether they will be viewed as overly harsh. The initial reviews are bearish -  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Didi Global Inc ADR (NYSE:DIDI) are among Chinese companies whose U.S. listings are trading down more than 1% in pre-market trading.

U.S. futures are pointing marginally higher; the S&P 500 Futures are trading up .3% as of 7:40am ET, while Dow futures are up .2% and Nasdaq 100 Futures are up .35%. The last week of the year is usually a slower trading week owing to it falling between the winter holidays, and there is not a lot of economic news due this week. European markets are slightly higher in mid-day trading, while Asian markets closed a little lower. The path of least resistance for markets this year has been higher, and early indications for Monday are that we may be headed that way today. The question, after the S&P closed at all-time highs last week, is whether there's that much room left to go in 2021?

Investing.com – ADRs and shares of Chinese companies traded lower in premarket Monday in a spillover effect of new rules the world’s second largest economy is bringing to curb new offshore listings in sectors restricted from foreign investment.
ADRs of Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI) and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) traded down 2.5% and .5%, respectively. Both  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) fell 0.3%. Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) was down 1%. Nio ADRs (NYSE:NIO) bucked the trend with gains of nearly 1%. The Financial Times reported that in addition, Didi Global has extended the date of their lock-up indefinitely, preventing employees from selling shares.
The move by the Chinese authorities is intended to plug a loophole long used by the country’s internet industry to raise capital overseas. There is now a list of sectors that are barred from getting foreign investment and Chinese firms operating in those areas will have to seek a waiver before proceeding for share sales, according to Reuters that quoted a statement by the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce.
Overseas investors in such companies would be forbidden from participating in management and their total ownership would be capped at 30%, with a single investor’s holding restricted to 10%, according to the list that becomes effective January 1.
The regulators stopped short of a ban on IPOs by companies using the so-called Variable Interest Entities structure though the new rules are set to make the process more difficult and costly. VIE enables a Chinese firm to transfer profits to an offshore entity -- registered in places like the Cayman Islands -- with shares that foreign investors can then own.
The Chinese regulators have been concerned about the trove of data on Chinese consumers their listed companies possess and that they are forced to share with the U.S. authorities to comply with the laws there.

Investing.com –  Lazydays  Holdings stock (NASDAQ:LAZY) will be under watch when trading starts Monday after a series of eyebrow-raising developments involving a two-stage CEO departure unfolded at the RV dealership operator just before the extended Christmas weekend.
As revealed in a filing after Thursday's close, the saga started December 17 when William P. Murnane resigned as Chief Executive Officer of the company and its subsidiaries effective March 16, 2022, while continuing to be the Chairman. Five days later, on December 22, he quit the post of Chairman as well, this time with immediate effect and in a curter resignation letter. The next day, the company decided to accelerate the date of his termination to January 1. Lazydays' board went on to elect Christopher S. Shackelton as Chairman of the Board with immediate effect and appointed director Robert T. DeVincenzi as interim CEO, effective January 1.
Mr. Shackelton said, “On behalf of the Board of Directors, I thank Bill for his many important contributions over the past five years as CEO and the past 12 years as Board Chairman. Bill has overseen the Company’s national expansion while building on our strong relationships with OEM partners and growing our loyal and passionate customer base.

271,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 27, 2021 07:00AM ET</span>",15 Cybersecurity Stocks To Watch In 2022,"By Marco Oehrl and Robert Zach
Investing.com - With the increasing digitalization of the working world, the importance of cybersecurity is also growing. The days when industrial espionage was committed with small cameras and microfilm are long behind us. The new enemies are USB sticks, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth interfaces, and internet access. This means danger for end users, but also enormous growth opportunities for companies addressing this problem that could lead to meaningful market returns.
Although the ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (HACK) - which counts industry giants such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Palo Alto and Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) among its top holdings - gained only 2.5 percent in 2021, the return in 2020 was a whopping 38 percent. And isn't it often the case in the stock market that bad phases are followed by good ones, especially in an area as promising as the cybersecurity market?
There must be hardly anyone who owns a PC and has never had a problem with a virus or Trojan. Those who say they haven’t had a virus probably just didn’t notice its effects.
At a time when almost every device can be connected to the internet, cybersecurity is becoming a commodity on which more and more money is being spent.
The revenue generated in this sector in 2020 amounted to $118 billion worldwide. Hardware accounted for 20 percent, software 35 percent, and IT services 45 percent.
By 2026, the industry expects sales to increase to $210 billion, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.6 percent.
In the software segment, the U.S. was the undisputed spending leader in 2020. Of the $41 billion spent globally on software to improve security, the U.S. accounted for 56 percent. This equated to a per capita spend for each employee of $122.

Source: Cybersecurity Software Report 2021
https://de.statista.com/statistik/studie/id/104227/dokument/software-report/
Europe, on the other hand, accounted for only 25 percent, while Asia lagged far behind with 16 percent.
For the period from 2020 to 2026, a CAGR of 7.0 percent is expected for this segment.
Compared to the CAGR of the entire cybersecurity industry of 10.6 percent, software solutions still seem to play a smaller role.
However, this does not necessarily mean that an investment in the software sector cannot be worthwhile.
While the CAGR for the period from 2016 to 2026 is 8.1 percent in Europe and 7.8 percent in the U.S., a race to catch up seems to be underway in Asia with 10.4 percent.
The positive trend in Asia becomes even clearer when looking at total cybersecurity spending. This is expected to increase from $28.1 billion to $56.3 billion between 2021 and 2026. That represents an overall increase of more than 100 percent.
What's particularly interesting about this is that software segment revenue in Asia will ""only"" increase by 55.7 percent from $7.0 billion to $10.9 billion over the same period. This shows that the hardware and IT services segments are benefiting disproportionately.
This is also made clear by the fact that the share of software in the overall Asian cybersecurity market is expected to fall from 24.9 to 19.4 percent in the period from 2021 to 2026.
The U.S. and Europe cannot keep up with the growth of the Asian cybersecurity market anyway, with sales estimated to increase by a comparatively meager 34.3 and 37.2 percent, respectively.
With a 20 percent share of the overall cybersecurity market, the hardware segment is the smallest piece of the pie, but a CAGR of 9.2 percent between 2020 and 2026 promises more growth than the software segment.
There is also a clear shift in market share in this area. Of the $23 billion in total sales reached in 2020, the U.S. accounted for 47 percent, Asia 28 percent and Europe only 21 percent.
However, while hardware sales in Europe and the U.S. are expected to grow by only 36.4 and 32.7 percent, respectively, between 2021 and 2026, Asia is expected to increase from $7.7 billion to $15.2 billion, or 97.4 percent. This clearly indicates that Asia could be the market with the highest growth rates for cybersecurity.

https://de.statista.com/statistik/studie/id/104221/dokument/hardware-report/
The undisputed number one in hardware growth is China. Spending there is expected to increase by 162.6 percent from 2020 to 2026.
Sales of IT services play the biggest role of all in cybersecurity. It's no wonder, either, as without expert personnel, the best software and hardware aren't much use.
This is also where the largest growth is expected worldwide. From sales of $54 billion in 2020, the market is expected to rise to $108 billion by 2026, a CAGR of 12.2%.

https://de.statista.com/statistik/studie/id/104222/dokument/it-services-report/
In Europe, IT services sales are expected to climb from $19.7 billion to $32.2 billion (63.5 percent) between 2021 and 2026, and in the U.S. from $25.3 billion to $40.7 billion (60.9 percent).
Asia, on the other hand, may also outpace the rest of the world in the cybersecurity IT services sector. Over the same period, revenues are expected to increase from $13.4 billion to $30.2 billion, representing growth of 125.4 percent.
All in all, it can be stated that Asia is likely to be the next big growth driver for the cybersecurity market. However, the solid growth rates in the USA and Europe should not be ignored.
Let's take a look at the fifteen cybersecurity stocks that Wall Street analysts believe have the greatest upside potential over the next twelve months.
Investing.com used our stock screener for this, filtering for stocks from the cybersecurity sector that are followed by at least five analysts and have at least five buy recommendations and where there is the greatest upside potential. We looked for stocks with a minimum of $2 billion market cap. Here’s our list:
Note: All calculations refer to the respective closing price on December 15, 2021.
Here are the three standout names:
According to Wall Street analysts, Varonis Systems, a specialist in the field of data security and analysis, has the greatest share price potential in the cybersecurity sector over the next twelve months. The 20 analysts surveyed by Investing.com estimate the price potential of Varonis Systems shares at 55.4 percent. Of these, 16 are buy recommendations and 4 holds. There are no sell recommendations.
In the third quarter, the company's revenue increased 31 percent year-over-year to $100.4 million. Subscription revenues were up 59 percent to $70 million. Non-GAAP profit was $8.1 million, up from $3.1 million in the year-ago quarter.
RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew Hedberg believes Varonis's product business in the areas of data governance and insider threat management could be converted to a subscription model, which could significantly increase subscription revenue. The expert has high hopes for the company's potential to service both on-premises and cloud data stores. For the third quarter, Varonis reported ARR growth of 36 percent. Hedberg sees the cybersecurity specialist in a promising position for 2022 and beyond, especially given strong demand in the near term and longer-term growth drivers in the form of digitization of the economy and cloud migration.
RBC rates Varonis stock ""outperform"" with an $82 price target.
For the coming year, Varonis expects revenue to be between $383.5 million and $386.5 million, up 31-32 percent. Earnings on a non-GAAP basis are expected to be between $19.5 million and $21.5 million.
The next stock on the list is Cloudflare. It has already risen more than 73 percent in 2021, and much more at one point to $221.64, but has recently come under some pressure due to valuation concerns expressed by JP Morgan regarding the Fed's upcoming tightening cycle, and is currently trading at $131.87.
JP Morgan believes Cloudflare could emerge as one of the largest revenue generators in its coverage within the next 10 to 15 years, after all, the company is positioning itself as the ""fourth cloud"" after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), CNBC reported. However, with Cloudflare ""the most expensive stock in our coverage"" and multiples in the software space expected to decline, JP Morgan lowered its rating to ""sell"" from ""hold.""
If one believes the bulk of Wall Street analysts, though, the recent correction already represents a buying opportunity. On average, the analysts assume a price target of $207.28 - which corresponds to an upside potential of just under 51.26 percent in the next twelve months.
According to RBC Capital Markets, Cloudflare's total addressable market could swell to around $100 billion by 2024. 5G mobile networks and the ""Internet of Things"" should increase this market even further. RBC rates Cloudflare stock ""Outperform"" with a $220 price target.
Cloudflare reported third-quarter revenue of $172.3 million, up 51 percent year over year. On a non-GAAP basis, the cybersecurity specialist posted a profit of $1.4 million, the first time in the company's history. ""We had a landmark third quarter, with revenue growth up 51% year-over-year, and large customer growth up 71% year-over-year. Our strong growth and efficiency also propelled us to reach profitability this quarter, achieving that milestone a year ahead of our original timeline,"" Cloudflare CEO and co-founder Matthew Prince said in a press release.
For the fourth quarter, Cloudflare expects revenue of $184 million to $185 million.
Another stock on the list is Splunk. The provider of operational intelligence software that monitors, analyzes and reports on real-time computer data has had a tumultuous year. The cybersecurity company's stock price, for example, has plunged more than 35 percent since the beginning of the year. Challenges such as cloud transformation and the surprise resignation of CEO Doug Merritt have put pressure on Splunk stock.
Still, the former highflier shouldn't be written off completely, especially since the company has already ventured into the cloud with the launch of Splunk Observability Cloud, though it faces massive competition from companies like  Elastic  (NYSE:ESTC) and Dynatrace (NYSE:DT).
In the third quarter of fiscal 2022 (the three months ending Oct. 31, 2021), total revenue rose 19 percent year over year to $665 million. Cloud revenue increased 68 percent to $243 million in the same period. Many customers are just switching from an on-premise model to the new Splunk software delivery in the cloud.
""With only a little more than a third of its revenue coming from the cloud, it will likely take some time for this transition to fully unfold,"" said an article on The Motley Fool.
The average price target of the 39 analysts surveyed by Investing.com is $167.29, nearly 48 percent above the current price. Twenty-three advise a buy, while 16 recommend a hold. It is particularly remarkable that despite the recent price turbulence, no one recommends selling the stock.
So if you have nerves of steel and enough patience, Splunk could be a bargain.
Alternatives: Other companies in the cybersecurity space that are also seen as having greater upside potential by analysts over a 12-month period are: Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP) (+16.31%), Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) (+16.16%), NortonLifeLock (NASDAQ:NLOK) (+16.06%), Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) (+14.34%), and  Fortinet  (NASDAQ:FTNT) (+10.37%).

In 2019, Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, a Boeing 737 MAX bound for Kenya, crashed six minutes after takeoff from Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa, killing all 157 passengers and crew.
""Safety is our topmost priority .... and it guides every decision we make and all actions we take,"" Tewolde Gebremariam said in a statement.

Investing.com - European markets traded slightly higher in midday Monday trading. At 1200 CET (1100 GMT / 600 ET) the CAC 40 and the DAX were up .1% and .2%, respectively, while the Euro Stoxx 50 was down .1% and the IBEX 35 was up .45%. The FTSE 100 is closed today in observance of Christmas.
European stock markets and global markets in general are expected to have a quiet week due to the holiday period trading, and with many indices already closing at all-time or at least recent highs entering this week, it remains to be seen how much of a ""Santa rally"" is left to make.
Crude Oil WTI Futures has traded off more than a percent in early trading, though Brent Oil Futures is slightly higher. Payment software provider  Adyen  NV (AS:ADYEN) is up 1.7%, while food & beverage company  Danone  SA (PA:DANO) is up 1.5%. On the down side, EssilorLuxottica SA (PA:ESLX) is down 1.1%, as is media company  Vivendi  SA (PA:VIV).
Meanwhile all eyes are on airlines and travel companies to see how they hold up amidst concerns over flight cancellations around the globe. So far, International Consolidated Airlines Group S.A. (MC:ICAG) is up .6% via its Spanish listing, and Deutsche Lufthansa AG (DE:LHAG) is trading down .4%, and travel software provider  Amadeus  IT (MC:AMA) is up .7%. Melia Hotels (MC:MEL) is also among the leaders on the Ibex, up 1.6%, a sign that investors are looking past current disruptions to a light Omicron impact. U.S. airline stocks are trading off more, perhaps due to a more concentrated spate of cancellations.
Nel ASA (OL:NEL) is up 4.6% on news of winning two separate orders of $3M and $6M for its electrolysis and fueling stations.
Notable gainers in Europe include Stellantis NV (PA:STLA) and Fresenius SE & Co KGAA O.N. (DE:FREG), each up 1.2%;  Covestro AG  (DE:1COV), up 1%,  Cellnex Telecom  SA (MC:CLNX), up 2.5%, and Lonza Group AG (SIX:LONN), up 2.5%.
Notable market losers this morning include  Worldline SA  (PA:WLN), which is down 1.8%, which is down 1%, BE Semiconductor Industries NV (AS:BESI), down .6%, Royal Dutch Shell PLC Class A (AS:RDSa), down .6%, and STMicroelectronics NV (PA:STM), down 1%.
Asian stock indices ended the day marginally lower, and U.S. stock futures are trading just above flat in early-hours trading. Bitcoin is up 1.5%, trading just above $50,000.

Investing.com - Many growth investors are looking for the latest high-potential investment themes so as to buy the right stocks ahead of most other investors, and thus reap the huge gains promised to those with ""first mover advantage"". The trade-off, of course, is taking far more risk than investing in stocks in established sectors.
2021 has seen the emergence or reinforcement of several cutting-edge investment trends, which may present interesting opportunities for investors who want to try to get ahead of the curve in 2022.
In this article, we'll discuss three of these recent investment trends that could pop in 2022, along with relevant stocks that interested investors might learn more about for each theme. These are not necessarily top themes, just emerging themes worth a spot on savvy investors’ radar. Similarly, the individual stocks mentioned for each of the investment themes discussed in this article are not recommended stocks to buy, but simply illustrative examples of stocks to follow for each theme.

Environmentally conscious investors have long been drawn to the electric vehicle sector, as experts believe EVs will replace gasoline and diesel vehicles in the coming decades. Other environmentally oriented investors are more interested in clean energy production, with investments in solar, wind or hydroelectric power.
But perhaps the best way to invest in renewable energy is via renewable energy storage, and more specifically, batteries. Subject to the vagaries of weather and seasons, the production of clean and renewable energies must face the problem of storage and energy distribution to consumers. So if governments around the world intend to make a total transition to clean energy, the need for energy storage, and therefore for batteries, should escalate dramatically. Investors in this field can either look at battery manufacturers or consider more direct investments in lithium producers, an essential raw material for batteries.

Following cannabis’s trajectory from a few years ago, some psychedelic and hallucinogenic substances once considered illegal drugs are attracting the attention of the medical world.
Although it is an industry in its infancy, the potential of psychedelic healthcare has been supported by numerous studies.
Investors are turning their attention, and more importantly their capital, to this growing sector for three main reasons: the global need for effective mental health treatments, evolving legislation and regulation, and broad public support.
First, in the context of a post-COVID world, psychedelic care will become an essential tool in the treatment of worsening mental health problems. According to the UK charity Mind, more than two-thirds of adults with mental health problems reported that their mental health worsened during the lockdown. We still don't have a full picture of the impact of this period, or how the pandemic affected the general population.
In response, pharmaceutical companies are seeking to invest significantly in new medical treatments to address this problem.
Governments are also being encouraged to act quickly to protect the well-being of their citizens. In this context, the stocks of companies preparing treatments for mental illness based on their research into psychedelic drugs could be in high demand in 2022.

Although the definition of the metaverse is still up for debate, investors have not hesitated to bid up investments related to this concept since Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) made the creation of a metaverse its main objective, rebranding its business as Meta Platforms to mark the occasion.
In concrete terms, the metaverse refers to an online space that can be navigated in virtual reality, and that would allow all sorts of social and commercial interaction. Some analysts believe that this is the next great revolution of the Internet.
However, since it is still a vague concept that has not really been implemented by anyone yet, choosing the best stocks to bet on the metaverse is not easy.
There are some stocks that are less risky metaverse bets than others. Indeed, many experts believe that instead of betting on stocks of companies that want to have a business directly related to the metaverse, investors would be better off looking at the architects of the metaverse, or the companies that own the technologies needed to create metaverses.
In this area, graphics card and computer chip manufacturers seem like obvious choices, since no matter what, creating navigable metaverses in virtual reality will require immensely more graphics processing power than is currently required for games and experiences taking place on conventional computer screens.
In addition, chip stocks are also ideally positioned to take advantage of many other trends set to explode in 2022, such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing and data centers, and cryptocurrency mining.
But software will also come into play in the metaverse, as companies that own graphics technologies that are essential to the artistic and technical creation of metaverses may become attractive.

275,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 27, 2021 05:59AM ET</span>","GameStop Falls as Ascendiant Capital Cuts Target, Reiterates Sell","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – GameStop stock (NYSE:GME) traded 0.7% lower in Monday’s premarket trading after Ascendiant Capital cut its target for the meme stock while reiterating its ‘sell’, citing significant digital and execution risks.
The brokerage has now pegged the 12-month target for the stock at $23, down from its previous $24. The stock closed at $152.14 Thursday, down 1.2%. 
As reported by StreetInsider, analyst Edward Woo states that the new target reflects the estimated current cash value per share and, “the small chance for a highly successful and valuable company transformation"" is offset by the significant risks.
GameStop started the year as the Reddit gang's favorite meme stock that also fueled its rally by more than 900%, now a subject of probe at the SEC. The rally, a result of coordinated trades among the Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) crowd and subsequent self-fulfilling momentum, created its own legion of followers, putting it at the center of a fight between the big Wall Street institutions on one side and the retail crowd on the other.
In the last year, the company has overhauled its management, raised fresh funds, extinguished much of its debt, and revamped its stores to attract a new audience. But with the year closing now, much that was anticipated from the retailer of video games remains a work-in-progress while it continues to report losses. The stock is now down over 68% from the year’s high, though still up 700% YTD.
The net loss of $105 million in the third quarter -- its sixth in the last seven -- was wider than expected and also more than five times the loss in the last financial year’s third quarter.

Investing.com –  Globalfoundries  stock (NASDAQ:GFS) traded about 1% higher in Monday’s premarket after Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), its former parent and still a key client, expanded the size of a previous order to buy more silicon wafers from the company and for a longer period.
AMD, whose own share price was up 0.6% in premarket trading, will now buy about $2.1 billion of silicon wafers from GlobalFoundries through 2025 under an amended agreement, according to a regulatory filing Thursday.
The enhanced order comes as shortage of chips refuses to go away – largely owing to shift to a digital ecosystem accelerated by Covid-19. With existing supplies stretched as the pandemic rages and new capacities taking time, it’s a seller’s market that AMD is trying to capitalize on.
AMD was previously going to buy $1.6 billion worth of wafers between 2022 and 2024, meaning a 30% expeansion. Wafers are the large discs of silicon on which computer chips are made.
GlobalFoundries, which was spun off from AMD in 2009, also counts Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) as major customers. It re-listed on the Nasdaq in October.
Last month, Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) picked AMD chips to go into its data centers. AMD, having proven itself as a worthy competition to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), is now taking on larger rivals such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in supercomputing markets.

277,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2021 05:00AM ET</span>",Telefonica buys Ericsson 5G equipment to replace some Huawei gear,"MADRID (Reuters) - Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) has bought 5G network equipment from Swedish manufacturer Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) to replace some of the Huawei gear it has rolled out in Spain, a source at the Spanish firm said on Monday, confirming a report in Expansion newspaper.
The replacement of the next-generation mobile network equipment is part of Telefonica's strategy announced in 2019 to diversify suppliers, according to the source. 
Expansion said the telecoms company has initially rolled out some Huawei equipment that it had already bought before seeking to secure alternative supplies.
The source at Telefonica declined to say how much equipment Telefonica bought from Ericsson or when the purchase was made.
Huawei and Ericsson's Spanish unit did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Telefonica's 2019 decision came at a time when China's Huawei, the global market leader in network equipment, had been drawn into the centre of political tensions between Washington and Beijing. 

The United States has alleged the company's equipment could be used by the Chinese government for espionage. Huawei and Beijing have repeatedly denied the allegations. 
When Telefonica's announced its strategy two years ago, it said its decision to diversify was purely technical in nature and that it had seen no evidence to support the American allegations that Huawei gear posed a security risk.

278,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 27, 2021 04:54AM ET</span>",China Imposes New Curbs on Offshore IPOs From Restricted Sectors,"(Bloomberg) -- China will impose new restrictions on offshore listings by firms in sectors that are off-limits to foreign investment, a move that could plug a loophole long used by the country’s technology industry to raise capital overseas.
Chinese firms in industries banned from foreign investment will need to seek a waiver from a negative list before proceeding for share sales, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on Monday. Overseas investors in such companies would be forbidden from participating in management and their total ownership would be capped at 30%, with a single investor holding no more than 10%, according to the updated list effective Jan. 1.
The overhaul represents one of the biggest steps taken by Beijing to tighten scrutiny on overseas listings, after ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc. proceeded with its New York initial public offering despite regulatory concerns over the security of its data. While regulators stopped short of a ban on IPOs by companies using the so-called Variable Interest Entities (VIE) structure, the new rules would make the process more difficult and costly.
“For companies that seek to list under the VIE structure, the move may affect their decision as to choosing the listing destinations,” said Xia Hailong, a lawyer with Shanghai-based Shenlun law firm. “They used to have no obstacle to overseas listing, but now they’ll surely face much tougher scrutiny and the path to overseas IPOs will be much more difficult.”
VIEs have been a perennial worry for global investors given their shaky legal status. Pioneered by Sina (NASDAQ:SINA) Corp. and its investment bankers during a 2000 IPO, the VIE framework has never been formally endorsed by Beijing. It has nevertheless enabled Chinese companies to bypass rules on foreign investment in sensitive sectors, including the internet industry. The structure allows a Chinese firm to transfer profits to an offshore entity -- registered in places like the Cayman Islands or British Virgin Islands -- with shares that foreign investors can then own.
The requirements apply to new share listings and won’t affect the foreign ownership of companies already listed overseas, according to the nation’s economic planning agency.
The move comes days after the China Securities Regulatory Commission proposed on Friday that all Chinese companies seeking IPOs and additional share sales abroad would have to register with the securities regulator. Any company whose listing could pose a national security threat would be banned from proceeding.
Companies using the so-called variable interest entities structure would be allowed to pursue overseas IPOs after meeting compliance requirements, the securities regulator said, without providing further details. 
It’s all part of a yearlong campaign to curb the breakneck growth of China’s internet sector and what Beijing has termed a “reckless” expansion of private capital. Curbing VIEs from foreign listings would close a gap that’s been used for two decades by technology giants from  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. to sidestep restrictions on foreign investment and list offshore. 
The heightened scrutiny by Chinese regulators has been echoed by their U.S. counterparts. The Securities and Exchange Commission this month announced its final plan for putting in place a new law that mandates foreign companies open their books to U.S. scrutiny or risk being kicked off the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq within three years. China and Hong Kong are the only two jurisdictions that refuse to allow the inspections despite Washington requiring them since 2002.

279,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 27, 2021 04:51AM ET</span>",Airlines Weaker as Thousands of Cancelled Flights Spoil Christmas Weekend,"By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Shares of many American airline companies traded weaker in Monday’s pre-market session after thousands of flights were cancelled in the extended Christmas weekend, generally the peak time of travel.
The fast-spreading omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus resulted in pilots calling sick, and general staff shortages were blamed for the cancellations. Weather also played the spoilsport in many cases.
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock fell 3% while American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Delta Air (NYSE:DAL) were both down around 2%. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) traded 1.7% lower.  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) fell 0.1% while shares of JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) were yet to be traded. They had closed higher Thursday, with markets being shut Friday due to Christmas.
A total of 997 flights were scrapped on Christmas Day and nearly 700 on Christmas Eve, Reuters said. Airlines had canceled 1,318 flights within, into or out of the U.S. by Sunday afternoon, quoting flight-tracking website FlightAware.com.
On Sunday, Delta canceled 167 flights, United 115, and American 83. Globally, 3,023 flights were called off and more than 13,742 were delayed, as of 8:15 p.m. EST Sunday, FlightAware data revealed.
The average of Covid-19 cases reached 184,802 in U.S. as of Saturday, per the Wall Street Journal, analyzing data from Johns Hopkins University. France reported more than 100,000 new cases of Covid Saturday while U.K. continues to reel under the onslaught of the mutant virus.
The omicron variant is now the dominant form of Covid-19 in many countries, having been found in more than 90 countries. Said to be at least twice as fast spreading as the delta variant – the mutant that ravaged much of the world earlier this year – omicron hasn’t yet resulted in a correspondingly higher number of hospitalizations, which has kept markets and travel company shares afloat.

The government did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment but state news agency WAM quoted a Ministry of Economy statement saying a draft law on commercial agencies was still in its legislative cycle and ""it is still too early to give details"". 
The cabinet referred the draft to the Federal National Council for discussion and possibly more amendments, it added. 
The FT report said the proposed legislation would end the automatic renewal of existing commercial agency agreements in the Gulf state, giving foreign firms the opportunity to distribute their own goods or change their local agents.
""It no longer makes sense for individual families to have such power and preferential access to easy wealth,"" the report quoted an Emirati official as saying. ""We have to modernise our economy.""
The proposed law must be approved by the Emirati leadership and the timing for that remains uncertain, the report added.

Over the past year the UAE, a growing economic rival of Saudi Arabia, has taken measures to make its economy more attractive to foreign investors and talent.
Earlier this year, UAE said foreigners opening a company will no longer need an Emirati shareholder or agent, after it made changes to UAE company law.

281,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2021 01:16PM ET</span>",'Spider-Man: No Way Home' becomes first pandemic-era movie to smash $1 billion milestone globally,"By Rebecca Rubin
LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" unwrapped the best Christmas gift of all, becoming the first pandemic-era movie to cross $1 billion at the global box office. 
 Sony  (NYSE:SONY)'s comic-book epic has eclipsed that milestone in a near-record 12 days, tying with 2015's ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" as the third-fastest film to reach the billion-dollar benchmark. Only 2018's ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and 2019's ""Avengers: Endgame"" were quicker, smashing the coveted tally in 11 and five days, respectively. 
It's impressive that ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" managed to blow past $1 billion in ticket sales worldwide given the rapidly spreading omicron variant of COVID-19. It makes Tom Holland's Marvel superhero adventure the only movie since 2019's ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" to surpass $1 billion globally. No other Hollywood film has come close to nearing those box office revenues in the last two years. 
Prior to Spidey's reign, MGM's James Bond sequel ""No Time to Die,"" which grossed $774 million globally, stood as the highest-grossing Hollywood film of 2021 (and the pandemic). As the first movie to reach $1 billion worldwide, ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" took the earthly throne from another box-office behemoth, China's ""The Battle at Lake Changjin"" ($902 million), to officially cement its place as the year's highest-grossing film worldwide. It's also notable that ""No Way Home"" surpassed that high-watermark without playing in China, which is currently the world's biggest moviegoing market. 
At the domestic box office, ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" had another dominating weekend, soaring high above the competition during a crowded Christmas corridor. 
The newest ""Spider-Man"" adventure collected $81 million from 4,336 North American theaters over the weekend. To put that figure in perspective, only select COVID-era releases have managed to generate that kind of coinage in their entire theatrical runs, much less in their second weekend of release. ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" also managed to do so at a time when several new movies -- ""The Matrix Resurrections,"" ""Sing 2"" and ""The King's Man,"" among others -- opened nationwide to decent (and not-so-decent) ticket sales. 
It brings the film's ten-day total to a mammoth $467 million at the domestic box office. That tally is more than double the next highest-grossing movie in Disney and Marvel's ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"" which earned a mighty $224 million domestically. 
At the international box office, ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" added $121.4 million over the weekend and has made $587 million to date, bringing its global revenues to $1.05 billion. 
Universal and Illumination's animated musical ""Sing 2"" had the biggest start among new releases, debuting in second place with $23.7 million over the traditional weekend and $41 million since Wednesday. (That number is slightly inflated because it includes $1.6 million banked from advanced screenings over Thanksgiving weekend.) It's a softer start than its predecessor, 2016's ""Sing,"" which had secured a three-day total of $35 million and five-day tally of $54.9 million. However, it's not a bad result for a film targeted at parents with young kids at a time when family audiences have been especially wary about going to the movies. 
The movie, directed by Garth Jennings and voiced by Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Scarlett Johansson, Nick Kroll and Bono, has been well received by audiences, who awarded it a coveted ""A+"" CinemaScore. Unless the pandemic has something to say, ""Sing 2"" should benefit from a long run on the big screen, especially since it doesn't have much competition among family films. The original ""Sing,"" centering on a bevy of animals with killer pipes, also opened around Christmas and played in theaters well into the new year, ultimately grossing $270 million domestically and $634 million worldwide. At this rate, the sequel will have trouble replicating those results but it should remain the de facto choice for youngsters through the holiday season. 
""The Matrix Resurrections,"" the Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow's sci-fi sequel, landed with a thud in third place. The cerebral film landed significantly below expectations, scraping together $12 million from 3,552 cinemas over the weekend and $22.5 million since Wednesday. The fourth installment in the seminal series, like Warner Bros. entire 2021 slate, is available simultaneously on HBO Max, though the company didn't provide digital viewership metrics. 
Lana Wachowski returned to direct ""The Matrix Resurrections,"" which stars Keanu Reeves as the sleek cybercriminal Neo and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity. The $200 million-budgeted tentpole has gotten mixed reviews (it has a 67% on Rotten Tomatoes, as well as a ""B-"" CinemaScore), which may not move the needle for ticket sales while it's playing simultaneously on a streaming service at no extra charge. 
""Right now, if you're under 35 and going to the movies, your first choice is 'Spider-Man,' and your second choice is seeing 'Spider-Man' again,"" says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. ""You can watch 'The Matrix' later with someone who has HBO. That's how it is when a single movie is dominating the market the way 'Spider-Man' is."" 
Another newcomer, Disney and 20th Century's ""The King's Man"" finished in fourth place, amassing a paltry $6.3 million from 3,180 screens over the weekend and $10 million since opening on Wednesday. Internationally, the prequel in ""The Kingsman"" action franchise didn't make up much ground. The oft-delayed spy comedy, starring Ralph Fiennes, nabbed only $6.9 million from seven overseas markets for a global tally of $16.9 million. 

At the domestic box office, ""The King's Man"" beat Lionsgate's real-life sports drama ""American Underdog"" by a hair. In fifth place, ""American Underdog"" captured $6.2 million from 2,813 locations since opening on Christmas Day. The crowd-pleasing film about rags-to-riches quarterback Kurt Warner (played by Zachary Levi) has been embraced by moviegoers, who gave it an ""A+"" CinemaScore and 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. Unfortunately, the movie hasn't been high on audience's radars and could get sacked by competitors over the busy holiday stretch. 
Strong reviews didn't do much to boost Disney's big-budget ""West Side Story"" remake, which landed at No. 6 in its third weekend of release while bringing in $2.8 million from 2,810 venues. The Steven Spielberg-directed musical has generated $23.9 million domestically since opening earlier in December. The song-and-dance property has also had a slow go at it overseas, grossing only $12.7 million from 46 international territories so far. Globally, the $100 million-budgeted ""West Side Story"" has earned only $36.6 million. 
After four weeks in limited release, director Paul Thomas Anderson's coming-of-age comedic drama ""Licorice Pizza"" expanded to 786 North American theaters on Christmas Day and collected $2.32 million on Saturday and Sunday, enough for seventh place. To date, the MGM film and awards season hopeful has generated $3.6 million domestically. "
282,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2021 12:45PM ET</span>",China Evergrande reports progress in resuming home deliveries,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group said on Sunday it had made initial progress in resuming construction work with its chairman vowing to deliver 39,000 units of properties in December, compared with fewer than 10,000 in each of the previous three months. 
Evergrande is the world's most indebted property developer, with over $300 billion in liabilities. It is struggling to repay bondholders, banks, suppliers, and deliver homes to buyers, epitomising a bloated industry suffering from the Chinese government's deleveraging campaign. 
Company chairman Hui Ka Yan stressed during a meeting on Sunday that no one at Evergrande would be allowed to ""lie flat"", urging employees to fight day and night so that sales can be resumed and debts repaid, Evergrande said in a statement. 
""With the company resuming construction work at full steam, the group plans to deliver 115 projects in December,"" Hui said in the statement. ""With five days left this month, we must go all out to ensure we meet the goal of delivering 39,000 units this month."" 
His pledge came a day after China's top real estate regulator told the official Xinhua News Agency the government would resolutely tackle risks stemming from overdue delivery of residential properties by some top developers.
Also on Saturday, China's central bank said it would safeguard the legal rights of home buyers.
The statement said Evergrande had resumed cooperation with more than 80% of decoration companies and long-term suppliers, having signed 6,869 contracts with material suppliers. 

The Chinese government has in recent months marginally eased property financing to prevent a hard landing of the sector, but has not reversed its property curbs designed to reduce leverage and discourage speculation.
Chinese authorities are scrutinising the assets of Evergrande and its wealthy chairman but expect no fire sale for now, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters in mid-December.

Worldwide, thousands of flights have been cancelled over the Christmas weekend because of the rapid spread of the new Omicron coronavirus variant.
Japan, which tightened border controls to counter the threat from Omicron, has reported only about a dozen cases of community spread of the new variant and 231 total Omicron infections, including overseas arrivals, according to the health ministry.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. airlines scrapped nearly 1,000 flights on Saturday, the second straight day of massive cancellations as surging COVID-19 infections have sidelined some pilots and other crew members, upending plans for tens of thousands of holiday travelers over the Christmas weekend.
A total of 957 Christmas Day flights, including domestic flights and those into or out of the country, were canceled, up from 690 on Christmas Eve, according to a running tally on flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. Nearly 2,000 flights were delayed.
At least one airline said that it expects hundreds more cancellations on Sunday.
The Christmas holidays are typically a peak time for air travel, but the rapid spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant has led to a sharp increase in COVID-19 infections, forcing airlines to cancel flights as pilots and crew need to be quarantined.
United Airlines canceled 230 flights while American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) called off 90 flights, representatives for the companies said in separate statements.
""The nationwide spike in Omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation,"" United spokesperson Maddie King said. She said the cancellations made up a small portion of United's 4,000 average daily flights during the holiday season.
""We are working hard to rebook as many people as possible and get them on their way for the holidays,"" she said.
Winter weather and Omicron forced Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) to scrub 344 flights on Saturday, of approximately 3,000 scheduled flights, ""after exhausting all options and resources to prevent those cancellations,"" a spokesperson for the company said, adding that the impact was likely to persist on Sunday.
""Delta expects more than 300 of its flights will be canceled on Sunday, Dec. 26,"" the spokesperson said. ""Delta people are working together around the clock to reroute and substitute aircraft and crews to get customers where they need to be as quickly and safely as possible.""
Globally, FlightAware data showed that just over 2,700 flights were called off on Saturday and another 7,049 were delayed, as of 5.30 p.m. EST (2230 GMT).
Among the most impacted U.S. airports were Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International, New Jersey's Newark Liberty International, Los Angeles International and New York's JFK International. Six out of the 10 global airports most hit by the cancellations were Chinese.
Not all airlines were affected equally. A spokesperson for Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) said there were no issues to report with the carrier's flights on Saturday.
The Omicron variant was first detected in November and now accounts for nearly three-quarters of U.S. cases and as many as 90% in some areas, such as the Eastern Seaboard.
The average number of new U.S. coronavirus cases has risen 45% to 179,000 per day over the past week, according to a Reuters tally.
While recent research suggests Omicron produces milder illness and a lower rate of hospitalizations than previous variants of COVID-19, health officials have maintained a cautious note about the outlook.

Ahead of the Christmas holiday, Americans scrambled for COVID-19 tests and many went ahead with their travel plans. 
U.S. officials have said that people who are fully vaccinated should feel comfortable proceeding with holiday travel.

285,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 25, 2021 03:31PM ET</span>",NASA launches revolutionary space telescope to give glimpse of early universe,"By Steve Gorman
(Reuters) -NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, built to give the world its first glimpse of the universe as it existed when the earliest galaxies formed, was launched by rocket early Saturday from the northeastern coast of South America, opening a new era of astronomy.
The revolutionary $9 billion infrared telescope https://graphics.reuters.com/SPACE-EXPLORATION/TELESCOPE/klvyknwbrvg, described by NASA as the premiere space-science observatory of the next decade, was carried aloft inside the cargo bay of an Ariane 5 rocket that blasted off at about 7:20 a.m. EST (1220 GMT) from the European Space Agency's (ESA) launch base in French Guiana.
The flawless Christmas Day launch, with a countdown conducted in French, was carried live on a joint NASA-ESA webcast. The liftoff capped a project decades in the making, coming to fruition after years of repeated delays and cost over-runs.
""From a tropical rain forest to the edge of time itself, James Webb begins a voyage back to the birth of the universe,"" a NASA commentator said as the two-stage launch vehicle, fitted with double solid-rocket boosters, roared off its launch pad into cloudy skies.
After a 27-minute, hypersonic ride into space, the 14,000-pound instrument was released from the upper stage of the French-built rocket about 865 miles above the Earth, and should gradually unfurl to nearly the size of a tennis court over the next 13 days as it sails onward on its own.
Live video captured by a camera mounted on the rocket's upper stage showed the Webb gliding gently away after it was jettisoned, drawing cheers and applause from jubilant flight engineers in the mission control center. 
Flight controllers confirmed moments later, as the Webb's solar-energy array was deployed, that its power supply was working.
Coasting through space for two more weeks, the Webb telescope will reach its destination in solar orbit 1 million miles from Earth - about four times farther away than the moon. And Webb's special orbital path will keep it in constant alignment with the Earth as the planet and telescope circle the sun in tandem.
By comparison, Webb's 30-year-old predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope, orbits the Earth from 340 miles away, passing in and out of the planet's shadow every 90 minutes.
Named after the man who oversaw NASA through most of its formative decade of the 1960s, Webb is about 100 times more sensitive than Hubble and is expected to transform scientists' understanding of the universe and our place in it.
NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, striking a spiritual tone as he addressed the launch webcast by video link, quoted the Bible and hailed the new telescope as a ""time machine"" that will ""capture the light from the very beginning of the creation.""
COSMOLOGICAL HISTORY LESSON
Webb mainly will view the cosmos in the infrared spectrum, allowing it to peer through clouds of gas and dust where stars are being born, while Hubble has operated primarily at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. 
The new telescope's primary mirror - consisting of 18 hexagonal segments of gold-coated beryllium metal - also has a much bigger light-collecting area, enabling it to observe objects at greater distances, thus farther back into time, than Hubble or any other telescope.
That, astronomers say, will bring into view a glimpse of the cosmos never previously seen - dating to just 100 million years after the Big Bang, the theoretical flashpoint that set in motion the expansion of the observable universe an estimated 13.8 billion years ago.
Hubble's view reached back to roughly 400 million years following the Big Bang, a period just after the very first galaxies - sprawling clusters of stars, gases and other interstellar matter - are believed to have taken shape. 
While Hubble caught glimmers of ""toddler"" galaxies, Webb will reveal those objects in greater detail while also capturing even fainter, earlier ""infant"" galaxies, astrophysicist Eric Smith, NASA's Webb program scientist, told Reuters hours before the launch.
Aside from examining the formation of the earliest stars and galaxies, astronomers are eager to study super-massive black holes believed to occupy the centers of distant galaxies.
Webb's instruments also make it ideal to search for evidence of potentially life-supporting atmospheres around scores of newly documented exoplanets - celestial bodies orbiting distant stars - and to observe worlds much closer to home, such as Mars and Saturn's icy moon Titan.
The telescope is an international collaboration led by NASA in partnership with the European and Canadian space agencies.  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) was the primary contractor. The Arianespace launch vehicle is part of the European contribution. 
""The world gave us this telescope, and we handed it back to the world today,"" Gregory Robinson, Webb program director for NASA told reporters at a post-launch briefing.
Webb was developed at a cost of $8.8 billion, with operational expenses projected to bring its total price tag https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-nasa-telescope/northrop-ceo-grilled-by-u-s-lawmakers-over-space-telescope-idUSKBN1KG2US to about $9.66 billion, far higher than planned when NASA was previously aiming for a 2011 launch.

Astronomical operation of the telescope, to be managed from the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, is expected to begin in the summer of 2022, following about six months of alignment and calibration of Webb's mirrors and instruments.
It is then that NASA expects to release the initial batch of images captured by Webb. Webb is designed to last up to 10 years.

Wang Menghui, head of the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, also told Xinhua that China will keep its real estate policies consistent and stable, while strengthening coordination in areas including finance, and land and market supervision.
Chinese developers suffered liquidity stress this year as Beijing stepped up its deleverage campaign against the bloated sector, triggering defaults at heavily-indebted players such as China Evergrande Group.
Although Chinese regulators have marginally eased funding restrictions to avoid a hand-landing of the sector, Wang ruled out policy reversal.
China will not use the property sector as a tool to stimulate the economy for short-term growth and will continue to crack down on speculative investment, Xinhua reported, citing Wang.
Instead, China will set up a mechanism to foster long-term development of the real estate industry, while maintaining stability in market expectations, as well as land and property prices. 

Wang said the fundamentals of China's real estate market have not changed, with home-buying demand remaining robust from the still-rapid pace of urbanisation, and the need for better living standards fuelled by the coronavirus epidemic. 
Earlier on Saturday, China's central bank said it will safeguard the legal rights of home buyers and better satisfy their reasonable living needs, vowing to promote healthy development of the country's real estate market.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A New York state judge on Friday ordered the New York Times to return internal documents to the conservative activist group Project Veritas, a restriction the newspaper said violates decades of First Amendment protections.
In an unusual written ruling https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=SgQ8IEENXxhU2D4NlHEZHw==&system=prod, Justice Charles Wood of the Westchester County Supreme Court directed the New York Times to return to Project Veritas any physical copies of legal memos prepared by one of the group's lawyers, and to destroy electronic versions.
Wood had entered a temporary order against the New York Times last month, drawing criticism from freedom of the press advocates.
Project Veritas, led by James O'Keefe, has used what critics view as misleading tactics like secret audio recording to expose what it describes as liberal media bias. The group is the subject of a Justice Department probe into its possible role in the theft of a diary from President Joe Biden's daughter, Ashley, pages of which were published on a right-wing website.
Project Veritas objected to a Nov. 11 Times article that drew from the legal memos and purported to reveal how the group worked with its lawyers to ""gauge how far its deceptive reporting practices can go before running afoul of federal laws.""
Wood said in Friday's ruling that the Project Veritas legal memos were not a matter of public concern and that the group has a right to keep them private that outweighs concerns about freedom of the press.
""Steadfast fidelity to, and vigilance in protecting First Amendment freedoms cannot be permitted to abrogate the fundamental protections of attorney-client privilege or the basic right to privacy,"" Wood wrote.
A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times, said the newspaper would appeal the ruling.
Sulzberger said the decision barred the Times from publishing newsworthy information that was obtained legally in the ordinary course of reporting.
""In addition to imposing this unconstitutional prior restraint, the judge has gone even further (and) ordered that we return this material, a ruling with no apparent precedent and one that could present obvious risks to exposing sources should it be allowed to stand,"" Sulzberger said.
Libby Locke, a lawyer for Project Veritas, said in a statement that the New York Times’ behavior was ""irregular,"" and that the ruling affirms that view.
""The New York Times has long forgotten the meaning of the journalism it claims to espouse, and has instead become a vehicle for the prosecution of a partisan political agenda,"" Locke said.

Project Veritas has been engaged in defamation litigation against the New York Times since last year, when the newspaper published a piece calling the group's work ""deceptive.""
The Times had not faced any prior restraint since 1971, when the Nixon administration unsuccessfully sought to block the publication of the Pentagon Papers detailing U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.

(Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) is seeking information through the U.S. courts which could lead to it taking legal action in Britain against SoftBank Group Corp to recover funds it says are owed to its Greensill-linked supply chain finance funds, U.S. court documents show.
Switzerland's second-largest bank has been working to recover funds from the collapse of some $10 billion in funds linked to insolvent supply chain finance firm Greensill.
Credit Suisse declined comment, while SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Swiss bank has been focusing on some $2.3 billion in loans provided by Greensill, which imploded in March, to three counterparties including SoftBank-backed Katerra, for which late payments have accrued.
Katerra filed for bankruptcy in June, and had estimated liabilities of $1 billion to $10 billion and assets of $500 million to $1 billion, according to court filings at the time.
In a petition filed on Thursday with a U.S. federal court in San Francisco, Credit Suisse is seeking information it said would support a lawsuit it plans to file against SoftBank and other affiliates in Britain over $440 million it says are owed by Katerra.
""The documents the Subpoena requests are relevant to an anticipated court proceeding in England against, among potentially other parties, SoftBank Group Corp. and certain of its affiliates including SoftBank Vision Fund LP, SoftBank Vision Fund II-2 LP, SVF Abode (Cayman) Limited, SVF II Abode (Cayman) Limited, and SVF Habitat (Cayman) Limited,"" attorneys for the bank said in the filings.
Credit Suisse on Thursday filed a section 1782 Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA), aiming to obtain documents and communications exchanged between SoftBank and Katerra. This statute allows foreign parties to apply to U.S. courts to obtain evidence for use in proceedings.

LONDON (Reuters) - You might be tempted to pop corks if you've invested in vintage champagne this year - the most coveted bottles have outperformed all major financial market assets, from Big Tech to bitcoin.
Online platforms that allow you to trade desirable wine, champagne and spirit vintages, much like stocks or currencies, have seen record activity and bumper price movements this year.
Data from LiveTrade, which runs the ""Bordeaux Index"" of drinks, showed champagne accounted for 15 of the 20 top price rises on the platform in 2021. 
The charge was led by Salon le Mesnil's 2002 vintage, described by its producer as ""captivating like a samurai sword"". It has surged more than 80% in value in 2021 on both LiveTrade and another wine platform Liv-ex, and currently sells for roughly 11,700 pounds a bottle ($15,700).
That beats bitcoin's 75% rise and is nearly five times more than the 18% made by the NYFANG+TM stocks index of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) which have powered world equity market gains of late.
Taittinger's Comtes de Champagne 2006 also sparkled, along with Krug's 2002 and 1996 vintages, with price rises of more than 70%, while the Krug 2000, Bollinger La Grande Année 2007, Cristal Rosé 2008 and Dom Pérignon P2 2002 have seen rises of 54%-55%.
LiveTrade CEO Matthew O'Connell said several factors had fuelled a boom in fine-wine trading this year - ""from low interest rates and high levels of savings accumulated by the wealthy during numerous global lockdowns, to a growing focus on hard assets in the face of rising inflationary pressures"".
Champagne benefited early in the year as it was exempt from the 25% U.S. tariffs put on European wines by Donald Trump's U.S. administration which were then suspended shortly after Joe Biden took over.
Cristal's 2012 and 2013 champagnes were the most-traded bottles of the year overall, LiveTrade said, followed by leading fine wine, the 6,450-a-bottle Lafite Rothschild 2014.
The prized claret brand's stellar performance was driven by normally less coveted ""off"" vintages – namely 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2017 - all of which enjoyed 25% plus sales growth.
A record 220,000 bottles were traded this year on LiveTrade at an average bottle price of about 230 pounds ($308.50) apiece. A tenth of all bottles traded saw their prices rise by over 30%. 

The Champagne 50 index was the top-performing sub-index in the Liv-ex Fine Wine 1000, up 33.8% year-to-date.

By Danilo Masoni and Alun John
MILAN/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Stock markets in Europe and Asia cemented gains in light holiday trade on Friday, while the safe-haven dollar eased on signs the Omicron variant would not significantly derail global economic growth. 
The greenback was set for its worst week in four months while other risk-friendly assets from bitcoin to the Australian dollar held onto their recent gains, buoyed by ebbing concerns over the severity of the new COVID-19 variant.
A top European equity benchmark hovered around one month highs after a week of gains and the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.1%, after a record closing high for S&P 500 on Thursday. 
Even though it is highly infectious, studies have shown how Omicron is less severe than the Delta strain, fuelling optimism about a limited fallout from new restrictions, and setting the MSCI world equity index for a 2% weekly gain. 
""The most popular motivation (for the rally) is the growing perception that Omicron is less lethal. This certainty helped risk appetite return, but self-fulfilling expectations of Christmas rallies and reduced liquidity also came in play,"" said Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia in Milan.
""I still think the news on Omicron is good, but not as good as the market is taking it. So it really depends on how much the contagions will fly,"" he added.
U.S. equity and Treasury markets will be closed on Friday for the holiday. In Europe, stock markets in several countries including Germany, Italy and Switzerland were also shut, while bourses in London and France trade only half day.
Stephane Ekolo, strategist at Tradition in London, said he would not read too much in market moves going into year end given the thin volumes, noting how the upward trend was clouded by uncertainties ranging from inflation to central bank policy.
The U.S. Federal Reserve said last week it would accelerate tapering of its massive bond buying programme and paved the way for three interest rate hikes in 2022, but this did not roil markets as it did in 2013 when the Fed tapered its post financial crisis quantitative easing. 
""As it looks like neither tapering nor the Omicron variant will have too much of an effect on the economy, globally, money is flowing into equities,"" said Steven Leung executive director for institutional sales at UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong.
Some markets, however, fell on tighter measures to contain the spread of Omicron. Chinese blue chips slipped 0.6% a day after rising infections in the northwestern city of Xi'an resulted in a lockdown of its 13 million residents.
SOFT DOLLAR 
In currency markets, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major peers was at 95.96, down 0.1% on the day and on course for a 0.7% drop from last Friday's close - its worst week since late August. 
The dollar has lost ground on most currencies, barring the yen, another safe haven. The Japanese currency was at 114.37 per dollar on Friday and 82.82 against the Australian dollar, almost the same level as in late November when news about the Omicron variant first emerged. 
The Aussie was at $0.7243, just off its five-week peak of $0.7252 hit overnight, and the pound which struck a month high of $1.3437 on Thursday, was last at $1.341, up 1.4% on the week. The euro added 0.1% at $1.134.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was 1.4926 at their Thursday close having touched more than a one-week high of 1.5010% earlier in the session as investors sold government bonds as part of the risk-on mood. [UST/] 
In line with the same trend, bitcoin rose 4.5% on Thursday, its best day in nearly two weeks and held onto those gains on Friday in Europe, trading just above $51,000, up 0.6%. 
Trading patterns in the world's largest cryptocurrency are gradually becoming more aligned with risk-on and risk-off moves in traditional markets as institutional investors' influence grows. 
Oil prices fell in light holiday trade, snapping a three-day rally. Brent crude futures slid 1.2% to $75.94 a barrel. U.S. markets are closed. [O/R] 
The weak dollar helped spot gold hit its highest in more than one month in Asian trading before paring gains. It was last at $1,807.9 per ounce, flat on the day but set for a weekly gain of 0.6%. [GOL/]

294,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2021 12:10PM ET</span>",Selfridges sold to Thai and Austrian alliance in $5 billion deal,"By Matthias Inverardi
DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Luxury British store chain Selfridges is being sold to a Thai retailer and an Austrian property company in a deal that a source close to the matter said was worth around 4 billion pounds ($5.37 billion).
Thailand's Central Group and Austrian real estate company Signa Group, which already jointly own major department stores across Europe, said on Thursday they had struck a deal for the chain best known for its Oxford Street store in London.
The Canadian wing of the billionaire Weston family bought Selfridges for nearly 600 million pounds in 2003.
Central Group, owned by the billionaire Chirathivat family, and Austrian investor Rene Benko's Signa together own department stores in Germany, Italy, Denmark and Switzerland.
Founded in 1908, the Selfridges Group employs 10,000 people and owns 25 stores worldwide, including in major cities in England, Ireland, the Netherlands and Canada.
Signa and Central will take over 18 of the 25 stores and hope to build a luxury hotel alongside the Oxford Street flagship, the source said, adding that seven department stores in Canada were not part of the package.
With Selfridges, they hope to build a luxury department store empire, complemented by an online business.
The source said they plan to increase sales to 8 billion euros ($9.1 billion) by 2024 - including more than 1 billion online - from around 5 billion now.
The conglomerate will be managed from a holding company in London, with the potential for an eventual stock exchange listing, although local management of the stores in other countries will remain, the source said.
Central opened its first department store in 1956, growing to become Thailand's largest mall owner with about 2,400 retail stores. It has an e-commerce joint venture with China's JD (NASDAQ:JD).com and stakes in Southeast Asia ride-hailer Grab Holdings.
Central has been present in Europe since 2011 when it bought the upmarket Italian department store chain La Rinascente SpA for 205 million euros. In 2013, it also acquired Illum, Denmark’s oldest department store.
In 2015, Central bought a majority stake in three luxury department stores in Germany from Signa. Central and Signa last year together bought Swiss luxury store Globus and other assets for more than 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.1 billion).

Central and Signa have also teamed up with Japanese retail giant Aeon Co to develop an e-commerce platform for one of the fastest growing online sports retail markets in the world.

295,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2021 11:51AM ET</span>","Apple's App Store broke competition laws, Dutch watchdog says","(Reuters) - The Netherlands' top competition regulator on Friday said Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) broke the country's competition laws and ordered changes to the iPhone maker's App Store payment policies.
Apple's practice of requiring app developers to use its in-app payment system and pay commissions of 15% to 30% on digital goods purchases has come under scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world. 
An investigation by the Netherlands' Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) on whether Apple's practices amounted to an abuse of a dominant market position was launched in 2019. But it was later reduced in scope to focus primarily on dating market apps, including Tinder owner  Match Group Inc  (NASDAQ:MTCH).
""We disagree with the order issued by the ACM and have filed an appeal,"" Apple said in a statement. It added that ""Apple does not have a dominant position in the market for software distribution in the Netherlands, has invested tremendous resources helping developers of dating apps reach customers and thrive on the App Store.""
Reuters reported in October that the ACM had found Apple's practices anti-competitive and ordered changes, but the decision was not published until Friday.
The regulator's decision said Apple violated competition laws. It has ordered Apple to adjust the unreasonable conditions in its App Store that apply to dating-app providers. 
The decision orders Apple to allow dating-apps providers to use alternative payment systems. The company faces a fine of up to 50 million euros ($56.6 million) if it fails to comply. 
Apple was given until Jan. 15 to implement changes, a statement said.
""We applaud the ruling issued today by a Rotterdam Court affirming the ACM's decision that Apple's forced use of its in-app payment systems and other practices violate Dutch and EU competition law, and must be eliminated by January 15th,"" Match group said in an email statement.
The disclosure of Apple's regulatory setback in the Netherlands comes after the iPhone maker lost a fight in South Korea to stop a law that requires major app platform providers like Apple and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google to allow developers to use third-party payment services.

Google has indicated it will allow such payments, though it will still charge a commission on them. Apple has not commented on its plans for compliance in Korea.
Apple is facing proposed legislation in the European Union and United States that would force it to change its in-app payment policies and other business practices objected to by developers.

(Reuters) -United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) have canceled hundreds of Christmas Eve flights, as the spreading COVID-19 Omicron variant takes a toll on its flight crews and other workers.
Chicago-based United on Thursday canceled 120 flights for Friday, while Atlanta-based Delta said it had canceled about 90. Both said they were working to contact passengers so they would not be stranded at airports.
FlightAware on Friday said United has now canceled 169 flights on Christmas Eve and Delta has canceled 127, along with another 50 canceled flights for United on Christmas and 89 for Delta.
The flight tracking firm said the current number of Christmas Eve flights canceled globally is 2,029, with 448 canceled in the United States.
""The nationwide spike in Omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation. As a result, we’ve unfortunately had to cancel some flights and are notifying impacted customers in advance of them coming to the airport,"" United said on Thursday.
Delta said Thursday it has ""exhausted all options and resources -- including rerouting and substitutions of aircraft and crews to cover scheduled flying -- before canceling around 90 flights for Friday.""
Delta cited potential inclement weather and the impact of the Omicron variant for the cancellations.
On Tuesday, Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian asked the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to shrink quarantine guidelines for fully vaccinated individuals who experience breakthrough COVID-19 infections, citing the impact on the carrier's workforce. Bastian asked that the isolation period be cut to five days from the current 10.

That request was echoed both by Airlines for America, a trade group representing major cargo and passenger carriers, which wrote to the CDC on Thursday, and by JetBlue on Wednesday.
The CDC released updated quarantine guidance for healthcare workers on Thursday, cutting the isolation time to seven days for workers who test positive for COVID-19 but are asymptomatic, providing they test negative.

(Reuters) -European shares closed lower in light holiday trading on Friday, following a recent rally in global shares on signs the Omicron coronavirus variant may not derail global economic recovery.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index slipped 0.1% to 483.01 in a shortened trading session ahead of Christmas. The benchmark has added 1.9% this week.
London's FTSE 100 closed flat, while France's CAC 40 ended 0.3% lower. Stock markets in several countries including Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the U.S. are closed on Friday for Christmas. 
Most Asian markets edged higher and the S&P 500 closed at a record high overnight on positive economic data and as some studies suggested the Omicron variant carries a lower risk of hospitalisation.
""The European market is moving in tight ranges ... due to light holiday trading and also driven by fears of possible restrictions and lockdowns,"" said Raed Alkhedr, chief market analyst at Equiti Group.
Italy on Thursday tightened restrictions, including banning all public New Year's Eve celebrations as daily COVID-19 infections hit a record high.
The STOXX 600 is entering the holiday period on a quiet note after rallying 21% so far this year. Though 2021 was marked by accommodative policies and positive corporate earnings, supply bottlenecks, inflationary pressures and a new COVID-19 variant threaten growth and recovery into 2022.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese health ministry panel on Friday recommended approval of the COVID-19 antiviral pill developed by Merck & Co Inc, part of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's plan to roll out new treatments by year-end as concerns rise about the Omicron variant.
The panel's decision sets the stage for shipments of 200,000 doses across the country from this weekend, based on preparations announced earlier by Kishida.
""I'm convinced the distribution of this drug is a major step forward for our nation's COVID-19 handling,"" health minister Shigeyuki Goto told reporters after the decision, adding that some medical institutions and pharmacies will start receiving the pill as soon as next Monday.
Japan is betting heavily on oral treatments to keep serious infections and deaths at bay should a feared sixth wave of the pandemic emerge. The government agreed last month to pay Merck and its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics about $1.2 billion for 1.6 million courses of their drug molnupiravir.
In addition, Kishida announced last week a deal to procure 2 million doses of a separate antiviral pill developed by  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) And Japan's Shionogi & Co is expected to soon file for approval of its own treatment, supplying another 1 million doses by early next year. 
U.S. regulators on Thursday authorized the Merck pill for certain high-risk adult patients.
Countries rushed to buy Merck's molnupiravir after very promising initial results, but subsequent company data in late November indicated the drug was markedly less effective than previously thought. France cancelled its order on Wednesday.

Asked about the debate over its efficacy, Goto said on Friday the Japanese panel evaluated the use of molnupiravir based mainly on the earlier test result, while adding the updated result ""does not negate this drug's effectiveness"".
Japan this week confirmed the first known cases of Omicron infections that could not be traced back to overseas travellers. Community transmissions of the variant have now been found in the western cities of Osaka and Kyoto, and a suspected case was announced in Tokyo on Friday.

Futures in London slipped 0.5% toward $76 a barrel on Friday. While omicron has led to some travel restrictions and surging infections, a U.K. health agency said the variant was less likely to lead to hospitalizations, compared with the delta strain. The market has been susceptible to greater volatility and wild price swings this week due to lower trading volumes.
Oil is heading for a yearly gain after a robust rebound from the pandemic but the rally has faltered recently, in part due to concerns about omicron. There are some signs of tightening emerging, however, with supply disruptions in Libya and Nigeria. An energy crunch in Europe is also raising the prospect that more oil products will be needed for power generation.
“If the omicron variant is indeed less deadly, then the economic recovery won’t be derailed and oil consumption will rise into 2022,” said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda Asia Pacific Pte. “The news flow around omicron makes conditions perfect for an oil price rally.”
Omicron appears to be less severe but more contagious than any other strain to date, the U.K. Health Security Agency said Thursday. An individual infected with the variant is 50% to 70% less likely to be admitted to hospital, compared with the delta strain, the agency said.
The U.S., meanwhile, awarded a second batch of crude oil from the strategic reserve to Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC). as part of the Biden administration’s effort to lower energy costs.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's move to block Facebook-owner Meta Platform Inc's acquisition of Giphy signalled a new determination to scrutinise digital deals.
Meta on Thursday appealed the ruling by the Competition and Markets Authority, which said the 2020 deal must be unwound and Giphy sold as a going concern.
The November decision was the first time the regulator had blocked an acquisition by a major tech company.
Under the leadership of Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli, the CMA has stepped up its scrutiny of ""big tech,"" and in particular Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which dominate digital advertising.
Coscelli has set up a digital markets unit, and he wants it to be backed up by new legislation.
Competition lawyer Peter Broadhurst, partner at Crowell & Moring, said Coscelli thought there had been historic under-enforcement in digital markets. 
""He sees merger control as a quick-win way that the CMA can do something about that,"" he said, adding that the regulator was testing the limits of its jurisdiction and reasoning.
""My view is that they are happy to push those boundaries until they get slapped down by the court,"" he said. ""That's their way of working out where the boundaries are.""
Facebook points out that Giphy has no presence, employees, offices or revenues in Britain, and it had not launched its fledging advertising business in the country. 
The CMA, which stresses that its process is independent, said the deal was firmly in its remit. It noted that UK users look for 1 billion GIFs a month on Giphy, and 73% of the time they spend on social media was on Meta's Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.
Notably, the CMA was concerned about the potential Giphy had to enter the display advertising sector, even though it had not done so in Britain. The CMA said it wanted to preserve any competitor or potential competitor given the dominance of Meta's social networks.
AJ Bell financial analyst Danni Hewson said the CMA acted because it felt there was potential for Facebook and Giphy to some day become direct competitors. ""Tech bosses (will seek to) work out exactly how strong these regulators' muscles are and whether the decision will set a precedent other regulators will seek to follow,"" Hewson said. 

Broadhurst said the CMA had gone farther in pursuing this argument than ever before.
""This will cause quite a lot of uncertainty for companies trying to do deals where the parties don't actually compete, but maybe could do in the future - particularly where one of them may be big in its own market,"" he said.

The Durex condom and Lysol disinfectant maker said the businesses generated a combined net revenue of 43 million pounds last year.
The Slough-based company has been trimming its portfolio to concentrate on high growth categories such as disinfectants and health care products that have seen a boom during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In February, Reckitt sold its Scholl footcare business to private equity firm Yellow Wood Partners, and a few months later signed a deal to sell its infant formula business in China for $2.2 billion to Primavera Capital Group.
Reuters had reported last year that the company was preparing to sell some non-core brands and was seeking out private equity bidders.
""As we shift from a brand-led to a category-led growth strategy, we are focusing on high growth categories with brands we can stretch into new places and spaces to support our medium-term growth ambitions, including 4%-6% growth in Health (business),"" CEO Laxman Narasimhan said in a statement.
In a separate statement, Karo Pharma said the deal is structured as a put option agreement and when completed will scale up its operations in the United Kingdom and strengthen its position in the dermatology category.
Reckitt will provide service and manufacturing support to Karo for a limited time following completion of the deal, which is expected in the second quarter of 2022, Karo Pharma said in a statement. 

No manufacturing sites are included as part of the deal and Karo intends to transfer production to a new third party contract manufacturing organization, the Stockholm-based healthcare company added.

Investing.com -- European stock futures were drifting lower early Friday, consolidating at the end of a week dominated by growing hopes of a quick end to the pandemic.
In many markets, including Germany, Spain and Italy, the Christmas holiday period has already started. Markets are open for half the day the U.K., France, Poland and the Benelux countries, however.
By 2:30 AM ET (0730 GMT), FTSE 100 futures were down 21 points, or 0.3%, while French CAC 40 futures were down 9.5 points, or 0.1%.
That was due largely to a negative handover from Asia, where the country's zero-tolerance policy of Covid-19 has already caused one of its tightest lockdowns in the last 18 months, in the city of Xi'an. Chinese authorities are eager to ensure that the staging of the Beijing Winter Olympics proceeds as planned early in the new year.
However, countries which have accepted the inevitability of community spread have been cheered by signs that the new dominant strain, Omicron, is significantly less dangerous than all those which have gone before it. U.K. health authorities, citing data from a population relatively well protected by vaccination and past illness, that Omicron is 70% less likely to cause a stay in hospital.
In addition, fresh data from South Africa, where the strain was first idenitified. suggest that the wave of Omicron infection may also be shorter than previous ones. The 7-day average for new infections there is already down 25% from its peak on Deember 16th. The peak came only three weeks after Omicron was first detected.
In corporate news, U.K. engineering group  Babcock International  (LON:BAB) said earlier it has completed the sale of its U.K. power business for 50 million pounds, whiie while  Carmat  (PA:ALCAR), a French maker of heart implants, will be in focus later after saying it had identified the source of a problem with its prostheses, a first step on the way to resuming their use in the U.S. Carmat stock has fallen nearly 40% from its peak earlier this year.

India’s benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has slumped 3.6% since the end of September, halting a rally that ran for six straight quarters and doubled the index’s value. Since reaching a record high in October, the gauge has approached a technical correction, with foreign investors pulling out more than $4 billion from market over the past three months.
Historically high valuations have also made some analysts cautious. India’s key equity gauges are trading at 20-21 times their estimated forward 12-month profits compared with 12 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  
“Unwinding of monetary policy support and reduction in fiscal support in the upcoming year may have negative repercussions for global growth as well as equity valuations,”  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG analyst Jitendra Gohil and Premal Kamdar wrote in a note this week.  
A withdrawal of monetary stimulus may cause a jump in volatility reminiscent of 2003 and 2009, when prices fluctuated while equity returns remained modest, according to Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc’s India wealth unit.

“The group considered it an opportune time to exit the aircraft-leasing sector and enhance its strategic focus during the pandemic,” CK Asset said in a filing to the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.
""COVID-19 has caused a paradigm shift in the aircraft leasing sector... the risk and return dynamics have become volatile and unpredictable, and the industry has undergone increased consolidation, mergers and acquisitions activities to mitigate such volatility.”"

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Friday morning, steadying after U.S. counterparts hit a record high as concerns about the omicron COVID-19 variant’s impact on the global economic recovery continue to ebb.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was steady at 28,798.37 by 9:06 PM ET (2:06 AM GMT), with data released earlier in the day showing that the national core consumer price index grew 0.5% year-on-year in November.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.51% and in Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.54%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched up 0.07%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.36% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.21%
Volumes have thinned, and many markets are closed or operating with reduced hours for the holidays. Investors are turning from safe-haven assets toward riskier assets, with U.S. Treasuries slipping during the previous session. There is no cash trading of Treasuries on Friday.
Giving sentiment a boost, a U.K. study suggested omicron infections are less likely to lead to hospitalization. But it added that the variant may still produce a significant number of serious cases due to its infectiousness.
Across the Atlantic,  Merck & Co . Inc. (NYSE:MRK) COVID-19 pill Molnupiravir received emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
However, a laboratory study showed that two doses and a booster of Sinovac Biotech Ltd.’s vaccine did not produce sufficient levels of neutralizing antibodies to protect against omicron.
A global stock gauge is up some 3% in December, demonstrating the equity market’s resilience despite the risks posed by COVID-19. Diminishing liquidity support from central banks as they move to curb high inflation could also test markets in 2022.
“We certainly favor value into 2022 overgrowth and are much more on the short duration side both when we look at equities and fixed income,” Angel Oak Capital Advisors LLC portfolio manager Cheryl Pate told Bloomberg.
However, U.S. inflation could move still higher and that the Federal Reserve faces a delicate balancing act to check price pressures while maintaining the economic recovery, she added.
Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers painted a darker picture, warning of a testing period for the U.S. economy in coming years, with the risk of recession followed by stagnation. The Fed had been late to spot the dangers of inflation, he added.
Although omicron “will create some slowdowns in the economy, perhaps some slowdowns of production which could add to inflation pressures in the short term,” that will fade and the economy will work its way through the situation,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute head of global market strategy Paul Christopher told Bloomberg."

(Reuters) - Two Georgia election workers who were the target of vote-rigging conspiracy theories have sued the far-right One America News Network, its top executives, and former President Donald Trump's ex-lawyer Rudy Giuliani for allegedly spreading lies about them. 
The defamation lawsuit was filed on Thursday in federal court in Washington, D.C., by Wandrea ""Shaye"" Moss, a voter registration officer in Fulton County, and her mother, Ruby Freeman, who was a temp worker for the 2020 election. 
The lawsuit targets San Diego-based Herring Networks, which owns and operates One America News Network, as well as the channel's chief executive Robert Herring, president Charles Herring, and reporter Chanel Rion.
Giuliani, Trump's former personal lawyer, was also named as a defendant. Giuliani has frequently appeared on OAN's programs and has been one of the biggest promoters of Trump's false claims that voter fraud cost him the 2020 election.
The complaint alleges that OAN broadcast stories in which Moss and Freeman were falsely accused of conspiring to produce secret batches of illegal ballots and running them through voting machines to help then-candidate Joe Biden defeat Trump.
There is no evidence to support such claims, which have been repeatedly debunked by Georgia election officials.
In a brief interview, OAN chief executive Robert Herring Sr. told Reuters he was not concerned about the lawsuit and that his network had done nothing wrong.
""I know all about it and I'm laughing,"" he said of the lawsuit. ""I'm laughing about the four or five others who are suing me. Eventually, it will turn on them and go the other way.""
Charles Herring, Rion and Giuliani did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The defamation lawsuit is the second filed this month by Moss and Freeman, who also sued the Gateway Pundit, alleging the far-right website's unfounded reports incited months of death threats and harassment against them. 
The Gateway Pundit did not immediately respond to an email sent through its website seeking comment.
In addition to removing the reports about Freeman and Moss from OAN's websites and other media channels, the lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages.
The OAN and Gateway Pundit lawsuits both revolve around false allegations first raised by a volunteer Trump campaign attorney at a Dec. 3 hearing of Georgia state legislators. Freeman and Moss worked in heavily Democratic Fulton County, which includes Atlanta, where a strong showing by Biden helped give the Democrat a narrow Georgia victory. 
Trump, a Republican, and his surrogates used surveillance video of the vote count at State Farm Arena to falsely accuse Freeman and Moss of processing ""suitcases"" full of fake ballots for Biden late at night on Election Day, Nov. 3, 2020, after most poll workers and election observers left.
According to the complaint, Giuliani then ""amplified the video by posting about it on social media,"" while ""OAN, its hosts, and its staff"" took Giuliani's assertions and ""published them to millions of its viewers and readers.""
State officials including Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger quickly and forcefully denied the allegations, explaining that the ""suitcases"" were standard ballot containers and the votes were properly counted under the watch of an independent monitor and a state investigator.

Giuliani has falsely claimed that the video footage showed the two women engaging in ""surreptitious illegal activity"" and acting suspiciously, like drug dealers ""passing out dope."" 
In early January, Trump himself singled out Freeman, by name, 18 times in a telephone call in which he pressed Georgia officials to alter the state's results. He described Freeman as a ""known political operative"" who ""stuffed the ballot boxes.""

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes posted solid gains for a third straight session on Thursday, with the S&P 500 marking a record-high close, as encouraging developments gave investors more ease about the economic impact of the Omicron coronavirus variant.
Stocks ended the holiday-shortened week on a positive note, lifting sentiment heading into Christmas. Gains were broad among S&P 500 sectors, led by consumer discretionary and industrials, which both rose about 1.2%. 
Vaccine makers AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc said their shots protected against Omicron as UK data suggested it may cause proportionally fewer hospital cases than the Delta variant, though public health experts warned the battle against COVID-19 was far from over.
The arrival of Omicron has helped ratchet up market volatility for much of the last month of 2021, which has been a strong year for equities. 
“There was a lot of negative sentiment coming into the final part of the year, and investors have likely continued to see pretty strong economic growth and pretty positive developments as it relates to healthcare innovation around COVID and that is putting in a bit of a bid into equities and causing investors to look to allocate capital as they close out the year,” said Matthew Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 196.67 points, or 0.55%, to 35,950.56, the S&P 500 gained 29.23 points, or 0.62%, to 4,725.79 and the Nasdaq Composite added 131.48 points, or 0.85%, to 15,653.37. 
Defensive sectors, which have mostly outperformed in December, generally lagged on Thursday. The real estate sector fell 0.4%. 
The S&P 500 has gained for three days, after falling in the three prior sessions.
“People are seeing the strength on Tuesday and Wednesday and all of a sudden everybody is more optimistic again,” said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management.
For the week, the S&P 500 rose 2.3%, the Dow gained about 1.7% and the Nasdaq climbed 3.2%.
Trading volumes were expected to be thinner than usual ahead of the Christmas and New Year holidays. The stock market will be closed on Friday in observance of the Christmas holiday.
In another medical development against the pandemic, the United States authorized Merck & Co's antiviral pill for COVID-19 for certain high-risk adult patients, a day after giving a broader go-ahead to a similar but more effective treatment from  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) Merck shares fell 0.6%, while Pfizer dropped 1.4%. 
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits held below pre-pandemic levels last week as the labor market tightens, while consumer spending increased solidly, putting the economy on track for a strong finish to 2021.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shares rose 5.8%, gaining sharply for a second day after Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Wednesday he was ""almost done"" with his stock sales after selling over $15 billion worth since early November.
The S&P 500 is up about 26% so far this year. Still, the environment for equities could be changing heading into next year as the Federal Reserve is expected to begin raising interest rates in 2022.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.22-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 35 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 62 new highs and 80 new lows.
About 8 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 11.8 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

317,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2021 06:20PM ET</span>",'Santa Claus' stocks rally? Investors look to Omicron for direction,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Investors are closely watching the latest news on the rapidly spreading Omicron variant https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/how-worried-should-we-be-about-omicron-variant-2021-12-14 for signs of how much the virus could impact the U.S. economy and earnings as the market heads into what has historically been a strong time of year for equities.
Overall, the S&P 500 is slightly ahead since Nov. 24, prior to news of the variant hitting markets. It marked a record-high close on Thursday, as encouraging developments gave investors more ease about the economic impact of the variant. 
""The market is extremely reactionary now and every little bit of news has a huge impact,"" said George Young, a portfolio manager at Villere & Co. Young is planning on taking advantage of any Omicron-induced volatility to add to stocks that rely on tourism and travel such as bank company First Hawaiian (NASDAQ:FHB) Inc. Shares of the company are up 14.4% for the year to date.
The Omicron variant is causing infections to double in 1.5 to 3 days, according to the World Health Organization. The variant now accounts for 73% of all new U.S. cases, up from less than 1% at the beginning of the month. [L1N2T60ZU]
Still, questions about Omicron's virulence have made investors less pessimistic than the original reaction. The S&P 500 closed down 2.3% on Nov. 26 after the variant was discovered, on fears of fresh economic lockdowns.
A South African study offered hope about the severity of Omicron and the trend of COVID-19 infections on Wednesday. Shares of vaccine makers slumped in December as investors expect the Omicron variant's impact to be limited based on recent data. 
That bodes well for what is known in the market as a Santa Claus rally. Historically, U.S. stocks have risen during the last five trading days of December and the first two days of January in 56 out of 75 years since 1945, according to data from CFRA Research. This year, the time period starts on Dec. 27. The average Santa Claus rally has boosted the S&P 500 by 1.3% since 1969, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. 
It is unclear to what extent Wall Street analysts expect Omicron to affect earnings and the economy. Estimated 2022 S&P 500 earnings growth was at 8.3% as of Friday, compared with 8.0% at the start of December, according to Refinitiv data.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) cut its estimate https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/goldman-sachs-cuts-us-gdp-growth-forecast-2022-over-omicron-fears-2021-12-04 for U.S. GDP growth to 3.8% from 4.2% due to the uncertainty of the impact of the Omicron wave.
POSSIBLE VOLATILITY
While there will likely be some economic impact from Omicron, U.S. consumer spending will likely remain strong, said Cliff Hodge, chief investment officer for Cornerstone Wealth. 
He is focused on any signs that Senator Joe Manchin could reach an agreement to support President Joe Biden's signature $1.75 trillion Build Back Better https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-says-he-manchin-are-going-get-something-done-2021-12-21 climate and social spending bill. Manchin, who would provide one of the key votes to pass the bill in a divided Senate, said on Sunday that he could not support the bill in its current form. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said that the Senate will vote on the bill in early January.
""We need a little bit of good news whether on the Manchin front or Omicron to get a rally going,"" Hodge said. ""We are fully invested and anticipate a little bit of a relief rally into January."" 
The week ahead will be light on economic data, with the release of the S&P Case-Shiller U.S. home price index on Tuesday among the few notable data points. 
The lack of new reads of the strength of the economy at a time when coronavirus case counts are rising may leave the stock market more volatile through the end of the year, said Dana D’Auria, co-chief investment officer of Envestnet (NYSE:ENV) PMC. 
""The market has gotten pretty good at pricing in and leading off from what we are learning about on the health side,"" she said. 

Should Omicron cases continue to spike or there are signs that economic restrictions could be reimposed, investors will likely rebalance into the shares of giant technology companies such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) that have emerged as defensive plays given their large cash positions and revenue growth as a result of remote work, D'Auria said. 
""At the end of the day if Omicron really causes problems I would be ready for a more volatile market"" well into the new year, she said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The S&P 500 notched a record-high close on Thursday, with oil prices also rising, as investors and traders were optimistic about positive economic data and discounted the impact of the Omicron coronavirus variant on the economy, even as COVID-19 case counts soar.
Stocks rose broadly on the last trading day of the week ahead of a long Christmas weekend in the United States, after data showing consumer spending rose 0.6% last month. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits held below pre-pandemic levels last week, helping add to the gains.
Signs that Omicron is less likely to lead to hospitalization, and indications that both Merck's and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 anti-viral pills are effective against the variant, added to the festive cheer in the market.
“Today is a very calm day; it’s the relief over Omicron apparently not being as bad as we feared,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA). “It’s a positive sign as we head into 2022. The economic backdrop is on very strong footing.""
""The bull might have a few more tricks up his sleeve before the year ends,"" Detrick added.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.55% to 35,950.56 and the S&P 500 gained 0.62% to 4,725.79. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.85% to 15,653.37.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.72%.
As investors pulled money out of safe-haven assets, the benchmark 10-year yield on U.S. Treasuries was up 3.5 basis points at 1.4926% in afternoon trading. The Treasury markets closed at 2 p.m. ET due to the holiday weekend.
The rise of risk-on investments ahead of Christmas, dubbed a ""Santa Claus rally"" by traders, also nudged gold and oil higher.
The safe-haven dollar crept higher against a basket of currencies, but its gains were capped by the risk-on sentiment supporting the Australian dollar and British pound.
U.S. stocks posted a third successive day of gains as they recovered from a jolt on Monday when worries about Omicron pushed investors to safe-haven assets. 
The risk of needing to stay in the hospital for patients with the new variant is 40% to 45% lower than for patients with the Delta variant, according to research by London's Imperial College published on Wednesday. 
However, experts have said that U.S. President Joe Biden's attempts to curb the spread of Omicron by distributing free at-home rapid tests, though welcome, were too little, too late.

Oil prices extended gains on Thursday as the signs the worst effects of the Omicron variant might be containable prevailed over the threat of new travel curbs.
U.S. crude recently rose 1.37% to $73.76 per barrel and Brent was at $76.73, up 1.91% on the day.

AMD had agreed to buy $1.6 billion worth of chips between 2022 and 2024, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in May. Wafers are the large discs of silicon on which computer chips are made. 

GlobalFoundries was created when AMD spun off its chip factory operations in 2009 and has supplied AMD since then. However, GlobalFoundries in 2018 decided to quit pursuing leading edge chipmaking technologies.
Since then, AMD has turned to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co to supply the most critical sections of its computer processors called ""chiplets."" Even though TSMC has become its primary supplier, AMD still relies on some components from GlobalFoundries to tie its chips together.

320,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2021 05:40PM ET</span>",White House national security adviser asks software companies to discuss cybersecurity,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan sent a letter to major software companies and developers to discuss ways to improve digital security, the White House said on Thursday, the latest sign of the administration’s growing concern over cyber-security.
The United States has suffered several major cyberattacks this year, which exposed thousands of records held by companies and government agencies to hackers, including those with ties to Russia and China. 
One hack, which was identified a year ago and which the U.S. government has said was likely orchestrated by Russia, breached software made by SolarWinds and gave hackers access to thousands of companies and government offices that used its products. The hackers got access to emails at the U.S. Treasury, Justice and Commerce departments, and other agencies.
In a separate attack, more than 20,000 U.S. organizations were compromised through a backdoor patch used in  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s email software. The U.S. government believes it was carried out by a cyber-espionage group known as Hafnium, which has alleged ties to the Chinese government.
“The SolarWinds and Hafnium incidents serve as recent reminders that strategic adversaries actively exploit vulnerabilities for malicious purposes,” Sullivan said in the letter.

To kick off this effort, the deputy national security advisor for cyber & emerging technology, Anne Neuberger, will host a one-day discussion in January with company officials responsible for open-source projects and security.
Cyberattacks have grown in both frequency and impact, prompting the administration to issue an executive order in May that created a review board and new software standards for government agencies.

(Reuters) -Four people were injured when a fire erupted on Thursday at an  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) complex in Baytown, Texas, one of the largest refining and petrochemical facilities in the United States.
There were no fatalities and two of four contract workers hospitalized with injuries were released after treatment. The two still in hospital are in stable condition, the company said. 
The cause of the blaze, which was reported about 1 a.m. CT (0700 GMT) and extinguished seven hours later, has not been determined, Exxon said. 
The fire occurred in a hydrotreater unit at the refinery that had been shut on Wednesday due to a bypass line leak. The injured were contractors who had been repairing the leak, people familiar with plant operations told Reuters. 
Hydrotreaters remove sulfur and other contaminants in producing diesel, gasoline and jet fuel. An Exxon official told a news conference that the fire had affected a unit that produces gasoline. 
Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) initial reports had indicated that there had been some type of explosion at the plant. Social media users said on Twitter that a blast shook buildings in the area.
The Baytown plant https://graphics.reuters.com/REFINERY-FIRE/EXXON-BAYTOWN/gdpzymxolvw/index.html houses a chemical plant, an olefins plant and the country's fourth-biggest oil refinery, with capacity to process 560,500 barrels per day of crude. It is unclear whether any units will be shut for an extended length of time.
Exxon is adjusting production rates at other Baytown processing units to focus on stabilizing the affected units, spokeswoman Julie King said. 

The facility spans about 3,400 acres along the Houston Ship Channel, about 25 miles (40 km) east of Houston, and employs about 7,000 people.
The company has set up a hotline for local residents to seek claims for damages.

(Reuters) -Electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc will stop allowing video games to be played on vehicle screens while its cars are moving, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Thursday.
The move follows an announcement by the NHTSA on Wednesday that it had opened a formal safety investigation on 580,000 Tesla vehicles sold since 2017 over the automaker's decision to allow games to be played on the front center touchscreen while they are in motion.
This functionality, referred to as “Passenger Play,” may distract the driver and increase the risk of a crash, the NHTSA has said. 
Tesla has informed the NHTSA that a software update will lock the ""Passenger Play"" feature and make it unusable when the vehicle is in motion, a spokesperson for the agency said in a statement.
""The NHTSA constantly assesses how manufacturers identify and safeguard against distraction hazards that may arise due to faults, misuse, or intended use of convenience technologies, including infotainment screens,"" the agency said.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Safety advocates have raised concerns that drivers may not pay attention on the road, especially when Tesla vehicles are operating in semi-autonomous mode known as Autopilot. 

A driver's distraction - likely from a phone game application - was one of the causes of a fatal crash of a Tesla car operating in Autopilot in California in 2018, according to a report by the National Transportation Safety Board. 
The NHTSA in August opened a safety investigation on 765,000 Tesla vehicles over its Autopilot system after a series of crashes involving the system and parked emergency vehicles.

Investing.com - The S&P 500 finished at an all-time high close, just missing its intraday all-time high, and other leading U.S. indices closed higher to finish the holiday-shortened trading week, as low trading volumes and optimism over the Omicron Covid-19 variant being less severe allowed the fabled ""Santa rally"" effect to set in a little early.
The S&P 500 ended the day fading from session highs, up .62% to 4725.74. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 197 points to 35951, up .55%, while the NASDAQ Composite again outshone its peers, finishing the day up .84% at 15653. The Russell 2000 rose .89%, showing the market's risk-on appetite before the holiday weekend.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) again was a standout, rising nearly 6% as investors shrugged off CEO Elon Musk's continued share sales. There was excitement to go around in electric vehicles, with Nikola Corp (NASDAQ:NKLA) ending the day up 18%, Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ:LAZR) up nearly 4.4%, and Nio (NYSE:NIO) up 2.2%.
Micron Technologies (NASDAQ:MU) flirted with all-time highs, finishing up 4.5% as investors soaked in the glow of the company's strong report earlier this week. Semiconductors as a sector continued to rise, with the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) up 1%.
On the flipside, vaccine makers and pharmaceutical companies working to treat Covid-19 sold off amid continued reports that the Omicron variant poses a great risk of contagion but perhaps a lesser risk of serious disease and hospitalization, which also has led governments being less willing to take extreme containment measures that might impinge on consumer behavior or the economy more generally.  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) closed down 1.4%,  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) recovered to only be down .5% for the day, and  Novavax  Inc (NASDAQ:NVAX) closed down 3.3% despite promising news about its vaccine's efficacy against the omicron variant and other forms of Covid-19.
Bitcoin is trading above $50,000 again at $50,888 as of this writing, as the cryptocurrency sector more broadly rode the market buoyancy.  Coinbase Global  Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) benefited as well, closing up 5.3% on the day.
In a sign that the any news was bad news, both Quidel (NASDAQ:QDEL) and Crox traded lower after announcing deals. Quidel announced a $6B deal for Ortho Clinical Diagnostics and sold off 17%, while Crox sold off nearly 12% after announcing the $2.5B acquisition of HEYDUDE.
In commodities, Crude Oil WTI Futures finished the week up 4%, buoyed by the same market conviction that economic activity won't be overly slowed down by the omicron news. Gold Futures meanwhile finished at five-week highs, as inflation concerns off of a hot personal consumer expenditures report this morning may have boosted the yellow metal.
For the week, the S&P 500 finished up 2.3%, while the Dow finished up 1.65%, and the Nasdaq finished up 3.2%. The Russell was up 3.1% for the week.
The U.S. markets will be closed tomorrow in observance of Christmas.

325,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2021 04:16PM ET</span>",Enel teams up with Intesa Sanpaolo for Italy payments firm Mooney,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian utility Enel SpA has agreed to buy 50% of Italy's Mooney to take joint control of the payments firm with Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) SpA and create a European-based fintech group.
Under the deal, which values Mooney at 1.385 billion euros ($1.6 billion),  Enel  (MI:ENEI) and Intesa will buy out the 70% stake held by a company controlled by private equity CVC Capital Partners. Intesa already owns 30% of Mooney through its Banca 5 unit.
Enel will pay between 334 million and 361 million euros for its part of the stake while Intesa will pay between 88 million and 94 million euros for the remaining 20%, the companies said on Thursday.
When the deal is complete, at the end of the second quarter next year, Enel will sell its own financial service business in Italy to Mooney for 140 million euros, building scale in an industry that has grown during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Enel last year became the first of Europe’s big utilities to launch new digital banking services. 
It sees payment and open banking services such as wealth management and insurance as a new opportunity for growth as it ramps up digitalization across its networks and businesses.
""... digital payments (are) being increasingly utilized on power bills as well as on advanced, 'beyond commodity’ services, such as electric mobility"", Enel Chief Executive Francesco Starace said.
Mooney, which last year had sales of 153 million euros, has about 20 million customers and processes some 20% of all Enel electricity bills. It also has a stake in a digital platform providing more than 2 million consumers with mobility services.
Intesa Sanpaolo said Mooney would drive down the cost-to-serve for customers less interested in visiting its branches and would help it acquire new clients.

Italy's biggest bank sees Mooney as a strategic asset to help steer its branches towards higher-margin services like wealth management and insurance.

Residents of the Chumbivilcas province had been blocking the road since Nov. 20, forcing Las Bambas, which produces some 2% of global copper output, to suspend production. 
The situation has created a major issue for the government of leftist President Pedro Castillo. Peru is the world's No. 2 copper producer. 
While many Chumbivilcas residents agreed to lift the blockade on Wednesday, Giselle Huamani, a top government official focused on social conflicts, told Reuters that the last community to unblock the road had communicated its decision only on Thursday. 
In addition, communities have only agreed to lift the blockade temporarily until Dec. 30 https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/exclusive-peru-protesters-clear-las-bambas-road-after-mining-shutdown-legal-2021-12-22, when Peruvian Prime Minister Mirtha Vasquez is set to visit the area. Residents have said that depending on the agreements reached that day they will lift the blockade permanently or restart it. 
Las Bambas said in a statement it ""calls on all parties to respect the rule of law and generate the conditions necessary to restart our operations in a sustainable way."" The company added that the temporary truce did not meet those conditions. 

The Las Bambas mine has been a flashpoint for protests since the mine started operations, with blockades hitting the road on and off for over 400 days since then. 
Vasquez has strongly urged protesting communities to clear the road but was vague about the consequences of not doing so. She has not ruled out a state of emergency declaration but said she would rather engage in dialogue.

327,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2021 03:41PM ET</span>","U.S. SEC rejects Valkyrie, Kryptoin bitcoin trusts","By Hannah Lang and Katanga Johnson
(Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission vetoed two proposals to offer bitcoin exchange-traded funds, dealing a blow to market participants who had hoped the agency would green light the effort after approving futures-backed bitcoin funds in October.
In a notice dated Wednesday, the markets regulator said both of the proposals to list and trade shares of Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund and the Kryptoin Bitcoin ETF Trust failed to be approved because they did not meet its standard.
""(These proposals) do not meet the standard of being designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest,” the SEC said. 
The SEC in October approved two bitcoin futures-based funds, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which made their Wall Street debuts the same month. 
However, the regulator has yet to accept an application for a spot bitcoin ETF. Last month, the SEC rejected an application to create a spot bitcoin fund from VanEck, and on Dec. 17, delayed a decision on a similar proposal from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. 
ETFs are investment tools that track baskets of stocks and have become popular due to their lower fees. A Bitcoin ETF, which provides exposure to the digital currency, aims to save the hassle of buying the cryptocurrency from an exchange and managing the private keys.

Industry groups and stock exchanges have long sought to gain approval from the SEC on these products. 
Democratic SEC Chair Gary Gensler and investor advocates, however, worry about what they see as a lack of regulatory oversight and surveillance which heightens the potential for fraud and manipulation, they have said.

Investing.com -  Stitch Fix  (NASDAQ:SFIX) rose on Thursday on news that a large shareholder has been upping their stake in the personal clothing retailer.
Stitch Fix's shares were up 7.7% in late Thursday trading after a filing revealed that Working Capital Advisors had become a 10% shareholder. The firm had previously filed about a 6.5% position in Stitch Fix in February, and per the latest filing, has been adding steadily over the past three months, including after Stitch Fix's recent earnings report.
Stitch Fix has had a tumultuous 2021, soaring to over $100/share on the back of optimism over their December 2020 earnings report and then a short squeeze that had them caught up with the January meme stock rally. Both the market frenzy and the excitement over Stitch Fix's core business has faded, as founder/CEO Katrina Lake stepped down earlier this year. New CEO Elizabeth Spaulding has tried to shift the company's strategy away from reliance on a curated ""fix"" of five items handpicked by a data algorithm and a personal stylist together, and towards direct buying formats. So far the returns have been mixed at best, as their report two weeks ago had strong numbers for the previous quarter but muted guidance that sent shares into the teens. Even with today's spike, Stitch Fix is well off of pre-earnings levels, which were already 52-week lows.
Working Capital Advisors appears to be a London and Singapore based company run by Kenneth Chan, and Stitch Fix is their only disclosed position."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Jared Kushner's global investment firm, Affinity Partners, has raised more than $3 billion in committed funding from international investors, a person familiar with the fund-raising effort told Reuters on Thursday.
Kushner, a former top aide to former President Donald Trump who is married to his daughter, Ivanka, formed the Miami-based Affinity Partners last summer after deciding to step away from politics, and began raising money in the fall.
Kushner plans to invest in American and Israeli companies that are looking for international expansion opportunities in India, Africa, the Middle East and other parts of Asia.
Kushner's firm has received commitments of more than $3 billion, the source said, adding that he expects to continue fund-raising efforts for the next few months to close these and add potential additional commitments. 
Information on specific investors was not disclosed, but Affinity was targeting American institutions and foreign investment institutions, including sovereign wealth funds and high net worth individuals.
Affinity is hoping to close its first deal in the first quarter of 2022, the source said.
The firm has hired about 20 people, including private equity veterans Bret Perlman and Asad Naqvi, and plans to focus on U.S. based investments as well as those in the Middle East.
At the Trump White House, Kushner helped broker deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco in a six-month flurry last year. He also helped negotiate a new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.
He played a prominent role in Trump's failed 2020 reelection campaign, but has steered clear of Trump's false claims of voter fraud. Kushner tried to distance his father-in-law from fringe, far-right social media platforms after Trump was kicked off Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) following the deadly riot on Jan. 6. 

Kushner hopes to create ""an investment corridor"" between Israel and Saudi Arabia, by working with Israeli and Gulf companies and investors, the person said.
He has also written a book about his White House experience that is expected to be published by HarperCollins in 2022.

Investing.com - Mercury Systems (NASDAQ:MRCY) shares spiked nearly 10% in Thursday trading after activist firm Jana Partners filed a 13D revealing a 6.6% stake in the business.
The aerospace and defense contractor was up 9% Thursday afternoon, approaching levels not seen since the company's widely panned August earnings report.
Jana's 13D filing showed the firm has been building their stake in Mercury Systems for nearly two months. While the stated reasons for the position were fairly generic - aims of talks with management to consider ways to maximize shareholder value, ""including evaluating strategic alternatives including a sale of the Issuer, operations, capital allocation, corporate governance, board composition, and compensation practices"" - Bloomberg reported that Jana would push for a strategic review including a potential sale. Jana's recent successes on this front include pushing for sales of CyrusOne (NASDAQ:CONE),  Vonage Holdings Corp  (NASDAQ:VG), and Perspecta (NYSE:PRSP).
Mercury Systems has yet to comment on the news. The company's shares are down 37% for the year, valuing the company at $3.1B market cap."

LONDON/TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto-Dominion Bank is leading the charge of cash-rich Canadian banks seeking to make a foray in the United States and find growth away from their home turf where the Big Six banks already control nearly 90% of the market.
Billions of dollars of excess cash amassed during a nearly two-year moratorium on capital redistributions that was only lifted last month, and share prices close to record highs have given Canadian banks an acquisition currency to bet on the exit and downsizings of several European and international banks.
The sale of BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY)' U.S. unit, Bank of the West (BancWest), is the latest example of pent-up demand, with Toronto-Dominion Bank battling it out with rival Canadian lender Bank of Montreal, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Bank of Montreal said on Monday it will buy BNP Paribas' unit, Bank of the West, for $16.3 billion in its biggest deal ever.
TD, Canada's second-largest bank by market value, had looked at every major asset portfolio that came up for sale, including the U.S. businesses sold by Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) in September and BBVA (MC:BBVA) in November 2020, the sources said.
It remains on the hunt for acquisitions in the United States after its narrow loss to BMO.
TD and BMO spokespersons did not comment on the bidding process or future growth plans in the United States. MUFG declined comment on the Canadian banks' interest in their assets and BBVA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
""Banking is a scale, technology and sophistication game,"" said Brian Madden, portfolio manager at Goodreid Investment Counsel.
He added that Canadian banks already in the United States are well placed to scale up their U.S. operations since they ""happen to be directly adjacent to the largest banking market on the planet.""
TD executives said earlier this year that the bank ""will not be shy"" to do a bank deal in the U.S. Southeast or in any area where it currently has operations, primarily on the East Coast.
Having missed out on some big acquisitions, TD is now likely to turn its attention to smaller banks, one of the sources said.
Along with TD and BMO, Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), Bank of Nova Scotia and National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) round out Canada's Big Six banks.
TD is one of the top 10 banks in the United States, and Royal Bank owns City National, the ninth-largest bank in California by deposits.
Royal Bank has also been undergoing U.S. expansion, although Canada's biggest lender is more focused on its wealth management https://www.reuters.com/article/us-rbc-wealth-idUSKBN25U1I6 business in the United States. 
And CIBC, which entered the United States in 2017 with its acquisition of PrivateBancorp, has said it is aiming for increased earnings from the country in the coming years. 
Royal Bank did not respond to a request for comment. CIBC declined to comment.
BMO'S CHASE
BMO had pursued BancWest after losing out on the U.S. retail business of MUFG, Japan's biggest lender, one of the sources said. MUFG ended up selling its U.S. retail business to U.S. Bancorp for $8 billion. 
BMO made a competitive bid for MUFG's assets, and its disappointment at losing out propelled Canada's fourth-largest bank to move fast on the BancWest sale, the source said.
BNP Paribas, advised by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), entered parallel discussions with both TD and BMO, raising pressure on both bidders to finalise their offers as it fretted that regulatory headwinds could hamper the sale, the sources said.
BNP Paribas did not respond to a request for comment.
While TD initially made a low bid and subsequently raised it, BMO was more aggressive with its first proposal and was quick at declaring its offer ""best and final"" in December after offering a final sweetener, one of the sources said.
The deal will make BMO the 16th biggest bank by assets in the United States, up from 19th now, and lifts its assets to nearly $300 billion.

By merging with U.S. rivals, Canadian banks with an existing U.S. presence are expected to extract better returns from these businesses than smaller players, even when they appear to pay a premium as BMO did for BancWest, said Anthony Visano, portfolio manager at Kingwest & Co.
""Sometimes the strategic value trumps the financial consideration,"" Goodreid Investment's Madden said.

332,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 23, 2021 02:19PM ET</span>",Wall Street Trades Higher Entering Christmas Weekend; Dow up 245 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets traded mostly higher in quiet trading on Thursday, shrugging off a mixed set of economic data and winding down ahead of the Christmas holiday period. 
At 2:15 PM ET (1915 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 245 points, or 0.7% at 36,000 points, while the S&P 500 was up 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1%. 
All three indices added to sharp gains made on Wednesday, amid a growing body of scientific evidence that the latest dominant strain of the Covid-19 virus may be significantly less dangerous than previous strains. Data from the U.K., Denmark and South Africa in the last 48 hours have all shown a reduced risk of serious illness from the so-called Omicron stream. 
Earlier, the latest economic data from the U.S. showed a modest slowdown in personal spending in November, which grew only 0.6% on the month. That's still a decent clip but is clearly down from earlier in the year, and analysts said it added to evidence suggesting that the consumer boom fueled by stimulus payments over the first 18 months of the pandemic is slowing. 
The trend was also reflected in a 0.1% drop in core durable goods in November, stripping out defense- and aviation-related orders, which tend to be more volatile. 
In more encouraging news, initial jobless claims continued to bounce along at a historically low 205,000 last week, indicating no softening of conditions in the labor market despite the latest increase in Covid-19 cases across the U.S. 
Core prices for personal consumer expenditures, meanwhile, again showed why the Federal Reserve is pivoting faster to a tighter monetary policy stance. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation rose by 0.5% on the month, more than the 0.4% expected, and October's data were also revised up to show a 0.5% gain. That brought the annual rate of PCE inflation to 4.7%, up from 4.2% in October. The benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield touched 1.50% for the first time in 10 days in response.
There were few individual stock moves of note. Among the biggest was Chinese e-commerce giant JD (NASDAQ:JD).com ADRs, which fell 9.9% after long-term backer Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) said it will distribute almost all of its stake in the company, saying it was strong enough to stand on its own two feet. The move comes after months of increased scrutiny of China's Internet giants by Beijing's antitrust authorities, which has slashed tens of billions of dollars off their market value.  Tencent ADRs rose 4.2% but are still down some 40% from their July peak.
Quidel Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) shares took a 17% dip after the test maker announced an acquisition of Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, as the market seems concerned about the cost. Shoe manufacturer  Crocs  Inc (NASDAQ:CROX) took a similar hit, dropping 14% on news of the acquisition of Heydude, with similar concerns over the price and the dilution involved.
Avocado producer Mission Produce (NASDAQ:AVO) also fell 9.9% after a disappointing quarterly update dominated by supply bottlenecks that led to spoiled shipments and lower margins. 
Covid vaccine makers sold off, with  Novavax  Inc (NASDAQ:NVAX) leading the way with a 5% drop despite reporting that a two-dose regimen of their vaccine demonstrated ""strong immune responses"" against omicron and other Covid-19 variants. 
Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) led the semiconductor sector higher, as the memory chip maker approached all-time highs as investors continue to digest the company's strong earnings report from Monday. Micron was up nearly 5% while the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) was up 1.4%.
Crude Oil WTI Futures traded up nearly 1% and is poised to finish the week up 4%, rebounding from Omicron related fears last week.

Investing.com - Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) traded up 4.75% on Wednesday, nearing both its 52-week and all-time highs, as the market continued to relish the company's strong earnings report from Monday.
Micron shares traded hands at $94.65/share in Wednesday action, just shy of the $96.94 52-week high and Micron's all-time high of $97.50 from July 2000.
Micron's earnings report saw them beat on both revenue and EPS both for their Fiscal year Q1 and for their guidance to the next quarter. It led to a spate of price target increases and a couple upgrades, from Bank of America and Summit Insights. Goldman Sachs' analyst wrote, ""We expect healthy DRAM/NAND content growth across the major applications as well as supportive supply-side dynamics (i.e. disciplined industry capex, equipment constraints, more marginal bit growth from technology transitions than in the past) to drive a cyclical recovery in 2022.""
Guidance was the headline stealer, as Wedbush's analyst Matthew Bryson pointed out: ""Micron surprised us and the Street by providing robust guidance that suggests both Micron and the memory market are nearing a very shallow cyclical trough rather than the harsh wintery downturn some had projected.""
Micron is a popular value investor pick in the semiconductor space and often trades in rapidly cyclical fashion. With the pent-up demand and supply chain issues surrounding semiconductors more generally, the question of whether memory demand will sustain had weighed on shares, and the guidance and general Christmas-week quiet has allowed Micron to re-test its all-time heights.
The trading came amidst general semiconductor bullishness, with the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) up 1.3%, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) up 1.3%, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) up 1.1%, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) up 3%."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk, who has sold more than $15 billion worth of shares in the company since early November, said on Wednesday that he was ""almost done"" with his stock sales. 
The billionaire had made confusing statements as to whether he might or might not be done with his stated goal of selling 10% of his Tesla shares.
""I sold enough stock to get to around 10% plus the option exercise stuff and I tried to be extremely literal here,"" he said in an interview on Tuesday with conservative satirical website Babylon Bee.
But on Wednesday he suggested he might not be done. ""This assumes completion of the 10b sale,"" he tweeted, referring to his prearranged sales plan related to his options. 
""There are still a few tranches left, but almost done,"" he tweeted later.
Under the Rule 10b5-1 trading plan set up in September, he has exercised stock options that expire next year and sold a portion of the stocks to pay taxes, according to Tesla filings.
Following a flurry of sales, Musk still has about 1.5 million stock options that expire in August next year.
Tesla shares extended gains, rising more than 5% on Thursday after ending 7.5% higher the previous session. 
'LAND OF OVERTAXATION'
Musk said on Nov. 6 he would sell 10% of his stake if Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) users agreed. Tesla shares, which had hovered near record highs, lost about a quarter of their value soon after.
On Wednesday, Musk sold another 934,091 shares, bringing the total he has offloaded to 14.77 million - nearly 90% of the 17 million or so shares he had been expected to sell.
Asked whether he sold because of the Twitter poll, he said on Tuesday he needed to exercise stock options that expire next year ""no matter what."" He added he sold additional ""incremental stock"" to get near 10%.
Of the 14.77 million shares sold, 9.34 million were sold to pay taxes related to his options exercise, according to Tesla's securities filings. 
Musk, who moved the company's headquarters from California to Texas earlier this month, also criticized California for ""overtaxation"" and ""overregulation"" in Tuesday's interview.
""California used to be the land of opportunity and now it is ... becoming more so the land of sort of overregulation, overlitigation, overtaxation,"" he said, adding it was ""increasingly difficult to get things done"" in California. 
On Sunday, he said he would pay more than $11 billion in taxes this year. He has said his personal tax rate tops 50%, which would include federal and state income taxes. Musk said last year he had relocated from California to Texas where he faces no state income tax. 

Musk also said the ""metaverse,"" which describes shared virtual environments, is not compelling, adding that playing video games with goggles can cause motion sickness. ""Sure, you can put a TV on your nose.""
""I think we're far from disappearing into the metaverse. This sounds just kind of buzzword-y.""

A deal of this size would secure Italy about 10% of the 80 billion euros the U.S. company is looking to spend over the next decade in Europe on cutting-edge manufacturing capacity to help avoid future shortages of semiconductor chips.
Sources had previously told Reuters that the investment size was in a 4 billion to 8 billion euro range.
As part of this plan Germany, the European Union's largest economy, is in the lead to land  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)'s planned European 'megafab' plant, although France remains in the running, Reuters reported in October.
Intel said it is ""having constructive investment conversations with government leaders in multiple EU countries"" but declined to comment specifically on talks with Italian officials.
""We are encouraged by the many possibilities to support the EU’s digital agenda and 2030 semiconductor ambitions. While current negotiations are ongoing and confidential, we plan to make an announcement as soon as possible,"" the company said in a statement.
Chipmakers are scrambling to boost output after explosive demand for consumer electronics such as smartphones and computers resulting from the work-from-home trend during the COVID-19 pandemic led.
Meanwhile EU countries, where many jobs still rely on industries such as automobile manufacturing, are eager to reduce their dependence on semiconductor supplies from China and the United States after recent supply chain problems.
The proposed Italian factory would be an advanced packaging plant using innovative technologies to weave full chips.
Intel and the Italian government of Prime Minister Mario Draghi are discussing an overall investment of $9 billion over 10 years from when construction begins, the sources said.
Negotiations are complex and Rome wants Intel to clarify its plans for Italy before formalising a package of favourable conditions, especially on jobs and energy costs, they added.
If Rome and Intel clinch a deal, they will then proceed with the choice of a site for the plant, the sources said.
However its Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger earlier this month said he hoped to announce the locations of new chip plants in the United States and Europe early next year.

In April, the Italian government used anti-takeover legislation to block a planned sale of a controlling stake in a local semiconductor equipment maker to China's Shenzhen Invenland Holdings Co Ltd.

Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ:LAZR) announced the upsizing and completion of their convertible notes offering, which they plan to use for an increased share buyback program.
The company, which is developing lidar-based self driving software and sensors, announced the deal for 1.25% convertible notes was fully subscribed including an upsizing for $625M in gross proceeds. Luminar had previously estimated that this would lead to $608M in net proceeds.

Investing.com – Shares of vaccine-makers traded lower Thursday as the threat from omicron wanes and competition gets more intense.
 Novavax  stock (NASDAQ:NVAX) dropped 3.1% while  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) all traded down 1.5-2%. AstraZeneca ADRs (NASDAQ:AZN) were trading weaker by just under 1%.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), which is now a distant player in Covid management, was up 0.2%. Contribution of Covid-vaccine sales in the consumer giant’s overall revenue is negligible.
Omicron kept the world on tenterhooks last two months as the variant spread at least twice as fast as delta, the coronavirus mutant that ravaged the world April-September. In no time did it cover more than 80 countries, with nations that had a healthy pace of vaccinations, reporting record number of new cases. Fresh Covid cases in U.K. numbered more than 90,000 last week on some days.
However, it didn’t reflect in increased hospitalizations and latest studies suggest it may not be as deadly as delta, leading to subdued sentiment for stocks of vaccine-makers.
To add to that, the USFDA has approved anti-Covid pills made by Pfizer and Merck. While being no substitute, hope for any sort of medication other than vaccines, particularly among those still hesitant to get a shot, was also adding to the pressure on the stocks. Merck (NYSE:MRK) traded 0.4% lower in the session underway today.
With Novavax getting approved by the European drugs regulator and the WHO earlier this week, prospects of another vaccine compounded the negative sentiment for these stocks. Novavax reported today that a two-dose regimen of their vaccine offers strong protection against omicron and other Covid variants."

However, an increase in manufacturing activity and increased export demand are flashing, positive indicators of the chemical industry’s revival. Therefore, we think one could now consider adding top chemical stocks LyondellBasell (LYB),  Westlake Chemical  (NYSE:WLK),  Huntsman  (NYSE:HUN), and The Chemours (CC) to one’s portfolio. So, let’s examine these names.The chemical industry was hard hit by last year’s COVID-19 pandemic-fueled disruptions. However, the American Chemistry Council (ACC) reported that U.S. chemical production expanded in 2021, thanks to a post-lockdown spending surge that boosted demand for chemicals and other goods and materials.
With diverse uses for chemicals—ranging from assisting in the preservation and flavoring of foods to the production of soaps and increasing chemical usage in the automotive and construction industries—the industry is expected to grow substantially in the coming months. U.S. chemical volumes are expected to grow 3.2%. And capital spending in the chemistry industry is expected to rise by 3.1% in 2022.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally strong chemical stocks  LyondellBasell Industries  N.V. (NYSE:LYB), Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK), Huntsman Corporation (HUN), and The Chemours Company (NYSE:CC).

Investing.com – Casino stocks were gainers Thursday after issue of a consultation paper in Beijing rekindled hopes that they might be able to pursue their business in Macau.
While the paper hints at tighter regulations, hopes of business continuity with clear rules were propping up the shares. Current licenses for operating in the region, known as Asia’s Las Vegas, expire in June next year.
Melco Resorts stock (NASDAQ:MLCO) surged 6% while those of Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) and  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) were up 2.7% and 2.8% respectively. Studio City shares (NYSE:MSC) were only up .3% as of this writing.
The consultation paper came upon the conclusion of a 45-day forum held in the Chinese capital to address regulatory oversight, gambling license limitations and employee welfare. The paper carries comments from officials and a report by the Chinese government on promoting a sustainable and healthy gaming industry.
 Morgan Stanley released a note in response to the news saying it expects status quo with six licenses in Macau with a validity of 10 to 20 years, dividend issuance still allowed, and taxes to be unchanged. ""Yet, there will be increased oversight on operation and investment in non-gaming could be return dilutive,"" the note said.
Macau lies off Hong Kong and is part of China. Local authorities have earlier called for tighter supervision of casino operators and higher local ownership in gaming companies operating in the region.
China has been clamping down on high-stakes betting in Macau which takes place in convertible Hong Kong dollars. It is believed the gambling trades enable illicit outflow of currency and money-laundering efforts.
In the last year year, the Chinese government, in an attempt to develop a model state and cleanse the society of aspects it considers harmful to society, has capped the number of hours children can spend on online games and tightened ways the country’s tech companies can use consumer data, among other changes.

(Reuters) -European shares hit a one-month high on Thursday, led by gains in banking stocks as signs the impact of the Omicron variant may be less severe than feared led to improved risk appetite that pushed eurozone and Treasury yields higher.
The pan-European STOXX 600 gained 1%, marking the third straight session of gains, boosted by banks and travel stocks, tracking a global share rally that was also helped by robust U.S. economic data. [MKTS/GLOB]
Two vaccine makers said their shots protected against Omicron as UK data suggested it may cause proportionally fewer hospital cases than the Delta coronavirus variant, though public health experts warned the battle against COVID-19 was far from over.
Researchers from University of Edinburgh and Imperial College London reported evidence that the Omicron variant was less severe than the Delta coronavirus variant. 
""The Omicron wave won't derail the economic recovery that's well underway, it might delay it, but 2022 will have an attractive, healthy economic environment,"" said Philip Petursson, chief investment strategist at IG Wealth Management.
European government bond yields rose for the fourth consecutive session and benchmark U.S. Treasury yields rose to two-week highs as the trickle of risk sentiment back into the market reduced the need for safe-haven debt, helping push bank stocks higher. 
The STOXX 600 is set to gain around 21% this year, mildly underperforming a 26% gain in the S&P 500 and is a mere 1.5% away from its record highs. 
""This year, economies reopened from 2020 lockdowns and benefited from all the fiscal stimulus. 2022 will be the path to normalisation of equity returns, interest rates and economic growth,"" Petursson said.
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) added to the positive sentiment after the drugmaker said a three-dose course of its COVID-19 vaccine was effective against the Omicron variant, citing data from an Oxford University lab study.
Swiss building materials company  Holcim  (SIX:HOLN) gained 1.9% after saying it would buy Malarkey Roofing Products for $1.35 billion to expand into the growing U.S. residential roofing market.

LONDON (Reuters) - Facebook-owner Meta is appealing Britain's ruling that it must sell animated images platform Giphy, saying the evidence does not support the finding that the deal is a threat to its rivals or could impact competition in display advertising.
Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) ordered Meta to sell Giphy, which it acquired for a reported $400 million in May 2020, last month after it decided the remedies offered by the U.S. company did not answer its concerns.
It was the first time the British regulator had blocked a major digital acquisition, and it signalled a step change in its scrutiny of ""big tech"" companies.
""We are appealing the CMA's Giphy decision and will seek a stay of the CMA's order to divest,"" a Meta spokesperson said on Thursday. 
""The decision to block the deal is wrong on the law and the facts, and the evidence does not support the CMA's conclusions or remedy.""
Half of traffic to Giphy's huge library of looping videos comes from Meta's platforms Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram and WhatsApp.
Its GIFs are also popular with users of TikTok, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Snapchat, and the CMA was concerned Meta could limit access or force rivals to provide more user data.
Meta said it would not change the terms of access for competitors, nor collect addition data from the use of GIFs, which have no online tracking mechanisms such as pixels or cookies.
The CMA rejected the remedy, which Meta offered to make legally binding, in part because it would require ongoing monitoring.

The regulator was also concerned Meta had closed down Giphy's fledgling advertising business, removing a potential source of competition. 
Meta said Giphy's advertising business was unsuccessful, and if it had the potential to become a major competitor its model could be replicated by any other GIF provider. It argues the deal did not, therefore, meet the threshold of a ""substantial lessoning of competition"" needed for the CMA to block it.

Investing.com - Mexican airport operator Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte SAB de CV (NASDAQ:OMAB) announced the approval of a special dividend meeting at their shareholder meeting yesterday. The approval is for a dividend of up to 4,370 million Pesos, or Ps 11.20/share, the equivalent to about $4.30/share for the ADRs that trade in the U.S. This compares to a share price of $52.84/share in the U.S. and Ps 136.50 in Mexico (Grupo Aeroportuario Del CentroNorte (MX:OMAB)).
“Our cash position and our strong cash generation, which is the result of a continued improvement in our passenger traffic levels, as well as the strong performance in our non-aeronautical activities; and the solid balance sheet, reinforce our positive perspectives for the Company going forward, and we believe we can add more value to our shareholders through this special dividend distribution”, said Ricardo Dueñas, OMA’s Chief Executive Officer.
The board of directors will decide ultimately on the date and specifics of the payment, though the press release points out that a payment of the full Ps 11.20/share would lead to a 12.2% trailing 12 months yield at Tuesday's closing price.
This comes as travel stocks remain in watch with the cross-currents of reopening and restrictions related to Omicron. Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte has yet to recover to 2019 passenger levels, though as per the decision and the press release, they appear confident in their position. The press release stated that the company believes, ""that the special dividend will allow the Company to 1) reduce its cost of capital, 2) provide a more adequate return on capital, as measured by net income divided by shareholders’ equity, 3) achieve a more efficient capital structure, and 4) continue to provide adequate returns to shareholders.""
OMAB ADR Shares are up 1.3%, while peers  Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico  SAB De CV ADR (NYSE:PAC) are down .1% and Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste SAB de CV ADR (NYSE:ASR) is flat."

Futures fell as much as 9.5% on the New York Mercantile Exchange Thursday, the most since early December. Unseasonably high temperatures are expected on the East Coast and southern U.S. through next week, dampening demand for the heating and power-plant fuel. Trading has thinned heading into the U.S. holiday weekend, raising the likelihood of sudden swings in the future market.
“A weak spot market sliding into record warmth over the long holiday weekend may add to difficulties stemming the bleeding,” EBW Analytics said in a note to clients.
Thursday’s sell-off comes after gas prices in Europe plunged 20% on expectations that a flotilla of liquefied natural gas cargoes en route from the U.S. will help to ease an energy crisis that has driven futures to record highs and shut factories. U.S. LNG export facilities have been operating at or above capacity in recent weeks and 30 tankers carrying nearly 5 million cubic meters of the fuel combined are crossing the Atlantic.
Anemic declines to U.S. gas inventories at the start of winter has underscored the market’s expectations for higher-than-normal temperatures. Utility companies and other customers drew just 55 billion cubic feet of natural gas from winter storage last week, in-line with analyst expectations but less than half the 5-year average demand for that time of year, a report released Thursday shows. 
Natural gas futures traded 6.5% lower at 10:49 a.m. in New York.

358,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2021 10:52AM ET</span>","AstraZeneca vaccine booster works against Omicron, Oxford lab study finds","By Pushkala Aripaka
(Reuters) - A three-dose course of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine is effective against the rapidly-spreading Omicron coronavirus variant, the pharmaceutical company said on Thursday, citing data from an Oxford University lab study.
Findings from the study, yet to be published in a peer-reviewed medical journal, match those from rivals Pfizer-BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) which have also found a third dose of their shots works against Omicron. 
The study on AstraZeneca's vaccine, Vaxzevria, showed that after a three-dose course of the vaccine, neutralising levels against Omicron were broadly similar to those against the virus's Delta variant after two doses.
The London-listed company said researchers at Oxford University who carried out the study were independent from those who worked on the vaccine with AstraZeneca. 
""As we better understand Omicron, we believe we will find that T-cell response provides durable protection against severe disease and hospitalisations,"" Mene Pangalos, the head of AstraZeneca's biopharmaceuticals R&D said, referring to a critical component of the immune system that respond to fight infection.
Antibody levels against Omicron after the booster shot were higher than antibodies in people who had been infected with and recovered naturally from COVID-19, the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker added.
Although the early data is positive for the company, AstraZeneca said on Tuesday it was working with its partner Oxford University to produce a vaccine tailored for Omicron, joining similar efforts from other vaccine-makers. 
The Oxford study analysed blood samples from those infected with COVID-19, those vaccinated with two doses and a booster, and those previously infected with other variants of concern. It included samples from 41 people given three doses of Vaxzevria.

Scientists and governments are scrambling to bolster defences against Omicron with shots and therapies, as the variant threatens to become dominant globally and has prompted renewed curbs ahead of the holidays to contain infections.
Britain earlier this month backed the use of boosters after it found that a third dose significantly restored protection against mild disease caused by Omicron, in part reversing an otherwise steep drop in vaccine effectiveness.

2021 may have marked a true turning point in markets, as covid lingered but took a back seat to the threat of inflation in investors' minds, crypto resurged, meme stocks were a thing, and stocks continued to go up. 2022 could thus mark a new market era: inflation, Central Bank tightening, renewed capital investment, wage pressure, and so on. 
To prepare for the year ahead, we’ve assembled Investing.com’s global team of journalists and writers to give you a global take on what’s to come. Over the holiday period, we’ll publish outlooks from our team about the markets across the board - from currencies to stocks, cryptos to commodities, Europe to Asia to the Americas, and beyond. Our aim is to give you a broad perspective on how 2021 wrapped up and where that leaves traders and investors entering 2022, whether it’s a new market regime or more of the same. Check out our full series here.
Investing.com - 2021 was a monumental year for Chinese stocks trading in the U.S., in ways both good and bad. On the one hand, Chinese companies set a record for number of IPOs in the U.S. On the other hand, challenges in those IPO processes and regulatory conditions led to a large sell-off in China and Hong Kong indices and to some of these stocks setting multi-year lows. As we enter 2022, is there reason to expect a change?
The so-called “China Concept Stocks” is a collective term for all Chinese stocks listed overseas.
In the 1990s, Chinese companies began to experiment listing in the U.S. Shanghai Petrochemical (Sinopec (NYSE:SHI)) became the first Chinese state-owned enterprise to be officially listed and traded on the NYSE as a pilot company, in July 1993.
Over the last 20 years of China's economic growth, the ""China concept"" has changed from a gimmick to a profitable investment. Many Chinese companies have gone public in the U.S. and risen significantly in valuation.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), currently the largest Chinese company on the U.S. stock market, was valued at $21.8 billion when it went public in 2014, and at one point reached a value of more than $860 billion, or 40 times growth.
The presence of Chinese stocks in the U.S. has expanded rapidly over the past 15 years. In 2005, only 36 Chinese companies were listed in the U.S., with a total market value of about $260 billion between them, accounting for just 1% of the total market value of U.S. stocks. By the end of 2020, there were more than 600 Chinese companies listed in the U.S., with a market capitalization of about $6 trillion, accounting for nearly 9% of the total.
In 2021, with the tailwind of promising data from the pandemic recovery, as well as U.S. market buoyancy, the number of Chinese companies IPOing in the U.S. exploded. Refinitiv data reported 34 U.S. IPOs by Chinese companies in the first half of the year alone, well above previous records.
But as 2021 wore on, the market climate suddenly changed. The NASDAQ Golden Dragon China Index reached a record high of 20,893.02 in February, and then reached as low as 8275, a drop of 60%. Alibaba fell 58% from highs, Didi Global Inc ADR (NYSE:DIDI) fell 64%,  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) fell 73%, and these are just examples. Many Chinese stocks fell by more than 90%. No one expected that the thriving Chinese stocks would so quickly flip from desired goods to unholdable assets that had to go on fire sale prices, costing investors a great deal of money.
There was a series of events that led to 2021’s tumultuous trading.
One negative after another smashed Chinese stocks and dumbfounded investors throughout 2021. This rolling sell-off contrasted sharply with the Nasdaq Composite Index, which was up 16.2% year to date as of December 20th. The difference was day and night.
So where do Chinese stocks go from here? Here are three possible scenarios.
Companies must always be prepared for the worst, which in this case means considering a Hong Kong listing. Although the U.S. Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act still has a three-year window (ending in 2025), if the market is still tight next year, we can't rule out the possibility of a large number of Chinese stocks going to Hong Kong for a second listing.
CITIC Securities believes that the tightening of overseas regulations, coupled with the gradual liberalization of Hong Kong stock market listing rules and index inclusion, will accelerate the return of Chinese leaders eligible for listing on the Hong Kong stock market. The secondary listing in Hong Kong only needs to meet the regulatory requirements of both markets, and the return of eligible Chinese stocks to Hong Kong for secondary listing will become mainstream.
For companies that do not meet the requirements for secondary listing in Hong Kong, the likely alternative is the risk of privatization and delisting before 2025. Due to the large scale of capital consumed to buy out public shareholders, high compliance costs, and the difficulty of dismantling public shareholder structures, this is less likely to be a popular choice.
In fact, many foresighted Chinese stocks have already planned the back way early. In 2021 alone, star Chinese stocks such as Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI), Trip.com (NASDAQ:TCOM), Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI), Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV), and Autohome (NYSE:ATHM) have gone to Hong Kong for secondary listings.
There are diverse opinions on the impact of this inflow of companies to Hong Kong. Some believe this will put pressure on the liquidity of the Hong Kong capital market, being far smaller than that of the United States. As of December, the total market capitalization of Chinese stocks is about US$1 trillion, and there are 31 ADRs of large blue chips in the Hong Kong market traded in the U.S., including Tencent Holdings Ltd ADR (OTC:TCEHY), financial real estate stocks, and Hong Kong-owned utility stocks. Their return will generate financing demand on a large scale, creating a strong bloodletting effect, straining the Hong Kong market. Hong Kong stocks already struggled in 2021 and will hardly be able to withstand another big tumble.
But the benefits of big names relisting in Hong Kong are also obvious. Hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars will flow back to Hong Kong, which will inevitably strengthen Hong Kong's position as Asia's financial center. Some people also believe that the best quality Chinese stocks are not afraid of turbulence, because whether they list a Hong Kong ADR or not does not affect their prospects.
With the launch of the Science and Technology Innovation Board and GEM registration system pilot, Chinese stocks can also choose the channel of direct stock issuance to list in domestic A-shares.
Yuekai Securities believes that due to the scarcity of hard technology targets in the A-share market, the returned Chinese stocks will obtain a higher valuation premium, which will drive up the market value and liquidity of the stocks. This could have a positive feedback loop as local investors bid up the newly (re)listed companies, which would be a key to promote the return of Chinese shares to A-shares in the future.
Under the influence of tightening regulation, increasing anti-monopoly investigation and increasing policy measures, Chinese stocks suffered through 2021.
Shanghai Securities believes that as it has been nearly a year since the first mention of anti-monopoly by the government, and that the policy’s starting point is to promote and benefit industry rather than wipe out leaders, the market will gradually rationalize and responses to regulatory policies will slow, leading to a bottom for the Internet industry, especially the Hong Kong Internet companies. There are parallels to regulation on U.S. internet leaders, where negative effects are often temporary and limited.
In the context of China's economic transformation and strong science and technology, the long-term positive trend of the Internet industry remains unchanged. As regulation normalizes, the market may move its focus back to the companies’ performance and potential quality.
As seen from the above timeline, the whole macro environment is dragging down Chinese stocks as much as anything else, distracting from their still-strong outlooks. As the bear market has overshot, there are many Chinese companies whose stocks are trading below potential value.
For example, Alibaba’s shares have hit a nearly 5-year low and are close to breaking a $100/share price, leaving shares really tempting. With a P/E Ratio of 17, an EV/S ratio of 2.5, and a market cap of just over $300 Billion, the internet giant may be attractive.
There were safe havens in the Chinese market. For example, electric car maker XPeng Inc. only dropped 8% while Li Auto is down only 2%, as its stock hasn’t fallen with the rest of the sector.
Luckin Coffee is another surprise story, gaining 17% in 2021 despite trading on the pink sheets, as investors have bought into its focus on optimizing cost control and focusing on the core business to shed the reputation of past fraud.
Then there is JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), which has fallen 17.32% in 2021, but has been in rebound mode from August to November before getting hit by year-end volatility and news of Tencent's offloading of shares.
This shows that there remains a bid for Chinese stocks and that investors' confidence in the remaining Chinese stocks has not been completely lost.
In fact, global investors have already bought into what might be the bottom. Warren Buffett's partner Charlie Munger, High Tide Capital, and Bridgewater Associates have increased their holdings of Alibaba; capital giants George Soros and Duan Yongping have increased their holdings of Pinduoduo, and Perseverance Asset Management and Greenwood Assets have increased their holdings of Kanzhun Ltd ADR (NASDAQ:BZ) and  Ke Holdings Inc  (NYSE:BEKE).
ETF flows are also growing. Take the Efund China Overseas Net 50 Fund (SS:513050) as an example: it has received net subscriptions every month since 2021, allowing it to buy as prices fall, with a combined net subscription share of 20.998 billion shares as of December.
The ideal scenario would be for the U.S. and China to get back on track economically and in trade relations. That and the end of the pandemic could provide meaningful tailwinds for Chinese companies which are trading at depressed valuations. A rosier macro environment and Chinese stocks can sweep away the gloom of 2021 and shine in 2022. If that environment doesn’t emerge, investors may need to keep an eye on the Hong Kong and A-Share markets instead.

Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to avoid brick-and-mortar stocks Dollar General (DG), Tractor Supply (TSCO), and Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE). Read on.Cases of COVID-19 infections are on the rise again. European countries were the first to bear the brunt as countries like Netherlands and Austria imposed lockdowns. Meanwhile, in South Africa, reports of a new variant made headlines because it was believed to be more transmissible and infectious than the Delta variant. The WHO named the new variant, omicron, a variant of concern on November 26, 2021.
The omicron variant has been detected in more than 89 countries. And according to the WHO, cases are doubling every 1.5 to 3 days with community transmission. A minor breakthrough has been made in gauging the severity of the variant. But it is still unclear whether current vaccines are entirely effective against it. The WHO has warned that with cases rising so rapidly, hospitals may soon be overwhelmed in some places. Although President Joe Biden made it clear that full lockdowns are out of the question, the fear of partial restrictions remains.
As omicron variant cases surge, it could lead to lower foot traffic at brick-and-mortar retail stores.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group Inc (MUFG) will launch a new $300 million fund to offer debt financing to late-stage tech startups in the Asia-Pacific region, its chief executive said, as Japan's largest lender seeks to tap opportunities in growing economies.
The move comes amid a fundraising frenzy in Asia as the number of unicorns, or privately held startups with a valuation of more than $1 billion, has swelled.
The new debt fund will be created early next year through Mars Growth Capital, a Singapore-based joint venture between MUFG and Israeli financial tech firm Liquidity Capital, Hironori Kamezawa told Reuters in an interview.
MUFG will make a $300 million capital commitment to Mars, which will provide debt financing to startups in later stages of growth including unicorns.
If the investee firms eventually choose to go public, MUFG plans to support their initial public offerings with its U.S. alliance partner  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Kamezawa said.
The fund's financing decisions will be based on Liquidity Capital's artificial intelligence-driven credit scoring model that forecasts future earnings and cash flow of a startup from real-time financial and accounting data.
""We've seen immense needs from startups for debt financing"" as a way to raise funds without reducing existing shareholders' ownership, Kamezawa said.

""It's usually difficult for us bankers to extend loans to those startups in the red, but the Israeli firm's credit scoring model has helped us out,"" he added.
It will be Mars Growth Capital's second debt fund. The first fund, set up last year, is focused on early-stage startups and currently has a $200 million capital commitment. Mars Growth Capital has so far clinched financing deals with 11 companies, according to MUFG.

Recently, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated plans to tighten the central bank’s monetary policy to combat rising inflation. Powell, who had stated that inflation is “transitory,” told U.S. lawmakers that “it’s probably a good time to retire that word.” However, analysts warn that raising interest rates up may lead to an economic slowdown. “The Fed’s new policy is highly nonlinear, creating a dangerous endgame,” Mark Cabana, Bank of America’s head of U.S. rates strategy, said in a note. So, the uncertainty tied to the policy changes could hinder LC’s near-term prospects.

Third Point Investors Limited (TPIL), a closed-ended fund managed by Third Point, has been under fire from Asset Value Investors (AVI) and three other shareholders who collectively own more than 10% of the voting rights in the fund and say it is underperforming.
Steve Bates, a former JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) banker who has been the chairman of TPIL for three years, announced his resignation on Thursday, saying he had ""recently been put in a position where it is impossible for me to continue as a director of TPIL"".
TPIL said in a statement that Bates had suffered personal threats at one of the meetings the board had arranged with representatives of AVI and separately with Staude Capital, another of the activists. TPIL did not say who made the threats.
Loeb said Bates' departure was a ""loss for all shareholders"" and ""the behavior by these so-called 'activists' is a stain on institutional investors who attempt to engage constructively with boards and management teams...These juvenile antics smack of desperation and inexperience.""
AVI said in a statement that it had supported the appointment of Bates, and that it was ""unfortunate that he has now chosen to resign"". 
AVI added that it was ""disappointing to see the continued misleading narratives being put out under the Board’s name"".

Staude Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Third Point is itself an activist investor, taking stakes in companies and seeking changes in order to boost their share price. It recently took a stake in Shell (LON:RDSa), calling for a break-up of the oil major.

BOSTON (Reuters) - An Illinois board overseeing state employee pension funds on Wednesday voted to bar funds from holding Unilever (NYSE:UL) PLC shares due to sales limits by the company's Ben & Jerry's ice cream brand in Israel, joining at least five other U.S. states moving to restrict the stock.
A representative for the Illinois Investment Policy Board said it voted 7-0 at a meeting on Wednesday ""to add Unilever to its prohibited entity list,"" following similar moves by other states including New York and New Jersey.
An exact value of Unilever shares that state funds must now sell, if they own them, was not immediately available. Members of the board include representatives of Illinois teachers and university retirement systems and the Illinois State Board of Investment, who did not immediately respond to questions Wednesday evening.
Unilever representatives did not immediately respond to questions. 

Like other states Illinois law bars investments in companies that boycott Israel. Ben & Jerry's moved in July to end a license for its ice cream to be sold in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, saying sales there were ""inconsistent with its values."" Most countries consider Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land to be illegal. Israel disputes this.
Unilever had said the decision was made by Ben & Jerry's independent social mission board and said it does not support efforts to boycott or isolate Israel, where it employs nearly 2,000 people.

Investing.com – Mission Produce stock (NASDAQ:AVO) plunged more than 10% in Thursday’s premarket trading as the avocado producer’s fourth-quarter sales and earnings both fell short of estimates owing to multiple headwinds.
Total revenue was up 15% at $237 million as higher prices of the fruit outweighed the fall in volumes sold. The company blamed lower volumes on delayed start of the Mexican harvest season combined with the lingering effects of a smaller Californian crop. Cargoes from Peru partially offset the supply crunch but port congestion led to some late-season inventory being spoiled.
Upheavals in the supply chain and smaller average fruit size led to lower freight utilization, compressing gross margins by 4.8 percentage points to just over 14%. 
Expenses incurred on a new facility at Laredo in Texas also weighed on margins.
Selling, general and administrative expense fell owing to IPO-related expenses booked in the same period last year.
Adjusted net profit fell around 22% to $17 million because of higher cost of sales.
For the ongoing quarter, Mission Produce chose to give the industry outlook, according to which, volumes could be flat to slightly down on a year-on-year basis. Prices in the industry could go up by as much as 40% from a year ago, the company said.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said it resolved probes into Balfour Beatty (OTC:BAFYY) Communities, one of the U.S. military's largest private landlords, after it pleaded guilty on Wednesday to one count of major fraud and agreed to pay over $65 million in fines and restitution.
Balfour Beatty was being investigated for defrauding the U.S. Air Force, Army and Navy. A company spokesperson said on Thursday: “We have taken full responsibility and apologize to all our stakeholders.”
The company is a unit of British infrastructure conglomerate  Balfour Beatty Plc . 
In 2019, Reuters reports described https://reut.rs/3su5sAg how Balfour Beatty employees falsified maintenance documents at Air Force bases to help the company qualify for incentive fee payments, citing five former employees who said they falsified records, company emails and internal Air Force communications. Service members and their families were exposed to asbestos, vermin, mold and raw sewage.
The reports prompted https://reut.rs/3mqRDP0 an investigation by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and the Inspector General’s Defense Criminal Investigative Service.
U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan accepted the company's guilty plea on Wednesday and sentenced it to pay over $65 million, serve three years of probation, and engage an independent compliance monitor for a period of three years.
""Instead of promptly repairing housing for U.S. service members as required, Balfour Beatty Communities lied about the repairs to pocket millions of dollars in performance bonuses,"" said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. 

""This pervasive fraud was a consequence of Balfour Beatty Communities' broken corporate culture"".
Stacy Cabrera, a former housing manager at Texas’s Lackland Air Force Base who told Reuters she felt pressure to manipulate records to meet the bonus goals, pleaded guilty to major fraud in April. Rick Cunefare, a former Balfour Beatty regional manager who oversaw bases in Oklahoma, Texas and other states, pleaded guilty earlier this year to major fraud.

376,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2021 08:15AM ET</span>","Analysis-After another stunning U.S. stock market year, investors wonder how much gas is left","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market is set to deliver a three-peat of stellar annual returns, but chances of a similar performance in 2022 may be threatened by a more hawkish Federal Reserve, slowing earnings growth and a relentless pandemic. 
With a little over a week left in the year, the S&P 500 is on track for an 87% gain since the end of 2018, its best three-year performance in more than two decades. The benchmark index is up 25% so far in 2021 after double-digit returns in the prior two years. 
If history is any guide, next year’s gains may be less impressive, though not necessarily poor. 
The S&P 500 has notched three straight years of double-digit returns nine times since 1928, according to Jessica Rabe, co-founder of DataTrek Research. 
Gains in the year following such periods have on average been weaker, with the index averaging 8.4%, compared with its overall average total return of 11.6%, DataTrek found. Stocks rose in five of those nine years and fell in the other four. 
""The odds of this kind of positive momentum carrying into the next year is a coin toss,"" Rabe said in emailed comments to Reuters. ""But the S&P’s performance has historically proved asymmetric as positive returns have been much larger than negative returns in the fourth year.""
A Reuters poll of strategists earlier this month projected the S&P 500 would finish 2022 at 4,910, which is up 4.5% from Wednesday's close.
The Fed’s three projected interest rate hikes in 2022 - a more aggressive path than markets were expecting weeks ago - will be at the top of investors' minds, threatening to drive up bond yields and undercut comparatively risky assets such as stocks.
But the economic growth that is prompting the central bank to raise rates may help buoy equities as well. 
The S&P 500 has returned an average 7.7% in the first year the Fed raises rates, according to Deutsche Bank’s study of 13 hiking cycles since 1955. 
“We still see a decent environment for equity investors in 2022, although we don’t expect the types of gains that we have seen,” said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson, who is expecting mid-single-digit growth for the S&P 500 in 2022. 
Ragan prefers sectors that will particularly benefit from a solid economy, such as financials, industrials and materials, as well as companies that can pass along price increases during an inflationary environment.
“We think it is still a good overall GDP growth environment, should enable companies to still grow earnings, but we have concern about valuations,” Ragan said.
EARNINGS STRONG ENOUGH?
Rising bond yields, which tend to accompany higher rates, could pressure already-stretched stock valuations, as projected corporate cash flows will be discounted at higher rates in standard stock valuation models.
The S&P 500 trades at about 21 times forward 12-month earnings estimates, compared with its historic average of 15.5 times, according to Refinitiv Datastream. 
While strong earnings can still bolster the case for stocks, S&P 500 company profits are expected to grow by 8.3% next year, after a nearly 50% rebound in 2021, according to Refinitiv IBES.
""Earnings growth and revenue growth should be sufficient to drive stock markets higher, but the risk is if they disappoint,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
The earnings picture is also clouded by uncertainties over COVID-19, as the Omicron variant https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/how-worried-should-we-be-about-omicron-variant-2021-12-14 takes hold around the world. While investors doubt widespread U.S. government lockdowns related to the virus will return, consumers ""may spend more cautiously amid a renewed surge in Covid infections,"" according to a recent note by Oxford Economics, which projected consumer spending rising by 4.3% in 2022 following record growth of 8.1% this year.
Another wild card for investors will be the U.S. midterm elections in November, with control of Congress by President Joe Biden's Democratic Party seen as tenuous. 
Whether technology and growth stocks, which have led the U.S. market for much of the past decade, can maintain their strength also remains to be seen. For example, those stocks stand to be particularly sensitive to higher yields because their valuations depend more on future earnings.

Broader markets could be in trouble if mammoth growth stocks falter. Gains in six companies –  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Meta Platforms Inc, formerly Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) – accounted for about one-third of the S&P 500’s total return in 2021 as of Tuesday's close, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
“We may start to see an underperformance in tech and an outperformance in sectors that are under-appreciated,"" said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. ""By the nature and design of the S&P, you would probably get a lower market.""

Investing.com –  Crocs  stock (NASDAQ:CROX) traded 3% lower in Thursday’s premarket on concerns over how the company will fund its $2.5 billion acquisition of privately-owned Heydude.
To fund the $2.05 billion cash part of the deal, the company will take a $2 billion loan and also resort to a $50 million credit under an existing revolving facility with its bankers.
Additionally, it will issue $450 million shares of its own to Heydude founder and Chief Executive Officer Alessandro Rosano, leading to fears of a drop in earnings per share. Given Crocs had a market cap of $8.23 billion at the close Wednesday, the dilution is likely to be in excess of 5% of the equity.
Upon completion of the transaction, expected to happen by March, the casual footwear brand will operate as a standalone division of Crocs.
Crocs shares have more than doubled in the last year, a reflection of its comeback from a near bankruptcy a few years ago. The company expects to hit $5 billion in revenue by 2026. According to Bloomberg, analysts project current-year sales to be $2.27 billion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Canceled holiday parties, booster-shot recommendations and advisories to work from home are the new normal for Wall Street companies reacting to the fast-spreading Omicron COVID-19 variant ripping through New York and other financial centers.
With the fourth wave of the pandemic now in full force, financial firms are once again grappling with when they can realistically get back to business-as-usual, and how to communicate to staff and retain workers amid the uncertainty. 
""There is a great deal of squishiness around when the return to office is going to occur. They have had to reverse course so many times to the public, themselves and to staff,"" said Neal Mills, chief medical officer for the professional services firm Aon (NYSE:AON), who advises companies on return-to-work plans.
A number of Wall Street banks and investment firms, including Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Jefferies Financial Group have reversed their push to get staff back to the office as Omicron has spread https://www.reuters.com/world/us/omicron-fueled-covid-wave-crashes-into-new-york-days-before-christmas-2021-12-20 across the Northeast. 
New York City is being hit hard, with cases rising 60% last week. Breakthrough infections are also rising among the 61% of the country's fully vaccinated population.
Companies acknowledge that the safeguards they had been relying on to get workers back to the office, such as vaccinations, may not protect staff, Mills said. 
Employers are targeting February as the likely return-to-office date, but with the situation changing fast ""they are reluctant to do any communications"", he said. 
One financial firm executive said their return-to-office target date was largely ""arbitrary"" but that the company did not want to leave workers in the dark.
""People do a horrible job of communicating,"" said Adam Galinsky, a professor at Columbia Business School who advises companies on their back-to-office plans. Companies feel they cannot update staff until they have more information, he said. 
The financial industry has been among the most aggressive in getting back to business-as-usual. Among banks, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) led the charge to get workers back to offices after vaccines were rolled out. 
Goldman and JPMorgan had most workers back at offices on a rotational basis from the summer, while Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman had pushed for workers to return by September, although his stance has softened.
""U.S. banks were saying 'OK, everyone is back, and it's time to go and see clients in person'. That was the trendy thing in September, October,"" said a senior New York-based executive at a European bank with large U.S. operations. 
That aggressive stance has forced the industry to pivot quickly in recent weeks. Some executives have said the industry may have pushed too hard. 
""I thought we would be out of it by Labor day, past Labor day. We're not,"" Gorman told CNBC last week https://www.reuters.com/business/fidelity-pauses-return-to-office-cites-rising-covid-risk-2021-12-13. ""I think we will still be in it through most of next year. Everyone is still finding their way.""
'PEOPLE WILL QUIT'
Citigroup and Bank of America have told New York area staff to work remotely if possible for the time-being, while  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) delayed https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/wells-fargo-will-announce-new-plans-full-employee-return-new-year-statement-2021-12-21 its planned Jan. 10 office return.

Some banks, however, still have staff in the office.
Morgan Stanley has not told staff to work from home but is giving them the flexibility to do so. JPMorgan has sent home unvaccinated staff at its Manhattan offices and urged teams to review again who needs to be in the office. While Goldman Sachs canceled some holiday gatherings, it has not sent staff home.
A spokesperson for JPMorgan said the bank was monitoring the situation and would adjust accordingly. The other banks declined to comment. 
""The return to the workplace will not be a straight line,"" said Elisabeth Joyce, a vice president at  Gartner  (NYSE:IT) Research and Advisory. ""However, I anticipate organizations who are looking to mandate a return to the office will push timelines.""
She added that over the long term companies would stay the course in trying to get staff back into the workplace.
That is likely to cause retention issues. The senior New York-based executive said he believed hybrid working was ""here to stay"" and that banks had to figure out how to make remote working effective while reconnecting people physically. 

""Companies set their date for when people are coming back and every quarter it moves another quarter out,"" said Andy Challenger, senior vice president at executive-coaching firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas. 
""In the beginning it was because of the waves of COVID and the danger. Now (employers) are worried that they can’t ask people to come back because people will quit.""

Most major U.S. banks have had staff working in offices since the summer, but some are now choosing not to host holiday parties and others are strongly recommending staff to get booster shots. The following are the pandemic-related rules among Wall Street's biggest banks. 
For a FACTBOX on Canadian financial firms, click on
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)
The bank since late summer has been encouraging employees to get fully vaccinated and now to get their booster shots when eligible. It offers onsite clinics in several locations.
In December, the bank told New York City employees that they could work from home during the holidays and offered them free COVID-19 test kits.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)
Citigroup told employees at its New York City office on Wednesday they could work from home if they were able to through the holidays, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The bank has been requiring employees in the United States to be vaccinated but is not mandating boosters. It is providing rapid test kits and encouraging testing for employees going into the office, a source said earlier.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)
The German lender has made COVID-19 boosters available to staff at its new midtown headquarters in New York City since early November, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)
As infections flared up in August due to the spreading of the Delta variant, the Wall Street bank mandated vaccines for all staff and visitors entering its offices in the United States.
Staff in the United States must be tested onsite on a weekly basis. The bank is also providing access to boosters for those eligible, although boosters are not mandatory.
Goldman postponed its remaining holiday parties in New York due to COVID-19 concerns, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The bank had held holiday parties over the previous few weeks.
Jefferies 
The investment bank requires all staff who want to enter its offices to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and has said it will require boosters by Jan. 31, unless the person concerned is not yet eligible for the additional shot. The bank does not perform onsite testing.
Last week, following a spate of cases, the bank asked staff to work from home where possible and canceled all but essential travel.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)
The biggest U.S. bank, which has been one of the most aggressive in bringing employees back to the office, mandated face coverings for its U.S. employees in August, saying they would be required to wear masks in public indoor settings and in common areas regardless of vaccination status.
The bank in October said that it would restrict business travel for employees who are unvaccinated or have not disclosed their vaccination status. Such employees are required to get tested twice a week and contribute more of their pay toward medical insurance. It also mandated vaccines for new recruits in client-facing roles.
In December, JPMorgan instructed unvaccinated staff in Manhattan to work from home. It also relaxed mask requirements for vaccinated staff working in its Manhattan offices. And, it told managers that they should evaluate more often ""who should revert to working from home."" 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)
Morgan Stanley is asking employees, contractors and visitors to show proof of vaccination before entering its New York headquarters. The bank does not require additional COVID-19 testing for staff or visitors, a spokesperson said.
The bank expects staff who are not required to be in the office to take advantage of the ability to work from home and to spend more time with their families. But it is not sending staff home and does not have a work-from-home policy, a source familiar with the situation said.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co
The lender has said it strongly encourages employees to consider getting the COVID-19 vaccine but does not require it. The bank was providing all employees with four hours of paid leave to get the booster shot if eligible.
The bank also required employees to either document that they are fully vaccinated or get tested regularly.
Fidelity Investments

The company said it had paused its voluntary return-to-office plans in New England, citing a rising risk from the COVID-19 pandemic.

381,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2021 07:20AM ET</span>",Tencent hands shareholders $16.4 billion windfall in the form of JD.com stake,"By Sophie Yu and Scott Murdoch
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese gaming and social media company Tencent will pay out a $16.4 billion dividend by distributing most of its JD (NASDAQ:JD).com stake, weakening its ties to the e-commerce firm and raising questions about its plans for other holdings. 
The move comes as Beijing leads a broad regulatory crackdown on technology firms, taking aim at their overseas growth ambitions and domestic concentration of market power.
Tencent said on Thursday it will transfer HK$127.69 billion ($16.37 billion) worth of its JD.com stake to shareholders, slashing its holding in China's second-biggest e-commerce company to 2.3% from around 17% now and losing its spot as JD.com's biggest shareholder to Walmart (NYSE:WMT).
The owner of WeChat, which first invested in JD.com in 2014, said it was the right time for the divestment, given the e-commerce firm had reached a stage where it can self-finance its growth. 
Chinese regulators have this year blocked https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-antitrust-regulator-blocks-tencents-video-games-merger-2021-07-10 Tencent's proposed $5.3 billion merger of the country's top two videogame streaming sites, ordered it to end exclusive music copyright agreements and found WeChat illegally transferred user data.
The company is one of a handful of technology giants that dominate China's internet space and which have historically prevented rivals' links and services from being shared on their platforms.
""This seems to be a continuation of the concept of bringing down the walled gardens and increasing competition among the tech giants by weakening partnerships, exclusivity and other arrangements which weaken competitive pressures,"" Mio Kato, a LightStream Research analyst who publishes on Smartkarma said of the JD.com stake transfer.
""It could have implications for things like the payments market where Tencent's relationships with  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) and JD have helped it maintain some competitiveness with Alipay,"" he said.
JD.com shares plunged 11.2% at one point in Hong Kong trade on Thursday, the biggest daily percentage decline since its debut in the city in June 2020, before closing with a 7.0.% decline. Shares of Tencent, Asia's most valuable listed company, rose 4.2%. 
(GRAPHIC: Tencent and JD.com shares - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gkplglneqvb/image-1640231265000.png) 
The companies said they would continue to have a business relationship, including an ongoing strategic partnership agreement, though Tencent Executive Director and President Martin Lau will step down from JD.com's board immediately.
Eligible Tencent shareholders will be entitled to one share of JD.com for every 21 shares they hold. 
PORTFOLIO DIVESTMENTS?
The JD.com stake is part of Tencent's portfolio of listed investments valued at $185 billion as of Sept. 30, including stakes in e-commerce company Pinduoduo, food delivery firm Meituan, video platform Kuaishou, automaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and streaming service Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).
Alex Au, managing director at Hong Kong-based hedge fund manager Alphalex Capital Management, said the JD.com sale made both business and political sense.
""There might be other divestments on their way as Tencent heeds the antitrust call while shareholders ask to own those interests in minority stakes themselves,"" he said. 
A person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters Tencent has no plans to exit its other investments. When asked about Pinduoduo and Meituan, the person said they are not as well-developed as JD.com.
The Chinese internet giant has also invested in overseas companies such as Tesla, Netamble, Snapchat, Spotify and Sea. ""Going abroad is one of Tencent's most important strategies in the future,"" a CITIC Securities research note said on Thursday. ""The possibility of selling overseas high-quality technology and internet assets is small.""
Tencent chose to distribute the JD shares as a dividend rather than sell them on the market in an attempt to avoid a steep fall in JD.com's share price as well as a high tax bill, the person added.
Kenny Ng, an analyst at Everbright Sun Hung Kai, said the decision was ""definitely negative"" for JD.com. 
""Although Tencent's reduction of JD's holdings may not have much impact on JD's actual business, when the shares are transferred from Tencent to Tencent's shareholders, the chances of Tencent's shareholders selling JD's shares as dividends will increase,"" he said.
Technology investor Prosus (OTC:PROSF), which is Tencent's largest shareholder with a 29% stake and is controlled by Naspers of South Africa, will receive the biggest portion of JD.com shares.

Walmart owns a 9.3% stake in JD.com, according to the Chinese company. Payments processor Alipay is part of Tencent rival  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Thursday, with investors continuing to show optimism that the rapid growth of cases of the Omicron Covid variant won’t derail the country’s economic recovery.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 105 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 12 points, or 0.3%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 30 points, or 0.2%.
The major indices are all on course to end the week higher, despite Monday’s sharp selloff, after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed over 250 points, or 0.7%, higher Wednesday, the S&P 500 gained 1% to close within 1% of its record, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.2%.
This rebound follows a three-day losing streak, the worst such decline for the broad-based S&P 500 since September, on fears the swift emergence of Omicron as the dominant coronavirus variant would result in further mobility restrictions, damaging the economic recovery.
However, studies by both the University of Edinburgh and Imperial College London, released Wednesday, suggested the number of patients needing hospitalization with Omicron was sharply lower relative to Delta.
Additionally, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) stated earlier Thursday that three shots of its Covid-19 vaccine offered protection against the variant, citing data from an Oxford University lab study.
 Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) also said that its two-dose vaccine triggered an immune response to Omicron, just days after it became the fifth drug to be authorized for use in the European Union. It’s still awaiting U.S. approval.
That said, any gains are likely to be limited with the Omicron variant causing infections to double in 1.5 to 3 days, according to the World Health Organization, and trading relatively thin heading into the Christmas holiday.
U.S. consumer confidence improved more than expected in December despite the resurgence in Covid-19 infections, data showed Wednesday, adding to the general optimism. 
The data slate is full Thursday, including initial jobless claims, new home sales, durable goods orders, and the PCE price index. It also includes personal income and spending, as well as the University of Michigan consumer sentiment and expectations indexes. 
Turning to the corporate sector, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is likely to be in the spotlight following the decision of its largest shareholder, Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), to give up most of its stake in the China-based online retailer.
Oil prices gained slightly Thursday, adding to the previous session’s gains on the back of a sharp decline in U.S. crude stockpiles.
The Energy Information Administration reported late Wednesday that crude inventories declined 4.72 million barrels last week, the fourth consecutive weekly draw. This was even larger than the drop reported by the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday, with the industry body indicating that crude stocks fell by 3.67 million barrels.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $73.00 a barrel, closing Wednesday above $72 for the first time in two weeks, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $75.53. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,807.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.1325.

Investing.com – Ryanair  (IR:RYA) ADRs traded up 3.1% in premarket trading Thursday, despite the budget airline more than doubling its annual loss forecast, blaming recent travel restrictions brought on by European governments to tame the Omicron variant of Covid-19.
Both France and Germany have imposed bans on U.K. tourist arrivals in recent days, due to the surge in Omicron cases in Britain to levels far above previous records. Around one-third of Ryanair's flight movements involve the U.K.
The airline said its net loss for the year ending March 31 will fall between 250 million euro (around $282 million) and 450 million, much worse than the previous forecast of 100-200 million.
Ryanair said the new restrictions have “notably weakened close-in Christmas and New Year bookings” and those have led it to cut its planned January schedule capacity by 33%.
No cutbacks have yet been decided for February or March, the airline said, but its December traffic may now have to take a hit of at least 500,000 passengers.
Ryanair said it hopes to have more clarity, especially on the impact of Omicron on intra-Europe travel restrictions, in time for its quarterly results on January 31.
Despite its rise, the stock was still underperforming rivals such as BA owner IAG Group and Hungary-based Wizz Air (OTC:WZZZY).
IAG (LON:ICAG), EasyJet (LON:EZJ), Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ) were all up 3%-4%."

By Bansari Mayur Kamdar and Medha Singh
(Reuters) - Several companies, including Grab Holdings and BuzzFeed, that merged with shell entities to go public have seen their shares tumble, as investors pull the rug out from under the stocks hyped in Wall Street's frenzied blank-check deals this year.
Shares of BuzzFeed, which merged with blank-check firm 890 5th Avenue Partners, have plunged 40% since their debut on Dec. 6. The digital media firm raised a paltry $16 million out of $288 million in the SPAC's trust as 94% of its investors took their money back.
Grab Holdings, southeast Asia's biggest ride-hailing and delivery firm, has lost half its market capitalization since its Nasdaq debut on Dec. 2 following the company's record $40 billion merger with a blank-check firm.
""A lot of investors are now looking more toward companies that have proven track records, that have demonstrated history of delivering profit,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. ""The frenzy that has been driving some of the momentum in SPACs that we saw earlier in the year has clearly gone away.""
Special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC) are shell companies that raise money in an initial public offering (IPO) and put it in a trust for the purpose of merging with a private company and taking it public.
Since investors are unaware of the target company ahead of the IPO, SPACs often grant them the right to redeem their initial investment as an incentive to put their money in the trust.
The average redemption rate has more than doubled to 58% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, data from Dealogic showed, as many companies fall short of investors' lofty expectations. 
In the case of Zoom Video Communications-backed event management software company Cvent, nearly 85% of investors redeemed their shares for cash two days before its debut, its filing showed.
Vacation rental management company Vacasa received gross proceeds of about $340 million from its debut on Dec. 8, $145 million below its expectations due to redemption.
Vacasa's business is well capitalized through the SPAC deal as it retained greater than 50% of cash in the company's trust account, CFO Jamie Cohen told Reuters.
""SPACS got crazy in February and investors started looking at them like meme stocks. Then Lucid crashed and the SEC starting issuing negative comments and SPACs fell out of favor,"" said Matthew Tuttle, chief executive officer of Tuttle Capital Management LLC. 
U.S. regulators said last week they were considering toughening rules around how underwriters, boards of directors and sponsors of SPAC structure fees, issue projections and disclose conflicts.
SPACs are among the group that have seen a decline in retail investor participation, according to Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research
The De-SPAC index, which tracks the 25 largest companies to have completed a blank-check merger, is down around 43% so far this year after touching a record high in mid-February. 

Still, merging with blank-check firms remains a popular option, with 2021 being a record-breaking year as 604 SPACs raised $144 billion, Renaissance Capital disclosed in its annual review. However, 62% of the entire year's proceeds were raised in just the first quarter. 
Grab and BuzzFeed declined to comment, while Cvent did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

385,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2021 06:21AM ET</span>",Analysis-How 2021 became the year of ESG investing,"By Ross Kerber and Simon Jessop
BOSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Investors concerned about climate change and social justice had a bumper year in 2021, successfully pushing companies and regulators to make changes amid record inflows to funds focused on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues.
Extreme weather becoming more frequent and events highlighting social justice issues, such as the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, contributed to ESG rising to the top of the agenda of investors, companies and policy makers. 
A record $649 billion poured into ESG-focused funds worldwide through Nov. 30, up from the $542 billion and $285 billion that flowed into these funds in 2020 and 2019, respectively, the latest Refinitiv Lipper data shows. ESG funds now account for 10% of worldwide fund assets. 
Stocks of companies rated highly for their sustainability efforts also notched gains. The MSCI World ESG Leaders' index has risen 22% so far this year, compared with the MSCI World Index's gain of 15%.
Investors flexed their muscle to challenge companies' ESG credentials, culminating in a landmark board challenge against oil major  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). Support for social and environmental proposals at the shareholder meetings of U.S. companies rose to 32% in 2021 from 27% in 2020 and from 21% in 2017, according to the Sustainable Investments Institute. 
""It was a watershed year,"" said Tim Smith, a director at investment management firm Boston Trust Walden.
He contrasted the votes this year with one of the earliest corporate social policy measures, in 1971, when only 1% of General Motors (NYSE:GM)' shareholders backed an investor resolution for the auto maker to withdraw from South Africa over the country's racist social policies at the time.
Regulators have responded to the new pressure by making ESG disclosures a priority. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been asking money managers about the ESG classifications they use for their funds and is expected to firm up guidance on corporate disclosures such as carbon emissions. 
The European Commission has finalized most of its ""sustainable finance taxonomy"" rulebook on which corporate activities can be labeled climate-friendly. Rules will apply to some sectors in the European Union starting next month.
Of the $6.1 trillion in ESG funds, 59% of the money is held in Europe, Middle East and Africa, according to Lipper, reflecting the region's earlier embrace of the investing trend. 
Inflows in European ESG funds dropped in 2021, but this was more than offset by rising flows into U.S. and Asian ESG funds. 
Major wins for ESG investors pushing for changes at companies this year included the replacement of three directors at Exxon Mobil, the rejection of a $230 million pay package for  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co's CEO Lawrence Culp, and a successful call for  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP) to make public its workforce diversity statistics. 
Catherine Winner, global head of stewardship at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)'s asset management division, which backed the critical shareholder efforts at those three companies, said investors are no longer satisfied with companies delivering shareholder returns without doing more for the environment and society. 
""It's not just about shareholders; it's about all stakeholders"" she said.
ESG SETBACKS
To be sure, ESG investors also suffered blows in 2021. Shareholder resolutions that drew significant support but did not gain majorities included a call to reform employment arbitration procedures at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and a call for Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to review how it addresses racial justice and equity. 
Many top corporate investors warmed up to ESG resolutions, even if they did not back them most of them time. Out of 49 climate-related resolutions this year, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) supported 41%, up from 10% of a similar set of resolutions in 2020, according to advocacy group Ceres. Vanguard funds increased their support to 37% from 14%. 
Both major index fund companies declined to comment on the Ceres report. But they have previously said companies must have appropriate risk oversight of environmental and social issues, and that they try to be transparent about their views.

In the United States, companies can sometimes avoid putting shareholder resolutions to a vote by asking the SEC for permission. Thomas Skulski, managing director at proxy solicitor Morrow Sodali, said the SEC strengthened the hand of ESG investors in November by narrowing the circumstances under which companies can skip votes.
As a result, companies next year could face more challenges on operational issues, such as how they use consumer packaging or plastics, Skulski said.

Their analysis revealed Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was more effective, as a third dose of the shot administered after two doses of the same or China's Sinovac vaccine provided ""protective levels"" of antibody against Omicron.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and its German partner BioNTech have said their three-shot course was able to neutralise the new Omicron variant in a laboratory test.
The latest study was conducted by researchers from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and funded by the Health and Medical Research Fund and the Government of Hong Kong.
The statement did not say how many samples were used in the analysis. Sinovac did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Sinovac's CoronaVac and state-owned Sinopharm's BBIBP-CorV vaccine are the two most-used vaccines in China and the leading COVID-19 vaccines exported by the country. Sinopharm also has a second vaccine in use in China.
Hong Kong has been using the Sinovac and Pfizer-BioNTech shots. But people aged 12-17 are eligible only for the BioNTech vaccine.

Investing.com –  Novavax  stock (NASDAQ:NVAX) surged 6% in Thursday’s premarket trading after the company said it two-dose Covid-19 vaccine demonstrated “strong immune responses” against Omicron and other variants.
A third dose given six months after showed an even stronger response, the company said.
Omicron has now been found in more than 90 countries and is now the dominant variant in many of those, including U.S. and U.K. The coronavirus variant is said to be at least twice as fast spreading as Delta, the variant that ravaged India in April-May and later the U.S. and parts of Europe. A consolation has been that new infections haven’t been reflected in increased hospitalizations.
Responses in adolescents were two- to four-fold higher than adults against all evaluated variants, Novavax added.
The company said findings from the study will be submitted for peer-review publication, adding that development of an Omicron-specific vaccine is on track to go into manufacturing early next month.
While Novavax has been late to the market in bringing its Covid-19 shots due to manufacturing challenges, the week saw the company’s proposed vaccine getting the European regulator’s approval for treating adults after WHO’s nod last week.
The shot has got authorization for emergency use in Indonesia and the Philippines, and the company has filed for similar approvals in U.K., U.A.E., Australia, New Zealand, India, Canada, Singapore and Japan. The WHO and the EU approvals should make those clearances easier.
If the company’s plans, as reported earlier, are on track, it should be filing with the Food and Drug Administration for approval in the U.S. in the next eight days."
389,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2021 04:50AM ET</span>",Intel apologises in China over Xinjiang supplier statement,"HONG KONG (Reuters) -U.S. chip maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) apologised in China on Thursday after its letter telling suppliers not to source products or labour from the Xinjiang region triggered a backlash, making it the latest western firm to be tripped up over rights issues in the country. 
Intel recently published what it described as an annual letter to suppliers, dated December, that it had been ""required to ensure that its supply chain does not use any labour or source goods or services from the Xinjiang region"", following restrictions imposed by ""multiple governments"".
The United States has accused China of widespread human rights abuses in Xinjiang, home to the country's predominantly Muslim Uyghurs, including forced labour. Beijing has repeatedly denied the claims.
Intel's letter, on the company's website and in several languages, sparked criticism in China from state and social media, with calls for a boycott. 
In a Chinese-language statement on Thursday on its official WeChat and Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) accounts, Intel said that its commitment to avoid supply chains from Xinjiang was an expression of compliance with U.S. law, rather than a statement of its position on the issue.
""We apologise for the trouble caused to our respected Chinese customers, partners and the public. Intel is committed to becoming a trusted technology partner and accelerating joint development with China,"" Intel said.
Intel did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Other big multinationals have come under pressure over their aims to comply with sanctions related to Xinjiang while continuing to operate in China, a massive market and supply base.
On China's Twitter-like Weibo, singer Karry Wang said he would no longer serve as brand ambassador for Intel, adding in a statement that ""national interests exceed everything"".
Many Weibo users derided Intel's apology as an attempt at protecting sales in China, with one saying ""a mistake is a mistake! Retract the statement about Xinjiang!""
The hashtag ""Is Intel's apology sincere?"" was trending on Weibo on Thursday afternoon.
Intel, which has 10,000 employees in China, said in its apology that it ""respected the sensitivity of the issue in China."" 
China's foreign ministry said ""accusations of forced labour in Xinjiang are lies concocted by anti-China American forces"" aimed at destabilising China and hindering its development.
""We note the statement and hope the relevant company will respect facts and tell right from wrong,"" foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a daily briefing in Beijing.

Intel's China presence includes assembly and test sites in Shanghai and Chengdu.
In July, Swedish fashion retailer H&M reported a 23% hit in local currency sales in China for its March-May quarter after it expressed concerns about human rights in Xinjiang.

Investing.com – JD.com ADRs (NASDAQ:JD) plunged 8.6% in Thursday's premarket trading on the decision of its largest shareholder, Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), to give up most of its stake in the online retailer.
Tencent, whose stock stock closed 4.2% higher in Hong Kong, believes JD.com is now large enough to not need its backing.
Tencent said it will distribute about 457 million shares of JD.com, worth over $16 billion, in the form of a special dividend to its shareholders, and they will now be shareholders of JD.com.
The exercise will cut Tencent’s holding in JD.com to 2.3% from 17%.
In line with the decision, Tencent President Martin Chiping Lau resigned from the JD.com board. Tencent said both companies will continue to maintain a business relationship.
Tencent built up stakes in several internet companies over the years to rival the more widely known  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA). It continues to hold significant stakes in other major e-commerce players such as food-delivery company Meituan (OTC:MPNGY) and farm-focused platform  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD).
JD.com has had a good run last few years even as it trails Alibaba. In the year ended December 31, 2020, the company reported a net revenue of around 746 billion yuan (over $114 billion), up 29%. Net income climbed more than four times to over 49 billion yuan.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a mixed fashion Thursday, helped by renewed confidence in the region’s economic recovery despite the surge of Omicron variant cases.
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 underperformed, dropping 0.1%. 
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) stated Thursday that a three-dose course of its Covid-19 vaccine is effective against the Omicron coronavirus variant, citing data from an Oxford University lab study.
This follows on from a couple of studies released Wednesday, one from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and major universities in South Africa and another from Imperial College London, suggested reduced risks of hospitalization and severe disease in people infected with the Omicron coronavirus variant versus the Delta one, the previous dominant strain.
New data from the U.K. Health Security Agency on the severity of the Omicron variant is set to be published later Thursday. 
Helping the tone was Spain revising its economic growth in the third quarter sharply higher, with its gross domestic product growing 3.4% from a year ago, more than the 2.7% initially estimated.
Earlier Thursday, Japan upgraded its growth projections for the next fiscal year starting in April, expecting the fastest growth since fiscal 2010.
That said, gains are likely to be limited Thursday with many investors on holiday and with the Omicron variant causing infections to double in 1.5 to 3 days, according to the World Health Organization. 
The U.K. recorded over 100,000 daily cases on Wednesday for the first time ever, causing the FTSE 100 to underperform Thursday. 
Travel-related stocks all profited from the news on Omicron, with British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) rising 4.8%, Jet2 (LON:JET2) stock rising 5.2% and Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ) stock rising 4.4%. Ryanair Holdings  (DE:RYA) stock underperformed, rising only 0.4% after the company nearly doubled its forecast net loss for the current financial year due to the continental bans on British tourists announced earlier this month.
In corporate news,  Holcim  (SIX:HOLN) stock rose 2.3% after the Swiss building materials company said it was aiming to buy residential roofing maker Malarkey Roofing Products in a deal valued at $1.35 billion to expand into the growing U.S. residential roofing market.
Flutter Entertainment (LON:FLTRF) stock gained 2.5% after announcing it would buy Italian online gaming operator Sisal for 1.62 billion pounds ($2.16 billion), as the online betting group looks to expand its footprint in Europe.
Oil prices weakened slightly Thursday, giving back some of the previous session’s gains on the back of a sharp decline in U.S. crude stockpiles.

This was even larger than the drop reported by the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday, with the industry body indicating that crude stocks fell by 3.67 million barrels.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open marginally higher Thursday, continuing the global rally amid growing confidence that the global economic recovery will survive the surge of Omicron variant cases.
At 2 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded largely flat, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.4% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.5%.
Equity indexes in Asia have largely traded higher Thursday, a third consecutive session of gains, following on from the strong close on Wall Street overnight. This positive tone is expected to continue in Europe as investors breathe a sigh of relief on the back of positive signs about the impact of the omicron variant of Covid-19 as the year comes to an end.
A couple of studies released Wednesday, one from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and major universities in South Africa and another from Imperial College London, suggested reduced risks of hospitalization and severe disease in people infected with the Omicron coronavirus variant versus the Delta one, the previous dominant strain.
New data from the U.K. Health Security Agency on the severity of the Omicron variant is set to be published later Thursday. 
Adding to the positive tone was U.S. consumer confidence improving further in December, suggesting the U.S. economy, the world’s main driver, continues to recover strongly. Earlier Thursday, Japan upgraded its growth projections for the next fiscal year starting in April, expecting the fastest growth since fiscal 2010.
That said, gains are likely to be limited Thursday with many investors on holiday and with the Omicron variant causing infections to double in 1.5 to 3 days, according to the World Health Organization. The U.K. recorded over 100,000 daily cases on Wednesday for the first time ever.  
In corporate news, Swiss building materials company  Holcim  (SIX:HOLN) said it was aiming to buy residential roofing maker Malarkey Roofing Products in a deal valued at $1.35 billion to expand into the growing U.S. residential roofing market.
Ryanair (LON:RYA) could also be in the spotlight after the budget airline late Wednesday doubled its full-year loss forecast, citing the emergence of new travel restrictions in several big markets.
Oil prices edged higher Thursday, helped by a sharp decline in U.S. crude stockpiles which suggests continued demand from the world’s largest consumer.
The Energy Information Administration reported late Wednesday that crude inventories declined 4.72 million barrels last week, the fourth consecutive weekly draw. This was even larger than the drop reported by the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday, with the industry body indicating that crude stocks fell by 3.67 million barrels.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $72.86 a barrel, closing Wednesday above $72 for the first time in two weeks, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.31. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,806.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1336.

The fine is currently the regulator's maximum penalty, but a legislation was passed this month to increase it to A$100 million.
The Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation said Crown Melbourne was in contact with ""an unsuitable"" junket operator and allowed an associate of the operator to continue junket operations despite being directed by the regulator to cease all such activities.
Crown Resorts also failed to notify the state gaming commission about the associate, the regulator said, adding that the probe covered operations between 2015 and 2016.
The Australian casino firm was penalised in April https://www.reuters.com/article/crown-resorts-regulator-fine-idUSL4N2MK202 by the regulator for similar breaches, prompting the state to tighten regulations by increasing the fine and banning junket operations in Victoria through an amendment of a key casino and gambling legislation act.
Crown Resorts, which permanently ceased all dealings with junket operators last November, said it would consider the gaming commission's findings to continue reforming the company.

A separate powerful inquiry into Crown Resorts, one of many, earlier this month declared https://www.reuters.com/business/australias-crown-branded-disgraceful-gets-two-years-fix-melbourne-casino-2021-10-25 the company unsuitable to hold a gambling licence in Melbourne, but allowed it to run its biggest-earning casino under supervision.

Investing.com – Internet technology giant Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. (HK:0700) will transfer 86.4% of its stake in JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. (HK:9618) to its shareholders. Eligible Tencent shareholders will be entitled to one share of JD.com for every 21 shares they hold.
JD.com's Hong Kong shares fell 7.09% to HK$259.40 ($33.25) by 11:36 PM ET (4:36 AM GMT), while Tencent’s Hong Kong shares jumped 4.02% to HK$460.80.
The transfer of the stake, worth HK$127.69 ($16.37 billion), sees Tencent reduce its stake in JD.com from 17% to 2.3% after the distribution. Tencent will no longer be JD.com’s largest shareholder, with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. taking the role, according to Refinitiv data.
Tencent, whose first investment in JD.com was in 2014, said in an announcement that this is the appropriate time to do the transfer, given that JD has achieved a stage where it can be self-financed of its growth.
Its investment strategy is to invest in growth-stage companies, support and share in the growth of the portfolio company, and exit the investment when the invested company can raise its own capital. “The company and JD.com will continue to maintain their mutually beneficial business relationship, including via their ongoing strategic partnership agreement,” according to the announcement. 
However, the impact for JD.com is “definitely negative,"" Everbright Sun Hung Kai analyst Kenny Ng told Reuters.
""Although Tencent's reduction of JD.com's holdings may not have much impact on JD.com’s actual business when the shares are transferred from Tencent to Tencent's shareholders, the chances of Tencent's shareholders selling JD.com's shares as dividends will increase,” he said.
The JD.com divestment also raised questions on whether Tencent could be looking to offload its investments in e-commerce company  Pinduoduo  Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) and food delivery giant Meituan (HK:3690), as regulatory pressure to scale down increases.
However, Tencent has no plans to exit those investments because they are not as well-developed, a source told Reuters."

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Thursday morning, contributing to a global rally as mostly positive U.S. data and positive signs about the impact of the omicron COVID-19 variant on the economic recovery.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.31% by 9:44 PM ET (2:44 AM GMT), with Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda speaking earlier in the day.
South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.32% and in Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.38%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.44%.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.15% and the Shenzhen Component was up 0.22%. Shares in JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. (HK:9618) slid after Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. (HK:0700) announced plans to distribute JD.com shares worth HK$127.69 billion ($16.37 billion) to investors as a one-time dividend. Tencent’s stake in JD.com will fall from around 17% to 2.3%.
U.S. shares were little changed after the S&P 500 closed in on its record high. Wednesday’s U.S. data showed that the GDP grew 2.3% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter of 2021 while existing home sales were at 6.46 million for November and the Conference Board Consumer Confidence index was at 115.8 for December.
Further data, including initial jobless claims, new home sales, durable goods orders, and the PCE price index is due later in the day. The data also includes personal income and spending, as well as the University of Michigan consumer sentiment and Michigan Consumer Expectations indexes.
A gauge of global stocks is up more than 2% for the month to date, leaving the index 15% higher for 2021 and on course to surpass the gains made in 2020. But recent market volatility, with the discovery of omicron and central banks’ moves towards tighter monetary policy, still has some investors concerned.
“Markets hate uncertainty and not knowing, and when omicron hit the markets, we didn’t know. But it seems like it’s edging toward something more positive,” BMO Family Office deputy chief investment officer Carol Schleif told Bloomberg.
On the COVID-19 front,  Pfizer  Inc.'s (NYSE:PFE) COVID-19 antiviral therapy, Paxlovid, received emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The virus' unpredictable path and the impact on growth and inflation continue to dominate investor risk appetite,"" David Chao, global market strategist Asia Pacific at Invesco, told Reuters.
""The recent health data from the U.K. and other places around the world indicate that the worst case is unlikely. Even though transmission rates are reportedly higher, this variant seems less virulent and less prone to cause serious illnesses or death.""
Meanwhile, the Chinese city of Xi’an tightened restrictive measures to curb its latest outbreak of the virus. Omicron has now become the dominant COVID-19 strain in Australia, with the state of New South Wales seeing a record number of daily cases."

The shares rose as much as 58%, or 3.43 pesos per share, with a cumulative increase of nearly 200% this week.
The surge comes after the stock slumped to an historic low of 0.90 pesos last week after the announcement of a public tender offer by an unnamed third party that proposed offering 0.01 peso for each outstanding Aeromexico share.
""It's speculation, we don't see anything other than that,"" Carlos Hernandez, an analyst at Masari Casa de Bolsa, said of the market appetite for the airline's stock.
Despite the rally, which has led the stock exchange to repeatedly carry out volatility auctions on Aeromexico's stock, the shares are still below 4 pesos, the price where they traded before the tender announcement. Volatility auctions halt trading when the stock is fluctuating dramatically and seek to set a new stable price.
Analysts and traders said further details on restructuring plans would likely to determine future market moves.

""The company has to clarify the conditions of the takeover bid and then see how professional investors who determine whether or not it's convenient to participate in the takeover behave,"" said Gustavo Fuentes, an independent market analyst.
Aeromexico said in a statement after close of markets on Wednesday that the third-party firm Sociedad Alinfra submitted a formal request to Mexico's national banking and securities commission and the country's stock exchange to carry out the public tender, in line with Aeromexico's restructuring plans.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has declined an effort by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to skip a shareholder proposal asking the iPhone maker to provide greater transparency in its efforts to keep forced labour out of its supply chain.
A group of shareholders earlier this year asked Apple's board to prepare a report on how the company protects workers in its supply chain from forced labour. The request for information covered the extent to which Apple has identified suppliers and sub-suppliers that are a risk for forced labour, and how many suppliers Apple has taken action against.
In a letter from the SEC reviewed by Reuters on Wednesday, regulators denied Apple's move to block the proposal, saying that ""it does not appear that the essential objectives of the proposal have been implemented"" so far.
The letter means that Apple will have to face a vote on the proposal at its annual shareholder meeting next year, barring a deal with the shareholders who made it.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
American lawmakers last week passed a bill banning imports from China's Xinjiang region over concerns about forced labour.
""There's rightfully growing concern at all levels of government about the concentration camp-like conditions for Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims living under Chinese government rule,"" Vicky Wyatt, campaign director for SumOfUs, a group supporting the shareholder proposal, said in a statement on Wednesday.

Apple routinely asks the SEC to skip shareholder proposals, and the requests are granted about half the time.
The SEC also denied Apple's request to skip a shareholder proposal that would give investors more information about the company's use of non-disclosure agreements.

(Reuters) -  Albemarle  (NYSE:ALB) Corp does not expect its Chilean lithium operations to be affected by President-elect Gabriel Boric's administration due to its long history in the country and ""unique"" contract to produce the electric vehicle battery metal. 
Boric, a 35-year-old leftist lawmaker who takes office in March, won Sunday's election by a double-digit margin on a platform of overhauling Chile's market-oriented economic system. He repeatedly criticized lithium industry privatization during the campaign. 
Chile has the world's largest reserves of lithium, most of which is found in brine that flows underneath the country's remote Atacama desert. 
The election results spooked investors, pushing down shares of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Albemarle and Chilean-based rival SQM earlier this week. But Albemarle said it was unfazed and noted it has a contract to operate in Chile until at least 2043. 
""We have been present in the country for more than 40 years and plan to be there for many more,"" Albemarle spokesperson Kelli Hopp-Michlosky said in an emailed statement to Reuters on Wednesday. ""In essence, we do not expect that the new administration will have any impacts on our operations in Chile."" 
Albemarle noted that Boric said during the campaign he didn't plan to nationalize lithium operations and would look instead to create a national lithium company. Chile's government already operates Codelco, the world's largest copper producer. 

Albemarle also noted it pays a lithium royalty rate that can be as high as 40%, the highest lithium royalty in the world, gives money to communities living near its operations and funds water level studies. 
""We remain committed to maintaining our strong relationships in Chile, producing sustainable lithium for the world and generating development for the country,"" Hopp-Michlosky said. ""We have a unique, long-term contract with the state of Chile.""

Intel said it had been ""required to ensure that its supply chain does not use any labour or source goods or services from the Xinjiang region"" following restrictions imposed by ""multiple governments"".
The United States has accused China of widespread human rights abuses in the predominantly Muslim region of Xinjiang, including forced labour. Beijing has repeatedly denied the claims.
The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid run by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily stable of newspapers, branded Intel's statement as ""absurd"", adding that the company - which earned 26% of its total revenues from China in 2020 - was ""biting the hand that feeds it"".
""What we need to do is to make it increasingly expensive for companies to offend China so their losses outweigh their gains,"" the newspaper said in an editorial.
Netizens also expressed anger at Intel's letter. 
On China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) microblog service, singer Karry Wang said he would no longer serve as brand ambassador for Intel, adding in a statement that ""national interests exceed everything"".
Many Weibo users also called on Chinese citizens to boycott Intel, with one posting under the name ""Old Catalan"" saying, ""Must resist, do not buy!"" 
Multinational companies have come under pressure as they aim to comply with Xinjiang-related trade sanctions while continuing to operate in China, one of their biggest markets. 

The Global Times said in its editorial that multinationals ""should be able to endure, properly handle and balance pressure from all parties"". 
Intel could not immediately be reached for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Wednesday called for inspections and strengthening a key part for Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777-200 airplanes equipped with Pratt & Whitney (PW) engines after an engine failure in February.
The FAA issued three proposed airworthiness directives, a move that will allow Boeing 777-200 airplanes equipped with PW4000 engines to return to service as soon as early 2022.
A fan blade failure prompted an engine to fail on a United Airlines 777-200 bound for Honolulu after takeoff from Denver on Feb. 20. The incident showered debris over nearby cities, but no one was injured and the plane safely returned to the airport.
The FAA said it was calling for strengthening engine cowlings, enhanced engine fan-blade inspection and inspection of other systems and components. The directives will require corrective action based on inspection results.
The FAA in February ordered immediate inspection of 777 planes with PW4000 engines before further flights after investigators found that a cracked fan blade on the United engine was consistent with metal fatigue.
United said the proposed directives ""are a good outcome for our industry and United customers."" It added ""many of the affected engines have already undergone these proposed inspections. We expect these aircraft to safely rejoin our fleet early next year.""
 Boeing Co  said in a statement it supports the FAA’s guidance on inspection requirements for Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines ""and will work with our customers and Pratt & Whitney through the process."" 
Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp's Pratt & Whitney said on Wednesday the inspection of fan blades was ""already underway"" and could ""be performed in the field, on or near-wing by trained personnel."" It added the directive mandates ""guidance Pratt & Whitney has provided to customers.""
The FAA said ""further action is necessary to address the airplane-level implications and unsafe condition resulting from in-flight engine fan blade failures."" 
United, the only U.S. operator of 777s with the PW4000 engine, has 52 of those planes that remain grounded.

United Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) noted that the airline's voluntary grounding of those 52 planes was not cheap.
""That is a massively expensive decision to make - but we did it for safety,"" Kirby told a U.S. Senate panel last week.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes powered higher on Wednesday in a broad rally after upbeat economic data and hopeful developments about the severity of the Omicron coronavirus variant that is sweeping the world.
The S&P 500 gained at least 1% for a second straight session, putting it near record levels, as volatility has ratcheted up in the last month of 2021 following the arrival of Omicron and an otherwise strong year for equities.
A South African study suggested reduced risks of hospitalization and severe disease in people infected with the Omicron variant versus the Delta one, but World Health Organization officials cautioned that it was too soon to draw firm conclusions.
“We are still struggling for direction in the face of the Omicron outbreak, but in the past few days ... more and more evidence is building that the strain is potentially less severe than prior strains, specifically Delta, which bodes well for economic momentum in 2022,” said Mike Stritch, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 261.19 points, or 0.74%, to 35,753.89, the S&P 500 gained 47.33 points, or 1.02%, to 4,696.56 and the Nasdaq Composite added 180.81 points, or 1.18%, to 15,521.89.
All major S&P 500 sectors gained, with the consumer discretionary group up 1.7% and technology up 1.3%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shares rose 7.5%, boosting the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said in an interview he has sold ""enough stock"" following several weeks of share sales by the billionaire.
U.S. consumer confidence improved further in December, suggesting the economy would continue to expand in 2022. The survey from the Conference Board showed more consumers planned to buy a house and big-ticket items such as motor vehicles and major household appliances as well as go on vacation over the next six months.
Other reports showed U.S. home sales increased for a third straight month in November, and that gross domestic product increased at a 2.3% annualized rate in the July-September quarter, revised up from the 2.1% rate estimated last month.
In another encouraging development against the pandemic, the United States authorized  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s oral antiviral COVID-19 pill for at-risk people aged 12 and above, making it the first at-home treatment for the coronavirus. Pfizer shares rose 1%.
The benchmark S&P 500 is now up 25% so far in 2021. Still, the environment for equities could be changing heading into next year as the Federal Reserve is expected to begin raising interest rates in 2022 to rein in inflation. 
The market is ""certainly at an extended level of valuation,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. “Next year is a more difficult picture, but if inflation is going to be part of the problem, I think investors will certainly choose stocks over bonds.”
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.65-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 35 new highs and 99 new lows.
About 8.6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 11.8 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

(Reuters) -The United States on Wednesday authorized  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s antiviral COVID-19 pill for people ages 12 and older at risk of severe illness, the first oral and at-home treatment as well as a new tool against the fast-spreading Omicron variant.
Pfizer's antiviral regimen, Paxlovid, was nearly 90% effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in patients at high risk of severe illness, according to data from the company's clinical trial. Recent lab data suggests the drug retains its effectiveness against Omicron, Pfizer said. 
Pfizer raised its 2022 production projections to 120 million courses of treatment from 80 million and said it was ready to start immediate delivery in the United States. The treatment's two-drug regimen includes a new medicine and a second older antiviral called ritonavir. 
The U.S. government will have 265,000 treatment courses available by January and supply will ramp up in subsequent months, White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients told a briefing. The government expects to receive the 10 million courses it has ordered within six months.
""Paxlovid's approval is a major milestone that marks another step towards making COVID-19 a much more manageable infection,"" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Health Security.
""There are two key issues, however, that remain: It will be scarce in the coming weeks and its optimal use requires prompt diagnosis, which can be difficult with the continual testing problems that plague us,"" Adalja added.
Pfizer has said it has 180,000 treatment courses ready to ship this year. The U.S. government's contract for 10 million courses of the drug is priced at $530 per course.
The Food and Drug Administration's decision to issue emergency authorization for the treatment comes as the U.S. combats a surge in COVID-19 cases driven by the Omicron variant, with President Joe Biden announcing plans for more federal vaccination and testing sites https://www.reuters.com/world/us/omicron-surges-biden-expand-testing-warn-unvaccinated-2021-12-21.
The pills can fill a treatment gap opened by the Omicron variant, said William Schaffner, a leading infectious disease expert from the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. The most widely used monoclonal antibody treatments for COVID-19 have proven to be less effective at fighting the variant and there is limited supply of the one remaining treatment that works, he said.
Monoclonal antibodies are typically given intravenously in hospitals, are not widely available and are more than twice the cost of the Pfizer pill.
The Omicron variant https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/how-worried-should-we-be-about-omicron-variant-2021-12-14, first identified in southern Africa and Hong Kong in November, has spread across the world and now constitutes over 70% of new coronavirus cases in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prior infection and vaccines have been shown in studies to only partly prevent infection from the variant, though a booster shot does increase protection.
The FDA said it authorized Paxlovid for emergency use for the treatment of mild-to-moderate disease in adults and children 12 years and older who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19. 
The drug is available by prescription only and should be initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis of COVID-19 and within five days of symptom onset, the FDA said https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-oral-antiviral-treatment-covid-19. The pills are meant to be taken every 12 hours for five days. 
While the clinical trials did not include patients under the age of 18, Pfizer said, the authorized adult dosing regimen is expected to result in comparable blood concentration levels of the drug in pediatric patients 12 and older weighing at least 40 kg (88.2 lbs). 
The second drug, ritonavir, is known to have interactions with some other prescription medicines. Pfizer has said that should be manageable and suggested most patients would be able to lower the dose of their other medications while being treated for COVID-19.
Pfizer said it plans to file a new drug application with the FDA in 2022 seeking full regulatory approval. 
Pfizer has agreed to allow generic manufacturers to supply versions of the treatment to 95 low- and middle-income countries through a licensing agreement with international public health group Medicines Patent Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) (MPP). 

A rival pill from Merck & Co is under review by the FDA. The drug, molnupiravir, developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, cut hospitalization and death risk by 30% in a trial. 
Pfizer shares ended up more than 1% at $59.45 on Wednesday.

409,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2021 06:11PM ET</span>",U.S. stocks close up as Omicron fears fall; 'Santa Claus rally' may be muted,"By Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stock indexes closed broadly higher on Wednesday after investors cheered positive economic data and the White House said it was resuming talks on a massive social spending and climate change bill with a holdout senator. 
The market gained throughout the trading session, overcoming fears about the Omicron COVID-19 variant, and was pushed upward by improving consumer confidence and gross domestic product growth. The positive swing continued Tuesday's trend, when stocks recouped losses. 
""With COVID fears, there’s not as much worry as before,"" said Anu Gaggar, global investment strategist for Commonwealth Financial Network. ""It may not have as much of an impact on the economy. (U.S. President Joe) Biden has said we won’t go back to lockdown."" 
The White House said on Wednesday that it would continue talks with Senator Joe Manchin, who delivered what appeared to be a fatal blow to Biden's Build Back Better bill over the weekend by saying he would not support it.
Gaggar added that volatility in December has been much higher than usually seen, and that her conviction is that the ""Santa Claus rally is slightly lower this year.” 
The so-called ""Santa Claus rally"" is the last five trading days of the year and the first two of the next year, when stocks often are higher. According to an article from LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA), if Santa does not come, it could portend a bear market.
Riskier currencies such as the Australian dollar and the euro recovered against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, while U.S. Treasury traders discounted the threat of long-term inflation as the yield curve flattened.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose or 0.74% to 35,753.89, while the S&P 500 gained 1.02% to 4,696.56. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.18%, to 15,521.89.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.94%.
Oil prices climbed as fears of tight supply and drawdowns in the United States offset concerns about COVID-19 dampening demand. U.S. crude recently rose 2.66% to $73.01 per barrel and Brent was at $75.56, up 2.14% on the day. 
Little is known about the severity or transmissibility of the Omicron variant, but top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said on Wednesday that holiday gatherings of over 40 people are not safe even for people who are vaccinated and got a booster dose.
Meanwhile, Biden warned Americans about the risks of being unvaccinated - saying it ""can be the difference between life and death"" - and brought military personnel to support overwhelmed hospitals.
The United States also authorized  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s antiviral COVID-19 pill for at-risk people aged 12 and above.

Currency market moves were generally muted as trading slowed before the Christmas holidays. The dollar index fell 0.375%.
Elsewhere, cryptocurrencies slipped slightly, with bitcoin roughly flat at $48,937.70, still well below the all-time high of $69,000 hit in November.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of U.S. military equipment to foreign governments fell 21% to $138 billion in the latest fiscal year, the U.S. State Department said on Wednesday, as the Biden administration shifts away from some of the more aggressive arms sales practices under former President Donald Trump.
The U.S. State Department disclosed military sales figures for the 2021 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30. Sales included $3.5 billion worth of AH-64E Apache attack helicopters to Australia and $3.4 billion worth of CH-53K helicopters to Israel.
Sales of U.S. military equipment in the prior fiscal year had totaled $175 billion.
President Joe Biden's administration shifted away from selling offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia, due to civilian casualties in Yemen and intends to announce a new weapons export policy that emphasizes human rights when evaluating an arms sale.
The 2021 dip comes after high one-time sales of fighter jets and guided missiles in the final year of the Trump administration. Major fiscal 2020 deals included Japan's purchase of 63 F-35 fighter jets from  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) accounting for as much as $23 billion of that year's total. 
There are two major ways foreign governments purchase arms from U.S. companies: direct commercial sales negotiated between a government and a company; and foreign military sales in which a foreign government typically contacts a Defense Department official at the U.S. embassy in its capital. Both require U.S. government approval.
The direct military sales by U.S. companies fell 17% to $103 billion in fiscal 2021 from $124 billion in fiscal 2020, while sales arranged through the U.S. government fell 31% to $34.8 billion in 2021 from $50.8 billion the prior year, the State Department said.

In 2018 the Trump administration rolled out a ""Buy American"" program that relaxed restrictions on military sales while encouraging U.S. officials to take a bigger role in increasing business overseas for the U.S. weapons industry.

412,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2021 05:42PM ET</span>","Peru protesters to clear Las Bambas road, but unclear if mine will restart","By Marcelo Rochabrun
LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian community protesters who have blocked a key road used by MMG Ltd's Las Bambas copper mine will clear the route until at least Dec. 30, but it is uncertain if the firm will restart operations based on the truce announced Wednesday. 
Las Bambas declined to comment on the decision but has said in the past its operations can only be guaranteed if the road is cleared in an indefinite fashion. 
The decision to unblock the road was confirmed to Reuters by Victor Villa, an adviser to the protesting Chumbivilcas provinces. On Wednesday, the government confirmed several communities had agreed to lift the blockade, but said some were still mulling the decision. 
The blockade, which has been in place for over a month, snarled production at the mine, which produces some 2% of global copper output, and created a major issue for the government of leftist President Pedro Castillo.
""We are going to give them a truce, today in the afternoon we are going to release the statement that we are going to clear the road until the 30th of this month,"" said Victor Villa, an advisor to the protesting Chumbivilcas community.
""We need to be cautious,"" Villa said of the temporary truce, noting that politicians have made offers to the area previously but failed to deliver. 
He said that it is possible the road could remain clear after Dec. 30, but it would depend on agreements reached during a planned visit to the area by Prime Minister Mirtha Vasquez.

The Las Bambas mine has been a flashpoint for protests, with blockades hitting the road on and off for over 400 days since the mine started operations in 2016. 
On Tuesday, Vasquez strongly urged protesting communities to clear the road but was vague about the consequences of not doing so. She has not ruled out a state of emergency declaration but said she would rather engage in dialogue.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A surge in U.S. COVID-19 cases from the Omicron variant is overwhelming testing capacity in high-infection areas like New York City due in part to staffing shortages among healthcare workers and the limited number of open test sites, according to interviews with more than a dozen officials, health providers, and testmakers. 
Some testing centers, such as the New York area's CityMD, have had to shut sites due to a lack of workers, causing long lines in others, they say. The demand is exacerbated by a months-long shortage of at-home rapid tests in pharmacies that has worsened in hardest-hit regions. 
The highly contagious Omicron variant has become the dominant coronavirus strain in the United States in the past 10 days. U.S. infections have doubled since early November to a seven-day average of more than 150,000 cases per day, according to a Reuters tally. One national lab company said testing has increased more than 30% in the past week. States where infections are climbing such as Ohio and Texas also said they were struggling to keep up with demand. 
""The issue... in our community is with access,"" said Dr. John D'Angelo, who heads emergency medicine at Northwell Health, a health system in New York. ""The demand for rapid testing is driving long lines at our testing sites.""
A spokesperson for XpresCheck, which provides COVID-19 tests at 11 U.S. airports, said recent staffing shortages have worsened the impact of rising infections, resulting in longer wait times for airport testing. 
The United States has a shortage of workers across industries with about 11 million available jobs going unfilled, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
In healthcare and social work, about 8.3% of jobs are vacant based on October federal data, about 1.5 percentage points above the overall rate. 
""Our big one-two punch is an Omicron surge... with unprecedented depletion of our health care workers,"" said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.
Demand for tests will likely increase until January based on current models of the virus's spread, said Mark Stevenson, chief operations officer at Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO), a testmaker. 
Graphics https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/EMPLOYMENT/dwvkrzxeqpm/chart.png 
The White House has invested $3 billion since September with the aim of quadrupling U.S. production of rapid at-home tests to 200 million per month by December.
Several testmakers told Reuters they have more than doubled capacity in recent months putting tens of millions more tests on the market each month. 
That would still fall far short of the number of rapid at-home tests that health experts say are needed for the country's 330 million residents.
The White House on Tuesday said it will open testing centers across the country, starting with one in New York City before Christmas. It also plans to provide 500 million rapid at-home tests for free directly to consumers starting January. 
""By the time these tests are rolled out, we will very likely be right in the middle of the peak, if not past it,"" said Sam Scarpino, managing director of pathogen surveillance at the Rockefeller Foundation's Pandemic Prevention Institute. 
Graphics https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/EMPLOYMENT/dwpkrzxzjvm/chart.png 
Thermo Fisher said it is boosting its supply from around 5 million COVID-19 tests per week in October to as much as 20 million by the end of the year. Quidel (NASDAQ:QDEL) Corp says it has increased its test production to a run-rate of around 70 million per month, up from around 20 million earlier this year. 
Testmaker InBios International, one of 11 FDA-approved at home tests, expects to supply up to 5 million tests monthly starting in January. Experts caution that the White House's purchases of 500 million rapid tests could divert supplies from retailers and some healthcare providers. 
A report by the Kaiser Health Foundation assessing the availability of four rapid home COVID-19 tests at six major U.S. online retailers found that tests were unavailable 73% of the time in November, compared to 95% in September. 

""Test manufacturers can only make a finite number of tests,"" said Lindsey Dawson, an associate director of healthcare policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. 
""Whether what's leftover...is enough for consumers looking to pick up tests at their drugstore (or) community health center, is something that we'll have to watch.""

Wall Street analysts expect low-priced semiconductor stocks Resonant (NASDAQ:RESN) and Summit (WISA) to more than double in the near term. Therefore, it could be worth adding these stocks to your watchlist.The rising demand for semiconductor chips from several industries such as automotive and electronics has created a massive imbalance between supply and demand. The resultant increase in prices has been favorable for the semiconductor industry. As a result, semiconductor stocks are gaining investors’ attention.

Read more to find out.Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) and Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE:SWN) are two prominent players in the oil and gas industry. OXY engages in internationally acquiring, exploring, and developing oil and gas properties. The company operates through three segments ─ Oil and Gas; Chemical; and Marketing and Midstream. It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity, and invests in entities that conduct similar activities. On the other hand, SWN engages in the exploration, development, production, and transportation of natural gas, oil, and natural gas liquids (NGLs). The company focuses on the development of unconventional natural gas and oil reservoirs. It serves energy companies, utilities, and industrial purchasers of natural gas.
The oil and gas industry witnessed a huge surge in demand since the resumption of economic and industrial activities earlier this year. Though OPEC and its allies remain firm in their decision to continue production cuts to offset oversupply issues and recover the pre-pandemic global demand, the robust demand, tight inventories, and inflationary pressures have made the oil and natural gas prices hit multi-year highs recently.
Analysts forecast crude oil prices to hit $100/barrel in 2022.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China Telecom (NYSE:CHA)'s U.S. unit said Wednesday it plans to continue providing some services in the United States in 2022 after a U.S. regulator revoked its authorization to operate telecommunications in the country, citing national security.
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in October voted to revoke the authorization. The FCC said China Telecom (Americas) (CTA) ""is subject to exploitation, influence and control by the Chinese government.""
In a letter to the FCC, the company said the services it intends to continue do not fall under the FCC's order requiring a halt to its common carrier operations. CTA argued that the services qualify as private carrier. 
CTA offers consumers mobile service under the brand name ""CTExcel."" The FCC said CTExcel customers needed to switch to a new provider by Jan. 3.
A CTA spokesperson said Wednesday the company ""will continue to operate its private carrier business in the U.S. after the January 3rd deadline.""
Earlier this month, a federal appeals court declined CTA's emergency bid to halt the FCC order.
In a letter to FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel dated Monday and made public Wednesday, a lawyer for China Telecom (Americas) said the FCC rejected its requests to meet and the company planned to continue some services after Jan. 3.
""Absent a final factual determination and decision"" from the FCC, the company intends to continue offering some services ""on a private carrier basis ... to honor its contractual obligations and avoid undue disruption to its customers' operations.""
Rosenworcel's office did not immediately comment.

China Telecom, which had been authorized for 20 years to provide U.S. telecommunications services, had more than 335 million subscribers worldwide in 2019. It also provides services to Chinese government facilities in the United States.
In March, the FCC began efforts to revoke the authorization for China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) Americas, Pacific Networks and its wholly owned subsidiary ComNet to provide U.S. telecommunications services.

420,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2021 04:15PM ET</span>",Manchin's West Virginia worst in the nation for power reliability,"By Nichola Groom and Tim McLaughlin
(Reuters) - U.S. Senator Joe Manchin has said one of the reasons he can't support President Joe Biden's sweeping climate and social spending bill was that its incentives for renewable energy would put the stability of the U.S. power grid at risk. 
But West Virginia, the coal-reliant state Manchin represents, has the least reliable electricity in the country, according to a Reuters review of government data, and for reasons that have nothing to do with the limitations of solar and wind technology.
The average electric customer in West Virginia, a state that relied on coal-fired power plants for 88% of its power needs last year, experienced 468 minutes of outages last year, excluding major weather events, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
That's higher than any other state and four times the national average of 116 minutes, according to the data.
The reasons for West Virginia’s power woes were not related to problems with coal-fired power plants, which are considered a reliable energy source because they can run uninterrupted regardless of sun or wind conditions, but to trouble with the state’s local power lines.
West Virginia's landscape is heavily forested, and trees falling into power lines accounted for more than half of the outages in the service territory of utility Appalachian Power, according to a company spokesperson. 
Appalachian Power, a unit of  American Electric  Power (NASDAQ:AEP) , is West Virginia's biggest utility, serving 460,000 customers in the state.
In addition, the large numbers of customers in rural areas increases the time it takes to respond to outages, the company said.
Recent widespread blackouts in Texas and California, states with large amounts of wind and solar energy, have prompted some backers of fossil fuels to slam renewable energy as unreliable.
Manchin, a conservative Democrat, reiterated those concerns this week when he said he could not vote for Biden’s sweeping Build Back Better bill, which included $300 billion in tax credits for producers and buyers of clean energy sources like wind and solar. Manchin’s vote was critical to passing the legislation.
In a statement, he warned of ""catastrophic consequences for the American people like we have seen in both Texas and California"" if a transition to renewable energy happens ""faster than technology or the markets will allow."" 
Electric customers in Texas and California last year saw 132 minutes and 107 minutes of outages, respectively, according to the EIA data, both far below the duration of outages seen in West Virginia.
Manchin did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The Texas blackouts also had little to do with the state’s renewable energy sources, according to regulators. Rather, its fleet of natural gas-powered generators proved unreliable as equipment froze and supplies of fuel seized up. 
California’s blackout, meanwhile, was caused mainly by poor planning for extreme heat and the state’s inability to import power from the surrounding region due to high demand. 
Both Appalachian Power and Mon Power, a unit of FirstEnergy (NYSE:FE) , said reliability challenges in West Virginia were related entirely to the state's distribution system rather than generation sources. 

West Virginia utility regulators earlier this year ordered the state's four investor-owned utilities to improve their reliability targets by 5%. In its order, the Public Service Commission said some companies had seen little to no reliability improvement over the previous eight years.
The commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The S&P 500 rose 1.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7% , or 261 points, the Nasdaq climbed 1.2%, and Russell 2000 was up 0.8%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rose more than 7% after chief executive Elon Musk said he has sold “enough stock” to achieve his goal of selling 10% of his stake in the electric car company.
The move higher in Tesla comes just weeks ahead of the EV maker’s fourth quarter update on deliveries.
“Tesla typically reports within 2-3 days of quarter-end so expect the results early in the new year,” RBC Capital Markets said in a note, forecasting total 4Q21 deliveries of 285,000 units.
Consumer discretionary was also boosted by a surge in reopening stocks as travel and hospitality corners of the market racked up gains.
Carnival (NYSE:CCL),  Royal Caribbean  Cruises (NYSE:RCL) were up more than 3%, while  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) was up 2%.
Sentiment on reopening stocks was also strengthened by news that Pfizer’s Covid-19 pill has received emergency use authorization. Pfizer’s Paxlovid is the first at-home medication authorized for Covid-19.
“Pfizer stands ready to begin delivery in the U.S. immediately to help get PAXLOVID into the hands of appropriate patients as quickly as possible,” said Albert Bourla, chairman and chief executive officer of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE).

Investing.com – Paychex stock (NASDAQ:PAYX) closed up 5.5% Wednesday after strong hiring among its clients took its second-quarter revenue and earnings past estimates. Revenue in the second quarter grew 13% year-on-year to $1.1 billion, and the company earned more revenue from each client. Adjusted profit per share rose 25% to 91 cents.
Growth momentum in the quarter ended November 30 also drove the HR solutions firm to raise its annual guidance again. Total revenue for the year is now seen growing by 10%-11%, up from the September forecast of an 8% growth. Its first forecast, given in June, had pegged the revenue growth at 7%. Adjusted operating margin is seen around 39.5%, an improvement of 1 percentage point from the last revision.
“Results were driven by growth in employees within our client base and continued strong sales growth and client retention,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Martin Mucci said in a release.
Mucci said the demand for HR advisory services and packages that address talent needs continued to be strong. ""We most recently introduced an automated tool that businesses can leverage to capture and store employee vaccination status and communicate with their employees on an ongoing basis,"" he said, as an example of the company's adapting to current ""complicated"" climate.
Cowen analyst Brian Bergin raised his price target for Paychex from $120 to $130 after the earnings report, writing, ""Expansion was driven by revenue outperformance and improving client employee headcount levels. Further, underlying margin improvement has been due to returns from investments in digitizing and automating sales & services."" He also added that the third quarter view ""implies flattish y/y performance due to hiring pickup, however PAYX views much of its recent improvement as sustainable.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - A U.S. prosecutor on Wednesday argued a Russian businessman accused of insider trading using hacked corporate information could use his wealth and Kremlin connections to flee the United States if he was granted bail.
Vladislav Klyushin, an owner of an information technology company with ties to the Russian government, had sought to be released from jail on a $2.5 million bond and remain under house arrest in a Boston apartment following his extradition from Switzerland on Saturday.
But during a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler, Assistant U.S. Attorney Seth Kosto argued the proposed bond, secured by cash and a London apartment, was something Klyushin ""could easily walk away from."" Bowler did not immediately rule.
While Klyushin's true wealth is unknown, Kosto said he owned a $4 million yacht, possessed a safe containing about $3 million in cash and was named on a Danish trading account from which $8.9 million was transferred out over 18 months.
Prosecutors say the account was used by Klyushin and others while making $82.5 million trading on yet-to-be-announced earnings reports obtained by hacking the networks of vendors that help companies file reports with securities regulators.
Kosto added that Klyushin, 41, was ""not simply any Russian citizen."" 
He said Klyushin received a medal of honor bearing Russian President Vladimir Putin's signature and that his company, M-13, employed a former military intelligence officer involved in the hacking.
Kosto was referring to Ivan Yermakov, who is wanted by the U.S. government on 2018 charges that he and other intelligence officers carried out hacking schemes to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and target anti-doping agencies.
""That suggests (Klyushin) has connections that would facilitate his departure,"" Kosto said.

Klyushin's lawyer Maksim Nemtsev countered that many of his client's assets have been frozen and that he had no intention to flee.
""He's accused of crimes he fully intends to defend himself against,"" Nemtsev said. Nemtsev in an email said Klyushin intends to plead not guilty at the next hearing on Jan. 3.

425,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2021 03:54PM ET</span>",S.African study offers Omicron hope ahead of second coronavirus Christmas,"GENEVA/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) -South African data offered a glimmer of hope on Wednesday about the severity of the Omicron coronavirus variant, but World Health Organization officials cautioned that it was too soon to draw firm conclusions as the strain spread across the globe.
With the second Christmas of the pandemic days away, countries imposed new restrictions on their citizens while worrying about the damage the variant might inflict on their economies.
Plans for Christmas parties and celebrations were wiped out from London to New Delhi amid the uncertainty.
Omicron was first detected last month in southern Africa and Hong Kong. Preliminary data indicated it was more resistant to vaccines developed before it emerged.
But a study https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/safrica-study-suggests-lower-risk-hospitalisation-with-omicron-versus-delta-2021-12-22by South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) suggested that those infected with Omicron were much less likely to end up in hospital than those with the Delta strain. 
COVID-19 cases also appear to have peaked in South Africa's Gauteng province, where Omicron first emerged, it said.
The study, which has not been peer-reviewed, compared South African Omicron data from October and November with data about Delta between April and November.
""In South Africa, this is the epidemiology: Omicron is behaving in a way that is less severe,"" the NICD's Professor Cheryl Cohen said.
""Compellingly, together our data really suggest a positive story of a reduced severity of Omicron compared to other variants.""
It noted though that as the majority of people in South Africa have had a prior COVID-19 infection, they could have a higher level of immunity.
The positive news was bolstered by research from London's Imperial College which said the risk of needing to stay in hospital for patients with Omicron was 40% to 45% lower than for patients with Delta.
However, the WHO technical lead on COVID-19, Maria van Kerkhove, said the U.N. agency did not have enough data to draw firm conclusions.
The data was still ""messy,"" she told a briefing in Geneva.
""We have not seen this variant circulate long enough in populations around the world, certainly in vulnerable populations. We have been asking countries to be cautious, and to really think, especially as these holidays are coming up.""
The WHO's European head, Hans Kluge, told Reuters in Brussels that three to four weeks was needed to determine Omicron's severity. He said Omicron was likely to be the main coronavirus strain in Europe in a few weeks.
Britain on Wednesday reported more than 100,000 new daily COVID-19 cases for the first time since widespread testing was introduced, leaving many industries struggling with staff shortages as workers self-isolate.
France reported 84,272 new COVID-19 infections in the last 24 hours, close to its all-time high.
""There is no doubt that Europe is once again the epicentreof the global pandemic. Yes, I'm very concerned, but there is no reason for panic. The good news is... we know what to do,"" Kluge said.
VACCINATE
Germany, Scotland, Ireland, the Netherlands and South Korea have reimposed partial or full lockdowns or other social distancing measures in recent days. 
Germany's health minister said he had not ruled out a full lockdown.
Italy was preparing new measures and might make vaccinations obligatory for more categories of workers, Prime Minister Mario Draghi said.
Spain made it compulsory to wear a face mask outdoors again as part of a package aimed at containing Omicron. But Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez reassured citizens: ""Don't worry, families will be able to celebrate Christmas.""
In the United States, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky said the seven-day average of COVID-19 cases increased by 25% from the previous week to about 149,300 cases per day. 
On Tuesday, President Joe Biden warned the quarter of American adults who are unvaccinated that their choices could spell the ""difference between life and death"". 
In Asia, New Delhi banned Christmas and other celebrations ahead of the New Year.
The Chinese city of Xian - home to the Terracotta Warriors - told its 13 million residents to stay at home as it struggled to contain rising COVID-19 cases.
Policymakers across the world are trying to address the economic blow that might come from new outbreaks.
But Wall Street saw a broad rally on Wednesday after the hopeful news on Omicron's severity and upbeat consumer confidence and other economic data.
More than 275 million people have been reported to be infected with the coronavirus around the world, and nearly 5.7 million have died, according to a Reuters tally.
Infections have been reported in more than 210 countries and territories since the first cases were identified in central China in December 2019.

Investing.com — Arqit Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) (NASDAQ: ARQQ) announced an extension to its collaboration with Virgin Orbit on Wednesday, sending shares up19.4% to $26.39.
Virgin Orbit— which is to go public via a SPAC merger with  NextGen Acquisition II  Corp (NASDAQ:NGCA) — signed a new launch contract that ensures two dedicated launches for Arqit Quantum in addition to further commitments from the company.
The quantum encryption technology company has already delivered two satellites through Virgin Orbit's LauncherOne air-launched system, which will be a crucial component to its Platform-as-a-service. Both companies are collaborating on responsive space initiatives for Five Eyes nations, which comprises Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Arqit said it will launch additional customer-funded systems exclusively with Virgin Orbit, and that contract allows for up to five launches which will be realized as government contracts. 
In addition, the companies also announced the QuantumCloud Software License, which allows Virgin Orbit to use Arqit's platform to provide encryption to secure Virgin Orbit's global infrastructure. As a result, Virgin Orbit said it becomes ""the world's first quantum safe launch services provider.""
""I am delighted that another prestigious global brand has decided to use QuantumCloudTM to keep their customers' assets safe"" said David Williams, founder of Arqit. ""It is also great to be able to rely in Virgin Orbit's responsive launch capability to support the private instance contracts that we are selling to our government and defense customers."""

(Reuters) -U.S. lawmakers are launching an investigation into the role of events-promoting company Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV) at rapper Travis Scott's concert at the Astroworld Festival in Houston last month, when 10 people died in a stampede.
U.S. Representative Carolyn Maloney, chairwoman of the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform, and Representatives James Comer, Kevin Brady, Al Green, and Bill Pascrell Jr. sent a letter to Live Nation President Michael Rapino for information regarding the events of the Astroworld Festival on Nov. 5, the congressional committee said.
The 10 people who died in the stampede accidentally suffocated, a medical examiner ruled earlier this month.
The victims died of compression asphyxia, essentially crushed to death in the crowd surrounding the stage. Another 300 people were injured among the audience of 50,000 people.
Victims were trapped and hemmed in by barricades on three sides, unable to escape. Eyewitnesses said spectators fell to the ground and some were trampled by the crowd.
""Recent reports raise serious concerns about whether your company took adequate steps to ensure the safety of the 50,000 concertgoers who attended Astroworld Festival,"" the lawmakers wrote in their letter to Rapino. ""Experts have stated that Astroworld Festival organizers failed to heed warning signs.""
The lawmakers have requested information by Jan. 7. 
Live Nation said on Wednesday it was assisting local authorities in their investigation and will share information with the House committee as well.

""Safety is core to live events and Live Nation engages in detailed security planning in coordination with local stakeholders including law enforcement, fire and EMT professionals"", it said in an emailed statement.

The press release announcing the buyback also included commentary on the share price. ""Our strong earnings growth positions us to drive value back to our shareholders,"" said Bob Martin, President and CEO of Thor Industries. ""We believe there is a material misalignment between our value and our stock price. Given our favorable outlook on the industry and in our business, there is no better investment opportunity for THOR than its own shares at the current market price.""
Thor's revenues and earnings have risen considerably over the pandemic as various restrictions led to a camping and road trip boom that benefited the sector. Thor has also pursued a roll-up strategy, acquiring Tiffin Motor Homes for $300M and RV parts maker Airxcel for $750M over the past 12 months.
Shares are up only 5.5% for the year, trailing the indices, as investors focus on the post-pandemic period and questions over when a slowdown will set in for Thor and peers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden said U.S. actions to eliminate supply-chain snarls have staved off a pre-Christmas crisis, ahead of a meeting with U.S. officials and private-sector companies, including FedEx (NYSE:FDX), on Wednesday. 
Biden created a task force in June to address high prices and shortages of consumer goods and crucial components, thanks to pandemic-related labor and demand issues. 
After pushing for round-the-clock port operations, new transport rules and enlisting the help of big retailers including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), the White House says it has made significant progress. 
""The much-predicted crisis didn't occur,"" Biden said. ""Packages are moving, gifts are being delivered, shelves are not empty,"" he said. Shelves at grocery and drug stores are stocked at 90% of their full capacity, he said, and deliveries are happening at a faster rate than before the pandemic. 
A record number of goods are moving through Southern California ports faster, with shipping container wait time cut in half, the White House said. 
Fedex CEO Fred Smith said supply-chain issues are ""not all solved"" but that ""most of Santa Claus' products will be delivered to the consumers."" 
Inflation pressures should ease as labor shortages in the logistics industry are filled, he said. ""We think the peak season is going to be a good one."" 
Last month, Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said a decision to extend port hours was having a positive impact on the flow of goods. 
Retailers pulled holiday imports forward by a couple months and launched Christmas promotions early to ease pressure on the overburdened supply chain. 
While thousands of loaded import containers have been cleared from docks since the administration began intervening, the busiest U.S. seaport complex of Los Angeles/Long Beach continues to grapple with a flood of empty containers and about 90 container ships waiting offshore to unload.
Supply-chain issues continue to affect many U.S. industries. Reuters reported this week that candy-cane makers, like retailers and farmers, have been slammed during COVID-19 with high commodity prices, labor shortages, and transportation and supply-chain snarls preventing them from fully cashing in on the holiday season.
However, corporate profits overall have been strong, with most S&P 500 companies beating analysts' third-quarter expectations. 
PANDEMIC SPENDING 
Much of the shipping crunch resulted from the pandemic. Homebound Americans with unspent travel and entertainment dollars and government stimulus checks splurged on everything from food and refrigerators to toys and exercise equipment. The demand for imports overwhelmed supply chains. 
Biden has also sought investigations into excessive shipping fees and possible illegal conduct in oil and gas markets.
Wednesday's meeting included the secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor and Transportation as well as National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and Port Envoy John Porcari.

Also joining were chief executives of clothing retailer Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS), Kansas-based trucking company Yellow Corp and the American Association of Port Authorities.
The White House on Wednesday also said fuel prices had dropped 12 cents a gallon on average to $3.30 since the recent peak last month, but added that Biden ""believes that they are too high, especially given that we are emerging from a once-in-a-century pandemic.""

Oil prices rose in their last trading session to hover around $70-plus, while analysts expect them to hit $100 by 2023. We think the bullish market trends could be to the benefit of lesser-known stocks San Juan Basin Royalty (SJT), VOC Energy (VOC), PHX Minerals (PHX), and Barnwell (BRN). These stocks are currently trading under $10. Let’s discuss.The global drive for cleaner technology accelerated in the runup to the COP26 summit this year, but efforts may fall short. The oil and gas industry is here for a while yet because renewables are still expensive. The United States Energy Information Administration reported that Brent crude prices averaged $81 per barrel for November, indicating a $38 per barrel increase from November 2020. Furthermore, the organization also estimated that 99.7 million b/d of petroleum and liquid fuels was consumed globally in the last month, a 4.9 million b/d increase from the same month last year.
On Tuesday, December 20, oil prices rebounded after a decline in the previous session. Brent crude rose 3.4%, to $73.98 per barrel, while the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) gained 3.7%, to settle at $71.12 per barrel. In addition, analysts at investment bank  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS), expect oil prices to hit $100 per barrel in 2023 as growth in demand outperforms supply.
We think the upbeat market sentiment could also benefit comparatively lesser-known oil and gas stocks of San Juan Basin Royalty Trust (SJT), VOC Energy Trust (VOC), PHX Minerals Inc. (PHX), and Barnwell Industries, Inc. (BRN), given their growth potential. These stocks are currently trading at less than $10.

Therefore, we think EV chip makers QUALCOMM (QCOM), Microchip (MCHP), and ON Semiconductor (ON) should benefit. Read on.Semiconductors are the key components for electric vehicles (EVs). The aggregate value of semiconductors used in EVs is twice the value of chips in any internal combustion engine. Therefore, the expected surge in demand for EVs should drive the demand for semiconductors.
And while the global semiconductor chip shortage has marred the EV industry’s growth this year, government initiatives to transition to a zero-emission environment, and an increased focus on ramping up semiconductor production, should drive the industry's growth next year. By 2025, global electric vehicle production is expected to rise four-fold to more than 11.6 million units.
Therefore, we think prominent EV chip makers QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP), and ON Semiconductor (ON) should benefit.

Investing.com —   Adagio Therapeutics  Inc (NASDAQ:ADGI) shares declined 13% Wednesday, resuming a recent slide, after analysts at Jefferies downgraded the stock following uncertainty over its Covid-19 drug ADG20, reversing bullish comments they made last week.
Earlier this month, Adagio reported that following in vitro analysis of ADG20 against the new Omicron variant, data showed a more than 300-fold reduction in neutralizing activity, resulting in a series of downgrades by analysts and Adagio's share price falling just under 79%.
However, not long after, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Yee told investors that two pre-print publications from ""respected"" independent labs suggested that ADG, in fact, retained its neutralizing activity against the variant. Adagio shares gained 123% that day in response. The pre-prints prompted Stifel analyst Stephen Willey to label the story, ""even more complicated."" 
In the latest update, Jefferies analyst Yee downgraded the stock to Hold from Buy, lowering the price target to $10 from $46. 
Yee wrote: ""We moved to HOLD with a $10 PT due to uncertainty around next steps and development plan given the antibody does have reduced neutralization against omicron virus (although it does have some activity and at least appears similar to other antibodies on Omicron). 
""The issue is it will take a lot of time to get more answers and we predict the Phase III timeline may be delayed.""
The stock is currently trading around the $8.90 mark, and while Yee said it was very interesting near levels around $5, at levels around $10, the ""uncertainty abounds."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers urged major airlines to back mandatory training for flight crew members to address violent incidents amid a record number of disruptive onboard incidents.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Wednesday it has received a record 5,779 unruly passenger reports this year, including 4,156 incidents related to a requirement passengers wear masks to guard against the coronavirus pandemic.
The FAA, which has pledged a ""zero-tolerance"" approach, said last month it had referred 37 unruly passengers to the FBI for potential criminal prosecution. The FAA has initiated 1,054 investigations and 325 enforcement actions.
On Wednesday, House of Representatives Homeland Security chair Bennie Thompson and Transportation and Infrastructure chair Peter DeFazio and two key subcommittee chairs sent letters to the CEOs of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) urging them to require crew members to attend the Transportation Security Administration's Crew Member Self Defense Training Program.
The lawmakers want to ensure ""they are equipped with the necessary skills to deter and mitigate dangerous situations as unruly passenger behavior spikes across the country."" 
They want airlines to provide crewmembers with paid time, travel and accommodations to participate in the training led by federal air marshals.
TSA resumed offering its free self-defense program in July after pausing the course due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the lawmakers noted.
American Airlines said on Wednesday it holds ""the safety of our frontline team members as our highest priority, and we appreciate these lawmakers' commitment to helping protect it. We are reviewing the letter.""
The push comes amid a holiday travel surge. The TSA says it has screened 1.98 million or more passengers in each of the last six days.
The FAA and TSA announced on Tuesday that unruly passengers facing fines may be removed from TSA PreCheck screening eligibility.
Last month, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland directed federal prosecutors to prioritize prosecution of airline passengers committing assaults and other crimes aboard aircraft.
To date, the FAA has issued more than $1.4 million in fines for unruly passengers. Many passengers who refused to wear masks have been hit with $9,000 or higher fines.

On Oct. 8, President Joe Biden instructed the Justice Department to ""deal"" with the rising number of violent incidents onboard planes.
U.S. prosecutors in Colorado have charged a 20-year-old California man with punching a flight attendant on an Oct. 27 American Airlines flight bound for Santa Ana, California, that forced the plane to land.

Investing.com - Fertilizer stocks rose on Wednesday as continued pressure on commodity costs knocked into the vital agricultural sector.
CF Industries (NYSE:CF) set a new 52-week high, rising 4.3% in mid-day Wednesday trading. Mosaic Co (NYSE:MOS) was right behind with a 3.5% jump today, while Intrepid Potash (NYSE:IPI) traded up 3% and CVR Partners (NYSE:UAN) was up 2.6%.
The continued strength comes as European wholesale energy prices continued to hit new highs due to shortages and plant closures. Energy pricing has been a driver for higher fertilizer pricing, and these companies have been reaping the benefits. CF increased their guidance on their most recent earnings call, citing the strength in the strong global nitrogen market. Piper Sandler initiated coverage on CF Industries with an Overweight tag last week, citing the broader market's inherent skepticism that this agriculture cycle would follow the 2007-2009 period, and stating that the skepticism was misguided.
Mosaic meanwhile reported 71% sales growth in November vs. 2020, and did so on reduced Potash and Potassium volume (though Mosaic Fertilizantes volume were up meaningfully). Intrepid Potash for its part is trading near where it did after a Q3 earnings miss, and CVR Partners is 7% off 52-week highs.
InvestingPro's fair value estimates for these stocks suggests upside in CF Industries (fair value estimate of $82.76 for 15% upside), Mosaic (fair value estimate of $53.74 for 38% upside), and Intrepid Potash ($53.07 fair value estimate, 24% upside), with a lower fair value estimate for UAN Partners ($68.09 vs. the current $81 share price). Sell-side analysts see the most upside in Mosaic, with about 18% potential upside.

(Reuters) -European shares ended on Wednesday at near one-week highs, led by gains in technology and industrial stocks, even as investors worried about the outlook for global recovery amid a rise in COVID-19 cases due to the Omicron variant.
The pan-European STOXX 600 climbed 0.8%, adding to a 1.4% jump in the previous session, which was also its best day in two weeks.
Technology shares led gains, followed by industrials, travel and construction-related stocks. 
Global markets have been on edge this month as the rapidly spreading Omicron strain of the coronavirus has pushed some countries to reimpose restrictions on daily life, disrupting travel and hampering economic activity.
""There's a lot of treading water going on and waiting for the Omicron storm to hit, as a lot of traders are hanging onto every bit of scientific data around the severity of the new strain,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV). 
""It's going to be a very cautious mood for equities, rather than any kind of euphoria, heading into Christmas.""
Thin liquidity and risk associated with Omicron's spread have led to volatility in the benchmark index in recent days.
Meanwhile, the European Central Bank could raise rates as soon as the end of next year, and heralding an end to ECB bond purchases would be a strong signal that the move is coming in the next two quarters, Governing Council member Robert Holzmann said. 
The ECB at its last meeting promised to provide monetary support by temporarily doubling its asset purchases before it ends its emergency bond buys by next March.
Germany's benchmark index firmed 1% even with its government set to introduce new measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 before New Year's Eve, including limiting private gatherings for vaccinated people to a maximum of 10 people.
Scotland, Ireland, Portugal, the Netherlands and South Korea have reimposed COVID-19 lockdowns or other restrictions on activity in recent days.

Container shipping giant Maersk gained 0.9% after agreeing to buy Hong Kong-based LF Logistics for $3.6 billion in an all-cash deal.

Norway's Aker BP (NYSE:BP) dropped 6.9% and was at the bottom of the STOXX 600 with Lundin Energy after it announced plans to buy the oil and gas business of the Swedish firm.

Let’s discuss.The major stock market indexes climbed for the second day in succession yesterday after President Biden reassured the nation that his government has no plans to return to March 2020 style pandemic-driven lockdowns. Investment bank  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc. (NYSE:GS) believes that oil demand will reach a new high in 2022 and again in 2023. GS’ head of energy research, Damien Courvalin, believes that oil prices can soar to $100 per barrel.
Because demand for oil and gas continues to outstrip supply, Brent crude and U.S. crude prices have climbed above $80 per barrel. And although the omicron variant has been a spoilsport, international travel is expected to pick up gradually because several economies boast increased vaccination levels. According to Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, “The omicron’s potential damage to economic activity will be reasonably short and shallow.”
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on quality oil-related stocks as  Suncor Energy Inc.  (SU), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO), and APA Corporation (APA).

The agreement has a value of approximately $90 million over a 5-year ordering period.
After falling significantly in 2021, Red Cat — software provider to the drone industry — shares are up around 24% from Tuesday's close to $2.27 at the time of writing. They hit a high of $2.73 earlier in the session.
The agreement will allow the Department of Homeland Security agencies to place orders for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), i.e. drones. Red Cat said the drones will provide, ""airborne reconnaissance, surveillance, and tracking capability"" for United States Customs and Border Protection.
Red Cat CEO Jeff Thompson said: ""We are honored Teal was selected to provide U.S. manufactured drones that meet the rigorous technical requirements of the Department of Homeland Security.

The study, which is not yet peer-reviewed, investigated the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that use so-called mRNA technology against the Delta variant and the new, more infectious Omicron variant. 
""Our study contributes to emerging evidence that BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) primary vaccine protection against Omicron decreases quickly over time, with booster vaccination offering a significant increase in protection,"" the authors wrote in the study. 
The study was conducted by researchers at Denmark's top infectious disease authority, Statens Serum Institut (SSI). It analysed data from three million Danes gathered between Nov. 20 and Dec. 12.
Among those who recently had their second vaccine dose, effectiveness against Omicron was measured at 55.2% for Pfizer-BioNTech and 36.7% for Moderna, compared to unvaccinated people. 
But that protection quickly waned over the course of five months, the researchers said. 
""We see that the protection is lower and decreases faster against Omicron than against the Delta variant after a primary vaccination course,"" study author Palle Valentiner-Branth said. 
However, a third dose of Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine restored protection to 54.6% in people aged 60 or more who had been inoculated 14 to 44 days earlier, compared to those with only two doses. 

The study confirms the findings of a recent British study, which also showed a rapid decline in protection against Omicron over time and an increase following a booster with Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine. 
""In light of the exponential rise in Omicron cases, these findings highlight the need for massive rollout of vaccinations and booster vaccinations,"" the researchers said.

Investing.com – Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) topped $1,000 Wednesday, surging 7.5% after CEO Elon Musk’s statement that he had sold enough removed a key overhang for the shares that have struggled for a month and a half.
The maverick CEO sold Tesla shares in several tranches since his November 7 Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) poll asking whether he should sell 10% of his holding. Following that, between November 8 and December 21, the stock lost more than a quarter of its value. It touched a high of $1,015.66 earlier during the session that's underway. 
The billionaire sold 583,611 shares Tuesday, bringing his total sale to 13.5 million -- about 80% of what he planned to sell, Reuters said.
While Musk made his Twitter poll look like he would be directed by popular opinion – which eventually favored him selling the stake – he needed money to pay a large tax bill on his newly acquired Tesla stock.
""I sold enough stock to get to around 10% plus the option exercise stuff and I tried to be extremely literal here,"" he said in an interview with Babylon Bee.
 Musk told the conservative satirical website that he needed to exercise stock options that are expiring next year ""no matter what."" He added he sold additional ""incremental stock"" to get near 10%.
Musk still has more than 3 million options expiring in August 2022, which could require him to sell off more shares as he exercises them. 
Musk, who remains the largest shareholder in Tesla even after the sales, tweeted Sunday he would pay more than $11 billion in taxes this year.

454,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2021 11:56AM ET</span>",Analysis - 'Hands off': Why some U.S. investors are pulling meme stocks from brokerages,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - Jose Castillo pulled his $60,000 worth of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) shares from his brokerage last summer, even though he had no intention of selling them. 
The 26-year-old information technology worker, who lives in the greater Minneapolis area, is among a growing number of investors in ""meme"" stocks -- shares such as GameStop popular with day traders -- who are withdrawing them from brokerages out of concern the shares will be lent to hedge funds engaging in short-selling.
Castillo pulled the shares out of Fidelity Investments and transferred them to his name using Computershare Ltd, an Australian stock transfer company.
Brokerages have been trying to reassure investors that they only lend shares of customers who are trading on borrowed funds. If they use their own cash, the shares are not loaned. 
Castillo traded GameStop shares without using borrowed funds, but he still feared his shares would be lent. 
He said he read about the ""direct registration"" of shares on Reddit, the social media platform that day traders turned to this year after the meme stock trading frenzy took off. There, more and more investors have announced they have taken their shares out of brokerages through companies such as Computershare, arguing this will help shield them from short-selling. 
""There is so much going on with a stock being shorted, people started to think how can I make sure that I own it and that somebody else isn't doing anything that I don't want with it,"" Castillo said in an interview.
A Fidelity spokesperson declined to comment.
Paul Conn, president of Computershare's global capital markets group, said he saw a wave of direct registration business starting in September that was driven by day traders.
""Retail investors have asked their broker or bank to remove their investments from the 'street name' system and into their own name, directly onto the company's share register,"" Conn said.
Hedge funds short shares by borrowing and selling them, hoping they will drop in value so they can buy them back for less and pocket the difference. Financial market experts said the push towards direct registration was unlikely to curtail this practice, because most hedge funds' collateral comes from prime brokers rather than retail brokerages. 
    ""The shares used to stock-loan from margined retail accounts are minimal compared to the stock-loan inventory from prime brokers and long lenders such as mutual funds and pension funds,"" said research firm S3 Partners managing director Ihor Dusaniwsky. 
Monthly average trading volumes of GameStop shares have dropped since July to their lowest levels for more than a year, according to Refinitiv data. That was about the time that Reddit users began to advocate for the direct registration of shares.
The more shares are transferred out of brokerages into direct registration providers such as Computershare, the fewer of them are available to trade.Joshua Mitts, a securities law professor at Columbia Law School, said removing shares from the market makes them more susceptible to wild price swings, which could end up hurting the retail investors.
""From a psychological point of view, I can see how that resonates. But from an economic point of view it does not make much sense, because with fewer shares available the trading is simply going to become more volatile,"" Mitts said.
A GameStop spokesperson declined to comment. Popular trading apps such as  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) and SoFi Technologies Inc, as well traditional brokerages such as  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp and Fidelity, would lose out if the direct registration trend intensified. They benefited from this year's surge in trading of meme stocks. 
Robinhood and Charles Schwab representatives reiterated that only shares of customers who have borrowed from the brokerages to invest are loaned to hedge funds.
""We have seen an uptick in recent months of clients requesting to hold certain securities outside of Charles Schwab as a means to prevent them from being lent out,"" the brokerage's managing director of trading and education, Jeff Chiappetta, said in a statement. 
Many requests were made by clients who bought shares without borrowing from Charles Schwab and would not have had their shares lent, Chiappetta added.
A SoFi spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
TRADING CURBS
Retail investors started to mistrust brokerages when Robinhood and its peers placed trading restrictions in late January on GameStop's shares. Thousands of investors claimed on social media that the trading curbs were introduced to protect hedge funds that had lost billions of dollars shorting the stock without anticipating a Reddit-fueled rally. 
Commission-free brokerages such as Robinhood rely on payment for order flow, under which they receive fees from market makers for routing trades to them. This business model has also made retail investors suspicious, especially since Citadel Securities, which acts as Robinhood's market maker, also runs hedge funds that engage in short-selling.

Robinhood and Citadel have insisted that the trading restrictions were not put in place to protect hedge funds, but were needed because Robinhood did not have enough collateral to execute customers' trades.
A U.S. judge sided with Robinhood on the matter last month, dismissing an investor lawsuit accusing the trading app and other brokerages of wrongly preventing retail investors from buying fast-rising ""meme stocks"" and triggering a sell-off.

Investing.com — In a short report issued Wednesday morning, investment research firm Kerrisdale Capital told investors that software developer  HubSpot Inc  's (NYSE:HUBS) products are ""flawed"" and the ""pricing is expensive.""
New York-based Kerrisdale pointed to HubSpot's lack of profitability, fierce competition, and ""stale products"" as reasons it believes the company's shares will soon fall. 
Starting a series of Tweets outlining its reasons, Kerrsdale stated: ""We're short $HUBS. Report at http://kerr.co/hubs. Trading at 20x fwd rev, $HUBS benefited from a one-time COVID boost that lifted shares 6x. But fierce competition & stale products will lead to low growth / margins, long before the biz grows into its sky-high valuation.""








After closing Tuesday's session at $680.20, HubSpot shares initially fell to a low of $654.53 following the report. Shares have since erased the majority of those losses and now trade around the $681 mark, marginally up for the day. 
The company and its share price have soared since the start of the pandemic, climbing just under 70% in 2021 alone. In March 2020 its shares were priced at around $100. However, Kerrisdale said, ""the COVID tailwind will fade and future growth will depend on expansion into already crowded markets.""
""Though HubSpot does have some devoted fans, its core technology – a database that can be used to create customized emails and web pages – is nothing special,"" they added.
Kerrisdale's views are in direct contrast to Goldman Sachs who initiated the company with a Buy rating earlier this month. Goldman analyst Gabriela Borges set a $953 price target on the stock, which at the time implied a 32% upside. In addition, in her research note, Borges said that HubSpot's strategy and execution will drive further upside over the next 5 years after it proved its ability to expand beyond its marketing hub. "

Investing.com – Darden Restaurants stock (NYSE:DRI) traded 1.9% higher Wednesday after Stifel said that Gene Lee’s successor Rick Cardenas has greatly influenced the fine-dining chain’s direction in recent years and will continue the strategic growth path the outgoing CEO led it on.
Analyst Chris O'Cull upgraded the stock to ‘buy’ with a target of $165, over 13% higher than the current price of $145.40.
Lee served as CEO for the last seven years, and will give way to Cardenas in May while staying on as chairman. Cardenas is currently the company’s President and Chief Operating Officer.
The company had announced the succession plan on December 17, along with its second-quarter results. The stock lost 5% that day; Stifel believes the fall wasn’t warranted given that the recent numbers were strong. The brokerage said Friday’s decline in the stock price might have been due to the announcement of the CEO’s departure. ""we are confident investors will quickly realize his successor, Rick Cardenas, can continue to guide the company on a similar strategic growth path,"" O'Cull wrote in his report.
The report also pointed out that, "" Darden continues to report solid results, and we believe the company is well-positioned to outperform peers in a challenging operating environment. We acknowledge variant-related sales disruptions are a near-term risk, but we argue shares trading at ~17x our FY23 earnings estimate represents an attractive entry point for a high-quality company.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets rallied in morning trading after a slow start, as the absence of major news and promising reports regarding Omicron may have set the stage for a ""Santa rally"". 
At 11:35 AM ET (1635 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up .5%, or 188 points to 35,522 points. The S&P 500 climbed .77% while the Nasdaq Composite resumed leadership, up .88%. 
Markets had rallied on Tuesday after President Joe Biden chose not to announce any new restrictions on life due to the fresh wave of Covid-19 cases, instead choosing to roll out more testing capacity across the nation. The move reinforced impressions that the disease is progressing from pandemic to endemic, and will no longer lead to major economic disruption. 
Earlier, the last revision of third-quarter GDP figures failed to make waves, despite a small upward revision in the annualized rate of growth to 2.3%. Core personal consumer expenditures inflation was also revised up slightly for the quarter, to 4.6% from 4.5%, a reminder of the price pressures that have displaced the coronavirus as the market's number one risk factor.
Oxford Economics' Oren Klachkin noted that corporate profits were lower than previously estimated but still hit a record in the quarter, while profit margins reached 12.6% of GDP, the highest since 2012. However, he warned that higher labor costs and weaker productivity gains will weigh on corporate profit margins next year.
Among early movers, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock caught the eye with a 7.5% gain after comments from CEO Elon Musk to the website Babylon Bee indicated that he has stopped selling stock, removing what has been a significant headwind in recent weeks. Business software provider Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) saw its stock rise nearly 7% to a new record high after posting strong earnings through November, which were some 12% ahead of expectations.
CarMax (NYSE:KMX) stock fell 5% despite reporting another strong quarter for sales and earnings. The rise in earnings, around half of which was due to a one-off factor, wasn't enough to offset conviction that the peak of the used-car boom has passed, and that performance will revert to the mean next year.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock shrugged off reports of another outage at Amazon Web Services, the company's biggest profit generator, trading up nearly 1%. One of the companies said to be hit by the outage was Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN), but the crypto exchange's stock didn't reflect any pressure on it.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) shares were down nearly 4% on news of a lost partnership with the Chinese government.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S auto safety regulators said Wednesday they have opened a formal safety investigation into 580,000 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles sold since 2017 over the automaker's decision to allow games to be played on the front center touchscreen.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said its preliminary evaluation covers various 2017-2022 Tesla Model 3, S, X, and Y vehicles. This functionality, referred to as “Passenger Play,” ""may distract the driver and increase the risk of a crash,"" the agency said.
NHTSA said it has ""confirmed that this capability has been available since December 2020 in Tesla 'Passenger Play'-equipped vehicles."" Before then, the game feature ""was enabled only when the vehicle was in Park."" 
NHTSA said in a statement on Wednesday it was ""committed to ensuring the highest safety standards on the nation’s roadways."" 
The agency said the decision to open the investigation was based on reports ""Tesla’s gameplay functionality is visible from the driver's seat and can be enabled while driving the vehicle.""
The Governors Highway Safety Association said on Wednesday it was pleased with NHTSA's Tesla safety investigation ""and want to remind all drivers to be alert and focused on the road when you're behind the wheel.""
Tesla did not immediately comment. 
NHTSA said it would ""evaluate aspects of the feature, including the frequency and use scenarios of Tesla 'Passenger Play'."" 
Earlier this month, the New York Times highlighted the game feature, prompting NHTSA to say it was in discussions with Tesla about its concerns.
The agency noted earlier in December that distracted driving accounts for a significant number of U.S. road deaths - 3,142 in 2019 alone. Safety advocates have said official figures underestimate the problem because not all drivers involved in crashes later admit they were distracted. 
The Times said the Tesla update added three games - Solitaire, a jet fighter and conquest strategy scenario - and said that vehicles have warnings reading: ""Playing while the car is in motion is only for passengers.""
The paper said the game feature asks for confirmation that the player is a passenger, though a driver could still play simply by pressing a button.
In 2013, NHTSA issued guidelines to encourage automakers ""to factor safety and driver distraction-prevention into their designs and adoption of infotainment devices in vehicles."" 
The guidelines ""recommend that in-vehicle devices be designed so that they cannot be used by the driver to perform inherently distracting secondary tasks while driving,"" the agency said.
The agency in August opened a safety investigation into 765,000 Tesla vehicles over its driver-assistance system Autopilot after a series of crashes involving the system and parked emergency vehicles.
A preliminary evaluation is a first step before NHTSA decides whether to upgrade a probe to an engineering analysis, which must happen before the agency can demand a recall.

NHTSA said it received a complaint in November about the game feature from a Tesla Model 3 driver in Oregon, who said: ""Creating a dangerous distraction for the driver is recklessly negligent."" 
On Nov. 29, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s Mercedes-Benz recalled 227 U.S. vehicles - 2021 model year S580, 2022 EQS450, EQS580, and S500 -- because the vehicle infotainment systems ""might allow activation of the television and internet display while driving, causing a distraction for the driver.""

(Reuters) - The Serum Institute of India (SII) has waived its protection from legal liabilities for any AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 shots it supplies to a global programme for refugees, a spokesperson for the GAVI vaccine alliance told Reuters on Wednesday. 
The news comes days after Reuters reported that tens of millions of migrants may be denied COVID-19 vaccines from the vaccine-sharing programme COVAX because of concerns over who would be liable in the event of harmful side-effects. 
Many COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers require that countries indemnify them for any adverse events suffered by individuals as a result of the vaccines. But where governments are not in control - in the case of refugees - that is not possible.
With the waiver, SII's version of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, Covishield, can now be allocated to COVAX's Humanitarian Buffer - a last-resort reserve of shots to be distributed by humanitarian groups, the GAVI representative said.
SII, the world's biggest manufacturer of vaccines which also produces a version of  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX)'s COVID-19 shot, declined to comment. 

AstraZeneca-Serum are currently the main suppliers of COVID-19 vaccines to COVAX, but are set to be displaced by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech at the start of 2022.
GAVI, a public-private partnership, was set up in 2000 to promote vaccination around the world. It operates COVAX together with the World Health Organization to supply COVID-19 shots to poorer nations.

Investing.com – BlackBerry stock (NYSE:BB) slumped 4% Wednesday after the company’s projection of fourth-quarter revenue from its cybersecurity solutions disappointed traders.
The company expects fourth-quarter revenue from the vertical to come in at $135 million at the top end, around 11% higher than Q4 Fiscal 2021. According to Refinitiv data, one analyst expected the company to peg that forecast at $143 million. On the lower side, the company expects cybersecurity to deliver $125 million in fourth-quarter revenue. That will mean just $3 million more on year-on-year basis and lower on a sequential basis.
The somber outlook comes as shortage of chips have crippled production at automakers, some of whom are Blackberry’s clients. Growth in the cybersecurity vertical, which accounts for more than half of the company’s revenue, has been sluggish, impacting the overall business. At $128 million, revenue from cybersecurity in the quarter ended November 30 was lower on both year-on-year and sequential basis.
Blackberry’s revenue in their third quarter fell to $184 million, around 16% lower than the year-prior quarter, but came in ahead of estimates. Lower operating expenses helped it swing back to a net profit of $74 million, compared with a loss of $130 million in the third quarter a year earlier.

Therefore, we think warehouse management software stocks SAP SE (DE:SAPG) (SAP) and Manhattan Associates (NASDAQ:MANH) could be ideal bets now. Read on.The evolution of industrial automation and rapid expansion of the e-commerce business have prompted most organizations to prioritize the deployment of warehouse automation systems (WMS) to attain high operational efficiency and functional capabilities. Consequently, leading warehouse management system providers are working on providing industry-specific customization in WMS that offers an end-to-end solution, allowing organizations to coordinate their operations and inventory across their networks.
Factors such as the rising demand for effective order management, increased outsourcing of logistics and transportation operations, and the globalization of supply chain networks have spurred the use of WMS.

Only 14 out of the 6,190 equity funds in Morningstar's database going back to 2004 have gone from such highs to such lows within a year's time frame, showing the risks inherent in Wood's aggressive growth strategy, said Robby Greengold, an analyst at Morningstar. 
""There is a willingness on the part of Cathie Wood to embrace high-risk names with less caution than her peers,"" he said. 
Ark Invest did not respond to a request to comment for this story. 
Wood, for her part, has said in recent webinars that her strategy has fallen out of favor due to temporary concerns about rising inflation, but that deflation will prove to be the largest concern for financial markets and the economy in the year ahead. 
""Our confidence in our strategy has increased"" despite the stock losses for the year to date, Wood said. [L1N2SZ25L]
The losses in the ARK Innovation portfolio are broad, with 8 of the fund's 10 largest holdings down 8% or more over the last 12 months. The largest declines have come in  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc and Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) Health Inc, both of which have fallen more than 50% for the year after rallying last year, and streaming company  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc, which is down nearly 30%. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Intellia Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NTLA) Inc are the only companies in the fund's 10 top holdings to post positive returns for the year. 
The fund rose 3.8% on Tuesday and is down 40.4% from its February high. 
Despite the losses, investors appear to remain committed to Wood's approach. The fund has brought in slightly more than $5 billion in new money for the year to date, including nearly $229 million during the week that ended December 15, according to Lipper data. 

ARK Innovation remains among the top-performing mid-cap growth funds over the last 5 years, posting an 38% annualized return. 
The fund's ""tremendous success in 2020 was always going to be hard to duplicate, but many piled in to start 2021 and have stayed loyal despite a disappointing 2021,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, head of mutual fund research at New York-based CFRA. ""This bodes well for 2022 when many people have renewed optimism that they can’t struggle in back to back years.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is taking India's financial crime fighting agency to court, seeking to quash an investigation into one of its 2019 deals, a court filing seen by Reuters shows. 
India's Enforcement Directorate (ED) has for months been probing Amazon's $200 million investment in India's Future Group for suspected violations of foreign investment laws. 
The investment is at the centre of protracted legal battles, as Amazon has used the terms of that deal - and cited contract breaches by Future - to stall the $3.4 billion sale of the Indian company's retail assets to a rival.
In an 816-page filing, seen by Reuters, Amazon calls the investigation a ""fishing and roving"" inquiry, saying the ED had sought privileged legal advice and opinions from Amazon and other information not connected to the Future Group deal.
Multiple Amazon executives, including its India head, had been summoned by the ED in recent weeks and the investigation had caused ""unnecessary harassment,"" the U.S. e-commerce giant said in its filing to the Delhi High Court on Dec. 21. 
""The directions by the ED asking for disclosure of legally privileged documents and litigation privilege information is derogatory of the principles"" laid out in Indian constitution, Amazon said in the filing, which is not public.
""The investigation is a fishing and roving exercise.""
Amazon and the ED, which does not make details of its investigations public, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case will likely be heard on Thursday. 
The filing is the latest twist in the long-running dispute between Amazon and Future. Though India's antitrust body suspended their 2019 deal last week, saying Amazon had suppressed information when seeking approvals for it, the ED's probe is independent of that.
The dispute centres around three commercial agreements signed between Future and Amazon entities, which a Singapore arbitration panel - also hearing the dispute - has said must be read together when reviewing the transaction.
Future contends conflating the commercial agreements would effectively mean the deal violated Indian law.
Amazon's court filing contained a notice from the ED dated Feb. 19 which sought details of its investment in Future, including copies of agreements, bank account details and other related internal communication.
It also showed the ED is conducting a far wider probe, and had sought details of big vendors on Amazon's e-commerce website in India, including sales numbers for those that account for more than 5% of total sales on Amazon.in.

The notice came after a February Reuters investigation which found Amazon helped a small number of sellers prosper on its Indian platform, giving them discounted fees and using them to bypass foreign investment laws.
Amazon said at the time it was confident it complied with regulations and that it ""does not give preferential treatment to any seller on its marketplace.""

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) has sacked staff and imposed financial penalties on a number of individuals following a review into the collapse of its Greensill-linked supply chain finance funds, the bank said on Wednesday.
Switzerland's second-largest bank earlier this year initiated the investigation after the collapse of $10 billion supply chain finance funds that bought notes issued by Greensill, the British finance company which filed for insolvency in March.
Credit Suisse said it had shared its preliminary findings on the Greensill matter with regulators.
""Based on the preliminary findings of the investigation which have been shared with the regulators, Credit Suisse has taken action with regards to various individuals,"" the bank said in an emailed statement.
""These actions include termination of employment and severe monetary penalties via compensation adjustments. External investigations are still ongoing.""
Swiss financial blog Inside Paradeplatz earlier on Wednesday reported that Credit Suisse had dismissed two managers within its asset management division due to the probe's findings.
Credit Suisse declined to comment on the number of staff affected by its latest actions. The bank did not name any of the staff.

In July, Credit Suisse published a separate external review conducted into another scandal that rocked the bank at the same time. This blamed a ""lackadaisical"" attitude towards risk and ""a lack of accountability"" for the bank's $5.5 billion loss on investment fund Archegos.
Credit Suisse declined to comment on when the findings of the Greensill investigation would be published.

The approval process is still ongoing, the ministry said.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) could not be immediately reached for comment.
Due to environmental resistance and red tape, it remained unclear when the first vehicles will roll off the production line at the site. Brandenburg premier Dietmar Woidke had recently suggested a decision might come in early 2022.
Tesla has repeatedly had to push back the expected opening of the factory and Chief Executive Elon Musk has regularly travelled to Germany to check on the plant's progress, criticising German bureaucracy for slowing down construction.
Since Tesla expanded its original proposal to include a battery factory, the construction plans had to undergo a renewed process of public consultation which ended on Nov. 22.

The response to all objections raised in that consultation is a prerequisite for a final building permit. 
Currently, Tesla is only working on the factory on the basis of preliminary building permits.

476,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2021 09:41AM ET</span>",U.S. faces tough choices in 2022 on mines for electric-vehicle metals,"By Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - The United States has enough reserves of lithium, copper and other metals to build millions of its own electric vehicles (EVs), but rising opposition to new mines may force the country to rely on imports and delay efforts to electrify the nation's automobiles.
The tension underscores the dilemma facing the United States going into 2022, a year in which U.S. policymakers hope to see groundbreakings on a raft of EV manufacturing facilities from Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and others. 
President Joe Biden signaled earlier this year he prefers to rely on allies for EV metals, part of a strategy designed to placate environmentalists. That means U.S. automakers will find themselves competing with international rivals for supply amid the global rush to electrification. 
U.S. metals imports, though, could boost greenhouse gas emissions by increasing shipping from overseas mines to processing facilities, most of which are in Asia, thus abrogating part of the rationale behind building more EVs. 
A Reuters analysis found that proposed U.S. mining projects could produce enough copper to build more than 6 million EVs, enough lithium to build more than 2 million EVs and enough nickel to build more than 60,000 EVs. 
The estimates are based on the volume of minerals used to make a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Model 3, the world's most popular EV, according to a study by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Other types of EV use different amounts, depending on design.
""If we don't start getting some mining projects under construction this coming year, then we will not have the raw materials domestically to support EV manufacturing,"" said James Calaway, executive chairman of ioneer Ltd. 
Biden in August issued an executive order aimed at making half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 electric.
Washington so far has offered confusing guidance to its mining industry. For example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is poised to label a rare flower found on a handful of acres at ioneer's Nevada lithium mine site as endangered, a step that could impede permitting. At the same time, the U.S. Department of Energy is deciding whether to lend the company more than $300 million to build the mine. 
OPPOSITION 
Other proposed mines face opposition from indigenous groups, ranchers or environmentalists, underscoring the broader tension in the United States as resistance to living near a mine clashes with the potential of EVs to mitigate climate change.
In early 2022, federal judges are set to rule in two separate cases as to whether mine approvals granted by former President Donald Trump to Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Corp and Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Plc should be reversed. 
In Minnesota, state regulators are weighing whether permits issued to PolyMet Mining Corp, which is controlled by mining giant Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) Plc, should be revoked or reissued. PolyMet's mine would become a major nickel producer just as the only U.S. nickel mine is set to close by 2025.
In North Carolina, Piedmont Lithium Inc's failure to keep local landowners abreast of its development plans may cost the company necessary local zoning approvals.
Biden himself took steps in October to block  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) Plc's Twin Metals copper and nickel mine project in Minnesota for 20 years. The proposed underground mine would have become a major U.S. supplier of copper for EVs, which use twice as much of the red metal as vehicles with internal combustion engines.
Despite that step, the White House has been working to highlight its support for certain EV mining projects, including Lithium Americas' proposed lithium mine - despite Native American opposition - and a California geothermal lithium project funded in part by GM. 
The administration also touted a Tesla lithium supply deal with Piedmont, even though that arrangement was put permanently on hold earlier this year.

Many of the mining projects have strong support from labor unions, a constituency that the president has worked to cultivate and one sometimes at odds with environmental groups hoping to block new mines. 
Biden's EV goal ""means good-paying union jobs for working people in responsible mining operations that will both supply battery minerals and protect the environment,"" said Tom Conway, head of the United Steelworkers, a union that represents some U.S. miners.

However, the stock tumbled last Friday to its lowest price since its stock market debut, after the company cited supply chain issues and production constraints in its latest earnings report. RIVN also expects its production to fall short of its 2021 target. So, is it wise to buy the dip in RIVN? Read on.Electric vehicles (EV) manufacturer Rivian Automotive, Inc. (RIVN) in Irvine, Calif., made its public market debut under the ticker ""RIVN"" on November 10 at an initial offering price of $78.00. RIVN’s market value hit $127.30 billion at the close of trading on November 12, just three days after it went public. However, its shares slumped nearly 15% in price last Friday to hit the lowest level since its IPO, after the company cited operational disruptions that could hinder its production plans. Due to supply chain disruptions, the company expects its production to fall ""a few hundred vehicles short"" of its 2021 target of 1,200. RIVN’s pre-orders for its pickup R1T and special utility vehicle R1S were 71,000 units, up from October, but according to some analysts, it is on the low end of expectations.
Furthermore, given the production challenges, the company could struggle in building volumes as demand rises. ""The strong order book provides support for the production ramp, though it does add pressure to get vehicles to customers that may get impatient as current R1 orders won't be ready until the end of 2023,"" according to  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Colin Langan.
Over the past five days, RIVN stock has slumped 21.8% in price to close its last trading session at $96.82. The stock has been down 30% for the past month. However, it climbed 7.6% in yesterday’s trading session in part on Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer’s optimistic comment that the Senate would try to hold a re-vote early next year to pass the potential Build Back Better bill. If passed, the bill, with considerable provisions to boost the EV industry, could benefit RIVN, but uncertainty remains. In addition, the EV startup plans to start building its EV plant in Georgia next summer, and the facility will be capable of producing up to 400,000 vehicles per year. However, production is not expected to commence until 2024.

And the industry is expected to witness consistent demand as the hybrid work culture continues.

Therefore, we think investors could instead bet on quality telecom companies AT&T (T), Lumen Technologies (LUMN), and Cogent Communications (CCOI). So, let’s examine these names.
New York City-based Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) offers communications, technology, information, and entertainment products and services worldwide. Its total operating revenues increased 4.3% year-over-year to $32.91 billion in its third-quarter (ended September 30, 2021).

Also, its 0.41% trailing-12-month asset turnover ratio is 10.7% lower than the 0.46% industry average.
The stock has declined 11.3% in price over the past year to close yesterday’s trading session at $52.78. Also, in terms of forward EV/S, the stock’s 2.95x is 19.5% higher than the 2.47x industry average. In addition, its 2.73x forward Price/Book is higher than the 2.67x industry average. So, it is wise to avoid the stock now.
However, the overall telecom industry is witnessing a surge in demand, because the COVID-19 omicron variant has delayed office reopening schedules, causing a continuation of hybrid work structures.

483,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2021 08:51AM ET</span>",Brazilian companies hear the siren's call of U.S. stock exchanges,"By Tatiana Bautzer and Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Pharmaceutical company Blau Farmaceutica SA, which listed its shares on Brazil's B3 stock exchange in April, has opened its first U.S. plasma bank and may consider moving its headquarters and stock listing to the United States. 
The company, which is currently based in Brazil's Sao Paulo state and, until now, has been predominantly focused on business in Latin America, intends to open 10 plasma backs in the United States in addition to its new site in Florida. Once the expansion is completed, Blau may consider moving its headquarters to the United States. 
In an interview with Reuters, Blau Chief Financial Officer Douglas Rodrigues said international investors, unlike those in Brazil, are used to the business models of pharmaceutical companies, including those engaged in plasma-based medicine.
Blau is one of several Brazilian companies looking at relocating to the United States and listing on a U.S. exchange, a trend fueled by a desire for broader access to investors, lower corporate taxes, looser regulations for controlling shareholders and a better capital markets dynamic.
The shift shows how the success of tech startups with U.S. listings – including digital lender Nubank - has spurred interest among Brazilian companies in other sectors, ranging from retail to cosmetics, in moving their legal domiciles, mainly to the United States but also to other locations such as Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands.
SoftBank-backed Banco Inter SA, web services provider Locaweb, retailer Lojas Americanas and cosmetics maker Natura & Co are among the companies that have announced such moves. 
Brazil's  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY) , the world's largest meat processor, has also said it will pursue next year a U.S. listing of its international operations. 
On Tuesday, Brazilian planemaker  Embraer SA  (NYSE:ERJ) unveiled a deal with special purpose company Zanite to list its electric flying taxi subsidiary on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Embraer shares soared on the news.
The outflow of Brazilian companies represents a growing risk to B3, which is starting to look for ways to stem it, as well as to locally-based fund managers who may find their investment universe restricted.
Lawyers, bankers and executives, however, expect the trend to continue for now, although they point out that it will be confined largely to companies that have significant businesses abroad. They do not expect a corporate stampede for the exits. 
""Some Brazilian companies want to have access to a larger, more diversified investor base,"" said Alessandro Zema, head of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s Brazil operations. 
They also want to cash in on the generally heftier valuations overseas.
Shares of Natura & Co, which has announced its intention to swap its main listing from B3 to the NYSE, trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of about 29, compared to rival L'Oreal SA's 41.5. 
Banco Inter, which first listed on B3 in 2018, trades at just over 12 times its book value, around half that of its rival Nubank, which debuted on the NYSE this month.
Companies that list outside Brazil are looking for markets with more comparable companies as well as higher valuations, said Jean Marcel Arakawa, a corporate lawyer at Mattos Filho in Sao Paulo, citing asset managers Patria Investment Ltd and Vinci Partners Investments Ltd as examples.
Tech companies often decide to redomicile because venture capital investors tend to prefer to complete funding rounds using holding companies abroad. Another reason is to entice founders or controlling shareholders to remain at the helm by allowing them to own shares with special, higher voting rights.
For example, the founding partners of 3G Capital, including tycoon Jorge Paulo Lemann, will remain powerful players at Americanas SA after the retailer's merger with Lojas Americanas and U.S. listing. Banco Inter's controlling shareholders, the Menin family, will be in a similar position at the digital bank.
NEW RULES
Until recently, Brazilian companies could not locally list the receipts of their foreign-listed shares through Brazilian Depositary Receipts (BDRs). Some decided to drop off the local exchange, causing B3 to lose initial public offerings and trading fees to the NYSE and Nasdaq stock exchange. 
Brazil's securities industry watchdog CVM changed that listing rule, prompting companies such as Nubank and investment broker XP (NASDAQ:XP) Inc to list their BDRs on B3. Those BDRs saw huge trading volumes when they debuted. 
""We try to accommodate companies' demands as they change,"" said Flavia Mouta Fernandes, B3's regulation director.
Brazil has also tried to loosen regulations governing controlling shareholders' ownership of shares with super-voting rights, although Fabiano Milane, a corporate lawyer at Stocche Forbes in Sao Paulo, said local regulations still are not equivalent to those in other countries.
""Companies already listed cannot use super-voting, and the extraordinary voting rights are temporary,"" Milane said.
Frustration over the perceived lack of predictability in Brazil's legal system is another reason that big companies choose to redomicile, says Luis Semeghini Souza, a lawyer and founding partner at Souza, Mello e Torres in Sao Paulo.

Some bankers, however, are skeptical that the current corporate migration will become a long-term trend.
""I think the universe of companies that could move is maybe 5% of companies in B3, mainly the ones that have or intend to have significant business abroad,"" said Roderick Greenlees, global head of investment banking at Itau BBA.

Biden, who reopened the nation's online insurance marketplace created by the 2010 law when he took office in January, added that ""an all-time high"" of more than 12.6 million Americans signed up in the six weeks following Nov. 1.
The enrollment figures for the year come during the nation's second year grappling with the novel coronavirus, which has led to 51,395,700 reported cases according to a Reuters analysis and upended the nation's economy. 
""As we keep up our fight against the pandemic, it is more important than ever that we continue to expand coverage and lower costs,"" Biden said in a statement released by the White House. 

Americans can still sign up for health insurance under the marketplace through Jan. 15 via healthcare.gov, he added.
Additionally, Biden pointed to his Build Back Better plan's proposals to expand health insurance coverage, including a provision to expand coverage under the Medicaid insurance program for the poor in states that did not widen access under the ACA.

488,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2021 07:32AM ET</span>",Bruised Santander faces battle to save face in Orcel defeat,"By Jesús Aguado
MADRID (Reuters) - Santander (MC:SAN) plans to challenge a court ruling it must pay Andrea Orcel 68 million euros ($77 million) for changing its mind over making him CEO, though lawyers say the bank has a slim chance of clawing back much in a battle that has damaged its reputation. 
In one of banking's most high profile employment disputes, a Madrid judge ruled this month a four-page offer letter sent by the Spanish lender to Orcel in September 2018 was a contract, which the bank breached four months later when it decided to scrap his appointment. 
Santander had said an unforeseen requirement that it pay Orcel deferred pay he was losing on leaving UBS had made his appointment too expensive. 
The ruling - while affordable financially - was a blow to Santander Chairman Ana Botin who had personally courted the Italian executive and then appeared in court to defend the bank's change of course. 
Now Santander says it is preparing to file an appeal - a step that must happen within 20 working days of the publication of the Dec. 10 ruling. 
Legal experts, bankers and academics believe there is little scope to overturn judge Javier Sanchez Beltran's main finding that the offer letter was legally binding.
""Santander can indeed appeal but they have all the odds against them. In my opinion the offer letter showed there was an agreement and therefore it may just be an attempt to save face,"" said Enrique Quemada, chairman of Spanish investment bank ONEtoONE.
A lawyer not related to the case who did not want to be identified also said he believed the offer letter was a valid pre-contract, given there had been an approval by the bank's nominations and remuneration committee with the chairman on board, and that the announcement had been made public.
Botin had told the court the offer letter was not a contract as Santander's board had not approved his final pay package. 
But the judge referenced tweets by her and media interviews in which she said Orcel's appointment would be ""effective from the beginning of 2019."" 
No new evidence can be brought forward in the appeal, meaning Santander will be left to revamp its argument that the letter was not a contract. The appeal could go all the way to Spain's Supreme Court, court sources said, meaning it could be years until the matter is finally resolved. 
Both parties can reach an out-of-court settlement at any time during the process. 
Orcel did not reply to messages and calls for a comment. 
Lawyers and sources close to the matter believe Santander's best chance will be contesting the 10 million euros of compensation for ""moral damage"" Orcel was awarded by the Madrid court, rather than his 17 million euro sign-on bonus, the 35 million buyout clause and 5.8 million for two years' salary. 
Although the judge said it was difficult to prove how much ""moral damage"" Santander's volte-face caused Orcel, he said the bank's withdrawal created ""considerable frustration, uneasiness, uncertainty and a certain discredit in the banking world."" 
""The 10 million euros in moral damages is something that can be contested as it is quite high, although it is discretionary and up to the judge,"" the independent lawyer said. Though sources close to Santander believe the appeal will be an opportunity to overturn the court ruling, one said ""reducing the amount would also be a better scenario than the one the bank currently has.""
Santander declined to comment. 
Orcel originally sought as much as 112 million euros from Santander for breach of contract and damage to his career. In May, he dropped part of his claim after he was appointed UniCredit CEO. 
REPUTATION BLOW 
Analysts and academics said the court ruling highlighted potential flaws in the way Santander is run. 
""It is not a good ruling in terms of corporate governance (...) and my concern is how this ruling is going to affect investors' perception of governance,"" said Jose Carlos Diez, an associate professor of economics at the University of Alcala de Henares. 
In April 2019, some investors criticised the bank's handling of the aborted hiring of Orcel at the first shareholder meeting after Santander's U-turn. 
Santander maintains the appointment was made in good faith and after a proper governance process that involved the entire board, specifically its nominations and remuneration committees, which met 13 times during the process. 
Analysts, bankers and academics don't see a big financial impact for Santander and believe the bank will be wary of making the same mistake twice. 

""In the future the bank will be more careful when potentially searching for a new CEO or a high senior manager,"" Quemada said.

Investing.com – CarMax stock (NYSE:KMX) jumped 5% in Wednesday’s premarket trading after another quarter of record revenue.
Used-car retailers like CarMax and  Carvana  (NYSE:CVNA) have had a string of record quarters for more than a year as a long waiting period for new cars, fueled by a global shortage of chips, has driven consumers to second-hand vehicles. As a result, dealers have bought more cars and sold them at even higher prices, which has also reflected in U.S. consumer prices being at a 39-year high.
Average selling prices for both retail and wholesale rose strongly, by about 31% and 58% on the year, respectively.
The company purchased 383,215 vehicles from consumers in the third quarter ended November 30, a 91% increase year-on-year.
CarMax sold 415,054 units through its combined retail and wholesale channels, more than 29% higher from the prior-year quarter.
The company said online was driving both sales and purchases of vehicles, a result of digital solutions facilitating quicker appraisals. Revenue from online transactions was around 30% of the total, a good 10-percentage point jump from a year earlier.
Selling, general and administrative expenses rose about 34%, owing to higher compensation to staff and spending on technology to cater to strong demand.
Third-quarter net revenue climbed over 64% to $8.5 billion. Adjusted net profit per share rose about 15% to $1.63 to beat estimates.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Container shipping giant Maersk on Wednesday agreed to buy Hong Kong-based LF Logistics for $3.6 billion in an all-cash deal that will add hundreds of warehouses in Asia and help it expand beyond its core ocean freight business.
The deal is one of the group's largest takeovers to date and follows a series of acquisitions including logistics and e-commerce firms, a freight forwarder specialised in air freight and its smaller rival Hamburg Sud.
""Today we mainly help our customers import from Asia, but with this acquisition we make a big bet on long-term growth in Asia and on offering our customers better access to the Asian consumer,"" Maersk Chief Executive Soren Skou said on a conference call.
Record high container freight rates stemming from the impact of the pandemic have boosted big shipping companies and prompted deal-making by Maersk https://www.reuters.com/article/maersk-results-idCNL1N2PD0DX and its rivals, including CMA CGM https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/shipping-group-cma-cgm-buy-los-angeles-fms-container-terminal-2021-11-03 and Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC).
With chaotic conditions in the global supply chain, big companies have been willing to pay a premium for more reliable and integrated freight solutions. 
Maersk will buy LF Logistics from Li & Fung Ltd, a Hong Kong-based supply chain manager, and from Singapore state investor Temasek which bought 22% of the company in 2019. The deal is expected to close in 2022.
With a network of 223 warehouses, including 49 in China, and around 10,000 employees in 14 Asian countries, LF Logistics provides land-based services such as warehousing and trucking to more than 250 global customers. 
Maersk plans to ""turbo-charge"" growth at LF Logistics by doubling revenue to $2 billion and operating profit to $500 million in four years.
With the deal, Maersk will own 549 warehouses globally and increase total warehouse floor capacity by 40%, creating the world's seventh largest contract logistics company behind the likes of UPS, DHL and Kuehne+Nagel. 
The $3.6 billion price tag implies that the valuation of LF Logistics has more than doubled since the Temasek deal valued the company at nearly $1.4 billion two years ago. 
""The company has grown a lot since 2019, valuations in general are high, and we are paying a control premium which Temasek did not pay,"" Vincent Clerc, head of Maersk's ocean and logistics business, told Reuters in an interview.

Since breaking up its conglomerate in 2016, including selling its oil and gas business, Maersk has transformed into an integrated logistics company. The company aims to bring in half of its revenue from land-based services, up from around a quarter now.
Maersk shares, which have risen more than four-fold since March last year, were trading 0.1% higher at 1129 GMT.

The Commission proposal includes a common set of rules on how to calculate the globally agreed 15% effective tax rate, so that it is consistently applied across the EU.
""In October of this year, 137 countries supported a historic multilateral agreement to transform global corporate taxation,"" EU Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni told a news conference.
""The directive we are putting forward will ensure that the new 15% minimum effective tax rate for large companies will be applied in a way that is fully compatible with EU law,"" he said.
Gentiloni said the Commission would propose a second law in the middle of 2022 to implement the other part of the OECD and G20 agreement on the reallocation of taxing rights. 
The EU minimum corporate tax law will apply to any company, domestic and international, with combined revenues of 750 million euros a year, situated in the EU. 
To reduce the impact on groups carrying out real economic activities, companies will be able to exclude from tax calculations an amount of income equal to 5% of the value of tangible assets and 5% of payroll, the Commission said.

For a transition period of 10 years, the exclusions will be higher, starting at 8% of tangible assets and 10% of payroll that will gradually decline every year.
For the proposed law to come into force, all EU governments will have to agree and it will have to be consulted with the European Parliament as well.

(Reuters) -Oreo cookies maker  Mondelez International Inc  (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and drug-store chain CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) joined a growing list of U.S. firms to put off their return-to-office plans as COVID-19 cases surge across the country due to the fast-spreading Omicron variant.
The new coronavirus variant has become the dominant strain in the United States, accounting for 73% of cases and prompting some cities and states to impose new measures aimed at protecting the public. 
A Mondelez spokesperson said ""concern and uncertainty"" caused by the Omicron variant has led the company to postpone the planned reopening of its global headquarters in West Fulton Market, Chicago to a later date from Jan. 10.
CVS has also decided to delay plans for its U.S. corporate employees to return to a hybrid work format on Jan. 10, spokesperson Erin Shields Britt said in an e-mailed statement. 
Earlier this year, CVS, which employs nearly 300,000 workers in the United States, began requiring COVID‑19 vaccinations for clinical and corporate employees. Britt said CVS has now extended the policy to all employees.
""The health and safety of our employees remains our top priority as we continue to navigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and emerging variants,"" she said.
While the rapid rise of infections is once again disrupting life across the country, canceling events from Broadway shows to professional sports, President Joe Biden said Americans would be able to travel and enjoy the holidays as long as they are inoculated and follow masking guidelines.
Mondelez headquarters would remain open to fully vaccinated employees on a voluntary basis, with plans for a full reopening to be announced at a later date, spokesperson Tracey Noe said in an email.
The company requires employees at its offices in Chicago, Miami and East Hanover, New Jersey to be fully vaccinated as a condition of employment.

In 2019, Mondelez announced it was shifting its global headquarters from Deerfield, Illinois to Chicago's Fulton Market neighborhood, and said at the time it would relocate 400 employees to the new offices in April 2020.
It was not immediately clear how many employees currently work at the location.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen edging higher at the open Wednesday, stabilizing after the previous session’s strong gains as concerns over the Omicron Covid variant still weigh as the year-end draws near.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 75 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 5 points, or 0.1%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 5 points, or 0.1%.
The major indices rallied Tuesday, breaking a three-day losing streak, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining over 500 points, or 1.6%, the broad-based S&P 500 rising 1.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbing 2.4%.
The swift emergence of Omicron as the dominant coronavirus variant in the U.S. has alarmed investors. But as European nations reinstate lockdowns, President Joe Biden said on Tuesday he did not intend to lock down the U.S., instead announced new actions that increased booster availability and tightened travel rules.
Investors will be looking at data later in the session for a gauge of the strength of the U.S. economic recovery and the wellbeing of the U.S. consumer, a vital component in continuing the rally.
A reading of third-quarter U.S. GDP growth, at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT) is likely to show a 2.1% rise at an annualized pace, a small improvement from the first estimate of 2% given in October. It had grown by 6.5% in the second quarter.
Consumer confidence, as measured by the Conference Board, is likely to have improved to 110.8 in December from November’s 109.5, at 10:00 AM ET.
Turning to the corporate sector, Kellogg (NYSE:K) is likely to be in the spotlight Wednesday after the cereal-maker announced the end of a prolonged strike, with representatives of the employees ratifying an agreement that translates into higher wages and better benefits for them.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) could also be in focus after U.S auto safety regulators said they have opened a formal safety investigation into 580,000 of the electric-car maker’s vehicles sold since 2017 over the decision to allow games to be played on the front center touchscreen. 
CarMax (NYSE:KMX) will reveal its third-quarter numbers Wednesday, with the used car retailer expected to report revenue of $7.28 billion and profit per share of $1.47.
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday, helped by the American Petroleum Institute reporting crude stockpiles fell by 3.67 million barrels last week, a larger draw than the 2.63-million-barrel drop expected and much larger than last week’s 815,000-barrel fall. If confirmed by government data later Wednesday, it would be a fourth weekly draw.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $71.42 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.2% to $74.12.

496,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2021 06:25AM ET</span>","Exclusive-Brazil central bank puts brakes on tougher rules for fintechs, sources say","By Marcela Ayres and Aluisio Alves
BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank has put the brakes on tougher regulations for the burgeoning fintech industry, withdrawing a draft proposal that had been set to be voted on last month by the government's top financial policy-making body, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
On Nov. 18, the central bank proposed that the regulations be discussed at an extraordinary meeting of the National Monetary Council (CMN) but the new rules - which look to level the playing field between fintechs and traditional banks - were never voted on, the sources say.
The central bank declined to comment.
It is unclear why the central bank chose to delay the passing of the regulatory changes but it has left a multi-billion-dollar sector on tenterhooks.
The proposed changes would raise the minimum capital requirements for payment institutions according to their size, transaction volume and risk-weighted assets. 
They have been expected by the sector in some form since a public consultation was opened on the subject in late 2020.
Two of the sources, both speaking on condition of anonymity, said the delay did not necessarily signal that the rules would be watered down. 
A third source said the central bank department responsible for the regulatory adjustments has decided to conduct a review to ensure the new norms would not unnecessarily burden the sector. 
It is almost a decade since Brazil's central bank shook up the regulatory framework for payment institutions, putting them under its supervision and paving the way for the nascent industry of financial start-ups using technology to simplify payments, transfers and borrowing. 
The different regulations were designed to introduce more competition to a stale banking sector dominated by a handful of traditional institutions and break the dynamics of historically high lending rates in Brazil.
Now, partly as a result of those changes, Brazil's fintech industry is booming. Credit card issuer Nubank just listed on the New York Stock Exchange with a valuation that makes it Latin America's most valuable financial institution. 
Its debut last month occurred before any changes but Nubank disclosed in its IPO prospectus that under the new rules - as laid out in the central bank's public consultation - it would be subject to a 60% higher minimum regulatory capital, of 2.1 billion reais ($367.55 million).
Nubank's impressive IPO follows the rise of other players in Brazil like PagSeguro, Stone and PicPay which have all won millions of clients, raised venture capital financing, and have either listed their operations or plan to do so. 
Traditional banks are increasingly calling foul and urging the regulator to bring rules for highly successful fintechs into line with their own. 
But one of the complications of a regulatory move such as the one intended by the central bank is that fintechs - numbering more than a thousand in Brazil - have taken very different paths.
Using only the criteria of customer-base size or financial volume for setting new requirements could create more problems than solutions, according to those in the industry. 

""If the dose is wrong, the central bank can create barriers to entry and even make business unfeasible,"" said Fabiano Camperlingo, president of SumUp, which specializes in payment solutions for small and microenterprises.

Voya will replace CoreSite Realty (NYSE:COR) that American Tower (NYSE:AMT) is acquiring in a deal expected to be completed soon. The change in the index is effective December 28.

Voya swung to a net profit of $142 million in the third quarter from a loss of $333 million in the same period a year ago, driven by proceeds from divestitures in the reporting period. Last-year quarter was pulled down by losses on account of discontinued operations.  
Last month, the company rolled out its plan to grow adjusted operating earnings per share by 12%-17% through 2024.

Investing.com – Maersk stock (CSE:MAERSKa) traded 0.1% lower Wednesday in Copenhagen in a lukewarm reaction to the company’s decision to buy Asian warehouse giant LF Logistics for around $3.6 billion, including lease liabilities.
According to Maersk, the deal implies a multiple of 14.4, based on enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
The all-cash acquisition expands the shipping company’s capacity by around 70% to 549 warehouses globally, with a wide access to the world’s fastest-growing Asian market. Most customers are looking to grow in that region, Maersk said.
LF Logistics, an arm of Hong Kong supply-chain manager Li & Fung, has a large pool of global clients that Maersk will immediately be able to service with a wider bouquet of solutions. Maersk may pay out an additional $160 million based on LF Logistics’ future financial performance.
The pandemic, while wrecking global supply chains, also later brought a windfall for shipping companies as economies boomed and freight rates soared. Maersk reported a profit of $5.44 billion for the September quarter, more than five times the profit it had a year ago.
Maersk is now looking to deepen its business of carrying goods from ports to warehouses and then possibly extending it to offices and homes, businesses carrying higher margins.
It acquired HUUB in September, a Portuguese Cloud-based logistics start-up specializing in technology solutions for B2C warehousing. It’s also acquiring Germany’s Senator International to ramp up air-freight business."

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's SK Hynix Inc said on Wednesday it has received merger clearances from the Chinese antitrust authority for its acquisition of  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)'s NAND memory chip business, clearing the way for the world's second-largest memory chip maker to completion of securing regulatory approvals from all eight countries. 
The U.S. chip giant last October agreed to sell its NAND memory chip business to SK Hynix for $9 billion, part of a move to divest to focus on its smaller but more lucrative Optane memory business which uses more advanced technology.
""SK Hynix sincerely welcomes and appreciates the State Administration for Market Regulation's merger clearance for the deal. SK Hynix will enhance its competitiveness of NAND Flash and SSD business by continuing the remaining post-merger integration process,"" the company said in a statement. 
China's market regulator said on Wednesday that it had approved the acquisition deal but with conditions. 
The concentration of the PCIe and SATA solid state drive businesses after the acquisition will have or may have a restrictive effect on competition in those markets, so additional conditions to this deal are needed, China's State Administration for Market Regulation said in a statement.
Additional conditions include that SK Hynix should not supply PCIe and SATA enterprise-class solid state drive products to China's domestic market at unreasonable prices.
The Chinese regulator also said SK Hynix should continue to expand its output of PCIe and SATA enterprise-class solid state drive products within five years of the effective transaction date.
SK Hynix should not force customers in China's market to exclusively purchase products from SK Hynix or companies controlled by it, nor should it enter into deals with its main competitors in China that exclude or restrict competition.
The deal is SK Hynix's biggest acquisition, as the Korean firm tries to boost its capacity to build NAND chips which are used to store data in smartphones and data centre servers and to beef up its pricing power.
""There has been speculation that it will be difficult for SK Hynix to win China’s approval for the deal or any approval could be delayed significantly given the complex situation ... amid tensions between the United States and China in the semiconductor sector. 
""It seems like the approval could come at the right time without a significant delay as the deal is deemed mutually beneficial for all three countries,"" SK Hynix said. 
Analysts said the deal will help SK Hynix narrow the gap with market leader Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd.
""China's approval comes a bit later than what the market expected, but this is in line with the company's goal of receiving Chinese regulatory approval within this year,"" said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities.

""This acquisition would likely help SK Hynix better expand its NAND solid state drive (SSD) business for enterprise customers like data centres as its NAND SSD business has been predominantly focus on consumer products such as smartphones and PCs"" Park added. 
SK Hynix shares closed up 2%, outpacing the KOSPI's 0.3% rise.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German food delivery group Delivery Hero said on Wednesday it would scale down its Foodpanda operations in Germany and sell the subsidiary's Japan unit, citing increased competition and labour shortages.
Delivery Hero said Foodpanda would exit Cologne, Duesseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart, though it had only introduced the brand in Cologne, Duesseldorf and Stuttgart a month earlier as part of a broader expansion programme in Germany.
""Facing a very different reality now than we did entering these markets, it is with a heavy heart that we need to pursue other growth opportunities with larger potential,"" Chief Executive Niklas Oestberg said in a statement.
The meal delivery market, with players including Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats, Just Eat Takeaway and Deliveroo, is expected to consolidate as the pandemic-related boom starts to wear off and companies look to adjust operations.
At the same time, the European Commission announced draft rules in early December to give employee benefits to riders and drivers for online delivery firms, a move some companies argue will lead to job losses.
Delivery Hero shares were up 6.4% by 0930 GMT.
Delivery Hero, whose operations span more than 50 countries, only started in June with the soft launch of its Foodpanda brand in Berlin and then rolled it out to other cities in August.

That return home brought an abrupt end to a truce struck in late 2018, when Oestberg sold Delivery Hero's German operations to Takeaway.com - its Dutch competitor now known as Just Eat Takeaway (JET) - for $1.1 billion.
The group also said on Wednesday it would exit the market in Japan, which it entered in September 2020, in the first quarter of 2022 to focus on growth in other markets and niches, especially in the area of quick commerce.

The tariffs on a specific thin grade of aluminium converter foil, which will come into force on Thursday, range from 8.6% to 18.2% and come on top of existing anti-dumping duties of between 6.0% and 28.5%.
The European Commission, which conducted an investigation after a complaint from EU producers, said that China had identified aluminium foil as a key industry and intervened with the free play of market forces to promote the sector.
State subsidies took the form of financing on preferential terms, export credit insurance, grants, tax exemptions and government provision of land use rights and power at below market prices.

The investigation showed China's share of the EU aluminium foil market grew to 24% in 2019 from 18% in 2017, with average prices falling. Imports from other countries were limited. 
The complaint came from six EU producers, including Italy's Carcano Antonio, Eurofoil Luxembourg and Germany-based Hydro Aluminium Rolled Products.

""The new consolidated schedule will result in several flight cancellations,"" the company said in a website notice, without giving details. 
The carrier declined to comment on the routes involved, but said it would immediately reach out to all affected customers and try to make alternative flight arrangements for them.
A travel industry source who was not authorised to speak publicly about the matter told Reuters the cancellations included many long-haul flights to and from Australia, North America and Europe.
Cathay's Australian website said it would only fly to Sydney from Hong Kong in January, with no flights to Melbourne, Brisbane or Perth, which had been destinations in December.
For December, Cathay planned to fly no more than 12% of its pre-pandemic passenger schedule, having cancelled many flights because it could not find enough crew members to volunteer for tough rosters https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/locked-hotels-hong-kongs-covid-19-rules-take-mental-toll-cathay-pilots-2021-11-26 involving five weeks locked in hotel rooms.

China's CSI300 Real Estate Index lost 1%, after hitting a two-month high in the previous session. The gauge had rebounded almost 20% from its November low on signs Beijing is marginally easing real estate curbs to prevent a hard-landing.
China has since October urged banks to meet developers' ""normal"" funding needs, and allowed some real estate firms to issue more domestic bonds, fuelling hopes that Beijing is easing its deleveraging campaign against the sector. Regulators also recently showed support towards project acquisitions by big developers to aid weaker ones. 
The recent rebound ""is not backed by fundamentals,"" said Cai Hongfei, analyst at Central Wealth Securities.
""The government is still hoping troubled developers rescue themselves,"" he said, flagging that there will be a fresh wave of maturing debt next month.
Shares of Tahoe Group slumped 4.6%, having surged 21% over the past two sessions, after the company urged investors to pay attention to risks when investing in the company in an exchange filing.
After defaulting on 49.6 billion yuan worth of borrowing at the end of November, Tahoe also said in the filing it was seeking solutions through a debt restructuring.
Sichuan Languang, which has defaulted on local bonds since July, also said in a statement on Wednesday the company had made little progress in restructuring its debt. 
Its stock tumbled 7.8%, having surged some 67% this month. 
""Currently, the company's share price has sharply deviated from its fundamentals, and our business conditions continue to worsen,"" Languang said.
But some investors disregard companies' warnings. 
Shares of Beijing Dalong Weiye Real Estate Development Co surged the maximum 10% allowed for any stock on the main board in China on Wednesday, bringing this month's gains to 82%.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded mixed on Wednesday, hovering around the flatline with investors continuing to digest the risks associated with the Omicron Covid-19 variant heading into year-end.
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1% while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.3%. 
Policymakers are scrambling hard to try and contain the potential damage from the new variant, stepping up vaccination programs while reimposing partial or full lockdowns or other social distancing measures.
There was some good news from the U.K., one of the countries hardest hit by the Omicron variant so far. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would not introduce new curbs in England before Christmas and Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) of extra support for businesses hit hardest by the new surge. 
However, data released earlier Wednesday showed Britain's economy grew more slowly than previously thought in the July-September period, even before the Omicron variant threatened more economic damage.
U.K. gross domestic product increased by 1.1% in the third quarter, weaker than a preliminary estimate of growth of 1.3%.
Meanwhile in France, there was the latest reminder of the price pressures squeezing the economy, as producer prices rose 3.5% in November alone. That is due in large part to a ferocious rise in whosesale energy prices which has continued into this month due to shortages of natural gas and outages at French nuclear plants. French baseload power for February is now quoted at over 1,000 euros per megawatt-hour, around 20 times the average price seen in the last decade.
Russia increased the political pressure on the EU to approve the start of gas flows through the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. President Vladimir Putin spoke on Tuesday of a ""military-technical"" response to supposed threats to the country from alleged NATO influence in Ukraine.

In corporate news, AP Moeller-Maersk (CSE:MAERSKb) stock rose 0.5% after the Danish shipping giant agreed to buy Hong Kong-based LF Logistics for $3.6 billion in an all-cash deal, as it seeks to expand beyond its core ocean freight business.
Delivery Hero (DE:DHER) stock jumped 5.8% after the German food delivery group said it would scale down its Foodpanda operations in Germany and sell the subsidiary's Japan unit, citing increased competition and labour shortages.
Oil prices stabilized Wednesday, helped by an industry report pointing to another sharp drop in U.S. crude stockpiles but with traders reluctant to push the market too much higher given the ongoing concerns over the rapid spread of Omicron cases globally.
The American Petroleum Institute reported crude stockpiles fell by 3.67 million barrels last week, a larger draw than the 2.63-million-barrel drop expected and much larger than last week’s 815,000-barrel fall. If confirmed by government data later on Wednesday, it would be a fourth weekly draw.

TOKYO (Reuters) -The chief executive of Japanese online financial conglomerate SBI Holdings Inc said on Wednesday it is exploring the possibility of taking its listed subsidiary Shinsei Bank Ltd private to return $3 billion in public funds.
A delisting would be a key milestone for Shinsei, which has been unable to repay the public money its predecessor bank received two decades ago as its shares have long underperformed over years of low interest rates in Japan.
""It's an option worth pursuing,"" SBI's chief executive, Yoshitaka Kitao, told a news conference.
The group took effective control of mid-size lender Shinsei in a tender offer this month.
Kitao said the group has begun the talks on the possibility and planned to discuss it with the regulator, the Financial Services Agency.
He said he would consider a range of possibilities including allowing Shinsei's minority investors to swap their shares for SBI shares.
Shinsei Bank, with a market capitalisation of nearly 500 billion yen, still owes the government 350 billion yen ($3.09 billion) in public money.
As a result, the government still owns about 20% of Shinsei. In order for it to recoup the full amount lent by selling shares on the market, Shinsei stock would need to go up to 7,450 yen. Its shares closed up 5.9% at 1,907 yen on Wednesday.
Shinsei shares have struggled since its initial public offering in 2004, giving a total return of minus 74%, according to Refinitiv.
SBI, the financial unit of SoftBank Group until the firm left SoftBank in 2006, first took a stake in Shinsei after private equity investor JC Flowers & Co sold down its holding in 2019.
JC Flowers, together with buyout fund Ripplewood, bought Shinsei's predecessor bank after it went bankrupt in Japan's late 1990s banking crisis.

That made it the first Japanese lender to be owned by foreign investors and the subsequent initial public offering generated a huge profit for JC Flowers and Ripplewood.

512,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2021 01:21AM ET</span>",Analysis - Weak winds worsened Europe's power crunch; utilities need better storage,"By Nora Buli and Stine Jacobsen
OSLO/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Wind speeds were milder than usual in Europe this year, so windmills across the bloc generated less electricity which worsened a crunch that sent power prices to record highs as utilities had to buy more coal and scarce, costly, natural gas.
The situation illustrated a challenge facing the European Union as it tries to boost renewable power and meet its climate targets: Power prices can soar when the wind dies down, so generators need ways to store some of the excess power when winds are strong.
""If we had high winds or just reasonable winds over that period, we wouldn't have seen these price spikes,"" said Rory McCarthy, principal analyst at Wood Mackenzie.
Less wind power increased demand at thermal power plants, but tight natural gas supplies raised their costs. The worldwide spike in gas prices drove up energy bills for businesses and consumers. Some heavy industry had to cut supplies and some power suppliers went out of business. 
Europe's largest wind producers Britain, Germany and Denmark harnessed just 14% of installed capacity, in the third quarter, when gas prices hit record highs, compared with an average of 20-26% seen in previous years, according to Refinitiv data. (Graphic: Capacity Factors Wind, https://graphics.reuters.com/POWER-PRICES/lgpdwoymbvo/chart.png) 
In Germany, Europe's largest economy with the continent's highest wind power capacity, combined output from both on and offshore wind farms fell around 16% this year-to-date, Bruno Burger, an analyst at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute, told Reuters. (Graphic: Full Load Hours German Wind Turbines, https://graphics.reuters.com/POWER-PRICES/gdpzymorkvw/chart.png) 
Wind power generation has low operating costs, offering cheaper wholesale power than thermal plants that must pay for fuel, along with costs associated with carbon emissions.
This makes wholesale electricity prices lower at times of high wind, leading to lower consumer bills. Weaker wind periods, which are not uncommon, cause prices to rise and more thermal plants are needed.
Anna Borg, chief executive of Swedish utility Vattenfall sees two lessons. First, ""the market will be more volatile going forward and that the market needs to adapt to that,"" she told Reuters. 
Also, ""there is an evident need and also a value in flexibility services and storage. ... I think we are only at the beginning of the development of that kind of business model."" 
Utilities across Europe are starting to invest in storage systems including large batteries or smart charging solutions for electric cars. 
Several countries are also seeking to reward flexible consumer behaviour such as industrial customers curbing demand at certain hours. Better matching supply and demand can help maintain grid stability.
Europe currently invests 40 billion euros a year on power grids, according to lobby group WindEurope which estimates that annual investments need to double over the next thirty years to 66-80 billion euros a year. 
BUILD MORE
Both the European Commission and International Energy Agency (IEA) said recent record energy prices should not slow the effort to meet climate targets under the Paris agreement by moving away from fossil fuels.
Instead, governments should help boost capacity of wind and other renewable power sources, ensuring more overall output and avoiding the need for reliance on fossil fuels as backup. 
""The more renewable energy we can build, the more electricity will come from those sources and the less coal and gas is needed for electricity production,"" Christian Rynning-Toennesen, head of Norwegian utility Statkraft, told Reuters.
""So we think the trend (for renewable energy growth) will continue and be strengthened by these electricity prices, rather than slowed down,"" he said.
But some believe the energy transition may already be getting ahead of itself. Sindre Knutsson, vice president markets at consultancy Rystad Energy told Reuters Europe is turning away from fossil fuels too quickly.
Knutsson noted that more coal-fired plants capable of stable power generation are being decommissioned together with nuclear.
""It's no secret that we will use renewables to generate electricity in the future. But at the moment, we're still relying on fossil fuels,"" he said. 
Low or zero-emissions back-up capacity for periods of low wind or solar supply such as batteries, hydrogen or carbon capture and storage are still more than a decade away from being available at scale, agreed Matthew Jones, lead analyst for EU Power at ICIS.
""So for the moment thermal capacity is required,"" he told Reuters.EARNINGS HIT
Earnings at several European wind power generators were hit by this year's wind lulls, but the companies remain committed to increasing capacity.
The world's biggest developer of offshore wind farms, Orsted (OTC:DOGEF) said the lower wind speeds had a negative 2.5 billion crowns ($379.20 million) impact for the first nine months of the year compared to 2020. 
Germany's RWE said weaker winds caused profits at its wind and solar units to fall by 38% in the first nine months of the year.
There was nothing to suggest that climate change itself played a role in the lower wind speeds, companies in the sector said.
""We follow it on a daily basis, but we see nothing which indicate that there is a long-term change coming,"" Orsted’s head of Continental Europe, Rasmus Errboe, told Reuters.
Statkraft also regularly measures wind speeds and conditions but had not seen any extraordinary adjustments to its data, according to its CEO.
""To my knowledge, there's not any pattern that we can see,"" Rynning-Toennesen said. 
VOLATILITY
More renewables will make prices more volatile in the short to mid term, as weather will largely dictate prices, the heads of two power trading firms agreed.
""It will become common for the electricity market in Europe to have a very high degree of volatility because that will just be the nature of the assets that we are bringing online and the nature of the assets that we are taking offline,"" said chief executive at trading firm InCommodities, Jesper Johanson. 
Power traders, who typically profit from gyrating conditions, say the market can handle the higher volatility, and price spikes provide investors with an incentive to fund back-up solutions.
""In order to get commercial investments going into different kind of storage, like batteries, the market needs to give that price signal. There needs to be volatility and the stronger that price signal is, the more investments we will see,"" Johanson added. (Graphic: Next-Day Power Prices 2020-2021, https://graphics.reuters.com/POWER-PRICES/gkvlglogwpb/chart.png) 

High prices should favour construction of more renewable energy, agreed Anders Bauditz, chief executive of trading firm Norlys Energy Trading.
""Hopefully, the politicians have seen these price extremes over the last few months and will do the tally and then realize that probably we need to push for even more green energy and then figure out how we solve the problem with the intermittency,"" he told Reuters.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has denied Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s bid to exclude a shareholder proposal that would require the company to inform investors about its use of non-disclosure agreements and other concealment clauses, according to a document viewed by Reuters.
The move means that Apple will have to face a vote on the proposal at its annual shareholder meeting next year, barring a deal with the activist. Apple has said its policy is not to use concealment clauses, but former employees dispute that. 
In September, investor Nia Impact Capital filed a shareholder proposal calling for Apple's board to prepare a ""public report assessing the potential risks to the company associated with its use of concealment clauses in the context of harassment, discrimination and other unlawful acts.""
Apple in October filed a response with the SEC saying it wanted to exclude the proposal because ""the company’s policy is to not use such clauses.""
In a letter dated Monday, the SEC denied Apple's request, saying that the company had not ""substantially implemented the proposal.""
An Apple spokesperson declined to comment on the SEC letter. The company has previously said it does not discuss specific employee matters and is ""deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace.""
After viewing Apple's response to the SEC on the shareholder proposal, former Apple employee Cher Scarlett said she filed an SEC whistleblower complaint in October alleging that the company had made false and misleading statements to the regulator. She said she later shared documents with Nia Impact Capital.

Former Apple employee Ashley Gjovik also filed an SEC whistleblower complaint in October alleging Apple made false statements to the agency.
Large companies like Apple routinely ask permission to skip shareholder proposals, requests the SEC traditionally grants about half the time.

Alibaba Cloud did not immediately report vulnerabilities in the popular, open-source logging framework Apache (NASDAQ:APA) Log4j2 to China's telecommunications regulator, according to 21st Century Business Herald, citing a recent notice by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).
In response, MIIT suspended a cooperative partnership with the cloud unit regarding cybersecurity threats and information-sharing platforms, to be reassessed in six months and revived depending on the company's internal reforms, the notice said.
This latest measure highlights Beijing's desire to strengthen control over key online infrastructure and data in the name of national security. The Chinese government has asked state-owned companies to migrate their data from private operators such as Alibaba and Tencent to a state-backed cloud system by next year.
The suspension highlights Beijing's concern at a vulnerability that has triggered a wave of panic among corporations and governments around the world. Apache Log4j2 is a Java-based tool that is widely used in enterprise systems and web applications.
“This vulnerability may lead to remote control of equipment, which may lead to serious harms such as the theft of sensitive information and interruption of equipment services. It is a high-risk vulnerability,"" the telecommunications regulator said in a statement last week.
Alibaba Cloud recently discovered a remote code execution vulnerability in the Apache Log4j2 component, notifying the U.S.-based Apache Software Foundation, according to the statement.

MIIT said it then received a report from a third party about the issue, rather than from Alibaba Cloud.
Alibaba Cloud declined to comment on the suspension.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Wednesday morning, but concerns about the omicron COVID-19 variant’s economic impact cooled a global stock market rally.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched up 0.06% by 9:01 PM ET (2:01 AM GMT), with the Bank of Japan Governor releasing the minutes from its latest meeting on Wednesday.
South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.33% while in Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.26%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.75%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.05% and the Shenzhen Component was up 0.39%, with a gauge of Chinese shares traded in the U.S. climbing about 7%.
Contributing to improving sentiment, U.S. President Joe Biden said it is still possible to reach a deal with Senator Joe Manchin to push the $2 trillion Build Back Better bill through Congress.
However, thinner volumes as the holidays approach could exacerbate market swings and omicron concerns are also continuing to cast a shadow over the outlook.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ruled out tighter restrictive measures before the holidays but urged caution. Germany will likely limit gatherings to 10 people and France is limiting New Year’s Eve celebrations.
Some investors still remained optimistic, with Wealth Enhancement Group senior vice president Nicole Webb telling Bloomberg that the global reopening narrative will in time gain traction again.
“While this variant is significant and the impact is powerful, I do still have my rose-colored glasses heading into 2022 because below the surface there is still a lot of opportunity” away from trades that are played out or frothy, said Webb.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration could also authorize two COVID-19 pills from  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and  Merck & Co . Inc. (NYSE:MRK) as soon as this week.
“We’ve got a wave of COVID-19, but the undertow at least with each successive wave seems to be weaker. We’re on a very, very strong footing financially and economically speaking. So we think that the markets and investors will be able to withstand that,” UBS Private Wealth Management managing director Rod von Lipsey told Bloomberg.
Other investors warned of continuous volatility ahead.
“Whipsaw price action continues ahead of the holiday season,” OANDA senior market analyst Craig Erlam said in a note, which added that “these are illiquid markets and omicron continues to be a huge cloud of uncertainty over them.”"

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Tuesday finalized a reversal of a rule issued under then-U.S. President Donald Trump that sought to pre-empt California's vehicle emissions regulations.
The Department of Transportation said it was issuing final rules rescinding the Trump action, which sought to bar the most populous state in the nation from setting vehicle rules that might conflict with the federal government's authority to set Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirements.
The program, in place since 1975, sets vehicle fuel efficiency requirements.
""States can now actively pursue solutions to address the climate crisis and environmental challenges in their communities,"" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement.
About two dozen U.S. states sued to block a pair of Trump actions that sought to remove California from vehicle emissions regulations, while major automakers had backed the effort. The Republican president often clashed with California.
Soon after Democrat Joe Biden was elected president in November 2020, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) reversed course and opted to no longer back the Trump administration’s effort to bar California from setting its own emissions rules. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) separately has moved to reverse the Trump administration's 2019 decision to withdraw California's legal authority to set vehicle emissions rules and set zero-emission vehicle mandates.
The EPA in 2013 granted California a waiver for its tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions and zero-emission vehicle regulations.
A total of 14 states have adopted California's vehicle-emission rules and 11 have adopted its zero-emission vehicle mandates.
On Monday, the EPA finalized new vehicle emissions requirements through 2026 that reverse Trump's rollback of car pollution cuts and will speed a U.S. shift to more electric vehicles (EVs). The rule will reduce U.S. gasoline consumption by 15% through 2050, the EPA said, or more than 440 million barrels.
If expressed in miles per gallon (mpg) requirements, the EPA rules would result in real-world average for new cars and trucks of about 40 mpg in 2026, versus 38 mpg under the August proposal and 32 mpg under the Trump rules.

Biden wants 50% of all new vehicles sold in 2030 to be EV or plug-in hybrid models but has not endorsed California's plan to phase out new gasoline-powered light-duty vehicles by 2035.
The Transportation Department next year is expected to finalize its rewrite of CAFE standards.

Demand for cybersecurity software has been robust as more businesses and government organizations migrate to cloud-based solutions to support remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic.
BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) posted third-quarter cybersecurity revenue of $128 million and forecast that to be between $125 million and $135 million in the fourth quarter, below an estimate of $143 million by one analyst, according to Refinitiv data.
U.S. shares of the company fell 1.2% to $9.14 in extended trading. 
Chief Executive Officer John Chen said on a conference call that BlackBerry expects automotive supply chain issues to ease in the fourth quarter and help boost demand for its QNX car software, used by automakers including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW and Ford Motor (NYSE:F).
BlackBerry reported a net profit of $74 million in the third quarter, compared with a loss of $130 million a year earlier.

Excluding items, the company broke even on a per-share basis, beating analysts' average estimate of a loss of 7 cents per share.
Revenue fell to $184 million for the quarter ended Nov. 30, from $218 million a year earlier, but beat analysts' average expectation of $177.25 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes closed sharply higher on Tuesday, with strength in travel and tech shares as well as in  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) following their earnings, as stocks rebounded from a coronavirus-fueled rout the session before.
The rapidly spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus has rattled stock markets around the world, triggering volatility in the final month of 2021, which has otherwise been a strong year for equities.
Gains in massive technology and tech-related stocks such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) lifted indexes on Tuesday, as did increases in economically sensitive groups such as energy. Travel-related stocks surged, with Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp,  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) and  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) Group among the top percentage gainers on the S&P 500.
“It is clearly a risk-on day,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) in Boston. ""This is clearly, at least for the day, investors saying, 'You know what, we are going to be able to ride through this Omicron surge and come out the other side in pretty good shape.’”

Defensive sectors that have led in December lagged on Tuesday, with consumer staples and utilities posting slim declines.
Nike shares rose 6.1% after the sports apparel company's results beat quarterly estimates for profit and revenue, and it said it was more confident that supply chain issues would ease in its next fiscal year.
Micron Technology shares jumped 10.5% after the chip company forecast second-quarter sales and profits will beat estimates with shortages easing in 2022. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index rose 3.4%.

 General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) shares fell 4% after the consumer staples company missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit.

World shares had fallen earlier in the week after Omicron infections multiplied around the world, but strong corporate earnings and reports that  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's COVID-19 vaccine provides protection against the variant gave investors hope on Tuesday. U.S. stocks had also taken a hit after Biden's $1.75 trillion spending bill was dealt a potentially fatal blow on Sunday.

Brent crude settled up $2.46, or 3.4%, at $73.98 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose $2.51, or 3.7%, to $71.12 a barrel.
The United States is considering cutting quarantine time for people with COVID-19. The CEO of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) asked the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to slash quarantine time to five days from 10. 
A somber U.S. trading session on Monday underscored market fears that rapidly rising cases of the coronavirus variant would yet again force governments around the world to impose lockdown measures, potentially choking off fragile economic recoveries from similar measures earlier in the year.
Still, investors on Tuesday were cautiously optimistic that the economic hit would be less severe this time, as they bought stocks and sold perceived safe-haven currencies such as the dollar and Japanese yen.
The U.S. Dollar Currency Index fell slightly as investors ploughed money into riskier currencies.
The yen, considered a safe-haven asset, was flat versus the greenback at 114.08 per dollar. 

U.S. Treasury yields rose on Tuesday as traders set their sights on optimistic economic conditions, and brushed aside inflation fears at a 20-year bond auction.
Elsewhere, cryptocurrencies - which often offer a reliable gauge to risk sentiment - gained ground. Bitcoin added more than 4% after trending lower in recent weeks.

San Francisco (Reuters) - Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket company has reported 132 COVID-19 cases at its California headquarters, a fourth of the total number of cases in non-residential locations in Los Angeles County, according to county data.
The latest cases mark the second time a large number of COVID-19 cases have been reported at a company headed by Musk. Electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc reported 440 cases at its factory in Fremont in Northern California from May to December 2020, according to Alameda County data obtained by legal information site Plainsite.
In an internal email to employees on Monday, SpaceX said the 132 cases had been reported since September, when ""several employees who work in the same area contracted COVID outside of work at a non-work-related event."" 
""Again, it does not mean 132 employees in Hawthorne have COVID today or contracted it in the workplace,"" it said, referring to the Los Angeles-area city that is home to SpaceX's headquarters.
Asked for comment, SpaceX shared the internal email.
A total of 496 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in nonresidential locations such as workplaces, food and retail stores, and places of worship, Los Angeles County said, without elaborating on the time frame for those cases. SpaceX posted the highest number of cases in the county, followed by FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX)'s Los Angeles office with 85 cases.

SpaceX is the most well-established player in the burgeoning constellation of commercial rocket ventures. It has already launched numerous cargo payloads and astronauts to the International Space Station for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Shares of Brazilian planemaker  Embraer SA  (NYSE:ERJ) soared on Tuesday after the company said it had agreed to combine its electric aircraft subsidiary Eve with Zanite SPAC and list it on the New York Stock Exchange.
The transaction values Eve's equity at $2.9 billion and will include the combination with Zanite Acquisition Corp and an additional investment by a group of investors that includes Embraer, Zanite, financial investors and strategic partners such as Azorra Aviation, BAE Systems (OTC:BAESF), Republic Airways, Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) and  SkyWest  (NASDAQ:SKYW) Inc.
After the transactions, Eve - which will be listed on NYSE under the ticker EVEX - will have a $512 million cash position that will be used to develop its flying taxi. The firm is expected to start trading in the second quarter of 2022, after the closing of the deal with Zanite.
Eve already has an order pipeline of more than $5 billion. Among the customers with pre-orders are lessors, helicopter operators and ride-sharing companies. 
After announcing Eve's listing, Embraer also disclosed new orders. Florida-based Azorra, one of the Eve investors, ordered 200 electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft from Eve. Republic Airways, also an investor, placed an order for up to 200 eVTOLs, aiming to implement an eVTOL network throughout the U.S. Central and East Coast markets.
Skywest ordered 100 electric aircraft looking to develop a regional chain in the U.S., while BAE Systems will work with Eve to explore the development of its eVTOLs for the defense market. Both are also part of the same investor group.
Brazil-traded shares in Embraer skyrocketed after the announcement, closing up 16% at 23.10 reais. U.S.-listed shares of the company also jumped to close at $16.07, a 15.6% rise.
Embraer will own more than 80% of Eve after the SPAC combination and additional investment from the group. Eve's cash position is expected to be enough to fund the flying taxi development through its certification, expected for 2025, Embraer CEO Francisco Gomes Neto told Reuters.
Itau BBA analysts said the deal beat their own projections, noting that Eve's $2.9 billion valuation implies a ratio of $12 per U.S.-traded Embraer share, which is 110% more than the $5.7 per share they had incorporated in their $21 target price for Embraer shares at the end of 2022.
""Our calculation was based on a $2 billion (valuation) for Eve and a 50% stake from Embraer,"" they said.
Gomes Neto said in an interview that Eve will probably have multiple production sites to deliver to customers in different continents, but the locations have not yet been chosen. Gomes Neto expects Eve to reach $4.5 billion in revenue by 2030, with around 15% of the global urban air mobility market.
The production phase will probably be funded by debt, said Eve's co-CEO Jerry DeMuro, former BAE Systems CEO. Eve's other co-CEO is Andre Stein, an Embraer executive for two decades.
Embraer will provide infrastructure to Eve, including the allocation of engineers to the projects, testing grounds and simulation equipment. 

""This will allow us to lower the costs,"" DeMuro said in an interview.
Analysts at Guide Investimentos, also calling the deal positive for Embraer, said they expected the transaction proceeds to be used to finance operations, support the company's growth and for corporate purposes in general.

The California Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, rejected South San Francisco-based See's Candies' argument that the employee, Matilde Ek, must file for workers' compensation rather than seek damages in court because her husband's death was ""derivative"" of her own workplace injury.

A lawyer for Ek could not immediately be reached for comment. Nor could the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which had weighed in with a legal brief supporting See's.
Ek and her three daughters sued See's last year, saying she contracted COVID-19 because the company failed to ensure safety in the workplace. Her husband, Arturo Ek, then got the disease from her while she was convalescing at home, and eventually died from it, she said.
See's responded that Arturo Ek's death was ""derivative"" of Ek's alleged workplace injury. That meant it was covered by workers' compensation, and Ek could not sue over it in court, the company said.

A trial court nonetheless allowed the case to go forward. See's argued on appeal that the decision was an ""outlier"" and that other courts that had considered similar COVID 19-related cases had rejected them.
The Court of Appeal, however, said Arturo Ek's death was not derivative of his wife becoming sick, but was instead caused directly by the COVID-19 virus, for which his wife served as a ""conduit."" It cited a decision by a federal appeals court allowing a similar case over a hepatitis infection.

530,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2021 05:22PM ET</span>","NatWest pleads guilty to U.S. fraud charges, to pay $35 million","By Chris Prentice and Iain Withers
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A unit of NatWest Group on Tuesday agreed to pay about $35 million and pleaded guilty to wire and securities fraud in relation to a long-running scheme by some of its traders to manipulate U.S. Treasury debt markets.
The lender's investment bank NatWest Markets admitted its traders engaged in schemes to manipulate U.S. Treasury markets over a decade up to 2018. The firm agreed to serve three years of probation in addition to the fine and restitution, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement.
The fine is another setback for the British state-backed bank’s efforts to clean up its image under Chief Executive Alison Rose, including a rebrand of the group from the scandal-tainted Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS_old_old) name last year. The bank is still majority-owned by British taxpayers after its bailout in the 2008 financial crisis.
Tuesday's plea agreement comes little more than a week after NatWest was fined 265 million pounds ($352 million) by a British court for failing to prevent the laundering of nearly 400 million pounds, some of it deposited at a branch in bin bags.
Still, some said that Tuesday's penalty was too light. 
""It's good that DOJ required the bank to plead guilty, pay a fine and restitution, and be on probation for three years, but it’s not enough,"" said Dennis Kelleher, head of the Better Markets think tank on financial regulation.
NatWest traders in Connecticut, London and Singapore engaged in schemes in which they manipulated Treasury market prices through a practice known as ""spoofing,"" according to Tuesday's court filings. 
U.S. authorities have aggressively pursued the practice, a tactic designed to create a false appearance of demand, investigating similar activity by traders at other big banks, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Since 2019, the Justice Department, working with the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, has ramped up scrutiny through a specialist unit within its Washington-based fraud division. 
From 2008 to May 2014 and for another three months in 2018, traders for NatWest Markets engaged in these schemes in the secondary market for bills, notes, bonds and other related Treasury instruments, according to Tuesday's filings.
Robert Begbie, NatWest Market's chief executive officer, said in a statement that the firm regrets the ""past behaviour of a small number of former employees."" 
""The behaviour of these individuals was unacceptable and has no place in the bank we are today,"" he said.

The criminal penalty of $25.2 million and other payments will cover both spoofing-related charges as well as a breach of a prior agreement with the Justice Department, NatWest said.
In September, NatWest said prosecutors warned the bank it was in breach of a previous settlement because of traders' misconduct, referring to a 2017 deal in which the Justice Department agreed not to prosecute the lender for alleged fraudulent trading of mortgage-backed securities.

(Reuters) -Workers at Kellogg (NYSE:K) Co's U.S. breakfast cereal plants voted in favor of a new contract that offers better terms for transitional employees and across-the-board wage increases, ending a weeks-long strike, the company said on Tuesday.
The five-year contract ends the stalemate between the Froot Loops maker and its factory workers in Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania and Tennessee that had prompted the company to warn of permanently replacing striking employees, drawing criticism from President Joe Biden.
The union said the highlights of the new agreement included no permanent two-tier system, in which lower-tier workers make less than longer-tenured workers.
""This agreement makes gains and does not include any concessions,"" said Anthony Shelton, president of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union.
Around 1,400 workers went on a strike since Oct. 5 after their contracts expired, as negotiations over payment and benefits stalled amid a tightening labor market.
""It will be difficult to go back. There is a lot of tarnished relationships that we will work diligently to repair,"" said Dan Osborn, president of the local union in Omaha, adding the employees would return to work on Dec. 27.
The labor strike saw Senator Bernie Sanders rally with the striking workers in Michigan, while it also triggered calls for a boycott of Kellogg's products by consumers on social media platforms Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Reddit.

""Well deserved, Kellogg's workers! Also happy I can buy Cheez-its (sic) again,"" a Twitter user said on Tuesday, while another tweeted: ""Froot Loops party!""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Delta Air Lines Inc's chief executive asked the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday to shrink quarantine guidelines for fully vaccinated individuals who experience breakthrough COVID-19 infections, citing the impact on the carrier's workforce.
CEO Ed Bastian, along with the company's chief health officer and a medical adviser, asked in a letter to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky seen by Reuters that the agency's recommended quarantine period for anyone who tests positive with a breakthrough COVID-19 infection be reduced to five days from the current 10.
The letter suggested that individuals could end isolation with appropriate testing.
White House medical adviser Anthony Fauci said on Tuesday that U.S. health authorities are considering reducing the 10-day recommended quarantine period for Americans testing positive for COVID-19 as the Omicron variant tears across the country.
The CDC declined to comment.
""With the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, the 10-day isolation for those who are fully vaccinated may significantly impact our workforce and operations,"" Bastian wrote. ""Similar to healthcare, police, fire, and public transportation workforces, the Omicron surge may exacerbate shortages and create significant disruptions.""
Bastian noted the current guidance was developed in 2020 ""when the pandemic was in a different phase without effective 
vaccines and treatments.""
Delta said that ""as part of this policy change, we would be interested to partner with CDC and collect empirical data.""

Bastian said more than 90% of Delta's workforce is ""fully vaccinated, and those rates are increasing daily.""
He also noted that ""all airline personnel are required to mask at airports and on airplanes."" The Biden administration has mandated masks at all airports and on airplanes through March 18.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Wells Fargo & Co said on Tuesday it has delayed its plans for employees to return to the office ""given the changing external environment,"" according to a statement, the latest bank to adjust plans as the Omicron variant spreads.
The bank said it will announce new plans for a full return in the new year.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) had earlier set Jan. 10 for a mandatory return for many employees, including those who support business lines.
About 100,000 employees have been reporting to Wells Fargo locations throughout the pandemic, and offices are open to those who have been vaccinated and chose to use them, the company said. The bank had 254,000 employees at the end of September.
Wells Fargo's announcement is one of the latest changes to staffing plans of U.S. financial companies for coming out of the pandemic. But now the United States is being hit by a surge https://www.reuters.com/world/us/omicron-fueled-covid-wave-crashes-into-new-york-days-before-christmas-2021-12-20 in cases from the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
Omicron now accounts for 73% of all new cases in the United States, up from less than 1% at the beginning of the month.

Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) are among banks that have recently told New York City employees they may work from home during the holidays.
Still, some are sticking closer to their plans. For example,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) had not given employees that option as of Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. health authorities are considering reducing the 10-day recommended quarantine period for Americans who test positive for COVID-19 as the Omicron variant tears across the country, White House medical adviser Anthony Fauci said on Tuesday.
A spike in COVID-19 cases is alarming public health officials, who fear an explosion of infections following social mingling over the Christmas and New Year holidays. Omicron now accounts for 73% of U.S. coronavirus infections, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Monday. 
Breakthrough infections are rising among the fully vaccinated population, including those who have had a third, booster shot. However, Omicron appears to be causing milder symptoms in those people, some of whom have no symptoms at all.
Reducing the CDC's 10-day quarantine recommendation would help asymptomatic people return to work or school, with the proper precautions, Fauci told CNN. 
""That's certainly an important consideration which is being discussed right now,"" said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) Chief Executive Ed Bastian on Tuesday asked CDC Director Rochelle Walensky to shrink quarantine guidelines for fully vaccinated individuals who experience breakthrough COVID-19 infections to five days.
""With the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, the 10-day isolation for those who are fully vaccinated may significantly impact our workforce and operations,"" Bastian wrote Tuesday in a letter with airline medical advisors.
The CDC declined comment.
Delta's letter added that ""similar to healthcare, police, fire, and public transportation workforces, the Omicron surge may exacerbate shortages and create significant disruptions.""
Bastian said ""individuals would be able to end 
isolation"" with testing after five days of isolation.
The measure is being considered particularly in the context of healthcare workers, as the number of COVID cases rises along with the need for healthcare personnel, Fauci said.

With Omicron being so easily transmissible, the number to watch in this surge is hospitalizations, not overall infections.
""If you really want to look at the true impact on society, it's much more important to see who gets sick and who doesn't, who requires hospitalization, or doesn't,"" Fauci said.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 climbed Tuesday, as investors piled into energy and tech stocks following the recent Omicron-fuelled selloff, while a surge in  Nike  and Micron also bolstered sentiment on big tech. 
The S&P 500 rose 1.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.6%, or 560 points, the Nasdaq climbed 2.4%.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the Omicron variant is now the dominant strain of Covid in the U.S., representing 73% of cases compared with just 13% a week earlier.
Against the backdrop of the ongoing climb in Covid-19 cases, and potential for further restrictions to curb the spread of the new variant, investors piled into beaten down sectors such as financials as U.S. treasury yields rebounded.
Energy also rebounded from its recent malaise, up more than 2% as oil prices advanced even as the threat of the Omicron impact on energy demand persisted.  
On the earnings front, Nike and Micron were in the spotlight after delivering better-than-expected quarterly results.
Nike (NYSE:NKE) earnings of 83 cents per share topped Wall Street estimates as strong growth in the North America offset weakness in its key China market. Its share rose more than 6%.
“Overall, we remain bullish on the name, as the brand remains extremely strong, they continue to benefit from the shift to Digital, and the supply chain issues appear to be closer to the end than the beginning,” Wedbush said in a note.
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) also beat consensus estimates and issued strong guidance, driven by ongoing demand for memory and easing supply chain disruptions. Its shares gained more than 10%.
Also helping chip stocks, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) rose more than 4% after the chipmaker was flagged as “top pick” by UBS, citing a “wide moat.”
The move higher in chip stocks coincided with a rebound in big tech once, led by Meta, formerly known as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which rose nearly 3%.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) ended the day up more than 1%.
A day after negotiations around the Biden administration's ‘Build Back Better’ spending package were brought to halt as Senator Joe Machin rejected the package, investors believe the hit to economic growth will be manageable.
The failure of the package in its current form will take “a bite out of GDP and spending growth in early 2022, but the overall consequences should be manageable,”Morgan Stanley said.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes jumped on Tuesday, with strength in travel and tech shares as well as in  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) following their earnings, as stocks rebounded from a coronavirus-fueled rout the session before.
The rapidly spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus has rattled stock markets around the world, triggering volatility in the final month of 2021, which has otherwise been a strong year for equities.
Gains in massive technology and tech-related stocks such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) lifted indexes on Tuesday, as did increases in economically sensitive groups such as energy.

“It is clearly a risk-on day,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) in Boston. ""This is clearly, at least for the day, investors saying, 'You know what, we are going to be able to ride through this Omicron surge and come out the other side in pretty good shape.’”
Defensive sectors, such as consumer staples and utilities that have led in December, lagged on Tuesday.
Nike shares rose after the sports apparel company's results beat quarterly estimates for profit and revenue, and it said it was more confident that supply chain issues would ease in its next fiscal year.
Micron Technology shares jumped after the chip company forecast second-quarter sales and profits will beat estimates with shortages easing in 2022.
“If Micron’s forecast is strong, that tells us broadly speaking that demand is strong across many different industries,” said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management, adding that Micron's products ""go into so many different industrial applications"".
 General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) shares fell after the consumer staples company missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit.

And given Goldman Sachs’ (GS) and Morgan Stanley’s (MS) bullish outlook on the country’s growth prospects, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally sound Japan-based stocks Honda Motor (HMC), Sumitomo Mitsui Financial (NYSE:SMFG), and Canon (CAJ). Let’s discuss.While most economies are still grappling with the rapidly spreading COVID-19 omicron variant, Japan is boasting a high vaccination rate. According to Statista, as of November 30, 2021, more than 72% of the third-largest economy’s population was fully vaccinated (two doses). The country is also accelerating COVID-19 booster shots and securing oral medicines, which will likely help the economy recover faster.
According to a Reuters report, the Japanese government is considering raising its economic growth forecast for fiscal 2022, accounting for its record $490 billion stimulus package. In addition,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc. (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) provided a positive outlook on Japan’s growth prospects, given its low inflation, cheap valuation, and high vaccination rates. They have set a 2,250 12-month target for the benchmark Topix index.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on quality Japan-based stocks Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC),  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group , Inc. (SMFG), and Canon Inc. (CAJ). They are trading at discounts to their peers and have immense growth potential.

Investing.com - President Joe Biden on Tuesday ruled out the possibility of returning to the national pandemic lockdown of March 2020, as the Omicron variant of Covid-19 sweeps across the U.S., citing increased vaccination and medical expertise. 
Biden said the U.S. would ""absolutely not"" be returning to national pandemic lockdown seen in March last year.
""Thanks to the progress of vaccinations, we've gone from nearly 90 million adults in July that hadn't even started vaccinations yet to fewer than 14 million today,"" Biden said.
Biden also ruled out the possibility of closing schools down as increased resources and know-how would allow schools to stay open even if a student tests positive for Covid-19.   
""[Last year] I thought the only way to keep your children safe was the closures as our schools, but today we know more, we have more resources to keep those schools open,"" Biden said. ""If a student tests positive, others can test and stay in the classroom.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials are considering tough export control measures to disrupt Russia's economy should Russian President Vladmir Putin invade Ukraine, a Biden administration official told Reuters.
The measures, to be discussed in a meeting of senior officials on Tuesday, would be in addition to economic sanctions the Biden administration is contemplating should Russia invade, after massing tens of thousands of troops along the Ukrainian border.
U.S. President Joe Biden has threatened devastating actions against Russia, to try to warn Putin off any possible military incursion. Putin has denied that Russia plans an invasion. 
Measures to be discussed at the White House meeting include ""extraordinary"" export control measures that could choke off broad swaths of industrial and consumer technologies to Russia, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The measures being discussed could halt Russia’s ability to import smartphones, key aircraft and automobile components, and materials from many other sectors. They could have a major impact on Russian consumers, industrial operations, and employment, the official said.
The official said the potential measures would be unprecedented for Russia. They would employ tools used by former President Donald Trump's administration, and carried forward by the Biden administration, to block Chinese telecommunications company Huawei from accessing advanced semiconductors.
The basis of such an action is the fact that semiconductors that go into Huawei phones include parts that were designed in the United States, the official said. This can touch chips all around the world based on the fact that key U.S. input went into them, the official said.

U.S. officials plan to consult closely with key partners in Europe and Asia that could be implicated by these measures and to encourage coordinated efforts where appropriate, the official said.
Russia's cellphone market is dominated by foreign companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung (KS:005930) and Huawei , which became subject to a new Russia law this year requiring them to install Russian software.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 jumped Tuesday, as investors swooped in to buy beaten down cyclical stocks following the Omicron-fuelled selloff, while a surge in  Nike  and Micron also lifted markets.
The S&P 500 rose 1.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.5%, or 537 points, the Nasdaq climbed 2.2%.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the Omicron variant is now the dominant strain of Covid in the U.S., representing 73% of cases compared with just 13% a week earlier.
Against the backdrop of the ongoing climb in Covid-19 cases, and potential for further restrictions to curb the spread of the new variant, investors piled into beaten sectors such as financials as U.S. treasury yields rebounded.
On the earnings front, Nike and Micron were in the spotlight after delivering better-than-expected quarterly results.
Nike (NYSE:NKE) earnings of 83 cents per share topped Wall Street estimates as strong growth in the North America offset weakness in its key China market. Its share rose more than 6%.
“Overall, we remain bullish on the name, as the brand remains extremely strong, they continue to benefit from the shift to Digital, and the supply chain issues appear to be closer to the end than the beginning,” Wedbush said in a note.
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) also beat consensus estimates and issued strong guidance, driven by ongoing demand for memory and easing supply chain disruptions.

MEXICO CITY/HOUSTON (Reuters) -A pair of New York businessmen filed a lawsuit in a U.S. court seeking to block Mexico's state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) from taking control of a Texas refinery, claiming the sale would raise U.S. gasoline prices.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) in May agreed to sell its majority stake in the 302,800 barrel per day (bpd) Deer Park refinery outside Houston to Pemex, its long-time partner in the plant, for about $596 million.
The lawsuit, filed in a U.S. District Court in Houston last week, alleges a sale would lead to ""substantially less competition"" in gasoline and ""significantly increase"" the plaintiffs' energy costs. They asked the court to block the sale permanently or force Pemex to divest its holdings. 
The deal has been delayed by an ongoing review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a national security group that can block or set restrictions on foreign purchases of U.S. businesses. The CFIUS launched a second 45-day review that halted Pemex's plans to complete the sale this year. 
Pemex did not respond to requests for comment. 
Spokespeople for Shell, the CFIUS and U.S. Treasury Department declined to comment. 
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said the deal would move Mexico closer to energy self-sufficiency. He has promised to replace fuel imports by producing more domestically. Mexico this year imported about 60% of its motor fuel needs.
Lopez Obrador has complained that the 28-year-old joint venture https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/shell-sell-interest-deer-park-refinery-partner-pemex-2021-05-24 with Shell had not been good for Mexico as dividends have been not been repatriated.
Aaron Hagele and Andrew Sarcinella, owners of a Mt. Vernon, N.Y., coin-operated laundromat who filed the lawsuit, said their business would suffer ""an incalculable but evident"" effect if more of Deer Park's output is exported. 

Mark Lavery, an attorney for the pair, told Reuters Deer Park provides up to 2.5% of U.S. gasoline use and higher exports would reduce competition and lead to increased prices. 
""This is a critical time right now in the gasoline market in the United States,"" he said, echoing criticism of high prices by U.S. President Joe Biden.

MILAN (Reuters) - An Italian supplier at the centre of recent industrial snags on the 787 Dreamliner airplane produced more than 4,000 non-compliant parts destined for Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co over five years, a preliminary report from Italian prosecutors shows. 
Initial results of an investigation launched earlier this year suggest that Manufacturing Process Specification (MPS), or its now-bankrupt predecessor company Processi Speciali, produced flawed parts between 2016 and 2021, according to the document.
According to the report, seen by Reuters, the suspect titanium parts made it into 35 Boeing 787 fuselages. 
It added that the Brindisi-based supplier also made parts for the Boeing 767, a freighter model which is now also used as the basis for a U.S. Air Force tanker.
The investigation aims to establish whether MPS or its predecessor firm produced flawed components that could threaten air safety, a risk that has been denied by Boeing.
Boeing declined direct comment on the prosecutors' document, parts of which were first reported by Italian daily Il Corriere del Mezzogiorno. It reiterated, however, that airworthiness had not been affected. 
""While our assessment is ongoing, this does not present an immediate safety of flight concern,"" a spokesperson said. 
In October, Boeing said some 787 Dreamliner parts supplied by MPS had been improperly manufactured over the previous three years, marking the latest in a series of industrial snags to hit the airliner.
Italy's Leonardo, which was the immediate customer for parts made by MPS and has said it too is a victim of the suspected failure to meet specifications, declined comment.
A lawyer for former MPS Chief Executive Antonio Ingrosso, as well as for the former chief executive of its now-bankrupt predecessor Processi Speciali, also declined to comment.
The U.S. Air Force did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether suspect parts had reached any of its 767-based KC-46 tankers, the first of which was delivered in 2019.
DOORFRAME
The report emerged days after Italian prosecutors ordered the seizure of components intended for Boeing 787s from a Leonardo plant in Grottaglie, southern Italy.
MPS was a sub-supplier until this year for two sections of 787 fuselage made by Leonardo, known as sections 44 and 46.
In the report, prosecutors alleged that MPS or Processi Speciali made 4,189 parts using ""titanium and aluminium of different quality and origin"" from those ordered by the customer, breaching the relevant technical specifications.
In particular, they said, it produced components using so-called 'grade 2 titanium' instead of a titanium alloy, they said, adding that the metal used had ""mechanical and structural strength properties far inferior to those of the alloy"".
The affected parts included a clip for the doorframe of the left-side cargo door of the 787, the document said. It did not provide details of any suspect parts made for the older 767.
Prosecutors allege MPS chose cheaper non-compliant metals to save costs and speed up production, resulting in a reduction of additional margins built in to the design to ensure safety.
Eight individuals, including the former head of MPS and the former head of Processi Speciali, are under investigation for fraud and for actions threatening the safety of air transport. 
Prosecutors have said the two companies are also under investigation. Leonardo, which filed a lawsuit on Dec. 7, is being viewed by prosecutors as the injured party. 
The assets and factory of MPS will be put on sale at the beginning of next year as its predecessor Processi Speciali is being wound up, another court document seen by Reuters showed.

Administrators for the companies did not reply to a request for comment. 
Prosecutors said on Saturday initial findings suggested MPS and Processi Speciali used non-compliant metals and violated technical specifications. They did not respond to Reuters request for comment on details of their preliminary report.

(Reuters) -Pardes Biosciences on Tuesday said early human testing of its experimental COVID-19 antiviral pill supports its potential as a standalone treatment and announced plans to go public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company.
If the drug, PBI-0451, proves effective in later-stage testing, it could have an advantage over similar medicines that need to be taken with a second, booster medication, such as  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s two-drug antiviral regimen, Paxlovid, now under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Pardes said it expects to complete its current Phase I study in healthy volunteers early next year. It aims to begin by mid-year a larger trial that could be used to seek regulatory approval for the COVID-19 antiviral pill.
""We're hoping to be able to move as quickly as possible and generate significant data in 2022,"" said Chief Development Officer Brian Kearney.
There are currently no authorized oral COVID-19 treatments. But they are expected to become important tools against the illness because they can be taken at home early after symptoms appear to keep people out of the hospital. 
The Pardes drug is a protease inhibitor, designed to prevent the coronavirus from replicating in human cells. That is the same class of medicine as Pfizer's nirmatrelvir, which in combination with the older antiviral ritonavir was shown to cut the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% for COVID-19 patients at high risk of severe illness. 
Ritonavir is used to extend the action of the Pfizer pill, but can also interfere with some other medicines a patient may be taking, raising the risk of complications.
""We believe the ability to have an unboosted regimen will be important,"" Pardes Chief Executive Uri Lopatin told Reuters. He said that in the United States, one in five adults are on at least one prescription medication.
Pfizer, which says the issue of drug-drug interactions is manageable, is awaiting emergency authorization from the FDA for Paxlovid.
""If you look at hepatitis C and HIV as proxies for COVID, you'll see first generation compounds come out and then over time you'll see better and better options,"" said Jim Tananbaum, founder and CEO of healthcare investment firm Foresite Capital.
Some newer hepatitis C drugs were considered to be advances in part because they were highly effective without the need for ritonavir. 

Foresite is the sponsor of FS Development Corp II, a so-called blank check company set up to raise cash for acquisitions as an alternative to a traditional initial public offering. A shareholder vote on the merger of Pardes and FS II is scheduled for Thursday.
Company officials said Pardes plans to talk with regulators about the design of a larger, global trial of PBI-0451, including the number of participants and geographic locations.

Given this backdrop, we think coal stocks China Shenhua (CSUAY), SunCoke (SXC), and Hallador (HNRG) could be solid bets this winter.Rapid economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis has caused coal to rise again in prominence as a resource to meet the country’s energy needs. Currently, the amount of electricity generated from coal is set to post a record this year. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global power generation from coal is expected to surge 9% in 2021 to 10,350 terawatt-hours, which is an all-time high, while coal demand is predicted to hit record highs in 2022 despite the drive for cleaner energy. Moreover, the sky-high natural gas prices have given coal a cost-competitive advantage.
In addition Democratic Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia has said no to the Biden administration’s proposed Build Back Better bill, which contains $555 billion spending to shift the country toward renewable energy sources. Manchin’s negative position is aligned with his state’s coal interests. Gregory Wetstone, President and Chief Executive of the American Council on Renewable Energy, said, “All of the prior conversations had been along the lines that he did not want to penalize fossil fuel.”
Coal prices are at $149 per ton, up 121.2% this year. Therefore, we think coal stocks with sound fundamentals, China Shenhua Energy Company Limited (CSUAY), SunCoke Energy, Inc. (SXC), and Hallador Energy Company (NASDAQ:HNRG), might be ideal additions to one’s portfolio this winter.

Investing.com —  Boeing Co  (NYSE:BA) shares have been given a welcome boost Tuesday, rising 5% on news that it has received an order for 19 767 freighters from package delivery company  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS).
Boeing shares are trading around the $198.21 mark. However, they are down over 7.5% in 2021. UPS shares are currently up over 2.5%.
Boeing said the order has come because of rising air cargo demand, resulting from an expansion of the e-commerce and express cargo markets. 
Despite Boeing's struggles since the start of the pandemic, freighter sales have been positive in 2021, resulting in a record-breaking year, including 80 firm orders for new widebody freighters and over 80 orders for Boeing Converted Freighters. In contrast, UPS' business and its stock price have benefitted significantly from the pandemic, with restrictions causing an increase in online shopping. 
 ""Our plan to purchase 19 aircraft and take delivery between 2023 and 2025 aligns with the strategy and capital expenditure forecast shared during our June 2021 Investor and Analyst Day. It also supports our sustainability efforts by making our fleet more efficient and improving reliability,"" said UPS U.S. Operations President Nando Cesarone. "
563,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2021 01:07PM ET</span>","Grinch hits candy cane makers with sugar shortage, twisted supply chain","By P.J. Huffstutter and Marcelo Teixeira
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Orders have been pouring into Andrew Schuman's candy cane business this year, but business has been anything but sweet.
""We're not taking new orders from new customers,"" said Schuman, chief executive officer of Hammond's, based in Denver, Colorado. ""We can't keep up with demand.""
Candy makers, like retailers and farmers, have been slammed during the pandemic with high commodity prices, labor shortages, and transportation and supply chain snarls, preventing them from fully cashing in on the holiday season.
For more than a century, Hammond's Candies has twisted and packed up the classic Christmas treat for tiny gift shops and massive grocers alike. It is the largest wholesale supplier of U.S. handmade candy canes. 
This year, Hammond's labor costs have increased 30%, yet staffing remains a problem: The company's 250-person crew is down nearly 100 people.
Hammond's is not alone.
When Sam's Club, a Walmart (NYSE:WMT) unit, placed an order for Doscher's Candy Co.'s gourmet candy canes, co-owner Greg Clark was thrilled. Still, he said, Doscher's had staff and supplies to produce about 70% of the hand-crafted candies Sam's Club wanted.
""More and more Sam's Club members are shopping for seasonal candy, including candy canes,"" a company spokeswoman said. ""In an effort to meet the anticipated demand, we increased buys from other suppliers and pulled inventory and production forward where possible.""
Total seasonal confectionery sales are up 20% over last year, for the five-week period ending Dec. 5, according to the National Confectioners Association and IRI market data. Winter holiday non-chocolate sales – including candy canes – are up more than 34% from 2020.
Retailers have increased holiday candy items per store by more than 9%; and the total amount of non-chocolate products in stores is up nearly 23%, according to the data.
Many consumers are scrambling to stock up for the holidays after missing family gatherings last year.
""This is the fourth grocery store I've hit today, trying to find enough candy canes for our tree and stockings,"" grumbled Terri Andresson, 51, browsing at Mariano's grocery store in Chicago. 
Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co, which owns Mariano's, declined to comment.
Spangler Candy Co., the largest U.S. candy cane maker, ran extra shifts this fall to meet demand, said president Kirk Vashaw. The Ohio-based firm turned away business and faced supply-chain headaches. 
""We would have the cherry flavoring scheduled to come in on Monday, but the trucks were delayed, so we would have to stop and switch over to raspberry,"" Vashaw said.
SUGAR SHORTAGES
Facing tight global supplies, some sugar suppliers have limited sales to food manufacturers. 
The U.S. imports about a quarter of its annual sugar needs, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. A swath of this year's domestic crop was destroyed when Hurricane Ida tore across Louisiana, the nation's second-largest sugarcane producing state.
    Meanwhile, freight prices are soaring, and Brazil and Thailand - two of the world's top sugar producers - had smaller-than-expected crops. Sugar prices are at a decade-high. 
    ""I've heard that some commercial buyers are looking at erythritol as a substitute sweetener,"" said Bob Cymbala, a food trader at A&J Global USA, referring to a sugar substitute made from corn.
But prices are rising for corn-based sweeteners too. Clark from Doscher's Candy said suppliers of corn syrup - used to make candy canes - are quoting a 10% hike in 2022.
    As sugar supplies tightened, the U.S. government adjusted sugar import quotas after some overseas sugar suppliers failed to deliver the product.

Rick Pasco, president of the Sweetener Users Association trade group, said candy producers are hurt by the U.S. sugar policy, which limits imports to protect local growers.
""We are only getting a fraction of what we need"" Pasco said.

Furthermore, the adoption of cloud platforms is expected to accelerate as the world’s dependence on remote activities increases.
According to a Forrester’s Research report, event-driven architecture, collaborative work management, and an increase in the use of AI bots are expected in software development next year. Also, the trends in cybersecurity measures, customer retention, low-code development adoption, and other software solutions should propel the industry’s growth.

Basically, large caps were trending sideways, while small caps and growth stocks were moving lower, and we speculated on how the divergence would resolve. Well, it quickly became clear that large-caps were going to join the party as we mostly moved lower other than a few hours following the Fed meeting which saw a huge spike higher. These gains quickly eroded away. This morning, we gapped down to make new lows in tech/small-caps/growth, while the S&P 500 (SPY) made a slightly lower high. Today's commentary will focus on the market's next move and discuss some adjustments to our strategy given the market's bearish price action. Read on below to find out more….(Please enjoy this updated version of my weekly commentary published December 20th, 2021 from the POWR Growth newsletter).
Last week, the S&P 500 ended in consolidation while the Russell 2000 was trending lower. After a brief spurt higher following the FOMC, the S&P 500 also joined the bear party and moved lower. Currently, it’s about 1.5% above its lows from early December, while the Russell 2000 tested these levels today.
The trigger for today’s move lower was Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia saying he is a No on the BBB bill. I do think this slightly lowers growth expectations given the bill’s $2 trillion size and consensus that it would be passed.

Joe Manchin Says He Can't Support Biden's 'Build Back Better' Act,"President Biden’s Build Back Better plan, if implemented, would be a boon for infrastructure companies. However, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin’s ‘no’ position on the legislative plan appears to have ruined the attempt to make a huge investment in the country’s infrastructure and social safety net. Hence, we believe it is better now to avoid fundamentally weak infrastructure stocks  Nucor  (NUE), Vulcan Materials (VMC), Martin Marietta (MLM), and Eagle Materials (NYSE:EXP). They could now witness a downturn in the coming months. Let’s discuss.President Biden’s nearly $2 trillion Build Back Better plan was expected to revamp the country’s traditional infrastructure. Therefore, the plan would have created immense opportunities for some of the country’s biggest infrastructure companies.
However, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin recently said that he could not back his party’s Build Back Better Act, making the plan’s prospects uncertain. With concerns that certain spending bill provisions could exacerbate already high inflation, Manchin has long been a holdout on the legislation. Following this decision, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) cut its U.S. growth forecast. Furthermore, the chief economist of Goldman Sachs and the team stated that “We had already expected a negative fiscal impulse for 2022 as a result of the fading support from COVID-relief legislation enacted in 2020 and 2021, and without BBB enactment, this fiscal impulse will become somewhat more negative than we had expected.”
Because Manchin’s decision could eliminate the hoped-for $2 trillion spending to build highways, roads, bridges, and other infrastructures, we think it could be wise to avoid fundamentally weak infrastructure stocks Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.

“The risk is considerable that the U.S.A. as well as large parts of Continental Europe will likely not be able to avoid stringent lockdowns over the winter months,” committee members led by Michael Strobaek wrote in a note, commenting on the 3-to-6-month horizon.
U.S. and European stocks have been retreating from record highs over the past weeks as the hawkish shift in central bank policy and Covid restrictions have weighed on appetite. Credit Suisse said that monetary officials are now more focused on fighting surging inflation and their response to economic weakness may be less forceful compared with previous waves of the pandemic.
“Even though we do not foresee a situation as drastic as at the start of the pandemic, we could face a situation in which the growth prospects are waning while central banks are forced to tighten liquidity at the same time,” the investment committee said.
At the same time, committee members said they still see upside for stocks over the next six months as robust global growth will continue over the medium term. Within equities, they prefer more cyclical markets such as Germany and Japan, while cutting the U.K. to neutral on a deteriorating earnings outlook. And they keep their underweight in government bonds.
Credit Suisse sees upside of about 11% for the MSCI AC World and MSCI U.S. indexes in the next 12 months.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Enterprise software maker  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) will look to double its clients in Latin America and increase profits in 2022, a company executive told Reuters, adding that hitting these goals will depend on cultivating the right talent. 
Oracle has some 7,000 clients across Latin America. It plans to train 40,000 young workers in a free program of social inclusion as part of its expansion plans, the company's executive vice president for Latin America, Luiz Meisler, said during a virtual interview on Monday. 
The training scheme will be available exclusively for people unable to access paid education. 
""Our estimate is that we will have 40,000 certified students ready to work in the market, which is growing a lot,"" Meisler said. He added that the numbers could be much higher amid great market demand. 
""I have much more market than my current capacity for delivery; my limit is set by how many people I can train, so I would project growth of at least double,"" he said.
Under the Oracle Next Education (ONE) program, the company hopes to create opportunities and train future professionals who face challenges in accessing education and employment across Latin America.
There are around 23 million people between the ages of 15 and 24 across Latin America who are neither working nor studying, according to the World Bank. 

Oracle is growing across Latin America as part of a process of expanding its cloud coverage and supporting strong client demand, Meisler said. 
During 2022 the company, which serves 430,000 customers in 175 countries, will establish 14 new cloud regions across five continents. The expansion will include increasing its centers in Latin America to eight, which will be based in Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Colombia.

Investing.com – Cassava Sciences stock (NASDAQ:SAVA) soared 16% Tuesday after the company said another science journal had found no evidence to support charges it had manipulated data in a 2005 publication.
The stock has more than halved since the allegations were first made in August. 
The clearance from Neuroscience journal follows similar findings in November by Journal of Neuroscience, a different publication.
The controversy began when an online post alleged that the company had manipulated research results of simufilam, its experimental drug for Alzheimer’s.
Two physicians petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to halt Cassava’s clinical study of simufilam. Disputing the validity of Cassava’s clinical biomarker data and the integrity of Western Blot Analysis, the petition’s authors said they doubted the company’s research, claiming it included images that appeared manipulated.
Cassava had then said that the biomarker data of Alzheimer’s patients was generated by  Quanterix  (NASDAQ:QTRX), an independent company, and presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference.
The company said Western Blot Analysis is foundational to the biotechnology industry and is a standard lab technique used worldwide to detect a protein of interest.
Cassava’s proposed drug for Alzheimer’s aims to restore a protein, filamin A, that its scientists say is misshaped in the blood of patients suffering from the fatal illness.

Investing.com –  Braze  stock (NASDAQ:BRZE) traded 12% higher Tuesday after the company’s third-quarter revenue rose nearly 63% year-on-year to $64 million, beating estimates.
Gross profit expanded as the cost of revenue grew at a slower pace.
The company that debuted on the Nasdaq last month provides a customer engagement platform powering interactions between consumers and brands.  
New customers, renewals and the company being able to sell higher-margin solutions drove the topline. Total customers at the end of October came in at 1,247, up from 841 as of October 31, 2020.
Subscription revenue in the quarter ended October 31 topped $59 million, rising 61%.
The company closed October with remaining performance obligations at $304 million.
It managed to trim its net quarterly loss to $8.72 million from $8.81 million in the October quarter of last year. The loss per share was narrower than analysts estimated.
The company expects fourth-quarter revenue at $65.5 million at the center of its guidance range. Full-year revenue is seen at $233 million at the midpoint of the guidance range.
Braze raised $520 million in its initial public offering that included sale of both existing and new shares. The shares listed on Nov. 17 and climbed to a high of $98.78 on Nov. 22. They have lost over 27% since.

The investment research firm said in its note that Groupon is a misunderstood company ""that has been wrongly left for dead due to an antiquated bear thesis and apathetic sell-side.""
""Market participants have completely overlooked the sizable value of Groupon’s investment in SumUp, a fast-growing fintech with a 50%+ revenue [compound annual growth rate], which we believe is worth at least $268m (and growing) or close to 40% of Groupon’s current enterprise value,"" said Prescience Point.
Groupon shares have fallen over 33% in 2021, with analysts at JPMorgan and Barclays lowering their price targets in the past few weeks. Earlier this month, Barclays told investors that Groupon's Goods and Travel categories ""may never recover.""
Prescience evidently disagrees, saying the market is ""significantly undervaluing Groupon’s core business, whose recent turnaround has been overshadowed by pandemic related shutdowns and a recent change in revenue recognition accounting that makes it look like revenue got cut in half.""

U.S.-based Nuance serves 77% of U.S. hospitals and helped launch Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Siri virtual assistant.

So, read on to learn more.The healthcare industry has seen unprecedented capital inflows and investor interest over the past year, as evidenced by the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF’s (XLV) 20.9% returns over this period.

The sector has enormous potential to grow next year thanks to technological advancements and the growing need for improved healthcare products and facilities from an aging population. The global healthcare market is expected to reach $11.9 trillion by 2022.

Xandr was created in 2018 through the acquisition of an ad exchange and a TV ad tech company to use data collected from phone, internet and TV services to target consumers.
AT&T has spent billions to build a media company, satellite TV provider and an advertising platform all under one roof, but those plans faced investors' criticism as struggled to reduce debt.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Nikola Corp has agreed to pay $125 million to settle civil charges that it defrauded investors by misleading them about its products, technical advancements and commercial prospects, the U.S. securities regulator said on Tuesday.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused the electric vehicle maker of violating U.S. securities laws with numerous misleading statements made from March to September 2020 about in-house production capabilities, reservation book and financial outlook. 
The settlement follows civil and criminal charges filed in July against Nikola founder Trevor Milton for using social media to repeatedly mislead investors about the company's technology and capabilities, reaping ""tens of millions of dollars"" as a result of his misconduct. Milton is battling those charges in court after losing a bid to dismiss or move the case.
Milton's misleading statements aimed at inflating share prices began even before Nikola had produced a ""single commercial product or had any revenues from truck or hydrogen fuel sales,"" the SEC order said.
Nikola, which did not admit or deny the SEC's findings, has agreed to cooperate with ongoing litigation and investigation, the SEC said. The company previously disclosed expectations of the hefty penalty in November.
Nikola ""is responsible both for Milton’s allegedly misleading statements and for other alleged deceptions, all of which falsely portrayed the true state of the company's business and technology,"" Gurbir Grewal, the SEC’s enforcement director, said in a statement.
Nikola said in a statement that it will continue to execute on its strategy and expand its manufacturing network. The company is seeking reimbursement from Milton for ""costs and damages in connection with the government and regulatory investigations,"" it said.
Nikola went public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in June 2020, a process the SEC has criticized for requiring less initial vetting than the traditional initial public offering (IPO) process. 
This month, the SEC's chair said the agency was considering toughening rules around how underwriters, boards of directors and sponsors of SPACs structure fees, issue projections and disclose conflicts.

The plans are part of a broader crackdown on the SPAC sector this year. The SEC has also told top auditors to change their accounting practices, and launched a broad enforcement inquiry of Wall Street banks involved in the deals.
Nikola shares were up 0.74% at $9.32 apiece on the Nasdaq by 10:17 a.m. EST (1517 GMT).

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's government proposed on Tuesday to reform its insolvency law to simplify bankruptcy proceedings and meet a major condition agreed with Brussels to obtain European Union recovery funds. 
The current insolvency system has been criticised by organisations such as the International Monetary Fund for being slow and convoluted, often driving companies to wind up.
""We do not want any viable business to have to close its doors because of one-off financial difficulties, nor do we want any entrepreneur to give up their business because of a failed project that will weigh them down for ever,"" Justice Minister Pilar Llop told reporters.
Spanish companies have been among the most active in Europe in applying for state-backed credit and liquidity lines during the pandemic.
Since the first Spanish lockdown in March 2020, the obligation to declare bankruptcy has been suspended and the government in November extended the moratorium until June 2022 to avoid an avalanche of business failures.
However, some economists fear the extension is hiding some ""zombie"" companies that under normal circumstances should have been liquidated by now.
The draft proposal will now be sent to Congress as a bill, and is expected to be added to the statute books by mid-2022.
Among new features, it proposes a pre-restructuring process to try to tackle insolvency at an early stage, opening the door to renegotiating debts and avoiding forced liquidation.
The government has created a special system for companies with up to 10 workers, aimed at saving small businesses time and money when filing for insolvency.

Llop also promoted the idea of a ""second chance,"" making it easier for owners of failed businesses to form new ones.
The new bill also introduces mechanisms to speed up the work of administrators, such as bonuses for rapid resolution of cases.

The stock fell 5%, weighed down by soaring prices of ingredients for its cereals and ice creams as well as surging labor and freight costs. The company sold lower volumes.
According to the company, it was a quarter when at-home demand for food rose and so did input costs inflation and supply chain disruptions.
The maker of processed food resorted to price hikes and played with pack sizes to combat pressure brought on by higher prices of wheat, corn and edible oils. While the company is undertaking price hikes in the current quarter, there could be more increases following that, according to comments made by the management during a call with analysts.
Net sales rose 6% year-on-year to $5 billion to top estimates but adjusted profit per share fell 7% to 99 cents. Cost of sales jumped 13%. Lower selling, general and administrative expenses grew at a slower rate and that helped the profit.
The company raise its revenue outlook, banking on strong demand for its meals, snacks and baked items as well as its products for cats and dogs.
General Mills now expects organic net sales to grow 4% to 5%, a contrast to the 3% to 1% decline it factored in earlier.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Tuesday as strong earnings from Micron (NASDAQ:MU) helped strengthen a sense that Monday's sell-off was overdone, and that the fundamental outlook for next year is still positive. 
The market shrugged off figures showing new Covid-19 infections rising to a new record high in the U.S. at 298,000 on Monday. So far, there has been no notable pickup in hospital admissions, as the virulent Delta strain yields to the more transmissible - but seemingly less dangerous - Omicron variant. The Centers for Disease Control estimate that Omicron now accounts for nearly three-quarters of U.S. infections. Vaccine makers were the biggest losers in early trade,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock both losing 6.1% and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock losing another 11%.
By 9:55 AM ET (1455 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 267 points, or 0.8% at 35,199 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5%. 
Late on Monday, Micron had reported sharply higher-than-expected earnings and raised its guidance, citing sustained strong demand from the data center and electric vehicle sectors in particular. That was taken as a sign that at least two of the fundamental growth drivers that have supported in recent months are still intact, even through the breadth of the market rally has narrowed considerably.
Micron stock was up 8.7% in early trading, but there was only limited support for other chipmakers: Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock rose 1.0% and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock rose 0.9%.
 Nike  (NYSE:NKE) stock was another to advance after reporting earnings late on Monday, gaining 5.3% even though its update still smacked of supply chain constraints due to factory closures in Vietnam. Sales in China were down 20% due to a lack of product availability and signs of local aversion to the brand over the controversy about its alleged use of suppliers in the province of Xinjiang.  General Mills (NYSE:GIS) stock fell 4.1% after its supply chain constraints and higher input costs caused it to miss quarterly profit estimates by a wide margin. 
In a market slowly starting to thin out between the expiry of December options contracts on Friday and the upcoming Christmas holiday, reopening plays outperformed after underperforming on the way down on Monday. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock rose 5.6% and United Airlines  (NASDAQ:UAL) stock rose 5.9% after data from the TSA showed passenger traffic still holding up despite the latest wave of coronavirus infections.
Elsewhere, the settlement of SEC charges that it misled investors wasn't enough to generate any noticeable momentum for electric truck maker Nikola. Despite gaining over 3% in the premarket session, Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) stock could only add 0.6% in early trade."

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's markets steadied on Tuesday after sharp falls a day earlier in the wake of a resounding presidential election victory by leftist Gabriel Boric, who has pledged to shake up the country's market-oriented economic model.
The peso currency rose some 0.85% to around 867 per dollar in early trading, while the benchmark stock index gained 2.45%. Both had fallen sharply on Monday with the peso hitting record lows versus the greenback.
Boric on Monday pledged to maintain an ""orderly economy"" and to move swiftly on naming his cabinet, a day after a sweeping electoral victory propelled him to become Chile's youngest-ever democratically-elected president.
The former student protest leader, who leads a leftist coalition, firmly beat out far-right rival Jose Antonio Kast, who quickly conceded defeat, giving certainty to the result.

Boric's rise - and the wider polarization of the vote - had rattled Chile's markets and spooked mining firms concerned about his rhetoric to ""bury"" the country's market-orientated economic model, push higher taxes and tighten environmental regulation.
The country's markets are very attentive to the appointments Boric will make to his first Cabinet, after seeming to moderate his policy stance in recent weeks to attract centrist voters.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - So much in the world of work changed in the last two years, but Lynne Oldham, chief people officer at  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc, says the old adages still apply for job-seekers. 
""Take time to understand the planet that you want to land on – it’s really important not to just walk in the door,"" said Oldham, whose company is based in San Jose, California. ""You have to figure out how you add value.”
Oldham spoke with Reuters about her views on work, Zooming and hiring culture. Edited excerpts are below.
Q. What did you learn from your first job? 
A. My very first job out of university was with a benefits administrator for a small company. It was family-owned. I loved it because I got to work with retirees to really figure out their next step and how they would transition. 
I learned the power of listening to people’s stories, understanding the position they're in and coming at it from a more personal perspective.
Q. How are people using Zoom differently in these new times?
A. Before the pandemic, we were a B-to-B company. What happened was that everybody - grandma, grandpa, aunts, uncles - started getting on Zoom. 
We had weddings, happy hours, family gatherings – overnight, users realized it’s possible to do everything online, from telemedicine and online therapy to yoga and Zumba classes, parent-teacher conferences. 
In the business realm, we saw interviewing going virtual –
everybody was being met by their recruiters and hiring managers online. 
Q. What are some Zoom features you find particularly useful?
A. In audio settings, there is the “suppression” tool – set your setting at high, and you won’t hear a fire engine going or a dog barking. You could be in a crowded airport and they could be announcing something, and no one will hear it. 
Also, the lip color and eyebrow pencil features – it’s in studio effects. You literally can roll out of bed and roll to your camera and all of your makeup is in the tools. 
If I can change my shade of lipstick on studio without paying $25 for a new shade, why bother?
Q. What is a common mistake people make when Zooming?
A. We’re a distracted culture, so if you leave your email open and then have a chat open, you have to make sure to be fully attentive to the people in the video call with you. 
I close things out so that I’m not seeing five new emails out of the corner of my eye, and I’m sort of reading my emails while I’m talking. It’s important when we’re not able to connect as we have in the past to make sure that we’re there. 
Q. What qualities do you look for when you hire?
A. A continuous learner. People who are curious do well here. People who understand speed do well here. We're not a slow-paced company. We're quick. 
If you stay on top of your business news – and you're able to bring to this conversation something that you’ve learned and is relevant to the job – that says curiosity like none other. 
Q. What advice do you have for job seekers right now?
A. Know who’s hiring and why they’re hiring, and where they’re growing and what they're all about. 
Your LinkedIn profile has got to be up to date. You need to continuously network even if it’s virtual. Don’t leave those connections behind and say, ""I’ll get to that the next month or the month after."" 
Continuous networking is how I got my last few jobs.
Q. What’s the best piece of job advice you’ve received?

A. Do what you love, and you'll never work a day in your life. 
I love my job; I love what I do. It sounds crazy but the pandemic has heightened that, because I learned it is all about the people and what are we going to do to ensure that people feel good about coming back to the office.

Investing.com – Rite Aid stock (NYSE:RAD) tumbled 5% in Tuesday’s premarket after third-quarter profit more than halved and the drugstore guided for annual losses that are wider than it previously estimated.
The company also pruned its annual revenue guidance.
The drugstore also announced a plan to store some of its stores – 63 to begin with -- joining rivals like CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) in their pivot to digital as physical outlets struggle. The store closure is expected to provide an annual EBITDA benefit of approximately $25 million, it said. The company expects the number of closures to increase.
Adjusted net profit from continuing operations slumped to $8.2 million in the quarter ended November 27, compared to the prior-year quarter’s $21.6 million.
Revenue rose a mere 1.8% to $6.23 billion, mostly owing to struggles at the pharmacy services segment where revenue fell around 11% to $1.86 billion. The company attributed the fall in the segment revenue to a planned decrease in insurance membership at its pharmacy-benefits-and-services business, Elixir, and a previously announced loss of a large customer.
Annual net loss is expected to be $209.5 million at the center of its guidance range, a trifle deeper than the previously guided $209 million. The annual loss could be as much as $230 million, $9 million more than the worst outcome the company guided for earlier.
Total annual revenue is now seen around $24.6 billion, down from a previous estimate of $25.3 billion."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Melon Fashion Group has picked Sberbank CIB, VTB Capital, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and BofA to help organise its initial public offering (IPO) in 2022, two sources with knowledge of the company's plans told Reuters on Tuesday. 
Several Russian companies could hold IPOs next year, extending the listing spree that started a year ago, if geopolitics, including Ukraine tensions, and other risks do not thwart their plans.
One financial market source said Melon was aiming to list in autumn 2022. A third financial market source confirmed Melon's plan to list next year. 
Melon Fashion, VTB Capital and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Sberbank CIB and BofA did not immediately respond.
""It's too early to talk about an IPO at the moment,"" Melon CEO Mikhail Urzhumtsev told Reuters earlier this month.
""An IPO is one of a variety of opportunities for the company's development that we are considering,"" he said in an interview, without providing further details.
Russian firms' interest in listing shares swelled as the benchmark MOEX index soared to record highs in October, but a subsequent sell-off has reminded the market of Russia's vulnerability to external shocks. 
Based in St Petersburg on a site that housed a sewing factory in Soviet times, Melon owns four, mainly women's, fashion brands - Zarina, Befree, Love Republic and Sela - with around 815 stores across Russia and CIS. 
Melon's revenue jumped 66% in the first nine months of 2021 to 28.3 billion roubles ($383.5 million), surpassing the 2020 result. Its online business rose from 7% of sales in 2017 to 34% in 2020.
""We are starting online penetration outside Russia and CIS countries and we believe this is our way out, mostly online,"" Urzhumtsev said, explaining the company planned to use e-commerce marketplaces for this. 
Swedish real estate firm Eastnine, which holds a 36% stake, said in its nine-month report that Melon's strong growth had opened up divestment opportunities. This may take the form of an IPO and could occur before summer 2022, Eastnine said. 
Melon's creativity hub is based in St Petersburg, where styles and stores are designed. Production is largely based elsewhere, with the majority in China. 

Urzhumtsev said sustainability had long been important to the company, but that it was focused on carrying out a deep diagnosis of its supply chain and factories next year.

Shares of the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based company were down about 4% in premarket trade.
Prolonged supply chain disruptions and a shortage of truck drivers in the United States have forced packaged food makers to incur higher costs, adding to spiraling prices of ingredients like wheat, corn and edible oils that have already crimped margins across the sector.
To ease some of the cost pressures, General Mills, like peers Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co and  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) Co, has bumped up prices of its products.
However, heightened inflation and supply costs in the quarter outstripped General Mills' efforts to raise product prices, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Harmening said in his prepared remarks, adding the current environment is as ""challenging as I have seen in my 27-plus years in the industry."" 
The company said it has taken further pricing actions that will go into effect in the current quarter, adding it expects more price increases in the back half of the year. 
The Pillsbury dough maker also raised its full-year sales forecast, betting on strong demand for its cereals and baking products as well as pet foods, which helped drive net sales 6% higher in the reported quarter.
The company now expects organic net sales to rise between 4% and 5% in fiscal 2022. It had earlier forecast annual organic sales to be towards the higher end of a 1% to 3% decline range.

Second-quarter net sales of $5.02 billion topped estimates of $4.84 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES.
Excluding items, General Mills earned 99 cents per share in the three months ended Nov. 28, missing analysts' estimate of $1.05 per share.

LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar plans to invest at least $10 billion in U.S. ports and has approached international banks for financing help, three finance sources say, in an infrastructure spree that reflects the Gulf country's deepening ties with Washington.
The Middle East and Western sources familiar with the matter said Doha was targeting investments in ports around the U.S. East Coast which were expected to be developed in phases, adding that the plan was at a preliminary stage. 
The country's sovereign wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority and the Qatar Government Communication Office both declined to comment. 
""The Qataris have been preparing for almost a year to test the waters with U.S. port investments,"" said Michael Frodl, a U.S.-based adviser on projects including maritime security, commerce and infrastructure, who is familiar with Qatar's strategy.
""We think that a shrewd investor with the $10 billion the Qataris desire to put into American port infrastructure would likely look at the underserved East Coast first and foremost. The West Coast is getting all the U.S. government and private investment attention, while the East Coast is long overdue for improvements.""
Frodl said ports with easy access to highways and rail lines would be a priority.
""We'd be looking at aging medium-sized ports south of Boston and north of Jacksonville,"" he added. 
A Middle East-based source said the investments would be backed by debt, which would be linked to the port assets, adding that Qatar was in early discussions with banks to look for a structuring adviser.
The banks being approached included  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), HSBC and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), two of the sources said. 
Morgan Stanley, HSBC and Credit Suisse declined to comment. 
In November Congress approved U.S. President Joe Biden's $1.2 trillion infrastructure package, which port and industry sources say includes $5.22 billion of federal funding for port specific programmes, falling short of the tens of billions of dollars estimated to be needed for investment in creaking infrastructure. 
U.S. transport secretary Pete Buttigieg told an online news briefing with the Port of Los Angeles on Nov. 16 that while Washington was delivering a ""historic level of funding"" to improve ports, ""it can't all be from federal grants"".
""We're going to have to keep working with local, state and private partners in order to make sure that we have the kinds of resources that are needed,"" Buttigieg said. 
There are around 360 ports in the United States, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. 
The Middle East-based source said Qatar could look to target three port projects. 
A fourth finance source separately confirmed Qatar's investment plans in the United States.
Qatar currently has minimal holdings in overseas ports. However, last year the state’s commercial ports operator, QTerminals, purchased the Turkish port of Akdeniz and entered into an agreement to develop the Black Sea port of Olvia in Ukraine. 
STRONGER TIES 
Relations between the United States and Qatar have deepened after the small, wealthy Gulf monarchy forged close ties with the Taliban, playing a key role in the talks that led to the 2020 deal for the U.S. troop pullout from Afghanistan this year.
Washington and Doha signed an accord in November for Qatar to represent U.S. diplomatic interests in Afghanistan.

""Qatari interest in investing in U.S. infrastructure dates back to at least 2016,"" Frodl said.
""Things would have been more advanced if it was not for the previous Trump administration, which was closely aligned with the Saudis.""

And the growing prevalence of chronic diseases and an aging population are driving market demand. Recently, medical devices stocks Edwards (EW) and Integra (IART) were upgraded, and we think these stocks could be ideal bets now. So, let’s discuss.The global medical devices market was adversely impacted last year during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the growing prevalence of chronic diseases and the emphasis on early diagnosis and treatment are driving the demand for medical devices back to pre-pandemic levels. Studies show that more than half of all U.S adults have at least one chronic disease, and the number is rising. An aging population, among other factors, is also driving the market.
In addition, the integration of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), 3D printing, and the development of other smart gadgets are positioning the industry for long-term growth. The global medical devices market is projected to grow at a 5.4% CAGR to $657.98 billion in 2028. And several companies are focusing on R&D to develop advanced devices to capitalize on the growing market.

Investing.com – Nikola stock (NASDAQ:NKLA) traded about 3% higher in Tuesday’s premarket after a $125-Million fine by the Securities and Exchanges Commission removed a key overhang for the company and its shareholders.
The company said it will pay the penalty in five instalments over two years. It has already provisioned for the fine, according to its November 4 disclosure.
Nikola said it neither admits nor denies the SEC’s findings in this matter.
The penalty settles the charges that the EV-maker defrauded investors by misleading them about its products, technical advancements and commercial prospects, according to the market regulator.
The SEC had accused Nikola of violating U.S. securities laws with several misleading statements made from March to September 2020 about in-house production capabilities, reservation book and financial outlook, according to Reuters.
The Department of Justice had in July indicted Nikola founder Trevor Milton for making false and misleading statements to investors. The company had then pointed out that Milton resigned from Nikola on September 20, 2020 and has not been involved in its operations or communications since that time. Milton is battling those charges in court.
Nikola went public via a special purpose acquisition company in June 2020 and, like many other EV-makers, has struggled to book revenue. Net loss at the company more than tripled from a year ago to about $268 million in the quarter ended September 30.

Investing.com – Citrix Systems stock (NASDAQ:CTXS) was up 8% in Tuesday’s premarket trade after a Bloomberg report said that activist investor Elliott Management and Vista Equity Partners are considering a joint bid for the company.
Talks are at an early stage and Vista Equity, a private equity focused on tech firms, may use its portfolio company Tibco as part of the bid, according to the report.
Bloomberg had in September reported that Citrix was working with advisers to explore a potential sale. The talks followed Elliott taking a 10% stake in the company. Citrix's market valuation is currently just over $10 billion.
Elliott is known to chase companies to take steps to increase shareholder returns. This includes moves like reshuffling top management, forcing buybacks, and demands for better capital allocation.
Citrix specialized in remote access software solutions. That specialism was in high demand during the pandemic and looks likely to remain so as work-from-home model takes root. However, the company has meanwhile transitioned to a subscription model, which has capped its revenue growth in the short term.
Third-quarter total revenue of $778 million was up a mere 1% year-over-year. That followed another disappointing quarter when revenue grew 2% year-on-year.
The company’s stock price has suffered, falling 37% in a year when the Nasdaq 100 is up around 23%.

606,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2021 07:27AM ET</span>",U.S. meat plants relaxed some COVID-19 safety protocols after outbreaks - unions,"By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Smithfield Foods, the world's largest pork producer, last year assigned a team of dedicated employees to enforce social distancing and sanitize surfaces at a South Dakota slaughterhouse where COVID-19 infected nearly 1,300 workers, the president of the local labor union said.
Now, that role no longer exists, the company confirmed.
The plant gradually moved employees who worked as safety monitors to other positions, said BJ Motley, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union branch that represents Smithfield workers in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
Smithfield, which is owned by Hong Kong-listed WH Group (OTC:WHGLY) Ltd, said it shifted the monitors' duties to other personnel starting in the second quarter of this year because COVID-19 safety protocols became ""second nature"" and vaccines were available. As for cleaning, the company said facilities are ""routinely sanitized for food safety reasons.""
Across the country, U.S. meat and chicken plants that reported some of the country's largest coronavirus outbreaks last year have eased or adjusted protective measures implemented near the start of the pandemic, according to interviews with 10 plant employees, union officials and advocates for workers. 
Safety concerns in slaughterhouses, where employees are often in close quarters, have made it harder for meat processors to hire and retain workers at a time when labor is already scarce and demand is booming.
Meat companies including Smithfield,  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) and JBS USA say employee health is a top priority and that they require masks in plants, even though many states have relaxed COVID-19 mask and social distancing rules. 
Workers and advocates say the companies could do more as the contagious Omicron variant rages and soaring meat prices boost profits.
""We don't have anybody monitoring social distancing. We don't have anybody wiping tables down. It's really back to normal,"" Motley said.
About 59,000 meatpacking workers were infected with COVID-19 through January at U.S. plants run by Smithfield, Tyson, JBS, Cargill Inc and National Beef Packing Company, a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee report said in October in the most comprehensive data to date.
Smithfield said it invested more than $800 million to protect employees from COVID-19 and follows federal health and safety guidelines. 
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited Smithfield in 2020 for failing to protect Sioux Falls workers from COVID-19 and said last month the company agreed to assess its operating procedures as part of a settlement. Smithfield said the citation was without merit last year.
Along with masks, Smithfield uses barriers between work stations and social distancing ""when feasible"" to keep employees safe, spokesman Jim Monroe said. 
""We have in no way rolled back COVID-19 safety protocols,"" he said. ""We are confident that our protective measures are effective in mitigating COVID-19 illness among our employees."" 
A Smithfield plant in Vernon, California, operating under the name Farmer John, stopped having employees work as social distance monitors roughly three months ago, said Darryl Blackwell, a UFCW steward who slices fat from pork in the plant. He would like to see them return.
""It's pretty much do whatever you want as far as the social distancing,"" he said. ""With this new variant, you just can't be too cautious.""
Smithfield confirmed it shifted monitors' duties to other workers. The company did not provide data about vaccination rates. It said Smithfield hosted about 200 on-site vaccine drives that include boosters and that shots are widely available.
""Our vaccination and case rates are excellent,"" Monroe said.
Motley estimated the South Dakota plant is about 60% vaccinated, compared with a rate of about 65% nationwide. He and Blackwell said boosters had not been offered at their facilities.
'STILL ELBOW-TO-ELBOW'
Rival meat processor JBS USA, owned by Brazil's  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY), started staggering employees' break times at slaughterhouses last year as a way to promote physical distancing. In July 2021, the company stopped the practice at a massive beef plant in Greeley, Colorado, the UFCW Local 7 union branch that represents plant workers said. 
""Unless they do reconstruction of the plant or they slow down the line speeds, they're still elbow-to-elbow in the plant,"" said Kim Cordova, president of UFCW Local 7. 
Company spokeswoman Nikki Richardson said JBS kept the vast majority of COVID-19 protocols in place and adjusts procedures as it evaluates cases among employees and in the community.
The Greeley plant has reported more than 400 cases of COVID-19 among workers, including 19 since Oct. 25, 2021, state data shows.
JBS said the Greeley plant has an 80% vaccination rate and 35% have received boosters, while 86% of all its workers are vaccinated. New hires must be vaccinated.
Tyson Foods, the only major meatpacker that requires vaccinations for all workers, has said its rate exceeds 96% and plants have started offering boosters.
A worker at a Tyson chicken plant in Rogers (NYSE:ROG), Arkansas, said management told him the plant stopped having employees monitor social distancing. 
The monitors' duties were shifted to plant leadership and maintenance staff, Tyson spokesman Derek Burleson said. Facilities also have signs encouraging social distancing, he said. 
Another chicken processor, Wayne Farms, has a vaccination rate of only 31% at a plant in Decatur, Alabama, and 42% companywide, spokesman Frank Singleton said. The Decatur plant has not reported positive COVID-19 cases since Nov. 22, he said on Friday.
Wayne Farms formerly paid Mona Darby, who has worked at the Decatur plant for 34 years, to come to work 20 to 30 minutes early to enforce proper mask-wearing as other employees arrived, she said. Darby estimated that half of the workers wore their masks correctly over their noses and mouths. 
The company halted that role and stopped staggering breaks for employees over the summer, said Darby, also a local leader for the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. 
Singleton said Darby's assistance was not needed because almost all workers comply with a requirement to wear masks. 
The Decatur plant operates two production lines, down from five lines prior to the pandemic, because employees have quit, Darby said. 

The company confirmed it operates two lines and has been impacted by a labor shortage, but said it still processes the same number of chickens daily.
""They just can't get nobody to stay,"" Darby said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Carla Benton, a Chicago-based book copy editor, was preparing for a Christmas trip to Europe when the Omicron variant of the coronavirus began to make headlines in late November. 
She quickly canceled her international travel plans due to rapidly changing travel restrictions and testing requirements, initially opting to stay in the United States and visit her sister in Houston, Texas instead. Benton ultimately decided to cancel all travel and stay home in Chicago for the holidays.
""I’d initially hoped to be able to play some of my trip by ear,"" Benton said. ""While I’m fully vaccinated and following precautions here in Chicago, I was worried about the potential for a surprise positive test and quarantine abroad."" 
The Transportation Security Administration has screened more than 2 million people daily for the past four days, but it still remains down about 15% over pre-pandemic levels. TSA said it expects to screen 30 million people between Monday and Jan. 3 even as U.S. COVID-19 cases spike and Omicron spreads.
Airlines have in recent weeks reported some uptick in cancellations. Still, millions of Americans are expected to hit the highways and board flights to celebrate with family and friends over the holidays.
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) said last week that Omicron had slowed international bookings as many countries imposed new travel restrictions.
However, the airline's chief executive officer, Ed Bastian, told CNBC that ""Omicron (is) not going to impact our holiday bookings."" 
United Airlines is flying its busiest schedule this month since the start of the pandemic, with more than 4,000 flights per day on average during the year-end holidays. The airline said it added more than 200 daily domestic flights to meet holiday travel demand. 
Similarly, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) said on Monday the airline is encouraged by holiday demand trends. 
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) incoming Chief Executive Robert Isom told Reuters the airline's domestic business remained strong but the new travel restrictions had dampened demand in some international markets.
Nationally, COVID cases rose 9% in the past week but are up 57% since the start of December, according to a Reuters tally.
The spike in U.S. COVID-19 cases is causing some worry about the future of travel.
Omicron fears and new travel restrictions have prompted a rise in global hotel cancellations, according to online hotel search firm Trivago. 
As cases continued to climb, investors pushed airline and travel stocks lower on Monday. United Airlines dropped 3.3%, while  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Group slipped 3.4% after 48 people on its Symphony of the Seas cruise ship tested positive for COVID-19. 
And Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp said on Monday Omicron is already hitting the cruise line's near-term bookings. 
But more than half of Americans still did not intend to cancel their holiday travel plans as of early December, according to a poll from market research firm Ipsos released Dec. 7, when Omicron was already spreading in the United States. 
The American Automobile Association still expects this year to bring holiday travel in line with 2017 volumes, following the dramatic decrease in 2020. 
""Our forecast focuses on domestic travel, which we do not expect to be affected to the extent that international travel might,"" said Ellen Edmonds, public relations manager at AAA.
Major U.S. airports, preparing for a surge in holiday travelers, are maintaining their existing COVID-19 safety protocols like mandatory masking and extra cleaning. 

Denver International Airport spokesperson Alex Renteria said the airport still expects an uptick in travel over the holiday period, in line with high passenger volume since Thanksgiving. 
In the first half of December, passenger traffic at Miami International Airport was up 9% compared to the same period in 2019, according to communications director Greg Chin. Travel through the Florida airport is surpassing even pre-pandemic levels, with the average number of daily departing flights up nearly 12% compared with December 2019.

However, the tone is more optimistic Tuesday. The chief executive of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stated that the U.S. drugmaker could develop a booster shot to protect against the Omicron variant in a relatively short period.
""It only needs minor adjustments for Omicron. I don't expect any problems,"" CEO Stephane Bancel said in an interview with the Swiss newspaper TagesAnzeiger published on Tuesday.
The rapid growth of cases of the Omicron Covid variant has prompted worries that the country’s economic recovery could stall just as the Federal Reserve is starting to rein in its accommodative monetary policy. The Omicron variant has been found in at least 43 states and accounted for 73% of new infections in the U.S. last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
Also helping sentiment were strong numbers from the corporate sector.  Nike  stock is seen higher premarket after sales of its shoes and apparel in North America, the company’s largest market, rose 12% year-on-year, offsetting a 20% slump in sales in China. The company's suppliers in Vietnam are, however, still producing around 20% below their pre-pandemic levels.
Micron is also seen posting robust gains premarket after a solid start to the chipmaker's financial year, driven by strong demand for memory and storage chips, led it to promise a record year of sales with “solid profitability”.
The likes of  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) and Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) are also seen reporting quarterly results later Tuesday. 
Oil prices rose Tuesday, rebounding after a couple of days of sharp selling, and investors now await U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day.
The industry body estimated that crude stockpiles fell 815,000 barrels for the week ended Dec. 10, while the official government inventory report showed a draw of over 4.5 million barrels.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% higher at $69.75 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.5% to $72.57. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,798.25/oz, while EUR/USD climbed 0.1% higher to 1.1284.

610,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2021 06:51AM ET</span>","Norway wealth fund will pressure, not divest from high gas emitters","By Gwladys Fouche
OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $1.4 trillion wealth fund, the world's largest, will not divest from companies that are major emitters of greenhouse gases to meet plans to make its investment portfolio carbon-neutral by 2050.
It will however be an ""active shareholder"" in such companies by pushing them to make the transition to net zero emissions, and divest from them if it believes their business models are not sustainable, the deputy head of the central bank - which is in charge of the fund - said on Tuesday.
The fund invests Norway's revenues from oil and gas production into stocks, bonds, property and renewable projects abroad. It invests in some 9,100 firms globally and owns on average 1.4% of all listed global stocks. 
It estimates its portfolio's carbon footprint was 107.6 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2019 - roughly twice what Norway emitted that year.
Like many other long-term investors, the fund is looking at how to adapt to climate change. 
In August, a government-appointed panel recommended the fund should push the firms it invests in to cut their emissions to nil by mid-century, in line with the Paris Agreement of 2015. 
Jonas Gahr Stoere, at the time leader of the opposition and now prime minister, said the panel's recommendation would be made part of the fund's mandate.
On Tuesday, bank deputy governor Oeystein Boersum said that, while the bank supported the panel's recommendation, this should not be interpreted ""as a plan to divest from companies with high emissions"". 
""That is not our intention,"" and instead, the fund would be an ""active shareholder"", he said in a speech. 
Taking the example of high-emitting sectors such as steel and cement production, Boersum said ""their products will still be needed in the low-carbon economy"". 
""Much of our dialogue on transition plans is therefore about the technological advances and investments needed. We also raise the need for industry standards and the issue of lobbying, which is a major challenge,"" he said.
The fund will however divest from companies with unsustainable business models, he added.
One campaigner gave a guarded welcome to the bank's plan.
""They are taking big steps forward, but they have a long way to go,"" said Martin Norman at the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, a research and shareholder advocacy group.

Short- and medium-targets could have been set. ""We need emission cuts now,"" he said.

611,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2021 06:45AM ET</span>",Italian luxury group Zegna climbs on Wall Street debut,"By Elisa Anzolin
MILAN (Reuters) -Shares in Italian luxury menswear group Zegna rose on their New York market debut on Monday, after the company completed a merger with a U.S. blank check company in a deal with an enterprise value of $3.1 billion. 
At 1634 GMT, the shares traded at $10.92 apiece, up 6.6% from the opening price of $10.24. The company had said in a statement that the initial market capitalisation of the combined group would be $2.4 billion.
Zegna's Chief Executive Gildo Zegna told a press conference the listing would help the company accelerate a transition towards ""comfort clothing."" 
""Products that last and perform, and we're both of those - it's just a matter of accelerating ... this project will make us raise our voice and raise our bar.""
The group will remain focused on internal growth, without ruling out external expansion routes that ""fit its DNA.""
""The reason we're here is that we need scale,"" Zegna said. ""But the new Zegna is a big start up ... we need to concentrate our resources, our energies on it ... no distractions. We have enough on our plate, but we'll keep an open mind.""
At a time when the coronavirus pandemic is wrecking havoc with global supply chains and inflating the price of natural resources, Zegna pointed to possible acquisitions of suppliers.
""If you don't control the supply chain you go nowhere ...raw materials are going to be scarcer and scarcer and more expensive,"" the CEO said.
The Zegna family will have a 66% stake in the group resulting from the merger with Investindustrial Acquisition Corp, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by private equity firm Investindustrial and chaired by former UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti.
Investindustrial founder Andrea Bonomi said he and Ermotti had put their business proposition to Zegna in January at a meeting in the mountains, putting on hold possible alternatives until he came back with an answer a couple of months later.
""Zegna was a dream for us,"" he said.
The deal, announced in July, is the latest example of an Italian family-owned fashion business attracting outside investors to fund expansion, boost marketing spending and compete with bigger players, after the industry was hit hard by the coronavirus crisis.
Zegna, founded in 1910 as a textile company and now a leader in luxury menswear under the family's third generation, reaped gross proceeds of $761 million from the listing, mostly from Investindustrial and other participants in the deal. 
As part of the overall transaction, the luxury group raised $169 million out of $402.5 million initially amassed by the SPAC as 58% of its investors took their money back - mass redemptions have been a common feature for this kind of deal in recent weeks. 
A backstop deal with outside investors helped fill most of the gap, with the final enterprise value of $3.1 billion just short of the $3.2 billion initially mooted. 

Over the past few weeks several companies, including Grab Holdings and BuzzFeed, that merged with SPAC entities to go public have seen their shares tumble, as investors pull the rug out from under the stocks hyped in Wall Street's frenzied blank-check deals this year.
The average redemption rate has more than doubled to 58% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, data from Dealogic showed, as many companies fall short of investors' lofty expectations.

Investing.com – MapMyIndia-owner  CE Info Systems ' (NS:CEIF) rallied sharply on its stock market debut in Mumbai Tuesday, bringing a sigh of relief to investors Tuesday after big disappointments in some recent IPOs.
The stock listed at 1581 rupees (around $20) on the BSE, a premium of 53% to the issue price of 1,033 rupees. It touched a high of 1586.85 rupees, before closing above 1394  - a gain of 35%.  
MapMyIndia provides data and technology products, offering proprietary digital maps as a service. It is one of the few companies offering software products to have listed in a country known more for its IT services.
The listing was keenly awaited on two counts – one, that it came a day after the markets were routed Monday, and two, that it followed a spate of recent offerings that have rarely traded above their issue prices and are now down by 30%-40%.
The highest-profile example of that trend has been  One 97 Communications  Ltd (NS:PAYT), the Softbank-backed owner of payments fintech Paytm. 
Paytm started as a simple wallet but has expanded into a payments provider that now also provides mutual funds services, brokerage and lending.
One 97 shares were issued at 2150 rupees and have never traded above that. Since their November 18 listing, the shares have lost 39% of their value, inviting allegations of mispricing and denting investor confidence in primary issues.

The judgment from the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg was prompted by a lawsuit from the German branch of Iran's state-owned Bank Melli against Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) after the telecommunications provider terminated a contract with the bank in 2018 prior to its expiry. 
The Higher Regional Court in Hamburg will have to decide whether upholding the contract with Bank Melli would expose Deutsche Telekom, which makes about half of its turnover with its U.S. business, to such a disproportionate economic loss.
It is not clear when the Hamburg court will make its decision.
In 2018, then U.S. president Donald Trump decided to withdraw unilaterally from the Iran nuclear deal and to re-impose sanctions on Iranian companies that had been suspended under the agreement struck in 2015.
To try to rescue the nuclear deal and its economic benefits for Iran, the European Union as a signatory issued a ""blocking statute"" that prohibited individuals and companies in the bloc from complying with the renewed U.S. sanctions.
The court on Tuesday backed the EU blocking statute in its ruling, saying ""the prohibition imposed by EU law on complying with secondary sanctions laid down by the United States against Iran may be relied on in civil proceedings"".

But the judges also said the rules of the blocking statute ""cannot infringe the freedom to conduct a business...by leading to disproportionate economic loss"".
At the same time, the Hamburg judges must take into account that Deutsche Telekom did not apply for an exemption from the EU blocking statute's rules, the ECJ said.

614,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2021 06:13AM ET</span>",U.S. tornadoes push insurers 2021 bill over $105 billion as climate change impact grows,"By Noor Zainab Hussain and Carolyn Cohn
(Reuters) - Devastation from tornadoes that slammed parts of the United States this month will push the insurance industry's 2021 bill for weather-related claims well above the predicted $105 billion, industry experts said, and premiums should rise on worries that climate change will drive more severe weather. 
Tornadoes tore a 200-mile path through six states in the Midwest and South, demolishing homes and leveling businesses, causing $5 billion in insured losses, according to preliminary estimates.
Climate change has been driving more so-called ""secondary peril"" weather events that are smaller than hurricanes, for instance, but less predictable. Other secondary perils include small to mid-size localized events like wildfires, winter storms and hail storms. 
These events create risk management challenges for insurers and ultimately inflate premiums, said some insurance experts. 
""We've got a year of over $100 billion of catastrophe events without having a big named event, whether that's an earthquake or a hurricane,"" Barnaby Rugge-Price, Chairman of Howden Broking Group, told Reuters. 
""Clearly underlying that, something else is going on, of which the most obvious thing is climate change,"" he said.
On average, there are 1,500 tornadoes per year in the United States, with only 25 occurring in December, according to reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter. This month's cluster of tornadoes was exceptionally rare in terms of the season, the intensity and the length of the storm paths, the company said.
Studies suggest warming Gulf of Mexico surface temperatures are linked to intense thunderstorm updrafts that can generate tornadoes in the U.S. Southeast's Dixie Alley, said catastrophe modeling firm Karen Clark & Company (KCC). 
Warmer air in late autumn and early winter create favorable conditions for producing tornadoes, which could elongate the severe weather season over North America, said the reinsurer Guy Carpenter & Co LLC.
Unlike primary perils like hurricanes, which have the highest potential for losses and are therefore closely monitored and modeled, secondary perils are unpredictable. 
They are harder to model due to insufficient data, Rugge-Price said, making it in turn more difficult for the industry to assess the risks.
""Hurricanes have been recorded, and we know the path and we know the damage, whereas tornadoes, they just...pop up,"" he added.
Some experts said it is not easy to draw a clear connection between climate change and the rising severity of tornadoes. KCC said tornadoes form in specific atmospheric conditions and it could be ""challenging to attribute specific trends in severe weather to climate change"".
Still, this year has seen a rise in the severity of such secondary perils. 
Before the tornadoes hit, the global insurance industry was facing an estimated $105 billion in losses this year, the fourth-highest on record, without a single giant weather catastrophe, according to reinsurance giant Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY).
While Hurricane Ida was the single costliest natural disaster in 2021, more than half the losses were related to secondary peril events including winter storm Uri that brought freezing temperatures to Texas. 
At least one severe annual secondary peril event is the new “norm,"" each resulting in more than $10 billion in losses, Swiss Re said. 
""Natural catastrophe losses are likely to continue growing given increases in wealth, urbanization and the effects of climate change,"" the company said. 
PROPERTY PREMIUMS
Insurance industry sources said more severe events have boosted U.S. property insurance prices for the past four years. Clients with significant exposure to secondary perils experienced above-average rate increases in the third quarter, Swiss Re said. 
Insurance premiums are likely to continue rising, brokers said, and property owners seeking insurance also must shoulder higher retentions, initial costs they must bear themselves before insurance kicks in. 

""We don't expect to see a reduction in capacity available for tornado coverage,"" said Dave Reasons, Marsh's U.S. Central Zone Property Leader. However, he said, some clients were willing to bear retentions tenfold higher than in the past to keep premiums low. 
""We certainly may see discussions about the right retentions, the right pricing for that.""

616,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2021 05:40AM ET</span>",Airline passengers can claim if flight brought forward - EU court,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Passengers in Europe are entitled to compensation not only if their flights are delayed but also if they are brought forward by more than an hour, the European Union's top court ruled on Tuesday.
Under EU rules, passengers can claim damages if their flights are cancelled less than 14 days before departure or arrive more than three hours late or if they are denied boarding because of overbooking.
Compensation, ranging from 250 to 600 euros ($282.38-$677.70), depends on the distance of the flight, with a possible 50% reduction if the airline offers in advance to re-route the passenger so they arrive only a few hours late.
The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) determined that a flight should be regarded as cancelled if it was brought forward by more than an hour.
Judges reasoned that passengers could suffer the same degree of inconvenience as in the case of a delay, having to adapt their plans and even potentially missing the flight.
The compensation should also be the same as that due for a cancellation or delay, with no right to reduce the amount by 50% on the grounds that it has offered to re-reroute a passenger so that they arrive without delay at the final destination.
Airlines can still offer to re-route passengers if they do so sufficiently in advance. 
The court also found that a passenger has a ""confirmed reservation"" not only if they have a ticket but also if a tour operator, through which the passenger has booked, has provided assurances of transport on particular flights.

The case came to the CJEU from courts in Austria and Germany relating to flights operated by Azurair, Corendon Airlines, Lufthansa subsidiaries Austrian Airlines and Eurowings, as well as Laudamotion, now owned by Ryanair.

Revenue in the quarter ended December 2 jumped by a third to $7.7 billion, driven by strong demand for its memory and storage chips from a variety of clients including data centers, mobiles, graphics and automotive clients. Adjusted profit per share climbed 177% year-on-year to $2.16, easily beating estimates.
Growth of over 70% in data center revenue, in particular, more than offset a slowdown in demand from the PC market.

The company expects the current tight supply of components to ease gradually through the year, arguing that its volume-based supply pacts and strategic agreements should help it ride out any broader market disruptions.

Investing.com –  Nike  stock (NYSE:NKE) traded 3.7% higher in Tuesday’s premarket as reopening in U.S. got people to buy more of its shoes and apparel in the three months through November.
Sales in North America, Nike’s largest market, rose 12% year-on-year, offsetting a 20% slump in the company’s sales in China. A jump in direct sales also helped the company overcome reverses in the world’s second-largest economy, growing 9% to $4.7 billion.  
Sales in China suffered as its suppliers’ factories in Vietnam, a key manufacturing base, were shut for long periods due to the pandemic.  
The company told analysts in a conference call that Vietnam factory closures led it to cancel production of roughly 130 million units. All factories are now operational and weekly footwear and apparel production has reached roughly 80% of pre-closure volumes, Nike said.
Robust demand, strength in online sales and supply chain issues all reduced the need for discounting, something that helped Nike grow its margins. Gross margin rose 2.8 percentage points to near 46%.
Second-quarter revenue rose 1% to $11.4 billion. Adjusted profit per share rose 6% to 83 cents and comfortably beat estimates.
Nike repeated its forecast of around 5% sales growth in the year through May, despite ongoing supply chain disruptions due to Vietnam factory closures that will affect current-quarter sales. Sales in the fiscal third quarter are expected to grow by less than 5%, while the improvement in margins is also set to weaken to 1.5 percentage points in year-on-year terms.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Arifmetika Financial Solutions, which provides small loans to individuals, plans to start trading in Canada in early 2022 and aims to raise about $100 million in the next 12-18 months, the head of its parent company OR Group said.
The technical listing, which would allow the microfinance company to trade on the stock exchange without a prior public offer, would extend a wave of listings by Russian companies, provided geopolitics, notably tensions over Ukraine, does not thwart the plan.
""We plan to raise around $100 million,"" Anton Titov, OR Group's founder and director, told Reuters. ""The deals will be 12-15% each round, with three rounds planned. We plan to take 49% to the market in a year to year and a half.""
In September, OR Group, which began life as footwear chain Obuv Rossii and expanded to become a wider e-commerce platform, said it planned to list Arifmetika on Canada's TSX Venture Exchange through a SPAC-equivalent capital pool company (CPC), Navigator Acquisition Corp.
Titov, who expects Arifmetika and Navigator to sign a final agreement soon, although he did not specify when, said the company could be valued at $100 million-$140 million after a first round of funding in the first half of next year. 
Explaining how the technical offering differed from an Initial Public Offering (IPO), which requires onerous regulatory checks, he said: ""There is variability here - you can attract money gradually, diluting a large stake, or make small additional issues.""
IPO activity gathered pace in Russia as the country recovered from the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and global stock markets surged, driven in part by retail investment.
In August, video game developer Nexters used Russian special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Kismet to start trading shares on the U.S. Nasdaq.
SPACs are shell companies that raise funds to acquire a private company and take it public without requiring an IPO. 
Arifmetika's planned listing will be similar. 
Founded in 2010, the company sees 2021 revenue at 2.2 billion roubles ($29.75 million) with net profit of around 600 million roubles, Titov said. 
Titov said Arifmetika wanted the extra funds to help it to take a leading position in a market that some of Russia's largest banks have also started entering, as well as for acquisitions. 

""Straight after the deal, we are ready for effective negotiations,"" Titov said, adding that it may expand internationally from 2023, once it has made significant progress in the Russian market.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland said on Tuesday it will begin a ""phased exit"" from its 71% stake in Allied Irish Banks over the next six months, as it pares back state ownership of its largest banks. 
The Irish Department of Finance did not say how much of the AIB holding it would sell, but that the move would likely be slower than at Bank of Ireland , where the government has reduced its stake to 9.3% from 13.9% since June.
Ireland pumped 64 billion euros ($72 billion), or almost 40% of its annual economic output, into its banks a decade ago after a property crash, with Bank of Ireland the only one to avoid majority state ownership. 
""I expect the pace of share sales to be slower than what we've seen at Bank of Ireland, but it is important that we make further progress on what will be a multi-year journey,"" Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said in a statement.
The Bank of Ireland sales were the first time the state had sold any of its bank share holdings since 2017. It also owns 75% of Permanent TSB, Ireland's only other retail bank.

Moderna hopes to start clinical trials early next year on a vaccine to protect against the fast-spreading Omicron variant but for now is focussing on a booster dose vaccine.
""It only needs minor adjustments for Omicron. I don't expect any problems,"" Bancel said in an interview with the Swiss newspaper TagesAnzeiger published on Tuesday. 
The company was now awaiting important information on the variant to begin development.
""That will take another week or two,"" Bancel said. 
""It will take a few months before we can produce 500 million doses after (regulatory) approval. But our capacities are much higher today than a year ago,"" he said.
If approval bodies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Switzerland's Swissmedic require further studies, that would add at least three months.
""Some authorities want a study, others are still undecided. In my opinion, it depends very much on how severely the disease progresses,"" he said.
Following delivery delays and lags in production in early 2021, Moderna is now able to keep up with production targets and deliver orders on time. 
The company made between 700 million and 800 million COVID-19 vaccine doses this year, and expects to produce a higher number in 2022, boosting production from 100 million doses a month to 150 million.
Additional production lines that are being built via a deal with Swiss-based drugmaker Lonza will become operational in the first quarter of 2022, boosting production, he said, adding the company for the first time had 30 million doses in stock.
After signing preliminary agreements with Canada and Australia, Moderna has begun discussions with Switzerland over a so-called vaccine subscription that could ensure supply as it develops novel mRNA vaccine, and is interested in deepening ties with other regimes. 
""We have a number of new vaccines in development, for example against influenza or against the RS virus, which causes a respiratory disease that is fatal in the elderly and young children,"" Bancel said. 

""We can combine these three mRNA vaccines into one dose and propose to governments to secure supplies for a certain amount for several years and then invest in a production facility in that country.""
That would give those countries priority supply in the event of a new pandemic, he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun and Airbus Americas CEO Jeffrey Knittel on Monday urged the Biden administration to delay planned deployment of new 5G wireless services, saying it could harm aviation safety.
The executives in a joint letter seen by Reuters asked U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to support postponing AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ)'s Jan. 5 deployment of C-Band spectrum 5G wireless.
""5G interference could adversely affect the ability of aircraft to safely operate,"" the letter said, adding it could have ""an enormous negative impact on the aviation industry.""
The industry and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have raised concerns about potential interference of 5G with sensitive aircraft electronics like radio altimeters.
The FAA this month issued airworthiness directives warning 5G interference could result in flight diversions. The agency plans to provide more information before Jan. 5 
The Boeing (NYSE:BA) Airbus letter cited an analysis from trade group Airlines for America (A4A) that if the FAA 5G directive had been in effect in 2019, about 345,000 passenger flights and 5,400 cargo flights would have faced delays, diversions or cancellations.
Buttigieg's office did not immediately comment.
In November, AT&T and Verizon delayed commercial launch of C-band wireless service by a month until Jan. 5 and adopted precautionary measures to limit interference.
Aviation industry groups said that was insufficient. Boeing and Airbus said they made a counterproposal that would limit cellular transmissions around airports and other critical areas. 
United Airlines Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said last week that FAA's 5G directives would bar the use of radio altimeters at about 40 of the country's biggest airports. 

Wireless industry group CTIA said 5G is safe and accused the aviation industry of fearmongering and distorting facts. 
The Air Line Pilots Association on Monday said that aviation and communications regulators are at a stalemate. ""That's a big problem for passengers, shippers and the American economy,"" the group said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Geely Holding and France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) are likely to soon announce a deal to jointly produce the Chinese automaker's hybrid vehicles in South Korea and look at possibly exporting cars duty-free to the United States, three people familiar with the matter said. 
The joint venture (JV) deal, in the works since early this year and which also involves joint operations in China, will allow Renault to shore up its struggling business in South Korea and more broadly its presence in Asia. 
Renault, which exited China last year, will gain a way back into the world's biggest auto market by forming a new, plug-in hybrid-focused brand that will be managed jointly by it and Geely, the sources said.
Geely is expected to work with Renault to come up with a new lineup of green cars that use Geely's so-called Compact Modular Architecture (CMA), a midsize vehicle underbody structure shared by Geely and Volvo, as well as its supply chains and manufacturing facilities in China, the sources added.
Renault will focus on vehicle design, sales and marketing for its newly defined brand in China, the sources said.
For Geely, the deal could mean a production foothold in South Korea and access to Renault's assembly plant in the country, where the latter has been making and selling cars for over two decades via a local brand with a Samsung (KS:005930) Group unit. 
A model Geely plans to produce at Renault's plant in the southeastern South Korean port city of Busan is the Lynk & Co 01 sport-utility vehicle, one of the sources said. 
The Lynk & Co 01 model is currently available in three powertrain options, gasoline-fuelled, conventional gasoline-electric hybrid, and plug-in electric hybrid. 
It was not immediately clear which one it plans to produce in Busan, but one of the three sources said the gasoline-fuelled and hybrid models were going to be produced in South Korea.
The aim is to localise the production of certain Lynk hybrid vehicles in South Korea, the sources said, implying the companies would line up local supply of parts.
Geely might possibly gain a ""backdoor entry"" into the U.S. market due to the deal, one of the sources said.
The Chinese automaker is looking at the possibility of taking advantage of South Korea's free-trade agreement with the United States and export its Lynk & Co vehicles to the world's No.2 auto market, two of the sources said. 
This comes at a time when Chinese automakers such as Chery Automobile have shelved plans to push into the United States given the COVID-19 pandemic and Sino-U.S. tensions.
RENAULT SAMSUNG VERSIONS OF LYNK CARS
In South Korea, Renault will try to shore up its business by manufacturing Renault Samsung versions of certain Lynk & Co cars in its Busan plant, the three sources said. 
Renault Samsung Motors, which Renault controls with an 80% stake, has struggled in recent years. Sales including exports have almost halved from 2017 to 116,000 vehicles last year. Sales through November this year totalled 120,000 cars.
In China, Renault and its global alliance partner Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co had the same partner Dongfeng, before the Renault-Dongfeng JV was dissolved last year.

Renault and Nissan have also for long designed, produced and marketed cars jointly that share platforms and other vehicle components to reduce manufacturing and other costs.
It was not immediately clear how Renault's partnership with Geely would impact the Renault-Nissan alliance.

The world's largest mobile network operator by total subscribers is selling shares publicly in Shanghai, as a growing number of U.S.-traded Chinese companies seek listings in China or Hong Kong amid rising Sino-U.S. tensions.
Washington this month blacklisted Chinese companies, including AI company SenseTime Group, over allegations of human rights violations, and finalised rules to kick non-compliant Chinese firms off American exchanges in three years. 
China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) said in a prospectus that it plans to sell up to 845 million shares at 57.58 yuan apiece, raising as much as 48.7 billion yuan before an over-allotment option is exercised.
After that option is fully exercised, it will raise up to 56 billion yuan, making the public share sale China's fifth-biggest on record, according to Refinitiv data. It would also be China's biggest listing since Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF)'s public offering in 2010. 
China Mobile said proceeds from the offering would be used to develop projects including premium 5G networks, infrastructure for cloud resources and intelligent ecosystems. 
China Mobile's smaller state-owned rivals, China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU), are already listed in China. 
The three were delisted from the New York stock exchange after a Trump-era decision to restrict investment in Chinese technology firms, which has been left unchanged by the Biden administration amid continuing tensions between Washington and Beijing.
In addition to the sanctions, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) this month finalised rules to delist U.S.-listed Chinese companies under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA).
According to accounting firm EY, five of the top 10 Hong Kong listings in 2021 were secondary listings of U.S-listed Chinese companies, including Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) Inc, and the trend of Chinese companies coming home will continue.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Macau's casinos face a bleak short-term outlook after shutting most of their lucrative gaming rooms catering to wealthy gamblers and as COVID-19 travel restrictions prevent the shift to mass-market customers that they will depend on in the future.
The former Portuguese colony that is the world's biggest gambling hub in terms of money wagered has long relied on the revenue from the VIP gaming rooms where high-rollers placed massive bets. 
But the Chinese government's recent crackdown on the junket business, which arranged the transportation, accommodation and the credit necessary to gamble for wealthy clients, is calling into question the financial outlook for casino operators including  Wynn Macau  (OTC:WYNMF), Sands China (OTC:SCHYY) and MGM China (OTC:MCHVY).
Junket-run gaming rooms inside casinos made up roughly a third of Macau's overall gaming revenues in 2019, according to Alidad Tash, managing director at 2NT8 Limited, a consultancy specializing in international casinos and integrated resorts.
However, that revenue has dried up after the arrest in November of Alvin Chau, the head of Macau's biggest junket operator Suncity, triggered the shutdown of gaming rooms throughout the city's casinos. Chau is charged with setting up an internet platform based in Macau that let bettors in mainland China, where gambling is illegal, place overseas wagers.
Replacing the VIP revenue will depend on the ability of casinos to draw the mass-market gamers that analysts at Bernstein have said are the ""secular long-term growth story"" for the sector, but that hinges on controlling COVID-19. 
""The pace of recovery in late 2021 and 2022 depends on COVID outbreaks, travel restrictions coming down, and the key to recovery is to have mass players coming back to Macau at more normal levels,"" the analysts said in a note.
""The future remains in mass and premium mass recovery."" 
Mass refers to mom-and-pop players who play table games, such as baccarat or blackjack, or slot machines. Premium mass includes players who bet large enough amounts that they earn complimentary rooms, food and transportation but do not have their losses discounted nor are they extended credit from the casinos.
Representatives from Wynn Macau, Sands China and MGM China did not respond to requests for comment on their plans to replace VIP revenues when contacted by Reuters. 
Since Chau's arrest, shares of Wynn Macau have plunged about 23%, Sands China has fallen about 13% and MGM China have dropped 20%.
Suncity could not be reached for comment.
RESTRICTED ENTRY
China's strict COVID-19 movement restrictions have limited the pool of mainland gamblers that can enter Macau. In the pre-COVID month of October 2019, there were 3.2 million visitors that came into Macau, in October 2021 that plunged to 328,245 visitors.
Visits remain depressed even though quarantine-free travel is allowed for most arrivals from mainland China.
Group visas for players have not been issued since the COVID-19 pandemic and individual visas to Macau have come under greater scrutiny, according to Ben Lee, founder of Macau gaming consultancy IGamiX. 
There are also concerns as to how gamblers in Macau will be able to bring funds into the region.
Junkets, besides extending credit to high-rollers, also operated a shadow banking network that helped players skirt China's capital outflow rules that limit taking only the equivalent of $50,000 out of the country in one year.

Premium mass and premium direct players, who wager enough to gain rebates on their losses and received credit from the casinos, also utilized the methods to move funds. 
But with junkets closed down, players have lost the most convenient channel to bring money into Macau, said 2NT8's Tash.

635,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2021 01:16AM ET</span>",U.S. to be world's biggest LNG exporter in 2022,"By Scott DiSavino
(Reuters) - The United States is set to become the world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter in 2022, surpassing Qatar and Australia, and may hold that title for years to come. 
In a year when China and other large economies in Europe and Asia scrambled to source enough supply for heating and power generation, the United States was sitting on a bevy of supply - one that will grow in coming years.
Global LNG demand has hit record highs each year since 2015, due mostly to surging demand in China and the rest of Asia. Much of that global appetite has been met by steadily rising U.S. LNG exports, which have reached new records every year since 2016 and is poised to continue in 2022.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects U.S. LNG exports will reach 11.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2022. That would account for roughly 22% of expected world LNG demand of 53.3 bcfd next year, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and would outpace both Australia and Qatar, the two largest exporters at present.
One billion cubic feet is enough gas for about 5 million U.S. homes for a day.
The United States should remain the biggest LNG exporter by capacity until around 2025, when Qatar could regain the lead as its North Field expansion starts to enter service. But if some U.S. developers start building new LNG export plants, the United States may not give up the crown.
Major U.S. developers like Cheniere Energy (NYSE:LNG), the largest U.S. exporter, have signed numerous long-term deals to sell LNG in recent months that should enable them to secure the financing needed to go forward with additional multibillion-dollar projects. (Graphic: U.S. soon to be top dog in LNG export race, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/akvezowxwpr/Pasted%20image%201640016831799.png) 
Many of those long-term contracts came from Chinese buyers.
""After years of avoiding a commitment to buy U.S. LNG, Chinese companies have finally made their move,"" said Nikos Tsafos at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). 
So far in 2021, most U.S. LNG exports went to Asia with about 13% going to South Korea, 13% to China and 10% to Japan, according to U.S. energy data. Those were the same top three destinations in 2020 when 13% of U.S. LNG went to South Korea, 12% to Japan and 9% to China.
The growth of U.S. LNG exports helps people worldwide ""get greater access to an abundant and reasonably-priced product that helps ease the world’s current supply crunch,"" said Charlie Riedl, executive director for the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas (OTC:LNGLF) (CLNG).
Gas prices around the world repeatedly reached record highs in 2021 as utilities tried to lock in LNG cargoes to rebuild low stockpiles in Europe and meet heavy demand in Asia. U.S. gas futures also rose, hitting a 12-year closing high in October. But after mild weather in early December, U.S. natgas stocks were replenished, and prices overseas are now 11 times higher. (GRAPHIC: Worldwide natural gas prices [NGA/]
The oil and gas industry touts natural gas as a less polluting fossil fuel than coal or oil. Gas burns more cleanly, so switching from coal lowers emissions, although unburned gas or methane released to the atmosphere contributes heavily to global warming.

Utilities around the world have been using gas to keep power prices relatively low and maintain reliable electric grids as they meet rising energy demand while transitioning from coal to cleaner renewables. However, some countries, including China, have boosted coal production due to the lack of available LNG. 
Analysts at RBN Energy said three developers will probably go forward with new projects over the next year: Cheniere's Stage 3 expansion at Corpus Christi in Texas, Venture Global's Plaquemines in Louisiana and Tellurian (NYSE:TELL) Inc's Driftwood in Louisiana.

636,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2021 12:50AM ET</span>",Qatar Airways sues Airbus in A350 jet damage dispute,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Qatar Airways said on Monday it had started proceedings in a UK court against planemaker Airbus in a bid to resolve a dispute over skin flaws on A350 passenger jets, bringing the two sides closer to a rare legal showdown over aviation safety.
The companies have been locked in a row for months over damage, including blistered paint and corrosion to a sub-layer of lightning protection, which Qatar Airways says has now led to the grounding of 21 A350 jets by its domestic regulator.
Airbus insists the carbon-composite passenger jets are safe to fly despite some ""surface degradation,"" while Qatar Airways says it is too early to say whether safety has been compromised.
The dispute came to a head last week when Airbus, in what experts called an unprecedented move, accused the Gulf airline of misrepresenting the problem as a safety issue and threatened to call for an independent legal assessment.
On Monday, Qatar Airways hit back, saying it had taken its complaint against Airbus to the High Court in London.
""We have sadly failed in all our attempts to reach a constructive solution with Airbus in relation to the accelerated surface degradation condition adversely impacting the Airbus A350 aircraft,"" it said in a statement. ""Qatar Airways has therefore been left with no alternative but to seek a rapid resolution of this dispute via the courts.""
In a statement late on Monday, Airbus confirmed it had received a formal legal claim. ""Airbus intends to vigorously defend its position,"" it said.
A spokesman earlier reiterated it had found the cause of the problem and was working with customers and Europe's safety regulator, which has said it has not identified a safety issue.
Qatar Airways denies that the surface flaws - which witnesses say have left some of the jets with a pock-marked appearance - are properly understood and said on Monday that it wanted Airbus to mount a ""thorough investigation"".
JETS GROUNDED
Several industry executives said such a public legal fight between two of aviation's leading players is unprecedented.
The row widened this month when documents seen by Reuters revealed at least five other airlines in varying climates had complained about paint or other surface problems since 2016. Airbus had until recently maintained the problem was focused on paint on Qatar's A350s, based in the Gulf.
Reuters also first reported that Airbus was looking at changing the anti-lightning system.
The planemaker has said it is proposing interim solutions ranging from repairs to repainting and has accused Qatar Airways of ignoring those proposals without reasonable justification.
Qatar Airways reiterated on Monday it could not be sure whether proposed repairs would work without deeper analysis. Its chief executive has questioned why Airbus is still working on a solution if a reliable fix is already available.
The 21 grounded jets represent 40% of its current fleet of A350s, for which it was the launch customer with the biggest order. Other airlines still operate the jet, saying its airworthiness is not affected by what they term cosmetic issues.

The row meanwhile looks set to cost Airbus a big Qatar order for a new A350 freighter version. It received the first firm order for the model on Monday, confirming a previously tentative order for four planes from France's CMA CGM.
Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker told the South China Morning Post last week he had previously looked at placing a large order for the cargo A350. Sources now expect Boeing (NYSE:BA) to win the order to replace Qatar's 34-35 freighters.

LIMA (Reuters) -A Peruvian community blocking a road used by MMG Ltd's Las Bambas copper mine will attend a government-brokered meeting set for Tuesday, a representative said, backtracking from a previous decision to boycott it.
""In order to stop people from demonizing the communities as uncompromising, it's been decided to attend the meeting,"" said Victor Villa, a legal adviser for residents of Chumbivilcas, whose month-long blockade forced Las Bambas to suspend production last week.
Las Bambas said earlier on Monday it does not plan to initiate legal action against Peru ""for the time being"" over the blockade. The mining sector has previously called on the government to send law enforcement to remove the blockade.
The meeting is the government's latest attempt to defuse the situation without resorting to a state of emergency, which would suspend civil liberties.
The current blockade has been in place since Nov. 20 by residents of the Chumbivilcas province who complain that the mineral wealth of the mine simply bypasses them and want the company to provide more jobs and money for the area.
The government had tried to broker a meeting between the parties last week, but Villa called the available proposal ""a joke"" and did not attend.
Peru is the world's no. 2 copper producer and Las Bambas accounts for 2% of world copper supply.
Las Bambas' vice president of legal affairs, Claudio Caceres, said that company representatives were planning to attend the government-convened meeting on Tuesday with the Chumbivilcas communities.

""Currently we're mainly committed to being able to restart a constructive and real dialogue, at the moment we're not thinking of taking legal action,"" Caceres said in an interview with local radio station RPP.
The Chinese-owned mine has been a flashpoint of protests since it began operations in 2016.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Tuesday morning, recovering from the previous session’s battering. Although China’s push to help troubled developers boosted investors sentiment, surging cases of the omicron COVID-19 variant globally kept moves small overall.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 2.07% by 10:21 PM ET (3:21 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.44%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.62%. The Reserve Bank of Australia released the minutes from its latest meeting earlier in the day, where it said that beginning asset tapering at its first meeting of 2022 and ending it in May is consistent with existing forecasts.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.48%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.43% while the Shenzhen Component inched down 0.03%. Authorities are urging large private and state-owned property companies to acquire real estate projects from troubled developers, in order to reduce the risks posed to the economy by the latter’s mounting debt.
However, the mood was somewhat brighter in early Asian trading as their U.S. counterpart clawed back some losses. However, volumes were thin as the holidays approach.
U.S. shares had retreated more than 1% after President Joe Biden's social spending and climate bill was dealt a big blow. Senator Joe Manchin said on Sunday that he will not support Biden’s Build Back Better package, a $1.75 trillion domestic investment bill.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists cut their U.S. growth forecasts after Manchin’s comments, while the S&P 500 recorded its biggest three-day drop since September 2021.
“There’s kind of two dynamics going on. Probably the most important one is the imminent reduction in liquidity. On top of that, you have the omicron concern,” Infrastructure Capital Management chief executive officer Jay Hatfield told Bloomberg.
Other investors also highlighted the threat posed by omicron.
""COVID-19 remains a threat to the global economy. Initial evidence suggests omicron is more transmissible but results in less severe illness compared to previous variants,"" CBA analysts said in a note.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday that he was prepared to tighten restrictive measures if needed, and the variant is spreading rapidly in Europe. In the U.S., omicron now accounts for 73% of all sequenced U.S. cases, according to federal estimates."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - COVID-19 cases surged in New York City and across the United States over the weekend, dashing hopes for a more normal holiday season, resurrecting restrictions and stretching the country's testing infrastructure ahead of holiday travel and gatherings. 
The fast-spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus has become dominant in the United States with lightning speed, and claimed the life on Monday of an unvaccinated man in Texas, officials said.
The spike in COVID-19 cases is alarming public health officials, who fear an explosion of infections after the Christmas and New Year's holidays.
The Omicron variant now accounts for 73% of U.S. coronavirus infections based on sequencing data for the week ended on Saturday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday. 
With the new variant in circulation, COVID-19 cases are now doubling in 1-1/2 to three days in areas with community transmission, the World Health Organization said on Saturday.
Lines for COVID-19 tests wrapped around the block in New York, Washington and other U.S. cities over the weekend as people clamored to find out if they were infected before celebrating the holidays with family.
""I just want to make sure before seeing my wife's 70-year-old mom that I'm negative,"" said David Jochnowitz while waiting for a test in Washington.
With the rapid rise in infections, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser on Monday reinstated an indoor mask mandate until the end of January and required government workers to get vaccinated, including a booster shot. 
""I think we're all tired of it,"" Bowser told reporters. ""I'm tired of it too, but we have to respond to what's happening in our city and what's happening in our nation.""
In New York City, COVID-19 cases rose 60% in the week that ended on Sunday as Omicron spread rapidly around the U.S. Northeast. New York has set records for the most new cases reported in a single day since the pandemic started for three consecutive days.
""It is a predictor of what the rest of the country will see soon, and the minimum - since NYC is highly vaccinated - of what other parts of the country will experience in under-vaccinated cities and states,"" said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.
Many Broadway productions canceled performances as cast and crew have become infected. The popular ""Hamilton"" production on Monday extended cancellations until after Christmas due to breakthrough COVID-19 infections. 
Breakthrough infections are rising among the 61% of the country's fully vaccinated population, including the 30% who have gotten booster shots. 
Omicron appears to be causing milder symptoms in vaccinated populations, and health experts remain optimistic this wave might not cause the same spikes in hospitalizations and deaths as previous surges.
A man in his 50s from the eastern part of Harris County, Texas, who was not vaccinated died on Monday from an infection caused by the Omicron variant, County Judge Lina Hidalgo posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). The county, where Houston is located, was also the site of the first recorded U.S. Omicron case, on Dec. 6.
The man was the first local fatality from the variant, Hidalgo said. ABC News reported it is believed to be the first known U.S. death related to Omicron.
'JUST STAY HOME'
New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Dave Chokshi said on Monday that while new COVID-19 cases have ""increased sharply,"" hospitalizations have not jumped at the same rate. He credited vaccinations and booster shots, which help prevent severe illness, and urged that more were needed to build a ""seawall"" against the variant.
The spread of Omicron prompted Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, on Monday to require all students, faculty and staff to get a COVID-19 booster shot for the upcoming spring semester.
Nationally, cases rose 9% in the past week but are up 57% since the start of December, according to a Reuters tally. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients have increased 26% this month, with hospitals in some areas already strained by the Delta variant.
The Omicron variant was more than 90% dominant in regions including parts of the Northeast, the Southeast and the Northwest, according to DNA sequencing of the virus collected by the CDC for the week ended Saturday. 
That is a sharp increase from the previous week, when the virus accounted for just about 3% of sequenced cases.
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu announced strict new rules requiring patrons and employees at restaurants, bars, gyms and entertainment venues to be vaccinated. The rules, to be phased in over three months starting in January, will ultimately apply to children as young as five, and all adults. 
Midwest hospitals were still dealing with a surge in patients from a Delta wave this fall. Michigan, Indiana and Ohio have the nation's most-hospitalized COVID-19 patients per 100,000 residents, a Reuters tally found.
In New York City, the daily test rate reached an average of 130,000 per day, Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters on Monday, more than double three weeks ago. 
President Joe Biden will deliver a speech on Tuesday on how to deal with Omicron, the White House said. The president tested negative for COVID-19 after a mid-level White House staff member who had spent about 30 minutes near Biden on Friday tested positive on Monday morning, the White House said.
New York Governor Kathy Hochul said on Monday she was ramping up the state’s testing program, with 1 million kits arriving this week and the same amount in each of the next two weeks.
“More and more people are going to be testing positive from this,"" she said. For those who do, she advised: ""Just stay home, do not go out. Don't go to work. Don't go see your family.""
The state's health director, Dr. Mary Bassett, is among those who have tested positive for COVID-19, Hochul said.
Omicron's arrival is a headwind for an economic revival in New York that already lags the rest of the country, especially where employment is concerned.
The pandemic delivered an even larger body blow to the city than the rest of the country because of the outsized role played by tourism, leisure and hospitality, which suffered the worst under lockdowns and travel restrictions. New York's jobless rate topped out at 20% in the spring of 2020 - more than 5 percentage points above the U.S. average, and is still 9%, more than twice the national rate. 

Unemployment in New York remains high

Rei Ishii, an employee of Sony (NYSE:SONY) Life Insurance Company Ltd in Tokyo, allegedly embezzled the property in May and converted it to more than 3,879 Bitcoins valued today at more than $180 million, the department said in a statement.
Those funds were seized by law enforcement on Dec. 1, based on the FBI investigation, it said.
Ishii allegedly falsified transaction instructions, causing the funds to be transferred to an account he controlled at a bank in La Jolla, California, and converted them to Bitcoin, according to the complaint filed in federal court in the Southern District of California.
""All the Bitcoins traceable to the theft have been recovered and fully preserved. Ishii has been criminally charged in Japan,"" the Justice Department said.

(Reuters) - Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) on Monday delivered stronger quarterly results than Wall Street expected as data centers and electric vehicle manufacturers drove demand for its chips, and it forecast second-quarter sales and profits will also beat estimates with chip shortages easing in 2022.
Micron also disclosed that it has struck deals with its own suppliers to ease bottlenecks in its supply chain.
The company makes both the NAND memory chips that serve the data storage market and the DRAM memory chips that are widely used in data centers, personal computers and other devices. Micron shares rose 5.7% to $87.70 in extended trading after the results.
Strong demand and an industry-wide shortage of the chips have also allowed Micron, one of the world's biggest memory chip suppliers, to charge higher prices. Micron said data center revenue grew 70% and that automotive revenue grew 25%, with the automotive growth coming from the increasing amount of memory required in cars with advanced driver safety systems. 
""We are seeing dramatic step ups in some of the new model cars,"" Sumit Sadana, Micron's chief business officer, told Reuters in an interview.
Sadana said Micron officials expect the non-memory chip shortages will start to ease next year. The shortages have been stifling shipments of both cars and personal computers.
""We are starting to see a little bit of an improvement on that front. But it'll be through the calendar year 2022 that much of that improvement will occur,"" he said.
The company expects revenue for the current fiscal second quarter to be $7.5 billion, plus or minus $200 million, compared with analysts' average estimate of $7.27 billion, according to Refinitiv data. The company forecast adjusted earnings per share of $1.95, plus or minus 10 cents, beating analyst estimates of $1.86, according to Refinitiv data.

In the first quarter, Micron reported sales of $7.69 billion, above analyst expectations of $7.67 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Micron earned $2.16 per share on an adjusted basis, beating expectations of $2.11 per share.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes dropped more than 1% on Monday as investors worried about the Omicron COVID-19 variant potentially undercutting the economic rebound and a critical setback to President Joe Biden's social-spending bill.
The financials and materials sectors fell most among S&P 500 sectors, while declines in mega-cap tech and tech-related stocks also dragged.
Coronavirus cases surged in New York City and around the United States over the weekend, dashing hopes for a more normal holiday season. Britain's leader said he would take more steps to slow the spread of Omicron if needed, after the Netherlands began a fourth lockdown and as other European nations considered restrictions.
""I think (the stock market) is down over COVID fears and how those fears may extend the continuing supply-chain problems and how that will impact profits ... for companies,” Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 433.28 points, or 1.23%, to 34,932.16, the S&P 500 lost 52.62 points, or 1.14%, to 4,568.02 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 188.74 points, or 1.24%, to 14,980.94.
Financials fell 1.9% and materials dropped 1.8%. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) were the biggest individual weights on the S&P 500, falling 1.2% and 3.5% respectively.
The indexes finished above their session lows, but the benchmark S&P 500 ended below its 50-day moving average, a key technical level.
In a further knock to market sentiment, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin said on Sunday he would not support Biden's $1.75 trillion domestic investment bill Build Back Better, dealing it a potentially fatal blow.
After Manchin's comments, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) trimmed its quarterly U.S. GDP forecasts for 2022.
The developments came as the Federal Reserve decided last week to end its pandemic-era stimulus faster, with the central bank signaling at least three quarter-percentage-point interest rate hikes by the end of 2022. 
Investors have taken a more defensive stance this month, with sectors such as consumer staples and utilities rising most. Those two groups ended Monday's session with slim gains, the only sectors in positive territory.
The S&P 500 remains up 21.6% so far in 2021.
“Given the strength of the market so far this year, in some ways you could see investors take some profits and look for greater clarity in the new year,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
In company news,  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) shares fell 5.2% after the business software maker said it would buy electronic medical records company Cerner Corp (NASDAQ:CERN) for $28.3 billion. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 4.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.70-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted two new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 13 new highs and 346 new lows.

LONDON (Reuters) -British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday he would tighten coronavirus curbs to slow the spread of the Omicron variant if needed, after the Netherlands began a fourth lockdown and as other European nations consider Christmas restrictions.
Speaking after UK media reported Britain might impose new curbs after Christmas, Johnson said the situation was ""extremely difficult"" https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-says-12-deaths-104-people-hospitalised-by-omicron-2021-12-20 and hospitalisations were rising steeply in London.
""I have to say to the British public, and I say to everybody, we will not exclude the possibility of going further if we have to do things to protect the public,"" Johnson said after a cabinet meeting.
Omicron infections are multiplying rapidly across Europe and the United States, doubling every two or three days in London and elsewhere and taking a heavy toll on financial markets, which fear the impact on the global economic recovery.
The variant was first detected last month in southern Africa and Hong Kong and so far been reported in at least 89 countries. The severity of illness it causes remains unclear.
Any limits on Christmas celebrations would come at a high political cost for Johnson, already under fire over reports he and his staff broke lockdown rules last year.
Asked about speculation the government would ban indoor socialising and limit tourism, Johnson said: ""We're looking at all kinds of things ... we will rule nothing out.""
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced a shutdown https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/netherlands-starts-painful-christmas-coronavirus-lockdown-2021-12-19 on Saturday, ordering the closure of all but essential stores, as well as restaurants, hairdressers, gyms, museums and other public places until at least Jan. 14.
Germany plans to limit private gatherings from Dec. 28 to a maximum of 10 people who have been vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19, according to a draft of proposed steps.

In Washington D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said the city would reinstate an indoor mask mandate beginning Tuesday and running until the morning of Jan. 31. All employees, contractors and grantees of the District of Columbia government must be fully vaccinated against COVID and have a booster shot, she said.
In Geneva, World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Omicron is spreading faster https://www.reuters.com/world/omicron-spreading-infecting-vaccinated-who-2021-12-20 than the Delta variant and causing infections in people already vaccinated or who have recovered from COVID-19.
China, where the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was first detected in late 2019, must be more forthcoming with information about its origin, Tedros said. ""We need to continue until we know the origins. We need to push harder because we should learn from what happened this time in order to (do) better in the future.""WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said it was too early to conclude Omicron is milder than prior versions of the virus, adding that it could still make enough people sick to ""overburden"" healthcare systems.
Many monoclonal drugs ""will not work with Omicron,"" she said of the infused treatment used to lessen disease severity of COVID-19 patients.
Monoclonal antibody drugs deliver lab-made versions of the body's natural antibodies to fight infection, while vaccines spur the body to make its own antibodies and build its own immunity. 
Wall Street's main indexes opened lower on Monday, dragged down by concerns about the impact of tighter COVID-19 curbs on the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 500 points, or nearly 1.5% in afternoon trading. [MKTS/GLOB]
European stocks were down 1.33%. Shopper numbers across Britain's high streets fell 2.6% over the Dec. 18-19 weekend versus the previous weekend, researcher Springboard said.
Last week, the European Central Bank cut its euro zone growth forecast for next year to 4.2% from 4.6% previously, citing the pandemic among ""headwinds"".
ECB President Christine Lagarde said, even if economies were learning to adapt to living with COVID-19, tighter restrictions could delay the recovery. 
Israel added the United States to its ""no-fly"" list, citing concerns over the Omicron variant. U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said Omicron was ""raging through the world"" as he urged Americans to get booster shots.
Booster shots, on top of two-shot vaccinations, appear critical to fighting the variant.

The bank also said it is providing free COVID-19 test kits and will offer booster shots at onsite clinics in the new year, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The steps by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), which were reported earlier by Bloomberg News, came as financial firms try to adjust for the recent rise in coronavirus infections, as they want to push for more client meetings and in-office work and collaboration. A slew of other financial firms have adjusted plans as the virus spreads, such as  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS),  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc, Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and MetLife (NYSE:MET).

""We have decided to repeal the law and promote a plebiscite at the provincial level to listen to all the voices of the people,"" Chubut Governor Mariano Arcioni wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Monday.
Chubut province, in Argentina's southern Patagonian region, repealed the law after days of violent protests by local communities against the bill. The law would have allowed open-pit mining in two areas including where Canadian miner Pan American Silver's large Navidad silver project is based.
After approval of the law last week, government buildings in provincial capital Rawson were set on fire, roadblocks erected and clashes erupted in the streets.
The decision triggered an angry reaction from the mining sector. 
""When violence wins, the loser is Argentina,"" said a trade association for mining companies. 
""It looks like for some groups 'anything goes,' like burning down public buildings, destruction, threats...it's all allowed without the legal consequences that would be in place for any other citizens."" 
Pan America's Navidad has been on hold since 2013 when it ran afoul of provincial rules banning the use of cyanide in open-pit mining. Locals and environmental organizations oppose the exploitation of silver and lead due to the potential for contamination.

Pan American Silver did not reply to a request for comment.
Argentina, one of the world's top 10 silver producers according to the U.S. Geological Survey, is looking to expand mining production to bolster its embattled economy.

647,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2021 06:45PM ET</span>",Explainer-Why Trump's $1 billion capital raise was so popular,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump's new venture inked the second-largest ever private placement with convertible stock for a merger with a blank-check acquisition firm, according to SPAC Research, thanks to its unusually favorable terms and despite not having yet launched its social media app. 
None of the 36 investors that participated this month in the $1 billion capital raise, many of them hedge funds and family offices, have revealed their identities. Many of them fretted about publicly associating with Trump, who was banned from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) for encouraging the protests that preceded the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, sources have told Reuters.
The structure of the so-called private investment in public equity (PIPE) was atypically favorable to these investors, even though they could end up paying more than three times what investors in the blank-check acquisition firm's initial public offering in September paid, according to industry experts.
This is because they will be allowed to sell their shares right after the merger of the former president's Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) and the blank-check acquisition firm, Digital World Acquisition Corp, is completed, rather than a few months later as is customary. 
They will be entitled to buy the shares at a 40% discount to where the shares have traded, on average, in the 10 days following the deal's completion, with a ceiling of $33.60 per share and a floor of $10 per share, according to the terms of the deal.
Those investors can sell the shares immediately once the deal closes to lock in a profit. That selling would exert downward pressure on the share price. If the stock falls enough, they could get more shares based on the deal's formula, which they can sell again, in a trade that Wall Street refers to as a ""death spiral"" for the company's stock.

The merger, however, has proved popular with day traders and Trump supporters who invest in so-called ""meme stocks."" It's possible that enough of them will buy the stock to cancel out the impact of the PIPE investors dumping their shares.
Another perk afforded to the PIPE investors that is not seen in other such deals is the right to short the stock. That also allows them to lock in profits because they can borrow shares, sell them instantly, and then receive the shares they are entitled to at a discount after the merger closes so they can close out their positions.

648,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2021 06:25PM ET</span>","U.S. SEC to tighten insider trading rules, boost money market fund resilience","By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday proposed tightening a legal safe-harbor that allows corporate insiders to trade in a company's shares, and other rules to improve the resilience of money market funds.
The agency also unveiled measures to increase transparency around share buybacks and the complex derivatives at the center of New York-based Archegos Capital Management's meltdown earlier this year. 
The slew of long-awaited changes mark a milestone for SEC Chair Gary Gensler who has outlined an ambitious agenda to crack down on corporate wrongdoing, improve corporate governance and address inequities in the markets. 
The changes, which are subject to public consultation, will affect a swathe of corporate America, from publicly traded companies and their top executives, to banking groups and asset managers including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Vanguard, Fidelity and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). 
The proposed tightening of ""10b5-1"" corporate trading plans in particular was pushed by progressives who have long criticized the rules, saying they allow insiders to game the system and reap windfalls at the expense of ordinary investors.
The plans allow insiders to trade in a company's stock on a pre-determined date, providing legal protection against potential allegations of insider trading. Critics say it is far too easy to adopt, amend or cancel trades with little scrutiny.
Wednesday's proposal requires executives to disclose those plans and any modifications. For executives, the SEC also wants a ""cooling-off"" period of 120 days between the adoption of a plan and the first trade. For companies trading in their own securities, the cooling-off period would be 30 days.
The proposal would also bar insiders from having several overlapping plans, which Gensler said could allow them to cherry-pick favorable plans as they please. 
While critics have long said the plans are flawed, trades by executives at  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) during the COVID-19 vaccine development process renewed scrutiny of such plans and highlighted transparency issues, said Daniel Taylor a professor with expertise on issues related to financial disclosures at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. 
""There is mounting evidence that these plans are, at best, being used in a manner in which they were not intended, and at worst, being abused to enrich corporate insiders,"" Taylor said.
The SEC also said it wants companies to disclose share buybacks one business day after execution, in contrast to the current quarterly disclosure rule.
Investor groups welcomed the changes. 
""Cleaning up practices that can be a pathway for abusive trades will help restore trust in our markets,” said Amy Borrus, head of the Council for Institutional Investors.
The SEC also detailed changes to address systemic risks in the $5 trillion U.S. money market fund sector, which was bailed out for a second time during the 2020 pandemic-induced turmoil. 
Critics say the sector enjoys an implicit government guarantee.
SEC proposed new liquidity requirements, scrapping redemption fees and restrictions, and adjusting funds' value in line with dealing activity, a process known as ""swing pricing.""
While the funds industry has conceded changes are necessary, corporate groups may oppose some of the trading disclosures.
""Some of this appears to be overkill,"" said Howard Berkenblit, partner at law firm Sullivan and Worcester. ""A long cooling-off period and limits on the number of plans will be less popular and could cause a decrease in use of these plans.""
The SEC also outlined a plan to stamp out misconduct via security-based swaps. 

Such derivatives were at the center of the Archegos meltdown, which left Wall Street banks on the other side of the family office's trades with $10 billion in losses. 
Under the new rule, investors will have to publicly disclose such trades.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks ended trading on Monday down by more than 1%, pressured lower by surging Omicron coronavirus cases and a possible fatal blow to a $1.75 trillion U.S. domestic spending bill, with oil prices plunging.
U.S. stock indexes retreated more than 1% as positive COVID-19 case counts rose and President Joe Biden's social spending and climate bill hit a significant setback. U.S. COVID-19 cases have risen 50% this month, and the World Health Organization has said that cases are doubling in 1-1/2 to three days in areas with community transmission. 
Oil investors feared that new restrictions, which European countries are implementing, would weigh on fuel demand, sending crude prices lower.
""It was kind of a triple whammy on the economy over the weekend: Omicron, the Fed, and taking the fiscal initiative off the table,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management. ""The market is taking a hit. I think it’s an economic reset that investors are kind of gauging.""
The economic scare comes after the Federal Reserve decided last week to end its pandemic-era stimulus more quickly, with the central bank signaling at least three quarter-percentage-point interest rate hikes by the end of 2022.
In light of rising COVID-19 cases, the World Economic Forum postponed its annual meeting, which had been due to take place in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos in January, until mid-2022. 
Some economists expect the U.S. economy to grow more slowly next year after U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat who is key to Biden's hopes of passing the investment bill, said on Sunday he would not support the package.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.23% lower at 34,932.16, while the S&P 500 ended the day down 1.14% at 4,568.02. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.24% to 14,980.94.

U.S. crude recently fell 2.12% to $69.22 per barrel and Brent was at $72.01, down 2.05% on the day.
While coronavirus restrictions cloud the outlook for economic growth, they also risk keeping inflation elevated, prompting central banks to consider raising rates.

The dollar came under pressure on Monday as U.S. Treasury yields slipped. The dollar index fell 0.137%. In recent weeks it has rallied, and is up about 7% for the year.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Five Russians including a Kremlin-linked businessman now in U.S. custody carried out a vast, $82 million insider trading scheme that allowed them to profit from corporate information stolen through hacking, U.S. authorities said on Monday.
Vladislav Klyushin, the owner of a Moscow-based information technology company that prosecutors said had extensive ties to the Russian government, was extradited on Saturday from Switzerland to face conspiracy, securities fraud and other charges in Boston.
Klyushin, who was arrested in Switzerland in March while on a ski trip, appeared briefly from a Massachusetts jail during a virtual court hearing. A bail hearing is tentatively set for Thursday.
Prosecutors accused him and others of trading on corporate earnings reports obtained by hacking into the computer systems of two vendors that help companies filing quarterly and annual reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (SEC)
Those companies included  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Corp,  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. Prosecutors said Klyushin, 41, and employees of his company M-13 LLC placed trades for themselves as well for clients in exchange for a cut of their profits.
Authorities said the computer systems were hacked into by Ivan Yermakov, an M-13 employee who was among several Russian military intelligence officers charged in 2018 with carrying out hacking schemes to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and target anti-doping agencies. 
The scheme in total netted at least $82.5 million from 2018 to 2020, the SEC said in a related lawsuit.
Yermakov remains at large, along with three other defendants: M-13 director Nikolai Rumiantcev and two Russian businessmen who prosecutors say traded on the hacked information, Mikhail Irzak and Igor Sladkov.
They could not be reached for comment.

Klyushin's lawyers have called the case politically motivated and argued the real reason he was sought was his work and contacts within the Russian government, which calls the case part of part of a hunt for Russians by Washington.
But while Acting U.S. Attorney Nathaniel Mendell stressed Klyushin's ""extensive ties"" to the Kremlin, he said authorities did not know at the outset of the two-year probe ""where the facts and investigation would lead us.""

We urge you to use every mechanism at your disposal to investigate Amazon's labor and employment practices immediately.""
The lawmakers noted that the National Labor Relations Board had found that Amazon wrongfully terminated a worker who complained about unsafe working conditions during the coronavirus pandemic as well as two others who criticized Amazon's practices. 
The board also ordered a re-run of an election by workers who voted not to unionize because Amazon's actions ""made a free and fair election impossible.""
This month, the lawmakers said, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration said it would investigate the deaths of six people which occurred when an Amazon warehouse in Illinois collapsed during a tornado. 

""Amazon workers have voiced concerns regarding the company’s alleged lack of emergency response training, stringent cellphone policies, and expectations that workers continue to work during tornado warnings,"" the lawmakers said in the letter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Monday finalized new vehicle emissions requirements through 2026 that reverse former President Donald Trump's rollback of car pollution cuts and will speed a U.S. shift to more electric vehicles.
EPA Administrator Michael Regan called the tough standards ""doable"" even as he vowed to quickly move ahead with the next round of requirements. ""We are setting robust and rigorous standards that will aggressively reduce the pollution that is harming people and our planet,"" Regan said.
In August, President Joe Biden's administration proposed undoing the Trump-era action easing requirements imposed during the presidency of Barack Obama. The new rule finalized Monday is tougher than EPA's August proposal or requirements issued by Obama.
If expressed in miles per gallon (mpg) requirements, the EPA rules would result in a fleetwide real-world average of about 40 mpg in 2026, versus 38 mpg under the August proposal and 32 mpg under the Trump rules. 
Officials said the EPA as soon as next year could propose still tougher requirements through 2030 or beyond for vehicles.
""We urge the agency to get moving on the strongest possible long-term standards that rapidly accelerate the transition to zero-emission vehicles,"" said Sierra Club President Ramon Cruz. 
The Democratic administrations of Biden and Obama have pushed for stricter fuel efficiency standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change. The new rules will result in 3.1 billion tons of avoided CO2 emissions through 2050 and come after many states and environmental groups urged the administration to impose stricter rules.
Biden wants 50% of all new vehicles sold in 2030 to be EV or plug-in hybrid models but has not endorsed California's plan to phase out new gas-powered light-duty vehicles by 2035.
In March 2020, Trump's Republican administration rolled back Obama's standards to require only 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026. Obama had required 5% annual increases.
The new rules take effect in the 2023 model year and require a 28.3% reduction in vehicle emissions through 2026.
The rules will be challenging for automakers to meet, especially for Detroit's Big Three automakers. General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Chrysler-parent Stellantis NV appeared at an event Monday with Regan announcing the rules.
The Biden administration's EV plans suffered a setback Sunday when key Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said he would not support a $1.75 trillion domestic investment bill that includes new EV tax credits that would favor Detroit's Big Three automakers and the United Auto Workers (UAW) union.
UAW President Ray Curry said in an interview he is hopeful that the EV tax credits will ultimately be approved. 
A major auto trade association, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, said the new rules will require a substantial increase in electric vehicle sales and government incentives for consumers to buy those cars.
EPA estimates the vehicle emissions reduction benefits will exceed costs by up to $190 billion and drivers will save between $210 billion and $420 billion through 2050.
EPA estimates the savings from the new rules will outweigh the increase in vehicle costs by about $1,000 over the life of the vehicle.

EPA estimates the final rule will result in 17% of new U.S. vehicles by 2026 as EVs or plug-in hybrids. 
The transportation sector is the largest U.S. source of greenhouse emissions.

Joe Manchin Won’t Support Build Back Better Act,"The growing demand for solar power units and the passage of the Build Back Better Bill in the House of Representatives last month has raised investor optimism in the solar industry. However, Senator Joe Manchin’s current opposition to the climate change bill will likely stop the bill’s passage in the 50-50 Senate. As a result, it is wise to avoid fundamentally weak and overvalued solar stocks Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH), SolarEdge (SEDG), First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR), and Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) for now. The $1.75 trillion Build Back Better Bill was passed in the House of Representatives in November, which includes significant funding and tax credits for the renewable energy and electric vehicle industries. This, combined with the growing demand for residential and industrial solar power units, has raised investor optimism in the solar industry and incentivized companies to develop efficient product portfolios. The global solar energy market is expected to grow at a 20% CAGR to reach $200 billion by 2026.
However, Senator Joe Manchin III has recently shown his opposition to the social spending and climate change bill (designed to eliminate coal and natural gas), sharing concerns over certain provisions of the massive tax and spending bill and how it may exacerbate soaring inflation in the country. Manchin’s vote is crucial in passing the climate change bill in the 50-50 Senate.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 slipped Monday, as an Omicron-fueled surge in Covid-19 cases stoked worries about the  global economic recovery, sending cyclical stocks including financials sharply lower.
The S&P 500 fell 1.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.2%, or 433 points, the NASDAQ slumped 1.2%.
“Omicron news is dominating the headlines in the final trading days ahead of the Christmas holiday,” Stifel said following reports that the new variant had been identified in 43 out of 50 U.S. states.
The U.S. wave of Omicron is projected to “be in the steep part of its exponential growth in 2 to 3 weeks, just as we turn the corner into the new year,”Morgan Stanley said.
Cyclical stocks, those that move in tandem with the economy, were the hardest-hit, with banking stocks leading financials lower as U.S. Treasury yields.
Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF), Lincoln National (NYSE:LNC),  Capital One  Financial (NYSE:COF) were among the biggest decliners.
Falling Treasury yields hurts the net interest margin of banks – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to depositors.
In another blow to the outlook on the recovery, Senator Joe Manchin rejected the Biden administration’s $1.75 trillion spending program amid concerns about adding to the national debt.
Manchin later on Monday appeared to extend an olive branch, however, hinting that he would be willing to back a less costly version of the ‘Build Back Better Plan.’
Goldman cut its forecast for GDP in the first, second, and third quarters of 2022, and said “the odds [to pass the spending bill] have clearly declined and we will remove the assumption from our forecast.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. authorities have charged a Chicago doctor with insider trading, accusing him of using nonpublic information about drug trial results to reap illicit profits from buying shares of a California-based biotechnology company.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and federal prosecutors in Illinois said in statements on Monday they have charged a gastrointestinal medical oncologist Daniel V.T. Catenacci related to trading in securities of Five Prime Therapeutics (NASDAQ:FPRX) Inc. 
The doctor bought shares of the biotechnology company in advance of a Nov. 10, 2020 announcement it had gotten positive drug trial results for a cancer drug.
Authorities accused Catenacci of learning material nonpublic information about the positive results through his role as a lead clinical investigator for the drug trial. He has been cooperating with the government since the start of the investigation, Catenacci's attorney Jacob Kahn told Reuters.
""This is a complex area of law, and Dr. Catenacci did not intentionally breach any duty of confidence,"" Kahn said.
The doctor made more than $134,000 in illegal profits from the purchase and sale of the securities, authorities said. Catenacci was charged in a criminal information, a type of charging document usually used by prosecutors in connection with plea deals. It was not clear if Catenacci had a plea agreement. 
To settle the SEC's civil charges, Catenacci has agreed to pay a penalty in an amount to be determined by the court at a later date, the SEC said. The settlement is subject to court approval.

Catenacci is an associate professor of medicine, according to his LinkedIn profile and biography on the University of Chicago's website. A spokesperson for the school said he is on a leave of absence.
The spokesperson said in a statement that the university ""remains fundamentally committed to research integrity, protecting the rights of patients who participate in clinical trials, and honoring its obligations to government and industry research sponsors.""

Most major U.S. banks have had staff working in offices since the summer, but some are now choosing not to host holiday parties and others are strongly recommending staff to get booster shots. The following are the pandemic-related rules among Wall Street's biggest banks. 
For a FACTBOX on Canadian financial firms, click on
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)
The bank since late summer has been encouraging employees to get fully vaccinated and now to get their booster shots when eligible. It offers onsite clinics in several locations.
In December, the bank told New York City employees that they could work from home during the holidays and offered them free COVID-19 test kits.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)
Citigroup C.N told employees at its New York City office on Wednesday they could work from home if they were able to through the holidays, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The bank has been requiring employees in the United States to be vaccinated but is not mandating boosters. It is providing rapid test kits and encouraging testing for employees going into the office, a source said earlier.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)
The German lender has made COVID-19 boosters available to staff at its new midtown headquarters in New York City since early November, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)
As infections flared up in August due to the spreading of the Delta variant, the Wall Street bank mandated vaccines for all staff and visitors entering its offices in the United States.
Staff in the United States must be tested onsite on a weekly basis. The bank is also providing access to boosters for those eligible, although boosters are not mandatory.
Goldman postponed its remaining holiday parties in New York due to COVID-19 concerns, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The bank had held holiday parties over the last few weeks.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) 
The investment bank requires all staff who want to enter its offices to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and has said it will require boosters by Jan. 31, unless the person concerned is not yet eligible for the additional shot. The bank does not perform onsite testing.
Last week, following a spate of cases, the bank asked staff to work from home where possible and canceled all but essential travel.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)
The biggest U.S. bank, which has been one of the most aggressive in bringing employees back to the office, mandated face coverings for its U.S. employees in August, saying they would be required to wear masks in public indoor settings and in common areas regardless of vaccination status.
The bank in October said that it would restrict business travel for employees who are unvaccinated or have not disclosed their vaccination status. Such employees are required to get tested twice a week and contribute more of their pay toward medical insurance. It also mandated vaccines for new recruits in client-facing roles.
In December, JPMorgan instructed unvaccinated staff in Manhattan to work from home. It also relaxed mask requirements for vaccinated staff working in its Manhattan offices.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)
Morgan Stanley is asking employees, contractors and visitors to show proof of vaccination before entering its New York headquarters. The bank does not require additional COVID-19 testing for staff or visitors, a spokeswoman said.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co
The lender has said it strongly encourages employees to consider getting the COVID-19 vaccine but does not require it. The bank was providing all employees with four hours of paid leave to get the booster shot if eligible.
The bank also required employees to either document that they are fully vaccinated or get tested regularly.
Fidelity Investments

The company said it had paused its voluntary return-to-office plans in New England, citing a rising risk from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 moved off session lows Monday, but was still under pressure following a slump in financials amid fears that the omicron-fueled surge in Covid-19 cases would prompt further restrictions and derail the global economic recovery.
The S&P 500 fell 1.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.4%, or 519 points, the NASDAQ slumped 1.4%.
“Omicron news is dominating the headlines in the final trading days ahead of the Christmas holiday,” Stifel said following reports that the new variant had been identified in 43 out of 50 U.S. states.
The US wave of omicron is projected to “be in the steep part of its exponential growth in 2 to 3 weeks, just as we turn the corner into the new year,”Morgan Stanley said.
Cyclicals stocks, those that move in tandem with the economy were the hardest, with banking stocks leading financials lower as U.S. Treasury yields.
Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF), Lincoln National (NYSE:LNC),  Capital One  Financial (NYSE:COF) were among the biggest decliners.
Falling Treasury yields hurts the net interest margin of banks – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to depositors.
In another blow to the outlook on the recovery, Senator Joe Manchin rejected the Biden administration’s $1.75 trillion spending program amid concerns about adding to the national debt.
Manchin later on Monday appeared to extend olive branch, however, hinting that he would be willing to back a less costly version of the ‘Build Back Better Plan.’
Goldman cut its forecast for GDP in the first, second, and third quarters of 2022, and said “the odds [to pass the spending bill] have clearly declined and we will remove the assumption from our forecast.”
Energy, meanwhile, struggled to cut losses as oil prices remained pressure, though bounced off their session lows.

The plan, which had allocated billions for incentivizing electric vehicle (EV) production and sales, could have significantly boosted the industry. With the spending plan dropped and the persisting supply chain disruptions, it might be best to avoid EV stocks Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Rivian (RIVN), Lucid Group (LCID), and Fisker (FSR).Democratic Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia has decided to vote ‘no’ on the Build Back Better act, pulling the plug on the negotiations on the present version of the legislation expanding the country’s social safety net. Senator Manchin has shared his concerns over certain provisions of the $1.9 trillion spending plan and that it may exaggerate inflation.
The negative vote on the bill puts the Biden administration’s ambitious climate goals on hold. The package allocated more than $300 billion tax incentives for electric vehicles (EVs) and other clean energy measures. In addition, the bill also included a $12,500 refundable tax credit for EV purchases. However, in the present situation, for the bill to pass, every Democrat needs to vote ‘yes’ on it, as there is no Republican support for it.
On the other hand, the semiconductor shortage and the supply chain woes are expected to put pressure on company profits. Thus, EV stocks Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Rivian Automotive, Inc. (RIVN), Lucid Group, Inc. (LCID), and Fisker Inc. (FSR) might be best avoided now.

Furthermore, the shares of United States Steel Corporation (X) declined on Friday after the company issued fourth-quarter EBITDA guidance that failed to meet Wall Street’s expectations.
In addition, the debt crisis involving a major Chinese property developer has hit the performance of the world's second-largest economy’s steel sector, which is expected to affect the global scene given China’s dominance. With X having already issued a warning about a downturn for the steel industry, the segment remains volatile.

674,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2021 02:26PM ET</span>",Former oil executive appeals British Unaoil bribery conviction,"By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - A man convicted in Britain over how oil contracts were secured in post-occupation Iraq lodged an appeal on Monday, in another potential blow to one of the Serious Fraud Office's (SFO) most high-profile bribery cases.
Paul Bond, 69, received a three-and-a-half year jail sentence in March after an investigation into how Monaco-based oil consultancy Unaoil won contracts for Western clients in the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. 
The appeal by the former manager at Dutch energy services company SBM Offshore follows the Dec. 10 decision by London's Court of Appeal to overturn the conviction of his former co-defendant Ziad Akle, once a Unaoil manager for Iraq.
The court ruled that serious SFO failures rendered Akle's trial unfair and Bond's appeal will pile more pressure on SFO director Lisa Osofsky 10 days after the Attorney General ordered an independent review of the case.
Bond's legal team said the quashing of Akle's conviction, because the SFO had refused to disclose material to the defence that could have helped its case, made his conviction unsafe.
""The decision by the Court of Appeal, we believe, provides for the acquittal of the remaining convicted defendants, and we therefore are now making our own application,"" Joseph Kotrie-Monson of Mary Monson Solicitors, Bond's lawyer, said.
A representative for convicted co-defendant Stephen Whiteley declined to comment when asked whether he would follow suit. 
Court of Appeal judges rebuked the SFO for refusing to hand over to the defence documents that showed ""wholly inappropriate"" contact between the SFO and a U.S.-based fixer with vested interests, who wanted to persuade Akle and co-defendant Basil Al Jarah to plead guilty.
Without the material, defence lawyers were ""significantly handicapped"" when challenging whether a guilty plea by Al Jarah was reliable and admissible at the subsequent trial of Akle, Bond and Whiteley, the senior judges said.
The fixer, former DEA agent David Tinsley, worked for the prominent Ahsani family, which founded Unaoil.
British-Iranian brothers Cyrus and Saman Ahsani, Unaoil's former CEO and COO, pleaded guilty in the U.S. in 2019 to being part of a multimillion-dollar scheme to bribe government officials across nine countries but have not yet been sentenced.

Their father was not charged.
Judges said Tinsley wanted to deliver pleas from others to encourage the SFO to abandon any prosecution of the Ahsanis in Britain. Tinsley has said he acted properly throughout.

TORONTO/PARIS (Reuters) -Bank of Montreal said on Monday it will buy BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY)' U.S. unit, Bank of the West, for $16.3 billion in its biggest deal ever, allowing the Canadian lender to double its footprint in the world's biggest economy, while giving France's largest bank a huge step up in firepower for deals.
The deal gives BMO, Canada's fourth-largest lender, a large-scale presence in California, whose population is bigger than the bank's home country. It will add 1.8 million customers, increase the United States' contribution to total adjusted pre-provision, pretax earnings to 44% from 36% in fiscal 2021 and give the Canadian bank the ability to deploy almost all of its excess capital, which has been a drag on returns.
Analysts hailed the deal as a positive for BMO, which has made no secret of its ambitions to build on its existing presence in the United States. It has operated there for decades, from its acquisition of Harris Bank in 1984, to deals including its 2011 takeover of Marshall & Ilsley Bank.
That market, however, has proven increasingly unattractive for European lenders, and BNP Paribas has been struggling to keep up with larger retail banking rivals. BBVA (MC:BBVA) sold its U.S. operations to PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) in 2020 and HSBC Bank earlier this year sold most of its U.S. business to Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG) Group Inc.
For these banks, ""their entire organization was what they sold,"" BMO's chief financial officer, Tayfun Tuzun, told Reuters. ""We already have a very sizeable presence in the U.S., and have been investing in that organization in anticipation of an opportunity like this ... This company has been on our radar screen for a long time."" 
But the deal comes at a time when the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden is pushing regulators, including the Federal Reserve, to take a tougher line on mergers across the economy amid worries that declining competition is hurting everyday Americans. 
BMO's CEO, Darryl White, told investors on a conference call on Monday that he saw “no sensible reason” the bank would not obtain the green light from U.S. regulators. He noted the Fed's approval of three outstanding deals on Friday was a positive sign.
“While BMO is anticipating that the deal should be closed by the end of next year, regulatory uncertainty does exist,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts wrote in a note. 
BMO shares were down 2.5% at C$131.75 on Monday afternoon, on track for their lowest close since mid-October. They have lost more than 6%, including Monday's drop, since rumours of the deal surfaced last week. BNP Paribas shares closed up almost 0.5% on Monday. 
The acquisition allows BMO to further reduce its comparatively low exposure to the Canadian household sector, where ""borrowing capacity is somewhat limited,"" while capitalizing on an attractive U.S. growth opportunity, Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan said in a note. 
The Canadian bank expects ""meaningful"" revenue synergies from the deal, which will be further quantified in coming weeks, executives said on a conference call.
""BMO is paying a fair price for the Bank of the West franchise,"" Shanahan said, pointing out that the deal will lift earnings by about 10% in fiscal 2024, and that BMO expects to eliminate 35% of operating expenses without closing any branches. 
But analysts at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBW) said the $16 billion sale price was higher than many analysts had forecast.
""Achieving this price for Bancwest is a clear positive for shareholders and gives BNPP some strategic optionality, which has been a rare thing for European banks,"" wrote KBW.
EUROPEAN FOCUS 
BNP Paribas bought Bank of the West in 1979 and the unit had been its largest business outside of Europe. The sale will leave the French bank focused squarely on Europe, where it is growing in stature as one of the region's biggest investment banks as local rivals stall. In the past two years it has taken on equity and prime broking businesses from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Credit Suisse.
BNP said it would use the proceeds from the sale to fund more share buybacks, to finance bolt-on acquisitions and further develop its presence in both Europe and the United States. 

BMO has excess capital of about C$9.7 billion, Shanahan said - amassed during the pandemic following a March 2020 moratorium on capital redistributions by Canada's financial regulator that was lifted last month - which will be absorbed by this deal. It will also raise about C$2.7 billion through equity issuances to fund the deal, it said.
BMO put its share repurchase program, which it previously said it would restart, on hold until the Bank of the West deal closes at the end of calendar 2022.

The announcement, made after the bell Friday, means the medication is approved to treat a muscular disorder called generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adults who test positive for the anti-acetylcholine receptor. In addition, Argenx said Vyvgart is the first-and-only FDA-approved neonatal Fc receptor blocker.
Argenx shares are currently sitting just under the $336 level. Analysts have adjusted price targets following the announcement.  
Piper Sandler raised its price target to $375 from $354, keeping an overweight rating based on the Vyvgart news. However, analyst Allison Bratzel said she sees barriers to the immediate uptake and does not expect a commercial outperformance in the first few quarters of the launch of the medication.

Joe Manchin Ruins the Chance for US Climate Change Policy,"The efforts worldwide to gradually phase out fossil-fuel-powered vehicles make the EV industry’s prospects bright. However, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin’s ‘no’ position on President Biden’s Build Back Better Act makes the domestic EV industry’s prospects bleak. Therefore, we think it is better to avoid fundamentally weak EV charging stocks ChargePoint (CHPT), Blink Charging (BLNK), and EVgo (EVGO) because they could witness a downtrend in the near term.Last month, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the $1.75 trillion Build Back Better Act, which includes tax incentives of up to $12,500 per vehicle to spur consumer demand for electric vehicles (EVs). This initiative was formulated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve climate targets.
However, yesterday, Sen. Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat, said he would not vote for the Build Back Better Act. Democrats need Manchin’s vote in the 50-50 Senate. Because his decision could ruin the $1.75 trillion social spending and climate policy bill, the EV industry could suffer from low demand absent the tax incentives. A new study from the economic consulting firm Anderson Economic Group (AEG) stated that electric vehicles could be more expensive to fuel than their internal combustion engine counterparts.
Given this scenario, we think it could be wise to avoid fundamentally weak EV charging stocks ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. (CHPT), Blink Charging Co. (NASDAQ:BLNK), and EVgo, Inc. (EVGO).

The move comes a year after Morgan Stanley unveiled a scholarship fund for students in historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd. It committed to spending $12 million over four year for this purpose.
The initiative also includes partnerships with notable non-profit organizations including A Better Chance, Hispanic Federation, SEO and others.

Investing.com -- Stocks tumbled on Monday on the prospect of slowing growth, with a surge in new Covid cases because of the fast-spreading Omicron variant threatening new limitations on personal movement and business activities.
Sunday’s proclamation by Sen. Joe Manchin that he would not support President Joe Biden’s nearly $2 trillion social spending bill also weighed on the market. 
Goldman Sachs said U.S. first quarter economic growth could be lower without the stimulus the bill promised to inject.
European nations have already added new limitations on business, with the Netherlands closing bars and restaurants until mid-January. The annual confab of influencers, the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, postponed its January conference until at least mid-2022. It did the same last year, and then canceled it.
 Investors feared that closures could hit fuel demand, and that sent crude prices tumbling 5%.
This is all happening after the Federal Reserve said it would start to reduce the amount of monthly stimulus it was adding to the U.S. economy, with plans to cut its bond buying more rapidly than previously announced and a possible three rate hikes next year.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Micron earnings
Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU)will report its first-quarter numbers after the closing bell today. The company is expected to report profit per share of $2.10 on revenue of $7.68 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.
2.  General Mills  earnings
General Mills Inc (NYSE:GIS) will reveal its second-quarter results Tuesday. The company is seen posting revenue of $4.83 billion and profit per share of $1.05.
3. Rite Aid earnings
Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE:RAD)’s third-quarter loss per share is seen at 10 cents and revenue at $6.32 billion.

Investing.com —  Summit Therapeutics PLC  (NASDAQ:SMMT) shares have fallen almost 50% Monday after it revealed its phase 3 study evaluating its investigational drug, ridinilazole, failed to meet its primary endpoint.
The trial is assessing ridinilazole for Sustained Clinical Response as a potential treatment for patients suffering from C. difficile infection, an inflammation of the digestive tract caused by bacteria.
The study showed that ridinilazole resulted in a higher observed Sustained Clinical Response rate than antibiotic medication vancomycin but did not meet the primary endpoint for superiority. 
Despite the disappointment of the study not reaching its endpoint, Summit's Chairman and CEO Robert W. Duggan was upbeat, stating: ""We believe this study was indicative of worthwhile work, as the knowledge that we have acquired as a team over the past 18 months is priceless."" 
The company said it will continue to evaluate the data and perform additional analyses in order to discuss the next steps with regulatory agencies. "

(Reuters) -Presidio Petroleum LLC is in advanced talks to acquire around 5,000 shale gas wells from U.S. oil producer  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday.
Exxon's XTO Energy unit has been seeking buyers for its holdings in the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas, part of the company's drive to raise cash by shedding unwanted assets. Presidio, a closely-held producer backed by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Energy Partners, buys mature oil and gas fields and strives to boost output.
Exxon and Presidio did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comments.
Terms of the talks were not immediately available. Exxon had acquired the Fayetteville assets in 2010 for $650 million during a shale boom that would reshape the U.S. energy landscape.
Deal talks could still fall apart and Exxon could turn to another buyer or decide to retain the properties, the people said. They requested anonymity as the discussion are private.
The wells were among natural gas properties Exxon last year said it wanted to sell. It established a data room in November for potential buyers and put about 5,000 natural gas wells in the Fayetteville Shale on the block in August. 

The producing properties were valued at that time at between $400 million and $500 million, according another person familiar with the matter. U.S. gas prices are up 67% year to date, and were trading about $3.83 per million British thermal units on Monday.
Exxon has indicated it aims to close any sale in January. The properties' shale gas production has declined by half since 2016, to around 227 million cubic feet per day (mcfd) in the first half of this year, according to a marketing document seen by Reuters.

686,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2021 12:40PM ET</span>",Swiss bank UBS appeals against French money-laundering verdict,"By Michael Shields
ZURICH (Reuters) -UBS has filed an appeal with France's Supreme Court against last week's decision by a Paris court that upheld the Swiss bank's conviction for money laundering, while slashing its penalty for allegedly helping wealthy clients evade taxes.
""This enables UBS AG to thoroughly assess the verdict of the Court of Appeal and to determine next steps in the best interest of its stakeholders,"" Switzerland's biggest bank said in a statement on Monday.
Such an appeal in France usually takes months. The Supreme Court can only rule on a legal technicality, rather than the merit of the case. If it finds in favour of UBS, the case returns to the appeal court.
The Paris appeals court reduced UBS's penalty to 1.8 billion euros ($2.03 billion), less than half of an overall fine of 4.5 billion euros imposed against the bank after a first trial in 2019.
UBS, however, had hoped to see the charges thrown out by the appeals court, particularly the money-laundering allegation, because of the potential reputational damage to the world's biggest wealth manager.
Fines in Europe for tax-related and other offences have historically been lower than in the United States, with the UBS case marking an exception that has been closely watched by other banks.
Analysts are also watching the case to see how much excess capital UBS may distribute to shareholders.
Confirming the verdict of the 2019 trial, the appeals court found UBS guilty of soliciting clients illegally at sporting events and parties in France, and of laundering the proceeds of tax evasion.
UBS has already set aside 450 million euros in provisions in connection with the case.
Lawyers for the bank had argued in the appeals trial that despite whistleblowers coming forward, investigators had never found clear evidence of systematic attempts by UBS sales consultants to canvass French customers, including at client events like cocktail parties and hunts.

The bank had also argued that the original fine was disproportionate.

So, we think it could be wise to sidestep market volatility by betting on quality dividend-paying stocks Intel (INTC) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK). They also look undervalued at their current price levels. Let’s discuss.Growing concerns about the potential economic impact of the COVID-19 omicron variant and related restrictions contributed to the major stock market indexes closing in the red on Friday, capping off a week of extreme market volatility. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 532.20 points intraday to close Friday’s trading session at 35,365.44, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index fell 48.03 points and 10.75 points, respectively, to close at 4,620.64 and 15,169.68.
Investors have remained cautious about taking new long positions because November inflation data showed that consumer prices have surged to a 6-8%, 40-year high, their fastest increase since 1982. Inflationary pressures have forced the Fed to act, and it has indicated that it will halt its pandemic-driven asset purchases early next year, giving way to three interest rate hikes in 2022 to counter the high inflation threat. However, according to a FactSet report, the S&P 500 will close at or above 5,000 by fiscal 2022.
So, we think it could be wise to bet on quality dividend-yielding stocks to hedge one’s portfolio against market volatility by ensuring a steady income stream. Given their stable dividend yield, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) could be solid additions to one’s portfolio.

GME shares skyrocketed earlier this year, driven by retail investors on forums such as Reddit's WallStreetBets and easy-to-access platforms like  Robinhood Markets , Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD). But the stock tumbled to multi-month lows on December 13. GME shares have slumped 25.9% in price over the past month to close the last trading session at $155.64.

Let’s see if you need to invest in these beaten-down stocks at current prices.Airline stocks fell off a cliff at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. As borders were shut and lockdowns were imposed, travel came to a standstill. The rollout of vaccinations in early 2021 led to an increase in domestic travel as international quarantine rules turned away lucrative travelers.
Last month a new COVID-19 variant called Omicron was detected in South Africa. It has since been spreading throughout the world and has led to countries imposing serious restrictions and lockdowns.
This has resulted in another round of selling in airline stocks, such as Southwest (LUV) and Delta (DAL).

(Reuters) -European stocks ended lower on Monday in their worst session for three weeks amid a wider equities sell-off, with investors fretting over the spectre of tighter pandemic curbs hitting the global economy as cases of the Omicron coronavirus strain surge. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 dropped -1.4% to its lowest in two weeks. Oil companies , miners and auto stocks led declines, with all major sub-indexes ending lower. 
Travel stocks fell 1%, but were well above their intra-day lows touched earlier in the session, as some traders believed that positive vaccine-related headlines helped limit further losses. 
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc said that a booster dose of its COVID-19 vaccine appeared to be protective against the fast-spreading Omicron variant in laboratory testing.
""Headlines about booster shots working against the Omicron variant are providing little support, but if we are heading towards more movement restrictions and as long as virus cases continue to rise, we will see stock markets remain under pressure for awhile,"" said Equiti Capital analyst David Madden.
Britain may impose new restrictions to slow the spread of the Omicron variant after Christmas, media reported on Monday, a day after the Netherlands began a fourth lockdown and as other European nations consider putting a squeeze on Christmas.
The FTSE 100 index dropped 1%, driven by weakness in commodity-linked shares - including a more than 5% drop in oil prices - as the spread of Omicron across Europe stoked demand worries. 
Madden added that reduced liquidity in the last weeks of December could also be leading to the exacerbated moves. 
Last week, the STOXX 600 rallied after the European Central Bank promised continued economic support and the U.S. Federal Reserve flagged a long-awaited end to its pandemic-era stimulus in March, while delivering an upbeat outlook.
Among individual shares, argenx leaped 8.3% to the top of the benchmark STOX 600 after the Belgian group reached a regulatory milestone for its receptor blocker.

LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global merger and acquisition (M&A) activity shattered all-time records in 2021, comfortably erasing the high-water mark that was set nearly 15 years ago, as an abundance of capital and sky-high valuations fuelled frenetic levels of dealmaking.
The value of M&A globally topped $5 trillion for the first time ever, with volumes rising 63% to $5.63 trillion by Dec. 16, according to Dealogic data, easily surpassing the pre-financial-crisis record of $4.42 trillion in 2007.
""Corporate balance sheets are incredibly healthy, sitting on $2 trillion of cash in the U.S. alone -- and access to capital remains widely-available at historically low costs,"" said Chris Roop who co-heads North America M&A at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
Technology and healthcare, which typically account for the biggest share of the M&A market, led the way again in 2021, driven partly by pent-up demand from last year when the pace of M&A activity fell to a three-year-low due to the global financial fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Companies rushed to raise funds from stock or bond offerings, large corporates took advantage of booming equity markets to use their own stock as acquisition currency, while financial sponsors swooped on publicly listed companies.
Moreover, robust corporate earnings and an overall bright economic outlook gave chief executives the confidence to pursue large, transformative deals, despite potential headwinds such as inflationary pressures.
""Strong equity markets are a key driver of M&A. When stock prices are high, that usually corresponds with a positive economic outlook and high CEO confidence,"" said Tom Miles, co-head of Americas M&A at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Overall deal volumes in the United States nearly doubled to $2.61 trillion in 2021, according to Dealogic. Dealmaking in Europe jumped 47% to $1.26 trillion, while Asia Pacific rose 37% to $1.27 trillion. 
""While China cross-border activity has been modest, corporates from other Asian countries have stepped up to buy global assets. We expect to see this trend continue, especially for deals in Europe and the United States,"" said Raghav Maliah, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' global vice chairman of investment banking.
A number of the year's biggest transactions -- AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)'s $43 billion deal with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc and the $34 billion leveraged buyout of Medline Industries Inc -- were announced during the first half of the year. [nL3N2N4326}
But the pace of dealmaking showed no signs of slowing in the second half.
On Nov. 21, KKR made a bid approach for Italy's biggest telecoms operator,  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT), valuing it at roughly $40 billion including net debt in what would rank as the biggest ever private equity buyout in Europe should it go ahead, and the second largest globally.
Easy availability of financing drove private equity deals, with volumes more than doubling from last year to a record $985.2 billion, according to Dealogic.
""Investors are deploying cash at an unprecedented pace which means that, on a global basis, asset valuations have peaked to historic levels,"" said Luigi de Vecchi, chairman of Europe, Middle East and Africa banking capital markets advisory at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C). 
""The question is whether the prices being paid now will continue to make sense over time.""
Pressured to make their businesses greener and more climate-friendly, company executives have been hunting for targets with the right climate credentials.
""Along with technology and digital transformation, sustainability is here to stay and is a key focus for most boardrooms,"" said Citi's de Vecchi.

The dealflow is showing no sign of slowing down as companies and investors rush to sign deals ahead of possible interest rate hikes.
Borrowing costs are widely expected to inch up in the coming months with the U.S. Federal Reserve indicating it will increase rates next year to combat soaring inflation. Nonetheless, bankers expect dealmaking activity to remain robust. 
""I don't think upward movement in interest rates alone is going to be the catalyst that sidetracks the M&A market,"" said Morgan Stanley's Miles.
Top deal advisers are concerned about the fallout from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) increasingly adversarial stance towards merger activity over the past year, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s proposed $40 billion takeover of British chip designer Arm among the latest deals it is trying to block. 
""The FTC and Department of Justice are already taking more time than ever before to evaluate deals, so companies pursuing M&A must be ready to discuss their deals with regulators up front, at any time,"" said Krishna Veeraraghavan, an M&A partner at law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP.
He added that companies would need to wait longer to get deals through - up to a year and a half versus the usual 6-12 months - and should go into a merger ""willing to litigate"".

For all the headwinds, the year ahead still offers plenty of opportunities as the market for special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) has recently reopened, with new listings in Europe, after coming under regulatory scrutiny in the United States.
""With private equity and with the dry powder in the SPAC world we expect the momentum to continue well into 2022,"" said Philipp Beck, head of EMEA M&A at UBS.

Investing.com – Zoom Video stock (NASDAQ:ZM) rose 3% on Monday on renewed interest in the company as fears over the Omicron variant gather strength and countries bring back limits on the movement of people and business activities. 
The company behind the popular video conferencing app was one of the biggest winners of the pandemic last year as both corporates and individuals used it to connect with each other, conduct official meetings and online studies within the confines of homes.
However, as economies reopened and corporates called staff back to offices, the stock has struggled. It has more than halved since touching a high of $451.70 on February 16.  
Labelled ""of concern"" by the World Health Organization, Omicron has been reported in more than 80 countries, and now dominates the Delta variant in many nations. Omicron, which studies show to have a far higher reproduction rate than Delta, has forced several countries to reimpose restrictions on the movement of people and on business activity.
The U.K. has reported more than 90,000 new cases daily for the last three days, a record. Several states in the U.S. are also reporting an uptick in numbers.
Several firms on Wall Street and those in Silicon Valley have delayed return to office. Among the prominent ones are Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Ford and Uber (NYSE:UBER)."

The company’s better-than-expected quarterly earnings caused the stock to gain slightly in price. However, with relatively low profit margins and rising input costs, will WGO be able to thrive in the highly competitive RV market? Read more to find out.Recreational vehicle (RV) manufacturer Winnebago Industries, Inc. (WGO) in Forest City, Iowa, operates in six segments–Grand Design Towables; Winnebago Towables; Winnebago Motorhomes; Newmar motorhomes; Chris-Craft Marine; and Winnebago Specialty Vehicles. The demand for RVs rose substantially amid the COVID-19 pandemic as people sought alternative travel options with lower risks of contracting the virus. WGO CEO Michael Happe said in an interview that the pandemic accelerated WGO’s growth trajectory because the company was able to optimize retail pricing in a way it had not been able to do in a long time.
For its fiscal year 2022 first quarter, ended November 27, 2021, WGO’s revenues increased 45.7% year-over-year to a record $1.20 billion, surpassing the FactSet consensus estimate of $1.03 billion. This can be attributed to 37.5% organic growth, driven by strong consumer demand and pricing increases. Its gross profit came in at $229.40 million, up 67.4% from the year-ago value. Its net income improved 73.5% from the same period last year to $99.60 million. And its adjusted EPS stood at $3.51, reflecting a 97.2% rise from the prior-year quarter. And the company beat the Street’s EPS estimates by 50%.

Those who have decided to leave include Chief Technology Officer Michael Leiters, the carmaker said. 
The planned reorganisation, to be unveiled in detail on Jan. 10, was consistent with Ferrari's ""strategic goals of exclusivity, excellence and sustainability"", it said.
Vigna, an industry veteran, took the CEO role at the beginning of September with a task to drive Ferrari into the new era of electrification.
The new management structure will ""further foster innovation, optimise processes and increase collaboration both internally and with partners"", the carmaker said.
Leiters, a German national who joined Ferrari in 2014, has helped develop Ferrari's recent most successful models, including the 2019's SF90 Stradale and this year's 296 GTB, the house's first two hybrid electric cars.

Other top managers leaving the company are Chief Manufacturing Officer Vincenzo Regazzoni and Chief Brand Diversification Officer Nicola Boari, who oversaw Ferrari's push into luxury, with the unveiling in June of its first in-house fashion collection.
Key figures in the new organisational framework have been already identified through internal promotions and new hires, and will join the company starting from next month, Ferrari said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission member Elad Roisman said on Monday that he intends to resign his role as commissioner by the end of January before completing his five-year term.
Roisman notified President Joe Biden, a Democrat, of his plans in a letter sent on Monday, he said in a statement. 
He departs early as the SEC enacts a robust regulatory agenda under SEC Chair Gary Gensler, a Democratic appointee who has prioritized cracking down on misconduct by Wall Street companies and putting an end to the four years of rule-easing that brokers, funds and public companies had enjoyed under Republican President Donald Trump.
Roisman previously served as chief counsel at the U.S. Senate Banking Committee and joined the SEC in 2018.
The SEC will now have three Democrats, including Chair Gensler, and one Republican member. 

While this may not necessarily change the Commission's voting dynamic or priorities - as Democrats already held the majority - analysts say the gap in agency votes may now always come down to party line. 
""Serving the American people as a Commissioner and an Acting Chairman of this agency has been the greatest privilege of my professional life.

Investing.com – Biogen stock (NASDAQ:BIIB) fell 0.7% on Monday after the company said it is cutting prices of its Alzheimer’s drug aduhelm to $28,200 per year for an average weight person.
The cut, about half of the previous price, comes as sales were slow to take off because of the high-cost treatment. Many hospitals refused to support the treatment.
On June 7, aduhelm became the first drug in 18 years to secure the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s nod for treatment of patients suffering from the neurodegenerative disease.
The approval attracted much flak from various stakeholders because of perceived lack of benefits of the treatment over existing alternatives. The controversy over the approval was further stoked by the expensive annual $56,000 price tag of the treatment. Biogen's price for treatment of an average weight person was seen as a significant burden on Medicare, which covers more than 60 million people.
At least three members of the FDA’s advisory panel resigned in protest against the regulator’s nod.
The company now believes with insurance coverage, and access to diagnostics and specialized centers, approximately 50,000 patients may initiate treatment with aduhelm in 2022.
Biogen also said it will implement cost-reduction measures in 2022 to better align its costs with its revenue base, which is expected to be affected by the continued entry of generics in multiple sclerosis, as well as the delayed uptake of aduhelm."

The company's stores offer products in categories that include dairy and deli, produce, floral, and fresh meat and seafood.
Investors’ concerns over the pace of economic recovery due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases, high inflation, and a supply chain crisis have kept the market volatile. However, several retail companies have strengthened their online presence.

Invictus Global Management said in a public letter to Delta's board of directors that it opposed the plan put forward by Aeromexico. 
Aeromexico last week said an unnamed third party would make a tender offer valuing its outstanding shares at a fraction of their previous market price as part of its efforts to emerge from bankruptcy. 
Delta's stake would be diluted to 20%, while Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), a fund that often invests in bankrupt companies, would become Aeromexico's biggest shareholder.

It added that the proposal included ""seemingly egregious financial terms that defy decades of bankruptcy precedent.""
Invictus is a Delta shareholder as well as a sizeable creditor of Aeromexico, it said.

(Reuters) -Several companies, including Grab Holdings and BuzzFeed, that merged with shell entities to go public have seen their shares tumble, as investors pull the rug out from under the stocks hyped in Wall Street's frenzied blank-check deals this year.
Shares of BuzzFeed, which merged with blank-check firm 890 5th Avenue Partners, have plunged 40% since their debut on Dec. 6. The digital media firm raised a paltry $16 million out of $288 million in the SPAC's trust as 94% of its investors took their money back.
Grab Holdings, southeast Asia's biggest ride-hailing and delivery firm, has lost half its market capitalization since its Nasdaq debut on Dec. 2 following the company's record $40 billion merger with a blank-check firm.
""A lot of investors are now looking more toward companies that have proven track records, that have demonstrated history of delivering profit,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. ""The frenzy that has been driving some of the momentum in SPACs that we saw earlier in the year has clearly gone away.""
Special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC) are shell companies that raise money in an initial public offering (IPO) and put it in a trust for the purpose of merging with a private company and taking it public.
Since investors are unaware of the target company ahead of the IPO, SPACs often grant them the right to redeem their initial investment as an incentive to put their money in the trust.
The average redemption rate has more than doubled to 58% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, data from Dealogic showed, as many companies fall short of investors' lofty expectations. 
In the case of Zoom Video Communications-backed event management software company Cvent, nearly 85% of investors redeemed their shares for cash two days before its debut, its filing showed.
Vacation rental management company Vacasa received gross proceeds of about $340 million from its debut on Dec. 8, $145 million below its expectations due to redemption.
Vacasa's business is well capitalized through the SPAC deal as it retained greater than 50% of cash in the company's trust account, CEO Jamie Cohen told Reuters.
""SPACS got crazy in February and investors started looking at them like meme stocks. Then Lucid crashed and the SEC starting issuing negative comments and SPACs fell out of favor,"" said Matthew Tuttle, chief executive officer of Tuttle Capital Management LLC. 
U.S. regulators said last week they were considering toughening rules around how underwriters, boards of directors and sponsors of SPAC structure fees, issue projections and disclose conflicts.
SPACs are among the group that have seen a decline in retail investor participation, according to Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research
The De-SPAC index, which tracks the 25 largest companies to have completed a blank-check merger, is down around 43% so far this year after touching a record high in mid-February. 

Still, merging with blank-check firms remains a popular option, with 2021 being a record-breaking year as 604 SPACs raised $144 billion, Renaissance Capital disclosed in its annual review. However, 62% of the entire year's proceeds were raised in just the first quarter. 
Grab and BuzzFeed declined to comment, while Cvent did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) is changing to a Saturday-Sunday weekend from the New Year in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), according to an internal note seen by Reuters, becoming the latest international bank in the gulf nation to switch its work week.
Citi UAE will move its corporate offices in the country to a Monday to Friday full working days structure, with a two-hour fixed break time in the afternoon on Friday, the note said, adding that employees are required to return to work after the fixed break.
Citi's decision comes as other global banks in the nation are changing to a Monday-Friday work week from next year instead of the current Sunday-Thursday — as is common around the Middle East.
Reuters had reported on Sunday of Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA's move to switch to a Saturday-Sunday weekend from 2022 in UAE.
However, Citibank branches in the Sunni Muslim-ruled country will be open Monday through Saturday and remain closed on Sunday, as per the internal note. Its branches will operate from 0730 hours through 1230 hours local time on Friday and 0800 hours to 1400 hours on rest of the working days.
The Wall Street bank's UAE unit, which welcomed the new work week changes by the government in the country, said its move is to ""best adapt"" to the new structure and comply with the country's central bank's opening hours requirement, the note added.

The UAE had said on Dec. 7 it would shift to a four-and-a-half day week with a Saturday-Sunday weekend from the start of next year. Private companies were, however, free to choose their own working week.
Over the past year, the UAE has taken measures to make its economy more attractive to foreign investment and talent amid growing economic rivalry with Saudi Arabia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -General Motors Co said Monday it is extending a production halt at its Orion Assembly plant in Michigan, which makes the Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicle, through the end of February.
The largest U.S. automaker in August widened its recall of the Bolt to more than 140,000 vehicles to replace battery modules after a series of fires. Earlier this month, it extended its production shutdown through late January. GM has also indefinitely halted retail sales of new Bolt vehicles.
The suburban Detroit plant halted production in August but conducted two weeks of limited production at Orion starting Nov. 1 to help provide courtesy transportation vehicles for customers during recall repairs.
GM President Mark Reuss said in October the company was addressing the recall before resuming production. The company said Monday it will continue to prioritize recall repairs and ""focus on battery module replacements.""
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has an ongoing investigation into the battery fires. The agency noted in August that all Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles had been recalled due to the risk of the high-voltage battery pack catching fire. 
GM disclosed in October that its battery partner, South Korea's LG Electronics, had agreed to reimburse it for the $2 billion in estimated costs and expenses associated with the Bolt recall.

GM and LG Energy Solution are building two joint-venture U.S. battery plants. Reuters reported earlier this month GM has proposed building a $2.5 billion battery plant near Lansing with LG Energy Solution, citing documents filed with the city.
The largest U.S. automaker is separately considering a $2 billion overhaul of its Orion Township assembly plant north of Detroit to build next-generation electric vehicles. The total investments could top $4 billion, a source familiar with the plan told Reuters.

Investing.com – Cerner stock (NASDAQ:CERN) rose 1.1%, to $90.86, after the company said Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) would buy it for $95 a share, or around $28.3 billion.
Trading in Cerner shares was halted earlier in the day pending the news. Oracle shares fell 3%.  
Expected to close some time in 2022, Oracle CEO Safra Catz said the all-cash deal will add immediately to Oracle’s earnings on adjusted basis and contribute substantially more second financial year onward. Cerner will be organized as a dedicated industry business unit within Oracle, the former said in a press release.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the deal last week.
Healthcare – a $3.8-trillion industry last year in the U.S. alone according to Oracle -- already has a key presence in the enterprise software company’s revenue stream. Cerner offers technology to help insurers, care providers and public health systems parse data for better patient outcomes.
The acquisition is expected to help Oracle’s pivot to the cloud, a move the company was initially relatively slow to embrace. Its strategy has become more aggressive in the last year as rivals Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have surged ahead. 
Cerner said the goal is to deliver zero unplanned downtime in the medical environment.
In a post-Covid world, healthcare has become a go-to industry for tech companies to tap new areas of growth. Microsoft has struck a $16-billion deal to buy  Nuance Communications  (NASDAQ:NUAN), a provider of clinical speech recognition software, medical transcription and medical imaging. That deal awaits regulatory approval.

James Walker has been appointed CEO ad interim of Credit Suisse Holdings (USA) Inc, the memo from Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein said.
The departure extends the upheaval at Credit Suisse, which under new Chair Antonio Horta-Osario last month reined in its investment bankers and focused more on private banking as it tries to curb a freewheeling culture that has cost it billions in a string of scandals.
Varvel was head of the asset management division which sold wealthy clients investments linked to UK supply chain financier Greensill. 
Credit Suisse had to suspend $10 billion worth of the investments as Greensill headed for collapse in March, heaping pressure on the bank and its top bosses.
Varvel was removed as head of asset management in a leadership overhaul shortly after Greensill went bust.
The memo gave no reason for Varvel's exit. The Financial Times had reported last week that he was in talks to leave, owing partly to disagreement with Horta-Osario.

""I speak for us all when I say we appreciated Eric's optimism, his leadership and his winning attitude. He has developed remarkably durable and deep relationships with colleagues and clients alike,"" Gottstein wrote in the memo.
""Based on a great many conversations with Eric, I know the difference he made for this institution, its people and our clients over the years.""

714,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 20, 2021 09:45AM ET</span>","Wall Street Tumbles at Open as Omicron Fear, Rate Backdrop Weigh; Dow Down 600 Pts","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets started the weak in bearish fashion, with all three major indices falling over 1% in response to fears of another Covid-19 driven slowdown - this time accompanied by the prospect of rising interest rates.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 601 points, or 1.7% at 34,764 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were both down 1.4%. The Dow, with its heavy weighting of cyclical stocks, underperformed as warnings of the spread of the new Omicron variant of Covid-19 stoked fears that people will shun mixing over the next few weeks, even if they are allowed to. 
The mood was also soured by news over the weekend that Sen. Joe Manchin (D., WVa.) had effectively blocked the passage of the 'Build Back Better' bill through the Senate, saying he couldn't support it in its current form. With the Senate split 50-50, the only chance of passing it ""as is"" depends on the administration convincing Republican Senators to vote for it - something that appears unlikely in the current environment. 
Goldman Sachs analysts downgraded their growth forecasts in response to the news, factoring in a lower fiscal stimulus and also the negative effect on labor supply. The bill had aspired to make it easier for low- and middle-income families to get child care, making it easier for both parents in a household to take jobs. Labor constraints have increasingly been cited as a risk factor in U.S. companies' earnings updates over the last couple of weeks, with high-profile strikes at the likes of Kellogg (NYSE:K) and Deere (NYSE:DE).
The morning belonged to pharma companies, with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) all bucking the trend, while reopening plays suffered particularly. Pfizer stock rose 1.1% to a new all-time high, while Moderna stock rose 1.7% after saying trial data showed that a booster shot of its Covid-19 vaccine largely restored its effectiveness against the new Omicron strain of the virus, which forced a string of restrictive measures in Europe over the weekend, including a full lockdown in the Netherlands. 
Novavax stock meanwhile, soared at the opening after the EU's medicines regulator cleared its Covid-19 vaccine for use by adults in the EU. However, the stock quickly ran into profit-taking to trade down 2.6% by 10 AM ET. It has risen some 50% so in the last two weeks. The company aims to produce a new version tailored specifically to Omicron in the next couple of months. 
The one reopening play outperforming was AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock:  it rose 0.7% after a record-busting opening by the ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" movie provided a reminder of the pent-up demand for shared big-screen experiences. 
Elsewhere, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) stock fell 2.9% after the software giant confirmed the acquisition of Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) for a slightly higher price than had previously been mooted."

Furthermore, the stock tumbled in price on the company’s recent quarterly numbers, which missed consensus estimates. According to SCS, supply chain issues and inflationary pressures have hindered its performance. So, because SCS’ operational headwinds are expected to remain in the current quarter due to COVID-19 omicron-variant-related uncertainties, is SCS a buy now? Read on. Steelcase Inc . (NYSE:SCS) in Grand Rapids, Mich., manufactures and sells integrated furniture settings, user-centered technologies, and interior architectural products in the United States and internationally. The stock has slumped 15.6% in price over the past year and 18% year-to-date to close its last trading session at $11.11. The stock is currently trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.
The office furniture maker’s shares tumbled after the company reported lower than expected third-quarter top- and bottom lines on December 16. SCS’ shares fell 3.5% intraday in Friday’s trading session. The company’s revenue came in at $738.20 million, versus a $767.63 million consensus estimate. Also, its adjusted EPS came in at $0.08, missing analysts’ estimates by 11.1%. The company cited several supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, and higher costs associated with supply chain disruptions that have negatively impacted its growth trajectory over the quarter. SCS also noted that its earnings could “have been approximately three times higher this quarter” if the company had not dealt with these operational challenges. SCS expects its fourth-quarter revenue to be within $740 - $765 million, translating to 9 - 13% year-over-year growth. It expects its earnings per share for the quarter to be approximately breakeven. But its supply chain issues, and inflation are expected to continue through the quarter.
However, SCS is optimistic about its long-term growth. In addition, because companies worldwide are transitioning to hybrid work structures and bringing employees back to offices, requiring changes and re-equipment in those offices, SCS expects the shift to provide immense opportunities. However, the newly identified COVID-19 omicron variant is hampering companies’ office return plans. Surging omicron cases have compelled companies to keep their return-to-office plans on hold, and if the variant continues to spread, SCS’ near-term growth expectations could be hindered.

An NFT, which is a digital asset usually bought with cryptocurrencies or in dollars, encompasses everything from images, videos to text. The ownership record is tracked on the blockchain, which serves as a public ledger allowing anyone to verify the NFT's authenticity. 
Traded since around 2017, NFTs initially gained popularity in early 2021 and then around August.
Last week, former U.S. first lady Melania Trump launched an NFT and blockchain technology venture, which was spearheaded by Parler.
""Parler will continue building its digital offering with an NFT pipeline that builds communities and fosters creativity while furthering its commitment to free speech and security,"" the company said in a statement on Monday. 

The app was launched in 2018 as a social-media site, styling itself as a free-speech space for those seeking an alternative to major platforms such as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). It quickly gained traction from supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump. 
Parler, however, went dark for about a month after being cut off by major technology platforms Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) that accused the app of failing to police violent content related to the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.

ZHEZKAZGAN, Kazakhstan (Reuters) - Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa returned to Earth on Monday after a 12-day journey into space, ending a practice run for his planned trip around the moon with Elon Musk's SpaceX in 2023.
The 46-year-old fashion magnate and art collector, who launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Dec. 8 along with his assistant Yozo Hirano and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin, landed on the Kazakh steppe. 
Maezawa, a space enthusiast, made the trip in a Soyuz spacecraft and became the first space tourist to travel to the International Space Station (ISS) in more than a decade.
One of Japan's most flamboyant public figures, Maezawa entertained his social media followers from space by taking photos of his home prefecture of Chiba, showing how to make tea in zero gravity and discussing his shortage of fresh underwear.
The entrepreneur returned to snowy conditions on Earth, with precipitation and sub-zero temperatures at the landing site about 150 km (93 miles) south east of the town of Zhezkazgan in central Kazakhstan.

Maezawa will become the first private passenger on the SpaceX moon trip in 2023, as commercial firms including Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin usher in a new age of space travel for wealthy clients.

Investing.com –  Novavax  stock (NASDAQ:NVAX) climbed 10% in Monday’s premarket trade as the company’s much-delayed Covid vaccine secured the European medicines regulator’s approval for treating adults.
Formal approval from the European Commission is still outstanding but is generally a rubber-stamp process.
The company will market its NVX-CoV2373 vaccine as Nuvaxovid.
Novavax has a contract to supply the EU with up to 200 million doses of its vaccine. The Serum Institute of India, the Indian company behind a large part of AstraZeneca's (NASDAQ:AZN) Covid-vaccine supplies, will also be making Novavax’s Covid shots. It will later be supplemented with production from other sites in Novavax's global supply chain, the U.S. company said.
Novavax’s Covid vaccine secured the World Health Organization’s nod on Friday. That approval allows it to ship doses to the Covax program, providing another vaccine to low-income countries.
The protein-based vaccine developed by Novavax has been shown in trials to be more than 90% effective against a variety of coronavirus variants. The company plans to begin commercial manufacturing of a vaccine tailored to the highly transmissible Omicron coronavirus variant in January, according to Reuters.
Novavax's shot has received authorization for emergency use in Indonesia and the Philippines, and the company has filed for similar approvals in U.K., U.A.E., Australia, New Zealand, India, Canada, Singapore and Japan. The WHO and the EU approvals should make those clearances easier.
Novavax expects to file with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval in the U.S. by the end of this month.
The company has been late in bringing its Covid vaccine to market, held back by manufacturing challenges, which have since been addressed.

The BIST 100 Index tumbled 5%, after climbing as much as 3.1% earlier. Trading was set to restart at 4:23 p.m. Istanbul time, according to the bourse’s statement.
This is the second session in a row that Turkish equities’ trading is halted due to rapid losses. The benchmark plunged as much as 9.1% on Friday, triggering automatic circuit breakers during the second-steepest selloff of the year. The slump was made worse by high levels of margin trading among local investors who have borrowed funds to join a recent rally in stocks. 
Calls on margins “led to snowballing losses” on Friday, turning a price correction into “panic selling,” said Tuna Cetinkaya, assistant general manager at the Info Yatirim brokerage. 
The lira’s 58% decline this year in the wake of 500 basis points of central bank rate cuts has sent local investors flocking to stocks to shield their savings, making Istanbul among the best-performing markets of 2021 in local currency terms, but the worst when measured in U.S. dollars. 
The lira tumbled to another record low on Monday after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged to continue cutting interest rates, referring to Islamic proscriptions on usury as a basis for his policy.
Discount grocer BIM Birlesik Magazalar AS (IS:BIMAS) underperformed, while telecom operator Turk Telekom (OTC:TRKNY) was among the only four stocks that gained.

A month before world business and political leader were due to gather in the Swiss ski resort, its organisers said they had decided to postpone in light of continued uncertainty over Omicron, adding the event was now planned for ""early summer"".
Davos, which in the past has attracted around 3,000 business chiefs, political thinkers and state leaders, was deserted last year after the event was cancelled due to COVID-19.
Dating back to 1974, the private event has over the years entertained guests including former U.S. President Donald Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping, climate campaigner Greta Thunberg and Irish rock star Bono.
""Current pandemic conditions make it extremely difficult to deliver a global in-person meeting. Preparations have been guided by expert advice and have benefited from the close collaboration of the Swiss government at all levels,"" the Geneva-based WEF said on its website.
""Despite the meeting's stringent health protocols, the transmissibility of Omicron and its impact on travel and mobility have made deferral necessary.""
The cancellation is the second year in a row for Davos after organisers shifted the annual meeting to Singapore in 2021, before abandoning it altogether. 
Switzerland is tightening pandemic curbs while not opting, for now, to enforce a stricter limited lockdown.
Next year's Davos meeting had been set to focus on accelerating stakeholder capitalism, harnessing the technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and ensuring a more inclusive future of work, the WEF said in September. 
Participants will now instead join a series of virtual ""State of the World"" sessions with global leaders, it said.
The population of the remote Alpine town of Davos swells from 10,000 to about 30,000 during the summit, where much of the action happens outside the conference at side meetings and networking events.
Founded by German engineer and economist Klaus Schwab, the WEF meeting has in previous years served as a backdrop for political breakthroughs.

In 1989, North and South Korea held their first ministerial-level meetings in Davos, while at the same meeting, East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl met to discuss German reunification. 
And South African President de Klerk met Nelson Mandela and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi at Davos, their first joint appearance outside South Africa, in 1992.

Investing.com – Novo Nordisk stock (NYSE:NVO) slumped 5% in Monday’s premarket trade after the company warned of a hit to the availability of a key obesity drug in the U.S. due to issues at a supplier.
The company said a contract manufacturer filling syringes for its Wegovy pens for the U.S. market has temporarily stopped manufacturing and deliveries, following issues with Good Manufacturing Practices.
Wego was turning out to be a winner for the company at a time when its core insulin business is under pricing pressure. The development is a setback to Novo Nordisk when it was hoping to establish the drug in the obesity segment ahead of a 2024 launch of a rival drug by Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY).
Last month, the company said it expects sales growth to slow by about 3% in 2022 because of lower prices and a drop in insulin sales volumes in China. It doesn’t expect supply challenges to affect the previously communicated outlook for 2021.
The Danish company said that it does not expect to be able to meet demand in the U.S. in the first half of 2022 and that few new patients will be able to initiate treatment. It expects to be able to meet demand in the U.S. in the second half of 2022.
Novo Nordisk declined to name the manufacturer but said the issues concerned a European site of a large international company. According to Reuters, the two parties are in dialogue and the company believes the contractor has a ""good plan in place"".

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening sharply lower Monday, as concerns over the Omicron Covid-19 variant grow and doubts emerge over U.S. President Joe Biden's ability to pass his $1.75 trillion domestic investment bill into law.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 305 points, or 0.9%, S&P 500 Futures traded 45 points, or 1%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 200 points, or 1.3%.
The major averages come into the holiday-shortened week on a negative run, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite suffering the most, dropping nearly 3% last week as the prospect of higher interest rates persuaded investors to rotate out of growth stocks. The broad-based S&P 500 declined 1.9% and the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.7%.
The rapid growth of cases of the Omicron Covid variant has prompted worries that the country’s economic recovery could stall just as the Federal Reserve is starting to tighten monetary policy.
The World Health Organization stated on Saturday that the number of cases of the Omicron variant is doubling in 1.5 to 3 days in areas with community transmission, and that this Covid variety has now been found in 43 of the 50 U.S. states.
Adding to the negative sentiment was the news that U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat, has refused to support for Biden's Build Back Better policy bill. This could mean the end of the initiative, which aims to expand the social safety net and tackle climate change. Manchin, who represents the state of West Virginia, is the single biggest recipient of donations from the fossil fuel industry in the Senate and himself has an indirect 30% interest in Enersystems, a coal broker.
Goldman Sachs trimmed its quarterly GDP forecasts for 2022 on the news, cutting its forecast for Q1 2022 to 2% from 3%, Q2 to 3% from 3.5% and Q3 to 2.75% from 3%.
Turning to the corporate sector,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) is likely to be in focus Monday after the drugmaker announced that a third dose of its Covid vaccine provided significant protection against the new variant. 
Oil prices slumped as the rapid rise in cases in the Omicron Covid-19 variant raised concerns that the restrictions a number of countries have placed on air travel could last for some time, hitting the demand for crude. 
Additionally, the U.S. oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, rose by three to 579 in the week to Dec. 17, its highest since April 2020, according to a report from Baker Hughes, released Friday.

S&P and Nasdaq futures while European and UK stocks hit two-week lows Monday, dropping 1.9% and 1.8% respectively. U.S. crude hovered closed to $68.30 per barrel-levels.
Omicron, found in more than 80 countries, is now dominating the delta in many of those. Delta ravaged countries around the world this year, and is responsible for the bulk of over 5.4 million deaths from the disease worldwide
While much more infectious than previous strains of the virus, omicron hasn’t yet resulted in increased hospitalizations. At the same time, the surging number of cases has put health authorities on alert. Some European countries are already back to restrictions imposed after the first outbreak last year.

Investing.com –  Moderna  stock (NASDAQ:MRNA) surged 8% in Monday’s premarket trading after the company said trials have shown that its booster raises antibodies against Omicron by at least 37 times.
The company tested its booster candidates at 50 µg and 100 µg dose, with the latter showing about 83-fold jump in neutralizing antibody levels compared to pre-boost. Moderna had previously admitted that the usual 2-dose regime of its vaccine was much less effective against the Omicron variant than against the then-prevalent Delta variant.
Booster candidates are being evaluated in ongoing phase 2/3 studies of approximately 300-600 participants per arm, Moderna said in a release.
According to Moderna, while its first line of defense against Omicron will be a booster of its mRNA-1273 vaccine, it will also continue to develop an Omicron-specific variant vaccine that it expects to advance into clinical trials early next year. It will also evaluate including omicron in its multivalent booster program, it said.
Omicron, now prevalent in more than 80 countries, is now dominating the Delta variant in many of those. Spreading much more rapidly than Delta, Omicron has hastened the return of lockdowns and other restrictions to European countries.  
In U.K. alone, more than 90,000 new cases have been reported each of the last two days.  While there are signs that Omicron is far less likely than Delta to cause serious infection - hospital admissions in the U.K. have not risen in parallel with case numbers - health experts are concerned that its greater infectiousness could still lead to public health systems being overwhelmed, while businesses fear that it will lead to acute staff shortages as the infected are forced to self-isolate."

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Novo Nordisk shares fell as much as 16% on Monday after the Danish drugmaker was hit by U.S. supply issues for its new obesity drug as it seeks to establish a market foothold before the launch of a rival drug by Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY).
The obesity market has proved difficult for pharmaceuticals companies, but Novo made a breakthrough with its Wegovy drug. The company hopes the drug, which helps to achieve weight loss of 17% on average over almost two years, will offset growing pressure on its core insulin business.
In a stock announcement after Friday's market close, Novo said that a contract manufacturer filling syringes for pens to inject the drug had halted deliveries and manufacturing temporarily after issues relating to good manufacturing practice.
The Danish drugmaker was already facing separate supply constraints after being ""overwhelmed"" by initial uptake of the drug. 
As a consequence, fewer new patients will start treatment with the drug in the first half of next year. Novo now expects to be able to meet U.S. demand in the second half of next year, having previously estimated it would do so at the beginning of the year.
""Of course it's very painful to not be able to supply to that level of demand,"" Novo finance chief Karsten Munk Knudsen told investors on Monday. 
Novo declined to name the contract manufacturer but said the issues concerned a European site of a large international company. The two parties are in daily dialogue and Novo said it believes the contract manufacturer has a ""good plan in place"". 
Analysts at JP Morgan, which cut its Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) rating to neutral on Monday, said the supply issues would also give it less time to establish the drug on the market before the 2024 launch of rival Eli Lilly's tirzepatide drug for obesity.
""There should be sufficient space for both agents in the market,"" Novo's Knudsen said.
The company's shares were down around 10.5% at 0949GMT, having closed on Friday with a year-to-date gain of 76%.

Novo said the news does not affect its 2021 outlook and that it would provide its outlook for the next year in connection with full-year earnings on Feb. 2. 
Last month it forecast sales growth would slow by about 3% in 2022 because of lower prices and a drop in insulin sales volumes in China.

The land planning authority in the southwestern city said it was taking control of the plots, totalling over 300,000 square meters, as Evergrande had not developed them after holding them for over a decade. 
The notices on the two plots, posted by the authority on Dec. 17, followed the same move by the Haikou city authority early last week, taking back a plot without compensation in the country's island province of Hainan.
The Chinese government is calling the shots at Evergrande after the real estate giant missed payments on two overseas bonds, triggering a restructuring to deal with its more than $300 billion in liabilities.
The authorities are scrutinising the assets of Evergrande and its wealthy chairman Hui Ka Yan but expect no fire sale for now, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters last week. 
A government body has taken over Evergrande's soccer stadium in Guangzhou - set to be the world's largest soccer venue by capacity - with a view to selling it, another person said last month, as the developer has halted construction due to a lack of capital.
Its EV unit China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group also said late last month it had returned undeveloped lands for seven projects worth a total of 1.3 billion yuan ($203.87 million) to the government.
Shares of Evergrande fell 9.9% on Monday to HK$1.46, a fresh low. 

S&P downgraded Evergrande on Friday to ""selective default"" after the firm missed a debt payment deadline earlier this month, putting the developer at risk of becoming the country's biggest defaulter. Fitch has already downgraded the developer to ""restricted default"".

Investing.com – GlaxoSmithKline ADRs (NYSE:GSK) traded 1.3% lower in Monday's premarket as fears over the fast-spreading Omicron virus overshadowed the appointment of Dave Lewis to head its new consumer healthcare company.
Lewis, who will become non-executive chairman, left Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) last year after more than a six-year reign that oversaw a cleanup after a major accounting scandal rocked the retailer soon after he joined it in 2014.
He joined Tesco from Unilever (NYSE:UL), where he earned the nickname ‘Drastic Dave’ for fixing businesses through cost cutting and innovative marketing, according to Reuters.
Lewis has also served on the board of Sky and is currently a director of PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). For more than two months, he has also been advising the U.K. government on fixing supply chain issues that have hit the British economy and sent prices of energy and other essentials soaring.
The separation of consumer healthcare will be by way of a demerger in mid-2022, in which at least 80% of GSK’s holding will be spun off to shareholders. The new resulting company is expected to attain a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange.
According to a Bloomberg report in October, private equity groups eyeing the split reckon the new unit could be worth up to $54 billion.
Brian McNamara appointed CEO-designate of the new consumer healthcare company in July.
GSK stock's decline was a fraction smaller than that of the overall U.K. market on Monday, which was reeling under the threat of fresh restrictions on mobility to bring down a soaring Covid-19 infection rate.
The U.K. is now reporting more than 90,000 Covid cases daily, mostly owing to the new and more transmissible Omicron variant. So far, hospital admission rates - which have been the key driver of government policy - have not risen in parallel, but with cases now at a record high, Health Secretary Sajid Javid hasn’t ruled out stricter lockdown measures even before the holiday season.

737,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2021 04:27AM ET</span>","Oil driller sees the industry's future in electric rigs, carbon offsets","By Liz Hampton
BROOMFIELD, Colorado (Reuters) - In a Denver suburb, an oil drilling rig plumbs the earth near a wealthy enclave framed by snow-capped mountains. The site is quieter, cleaner and less visible than similar oil and gas operations. It might just be the future of drilling in the United States. 
Oil firm Civitas Resources designed the operation to run largely on the city's electric grid, eliminating daily runs by more than a dozen diesel fuel trucks. The electric rig has none of the soot or sulfur smell of diesel exhaust and is muffled enough that rig hands can converse without yelling. 
As investors and lawmakers push the oil industry to lower its carbon emissions, this drill site and others run by Civitas offer one model for drillers looking to migrate to low- or no-carbon emissions operations. 
An extra incentive for Civitas is that it must be mindful of neighbors of its drilling sites in relatively affluent suburban areas, where it also has easier access to the power grid. It is unclear whether drillers in more remote areas will be able to adopt the same technology as easily.
Civitas, Colorado's largest oil and gas producer, says it is the state's first ""carbon neutral"" producer. To get there, it has eliminated some diesel-powered pumps, makes modifications to drilling and hydraulic fracturing equipment and its production sites. It also buys carbon credits to offset remaining emissions. 
'NO DUST, NO TRAFFIC'
A few miles away, another Civitas pad with 18 wells is hidden behind an earthen berm, largely invisible to the surrounding community. It has dozens of air-monitoring sensors to detect greenhouse gas emissions. Its pneumatic controls have been adapted to avoid methane leaks. It is Civitas' first facility to do away with oil and waste water storage tanks.
""Everything is piped directly off location. There is no dust, no truck traffic necessary to produce the hydrocarbons,” said Matt Owens, Civitas' chief operating officer. 
Colorado, among the top oil producers among U.S. states, also has some of the toughest state emissions regulations. It has told energy firms they must cut methane emissions from drilling by 2030 to less than half of 2005 levels. More drillers also face stricter mandates as President Joe Biden's administration enacts tougher federal methane rules. 
""Electrifying drilling, upgrading pneumatics and going tankless are certainly steps in the right direction,"" said Deborah Gordon, a senior principal in the Rocky Mountain Institute's climate intelligence group. 
Colorado's tougher regulatory environment has partially evolved from the industry's proximity to homes and businesses. For Civitas, that suburban life means strong local electric power supplies. 
""All the power lines that have been built out for urban expansion, we're able to tap into those,"" said Brian Cain, Civitas' chief sustainability officer during a tour of a drilling site. He estimates switching from diesel to line power reduces emissions by 20% to 25%. ""The landscape is a lot different than west Texas,"" where operators do not have easy access to the adequate electric power, he said. 
Some environmentalists have said lowering greenhouse gas emissions from oil drilling is not enough, and instead advocate for moving society away from fossil fuel usage https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/radical-change-needed-reach-net-zero-emissions-iea-2021-05-18 altogether. This year, the International Energy Agency said investors should halt funding to new oil, gas and coal supply projects if the world wants to achieve net zero emissions by mid-century.
POWER GRID WORRIES
While electrification offers a quick way to cut emissions from production, there are other hurdles. Civitas shifts work schedules to avoid overtaxing the grid during peak heating or cooling times, said Cain. 
In Texas, however, top oilfields ""tend not to be urban environments"" with ample electricity, said Don Whaley, president of Texas retail power provider OhmConnect Energy. 
The second-largest Texas producer,  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD), aims to electrify drilling, hydraulic fracturing and compression at pump stations within eight to 10 years, its chief executive vowed last week. The company has already begun switching out compression at pumping stations to move oil and gas for electric, said Chief Executive Scott Sheffield. 
Pioneer is working with Texas transmission operator Oncor to boost capacity near the oilfield. It and other shale oil firms will likely cover some of the cost of upgrading power lines and substations to more quickly reduce diesel fuel use, Sheffield said. 
Hydraulic fracturing, the pumping of water, sand and chemicals into well bores to release trapped oil and gas, is undergoing its own conversion. So-called electric fracks, powered by fossil fuels coming from nearby wells, are just emerging.

Top U.S. fracking provider Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co this year said it successfully deployed a grid-powered fracturing operation, which sharply reduced its carbon footprint, according to a company report. 
""When you move to electric fracks, that's the white whale for us,"" said Cain, which he estimates could reduce emissions from completions by 20% to 30%. ""That is a huge benefit for us in terms of total greenhouse gas.""

Manchin, a moderate Democrat, appeared to deal a fatal blow to Biden's Build Back Better (BBB) policy bill on Sunday, which aims to expand the social safety net and tackle climate change.
""We had already expected a negative fiscal impulse for 2022 as a result of the fading support from COVID-relief legislation enacted in 2020 and 2021, and without BBB enactment, this fiscal impulse will become somewhat more negative than we had expected,"" Goldmans Sachs analyst Jan Hatzius wrote in a note on Sunday. 
Hatzius lowered U.S. GDP forecast for Q1 2022 to 2% from 3%, not factoring in that BBB would become a law, cut Q2 outlook to 3% from 3.5%, and Q3 forecast to 2.75% from 3%. 

""While BBB in its current form looks unlikely, there is still a good chance that Congress enacts a much smaller set of fiscal proposals dealing with manufacturing incentives and supply chain issues,"" Hatzius said.
Goldman Sachs says there is still a chance that Congress extends the expanded child tax credit programme, which aims at providing free childcare, with some modifications, though ""the odds of this occurring are less than even.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese artificial intelligence start-up SenseTime Group relaunched its $767 million Hong Kong IPO on Monday, a week after pulling the listing in the wake of the company's inclusion on a U.S. investment blacklist. 
SenseTime retained its target of selling 1.5 billion shares for between HK$3.85 and $HK3.99 each, according to regulatory filings, with the final price to be set on Thursday. 
However, it will now rely on cornerstone investors to buy about $511 million, or around 67%, of shares, up from $450 million, or 58%, of shares previously. 
SenseTime said its inclusion on the U.S. blacklist did not impose any restrictions on its business operations, but added the resulting lack of U.S. investors could impede its ability to raise capital in the future and reduce trading liquidity.
The U.S. Treasury added SenseTime to a list of ""Chinese military-industrial complex companies"" on Dec. 10, accusing it of having developed a facial recognition programme to determine a target's ethnicity, with a focus on identifying ethnic Uyghurs.
U.N. experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people, mainly Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities, have been detained in recent years in a vast system of camps in China's far-west region of Xinjiang.
Some foreign lawmakers and parliaments have labelled the treatment of Uyghurs as genocide, citing evidence of forced sterilisations and deaths inside the camps. China denies these claims and says Uyghur population growth rates are above the national average.
""Our group's products and services are intended for civilian and commercial uses and not for any military application,"" SenseTime said in the revised filings on Monday.
The company previously said it ""strongly opposed"" the designation of the blacklist and that accusations against it were unfounded.

SenseTime's shares are due to start trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Dec 30.

""We decided to come to the railway market with operational leasing,"" Dmitry Ivanter, the head of VTB's leasing subsidiary, told reporters in comments held for publication until Monday.
""We created a separate team, we are specifically looking for fleets, and we are participating in various auctions.""
VTB Leasing currently owns about 15,000 railcars for operational leasing and plans to increase this number to 35,000, Ivanter said. The company plans to buy new railcars direct from factory lines and from elsewhere on the market.
""Cargo volumes are growing. For a very long time, loading on the railway market has been stagnant, but growth has now started, primarily due to economic growth and the fact that external trade conditions are quite favourable, trade with China is increasing,"" he said.

After two years of declining cargo volumes the Russian Railways monopoly expects growth of more than 3% this year, mainly due to coal exports, as well as building materials and container transit.

The Canadian lender could finalize an agreement as soon as this week, assuming the talks don't fall apart, according to the report.
The deal would facilitate Bank of Montreal's expansion into the United States, where it has worked to build its presence in recent years. Combined, the banks would have some $870 billion in assets, the report added.
Bloomberg had reported last week that Bank of Montreal has expressed interest in buying San Francisco-based the Bank of the West, the U.S. arm of BNP Paribas.

BNP and Bank of Montreal did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
The French bank was working with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to assess a sale of the 147-year-old unit in a deal that could value it at around $15 billion, with potential suitors including Bank of Montreal, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Ohio-based KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY).

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) recently issued a notice to financial institutions, urging them to strengthen financial support for such acquisitions, the newspaper reported.
Over the past months, Chinese regulators have marginally eased funding curbs on the real estate sector, to prevent debt risks spreading from struggling developers including China Evergrande Group and Kaisa Property Holdings.
Regulators are urging Chinese banks to actively provide lending to fund acquisitions of projects owned by cash-strapped developers, and avoid cutting, or withdrawing, loans to these companies, China Securities Journal reported. 
But only the acquisition of real estate projects, rather than acquiring stakes in the struggling developers, would be encouraged, the newspaper said, citing unidentified sources.

Meanwhile, developers without financial problems are also being encouraged to issue bonds to fund such acquisitions, and PBOC is urging financial institutions to invest in such debt instruments, according to the newspaper. 
Developers including China Merchants Shekou Industrial Zone Holdings Co (001979.SZ) plan to issue debt instruments via the interbank market in the near term to fund mergers and acquisitions, local media has reported.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Monday morning as China cuts its benchmark loan rate for the first time in almost two years. Investors remain concerned about the spread of omicron variants and the U.S. tightening monetary policy.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.86% by 9:52 PM ET (2:52 AM GMT) ahead of a speech by the Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Thursday.
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 1.33%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.31%. The Reserve Bank of Australia is due to release minutes of its December interest rate meeting on Tuesday.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 1.07%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.70% while the Shenzhen Component down 0.76%. China cut its one-year loan prime rate from 3.85% to 3.8%, the first such move since April 2020.
In the U.S., investors expect a diminishing central bank stimulus as officials step up efforts to contain inflation. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller expects the central bank will start raising its interest rate as early as March 2022 when the Fed decided to end the purchase program a few months earlier than had been planned.
Meanwhile, a Democratic senator Joe Manchin said he would not support a $2 trillion social spending plan.
On the COVID-19 front, U.S. President Joe Biden’s top medical adviser Anthony Fauci said a shutdown will not be necessary despite a surge in cases. But he said the hospital will see a rush of cases from the Omicron variant.
“Omicron remains a concern and cases are on the rise,” Robert Schein, chief investment officer at Blanke Schein Wealth Management, told Bloomberg. “Investors should be prepared for COVID-19 to continue to be a main factor in market performance heading into 2022.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" racked up a head-spinning $253 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales over the weekend, setting a pandemic record and ranking as the third-biggest domestic debut in Hollywood history even as a new COVID-19 variant spreads.
Around the globe, ""No Way Home"" generated an additional $334.2 million for a worldwide weekend total of $587.2 million, according to estimates from distributor  Sony  Corp (T:6758).
The blockbuster returns delivered a much-needed jolt to cinema companies such as AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), Cinemark and Cineworld that have struggled to draw crowds during the pandemic. The emergence of the Omicron variant https://www.reuters.com/world/threat-omicron-looms-over-christmas-holidays-europe-us-2021-12-19 has sparked new concerns.
But as Broadway and New York City's Rockettes canceled shows and the National Football League postponed games, theaters were abuzz. Fans packed auditoriums for ""No Way Home,"" a big-budget superhero spectacle co-produced by Sony (NYSE:SONY) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co that is playing only in theaters.
The movie stars Tom Holland as Marvel's web-slinging superhero and Zendaya, as his girlfriend MJ, in the third film in the Spider-Man trilogy. It also brings back stars of previous ""Spider-Man"" films.
""This weekend’s historic 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' results, from all over the world and in the face of many challenges, reaffirm the unmatched cultural impact that exclusive theatrical films can have,"" Tom Rothman, the chairman and chief executive officer of Sony Pictures Entertainment's Motion Picture Group, said in a statement. 
U.S. and Canadian ticket sales crushed the most optimistic projections from last week, when analysts deemed $200 million a long shot. ""No Way Home"" finished just behind ""Avengers: Endgame"" and ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ahead of the Star Wars film ""The Force Awakens.""
Cinemark said ticket sales for ""No Way Home"" were especially strong in the United States and Latin America and on large-format screens. 
Holland offered gratitude to fans. ""Thank you thank you thank you and if you haven’t seen Spider-Man no way home yet ... merry Christmas and you know what to do,"" he wrote on Instagram.
The fact that the film concluded a popular trilogy added to its appeal, said Jeff Bock, senior media analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co, and many fans wanted to see the new installment on the opening weekend before they read spoilers on social media. 
SUPERHEROES
The success underscored the continuing pull of superhero-based films at cinemas, Bock added, particularly among young people who are used to streaming movies at home. 
""It reinforces the fact that superheroes are number one, and everybody else is somewhere way down below,"" he said. 

The previous pandemic record was set by Marvel superhero film ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage,"" https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/venom-bond-pull-4-mln-people-amc-theaters-over-weekend-2021-10-04 which took in $90 million domestically over its first three days in October. Marvel's ""Black Widow"" opened with $80 million back in May.
Other genres have struggled to lure audiences. Steven Spielberg's remake of classic musical ""West Side Story,"" which has earned rave reviews and Oscar nominations buzz, sold $3.4 million worth of tickets in the U.S. and Canadian market over the weekend. Its global total stands at $27.1 million after two weekends in theaters.

Shimao Group Holdings Ltd. agreed to sell stakes in a Hong Kong development at a loss while Sunac China Holdings Ltd. unloaded assets in Shanghai as developers seek to raise cash to pay debt. 
An index of Chinese dollar junk bonds fell for a fifth day Friday, while property stocks were little changed in Hong Kong. The rout in developer shares means the richest bosses behind China’s real estate firms have lost more than $46 billion combined this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Evergrande founder Hui Ka Yan’s wealth alone has plunged by $17.2 billion. 
Key Developments:
 
China Regulators Encourage Property Acquisitions: Report (9:15 a.m. HK)
China encourages “quality companies” to step up acquisitions and purchases of property projects based on market-oriented principles, Cailian reported, citing a notice from the central bank and Chinese regulators. The regulators also encouraged financial institutions to provide services for these acquisitions to help dissolve risks.
Kaisa Appoints Advisers; Shares Resume Trading (8:10 a.m. HK)
Kaisa has appointed Houlihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI) (China) Ltd as its financial adviser and Sidley Austin as legal adviser after missing multiple offshore debt payments.
The financial adviser will evaluate Kaisa’s liquidity and explore all feasible solutions, the company said in a stock exchange filing on Monday. Kaisa said it hasn’t received any notice regarding acceleration of repayment by holders, and has been in talks with holder representatives about a comprehensive debt restructuring plan. The shares dropped 6.5% in early Hong Kong trading.
Evergrande Backer’s Privatization Collapses (8:05 a.m. HK)
Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd. minority shareholders failed to give sufficient support to the company’s proposed privatization, derailing a plan by the long-time ally of Evergrande to delist next month. The stock plunged 33%.
Among the 74 stockholders participating, 64 voted no and made up 10.8% of the shares among the investors, according to a stock exchange filing Friday. The Hong Kong real estate firm, owned by the family of billionaire Joseph Lau, announced plans in October to buy out investors at HK$4 a share. The stock last traded at HK$3.78 before being halted Friday afternoon ahead of the results. Chinese Estates requested a trading resumption and said its listing will be maintained.
 
 
Evergrande Declared in Default by S&P for Failed Payments (8 a.m. HK)
Evergrande was labeled a defaulter by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings, the second credit-risk assessor to do so.
S&P cut Evergrande to “selective default” over its failure to make coupon payments by the end of a grace period earlier this month, a move that may trigger cross defaults on the developer’s $19.2 billion of dollar debt. S&P also withdrew its ratings on the group at Evergrande’s request.
Fitch Ratings was the first to declare the property developer in default on Dec. 9. Long considered by many investors as too big to fail, Evergrande has become the largest casualty of President Xi Jinping’s campaign to tame the country’s overindebted conglomerates and overheated property market. Concern has since spread to higher-rated firms like Shimao Group as liquidity stress intensifies. 
Shimao Sells Stake in Hong Kong Development (7:30 a.m. HK)
Shimao agreed to sell its 22.5% stake in three entities created for the Grand Victoria property development in Hong Kong for HK$2.1 billion ($270 million), according to an exchange filing.
The buyers include entities owned by fellow developers SEA Holdings, Wheelock & Co. and Sino Land. Shimao expects to recognize a loss of about HK$770 million from the sale.
Separately, Sunac China Holdings Ltd. sold three projects in Shanghai and Hangzhou for 2.68 billion yuan ($420 million), the 21st Century Business Herald reported, citing unidentified people.

(Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA are changing to a Saturday-Sunday weekend from the New Year in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) which is aligning its working week with most global markets. 
The German bank will from Jan. 3 operate Monday-Friday in the Sunni Muslim-ruled country, instead of the current Sunday-Thursday as is common around the Middle East, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Wall Street-based JPMorgan is also adapting the same week in UAE, along with flexible practices such as a break for Muslim prayers on Fridays, the bank said in a statement.
France-based Societe Generale's spokesperson said it is implementing Saturday-Sunday weekend from Jan. 2 in its Dubai and Abu Dhabi entities, according to an emailed statement.
Bloomberg News was the first to report on Sunday that JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and Societe Generale will switch to a Saturday-Sunday weekend in the UAE.
Representatives of Bank of America did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The banks' move comes after the UAE said on Dec. 7 that it would shift to a four-and-a-half day week with a Saturday-Sunday weekend from the start of next year.

Private companies are, however, free to choose their own working week in the oil-producing Gulf state which is the region's commercial, trade and tourism hub. 
Over the past year, the UAE has taken measures to make its economy more attractive to foreign investment and talent at a time of growing economic rivalry with Saudi Arabia.

YouTube tweeted that ""we've reached a deal with Disney and have already started to restore access to channels like ESPN and FX.""
Neither company disclosed the financial terms of deal.
YouTube warned last week that it would only renew its agreement with Disney if the company offered ""equitable terms"" and announced that it was cutting the monthly price for YouTube TV by $15, from $64.99 to $49.99.
On Sunday, YouTube said a monthly subscription had reverted to $64.99, but affected users would receive a one-time $15 discount. 

""We appreciate Google's collaboration to reach fair terms that are consistent with the market,"" Disney said in a statement on Sunday. 
YouTube earlier this month struck a multi-year pact with streaming platform  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc to distribute YouTube's flagship app and TV service, ending a months-long battle over accusations of anti-competitive conduct.

The firm said it also did not pay the coupon totalling $105 million for notes due in 2023, 2025, and 2026, with the grace period for the first two already expired. 
The non-payment on the $400 million maturity on Dec. 7 triggered cross-default provision on all its $12 billion offshore bonds and prompted a downgrade to ""restricted default"" by Fitch Ratings. 
Kaisa is the second-largest dollar bond issuer among China's property developers after China Evergrande Group, which has more than $300 billion in liabilities.
The fate of Kaisa, Evergrande and other indebted Chinese property companies has gripped financial markets in recent months amid fears of knock-on effects, with Beijing repeatedly seeking to reassure investors.
Shares of Kaisa tumbled 8.7% to HK$0.84 in the early session on resumed trading, a record low, after a suspension since Dec. 8. 
Kaisa said it was still in talks with bondholders over a debt restructuring deal and it had hired Houlihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI) as its financial adviser and Sidley Austin as a legal adviser. 
Kaisa was in talks with Lazard (NYSE:LAZ), the adviser of a group of offshore bondholders, to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), Reuters has reported, laying the groundwork for further discussions on forbearance and financing solutions.

The group planned to use up to $1 billion in order to buy bad loans from the Chinese developer's onshore creditors, sources said last week.
In the Monday filing, the developer added after significant decline in sales in October and November, it expects the confidence of potential property purchasers to remain subdued in December.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bid by the White House to dramatically boost electric vehicle tax credits hit a major roadblock on Sunday when a key Senate Democrat said he would not support a $1.75 trillion domestic investment bill.
West Virginia's Joe Manchin appeared to deal a fatal blow to President Joe Biden's signature domestic policy bill, known as Build Back Better, which also aims to expand the social safety net and tackle climate change.
The bill includes increasing the current $7,500 EV tax credit to up to $12,500 for union-made U.S. vehicles as well as creating a credit of up to $4,000 for used vehicles. The bill would also again make General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc eligible for tax credits after they hit the 200,000-vehicle cap on the existing $7,500 credit.
The bill also includes a 30% credit for commercial electric vehicles.
GM and Ford are both launching electric pickup trucks in 2022 and new tax credits could be crucial to meeting initial sales targets, as well as meeting rising vehicle emissions requirements.
Biden wants 50% of new U.S. vehicles to be electric or plug-in electric hybrid by 2030. The administration is expected as soon as this week to finalize tougher new vehicle emissions rules through 2026, automakers say.
Manchin opposes a $4,500 tax credit for union-made vehicles that is part of the $12,500 proposal. He calls the union credit ""wrong"" and ""not American.""
The EV tax credits are backed by Biden, many congressional Democrats and the United Auto Workers (UAW) union and would disproportionately benefit Detroit's Big Three automakers - GM, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Chrysler parent Stellantis NV - which assemble their U.S.-made vehicles in union-represented plants.
Tesla and foreign automakers operating in the United States do not have unions representing assembly workers and many have fought UAW efforts to organize U.S. plants.
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, which has a plant in West Virginia but whose U.S. employees are not union members, has lobbied against the $4,500 union credit.

Toyota announced this month it is building a $1.29 billion battery plant in North Carolina, while EV startup Rivian Automotive said on Thursday that it will build a $5 billion plant in Georgia.
Vehicles would have to be made in the United States starting in 2027 to qualify for any of the $12,500 credit, which includes $500 for U.S. made batteries. It has faced criticism from Canada, Mexico, Japan and the European Union.

Washington and other Western capitals have warned Moscow of strong economic repercussions if Russia invades Ukraine and cutting Russia off from SWIFT, crucial for global money flows, is one idea that has been floated. Russia has rejected suggestions it is planning to invade.
""Of course we will survive, certainly, but I don't think it will come to that,"" VTB CEO Andrey Kostin told state television channel Rossiya 1. 
""It would be a very serious measure, 'unfriendly' doesn't do it justice,"" he said.

765,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2021 02:15AM ET</span>",China to tighten antitrust legal enforcement - new antitrust bureau head,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's antimonopoly bureau will step up legal enforcement against monopolistic behaviour and push forward the amended antimonopoly law to improve the regulatory framework, said Gan Lin, chief of the national antimonopoly bureau.
China last month elevated the seniority of the market regulator's antitrust unit, the National Anti-monopoly Bureau, and appointed Gan as chief, a move which would help antitrust investigators gain resources when examining mergers and acquisitions. 
Gan said China still faces ""insufficient punishment"" for some monopolistic activities, while some antitrust regulations remain at the elementary level.
""With the rapid development of the digital economy, and new industries and business models emerging one after another, there are great differences in competition modes between the new and the traditional economy,"" Gan said in an interview published on the official website of State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) on Sunday.
""There's an urgent need to further improve the anti-monopoly legislation and industry regulation.""
China shed its once relatively laissez-faire approach to market regulation of the internet sector in dramatic fashion this year, blocking mergers and imposing a record $2.75 billion fine on e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding for abusing its market position.
Alibaba was found to have engaged in the practise of ""choosing one from two,"" in which an e-commerce platform bars vendors from selling on rival sites.
Gan said this practice was not evident during China's annual ""618 shopping festival"" and Singles' Day online shopping festival this year after the bureau kicked off a sector-wide rectification.
In October, it levied a $527 million fine on food delivery giant Meituan for abusing its dominance.

""The orderliness of market competition has shown great improvement, and the smaller business operators have now gained broader space,"" Gan said.
For the next step, the bureau will step up antimonopoly reviews of concentrated businesses, and will continue to prevent mergers from disrupting the market, and curb excessive capital expansion, Gan said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has asked India's antitrust watchdog to throw out a case alleging abuse of market power in the apps market, saying it is too small a player in the South Asian country where Google is dominant, a filing seen by Reuters shows.
The filing was made after the Competition Commission of India (CCI) started reviewing allegations that Apple hurts competition by forcing app developers to use its proprietary system which can charge commissions of up to 30% on in-app purchases.
Apple denied the allegations in its filing to the CCI and stressed that its market share in India is an ""insignificant"" 0-5%, while Google commands 90-100% as its Android operating system powers most other smartphones.
""Apple is not dominant in the Indian market ... Without dominance, there can be no abuse,"" Apple said in the submission dated Nov. 16 which was signed by its Chief Compliance Officer, Kyle Andeer.
""It has already been established that Google is the dominant player in India,"" it added.
Apple and the CCI did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google declined to comment when asked about Apple's assertions in the filing.
The complainant in the case, a little-known non-profit group called ""Together We Fight Society"", said that Apple with iOS dominates the market for non-licensable mobile operating systems.
Apple countered that in its filing, saying the entire smartphone market - which includes licensable systems like Android - is the market that should be taken into consideration.
Apple also described the Indian complaint as a ""proxy filing"" in its CCI submission, saying that the complainant was ""likely acting in concert with parties with whom Apple has ongoing commercial and contractual disputes globally and/or that have complained to other regulators."" 
The U.S. tech company did not give any evidence in its submission to support its claim. The non-profit told Reuters that Apple's remark was ""made to prejudice the mind"" of the CCI ""without any iota of proof.""
In the coming weeks, the CCI will review Apple's response to the allegations and could order a wider investigation or dismiss the case altogether if it finds no merit in it. Details of CCI investigations are not publicly disclosed.
The CCI is separately conducting an investigation into Google's in-app payment system as part of a broader probe into the company after Indian startups last year voiced concern.
Apple's iOS powered about 2% of 520 million smartphones in India as of end-2020 with the rest using Android, according to Counterpoint Research, though it adds that Apple's smartphone base in the country has more than doubled in the last five years.
GLOBAL ISSUE
Apple has been grappling with similar allegations in other parts of the world. In the United States, it is locked in a legal battle with ""Fornite"" creator Epic Games over the issue and South Korea this year became the first country to ban dominant app store operators from forcing developers to use their payment systems.
In the European Union https://reut.rs/38nEVZZ, regulators last year started an investigation into Apple's in-app fees for distribution of paid digital content and other restrictions.
Companies like Apple and Google say their fees cover the security and marketing benefits their app stores provide.
In its CCI filing, Apple argued that the in-app commissions it charges are ""not unfair or excessive"" and have decreased over time, adding that it charges lower rates from small developers.

""Only a small number of large developers, many of which are multi-billion-dollar conglomerates, pay the headline rate of 30%,"" Apple said.
""Competing platforms have charged similar or higher commissions as Apple. Particularly, Google has charged a 30% commission on its app store,"" it said.

NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. retailers opened their doors on Saturday to what they hope will be swarms of shoppers searching for last-minute holiday gifts, despite surging cases of the coronavirus, including the new, highly-contagious Omicron variant.
The last Saturday before Christmas – dubbed 'Super Saturday' – is typically one of the busiest shopping days of the year, marked by a rush to buy last-minutes gifts to tuck under the Christmas tree. 
The risks to shoppers this year, however, are not just that merchandise might be out of stock, but also that in-person shopping could trigger more coronavirus infections - making Super Saturday a super-spreader event. 
Toy store owner Katherine Nguyen says she anticipates more people to shop in person at her three Chicago-area locations compared to the last Saturday before Christmas 2020, or even the last Saturday before the pre-pandemic Christmas of 2019.
""It's like the new variant is the new normal – the environment has gotten a little used to that,"" she said.
Foot-traffic tracking firm Placer.ai said it expects more people to visit stores this weekend than on the same weekend last year. Sensormatic Solutions, a data firm that measures store visits, cited a nearly 48% increase in foot traffic on the Friday after Thanksgiving compared to a year earlier as a sign that people would want to shop in-person.
A supply chain logjam https://www.reuters.com/business/us-companies-keep-prices-high-supply-chain-headaches-persist-2021-10-27 has left many people also feeling nervous about not getting merchandise ordered online in time for the Dec. 25 holiday.
""Consumers have been bombarded with messages about the impact of supply shortages on the availability of holiday gifts,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. 
Nguyen said her three stores never received shipments of merchandise for about 15% of their toy catalog. The toys, she says, are ""sitting on a container in Long Beach, California, outside of the water waiting to come in.""
FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and the U.S. Postal Service set Dec. 15 as the deadline for ground deliveries to reach homes in time for Christmas, which means that shoppers still in search of gifts may have little choice but to shop in stores if they want to avoid fees for expedited shipping.

FedEx and rival  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) each say they have hired enough workers to manage the holiday peak, when the number of daily packages they handle easily doubles. 
Unlike last year, many consumers heeded advice from retailers to shop early - easing pressure on carriers by spreading demand over a longer period of time. But online shoppers may see more delays as Christmas approaches, according to Cathy Morrow Roberson, president of consultancy Logistics Trends & Insights.

The Senate approved Emanuel by a vote of 48-21 in a middle-of-the-night session, with three of Biden's fellow Democrats voting against his nomination.
Emanuel is a former member of the House of Representatives and was the first White House chief of staff when President Barack Obama was president and Biden was vice president.
Supporters backed him for the post in Tokyo because of his long record in public service at a time when Washington is looking to Asian allies such as Japan to help push back against a rising China. 
Detractors said they would not back Emanuel because of his handling of the shooting seven years ago of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, who died after police office Jason Van Dyke fired his weapon multiple times.
Then-Mayor Emanuel's handling of the case was criticized, especially because a video showing the shooting was not released for more than a year.

Van Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder and jailed for nearly seven years and four Chicago police officers were fired over McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) death, which highlighted racial tensions in the United States' third-largest city.
Biden nominated Emanuel in August. At his confirmation hearing in October, Emanuel said he thought about McDonald's death every day and that, as mayor, he was responsible and accountable.

MILAN (Reuters) -Telecom Italia (TIM) said on Friday former Chief Executive Officer Luigi Gubitosi had stepped down from the company's board, removing a hurdle that prevented Italy's biggest phone group from naming his successor.
The boardroom crisis has hampered the group's response to a $37 billion takeover approach from U.S. private equity fund KKR, which is awaiting access to TIM's data before making a formal bid. 
TIM said it was conducting ""a thorough assessment"" of the bid but also ""a review of other strategic alternatives ... in order to decide, among other things, whether to give access to the due diligence requested by KKR.""
TIM also said the search for a new CEO continued, but gave no indication of when it may appoint a new boss.
KKR's offer is conditional on backing from the company's board and Italy's government, but TIM's biggest shareholder Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) has said it does not reflect TIM's value.
The French media group is studying an alternative plan, sources have previously said.
Both strategies envisage separating TIM's services from its infrastructure assets, which require investments to be upgraded as part of the country's multi-billion digital push.
SEVERANCE PACKAGE
The agreement with TIM provides a severance package for Gubitosi of about 6.9 million euros ($7.8 million) that is to be settled by Jan. 3, the company said in a statement.
Gubitosi quit as CEO last month after coming under pressure from Vivendi and losing the confidence of a majority of board members, following a string of profit warnings.
But Gubitosi did not step down as a board director, preventing TIM from naming a new CEO pending a free board seat. 
Last month, TIM named https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/kkr-offer-prompts-telecom-italia-board-showdown-over-ceos-future-2021-11-26 Pietro Labriola, the head of its prized Brazilian business, as general manager and sources have said he was expected to be named CEO once a board seat became available.
But sources familiar with the process said there were different views on the board as to who would be the best candidate to ensure stable leadership in the longer term. 
TIM has hired headhunters Spencer Stuart, which has drawn up a list of possible CEO candidates.

""The board ... is continuing the succession planning process aimed at appointing a new CEO, and it will complete it as quickly as the circumstances allow,"" TIM said.

China's capital is keen ""to ensure zero local infection, the successful hosting of the Winter Olympic Games and the Winter Paralympic Games, and that the public have joyful, peaceful and tranquil holidays,"" it said in a statement. 
In addition to encouraging people not to take unnecessary trips outside the city, it will also call for some gatherings to be held online, according to the statement.
The northern Hebei province that will co-host the Games with Beijing as well as several other cities have issued similar advisories.
Wu Shiping, an official at China State Railway Group, told a briefing on Saturday he expects a ""relatively huge"" increase in the number of train passengers during the 40-day travel season for the Lunar New Year holiday compared to 2021 levels which will challenge COVID-19 prevention work.
In pre-pandemic times, the travel period was often described as the world's biggest annual migration, with hundreds of millions of China's migrant workers returning to home towns.
Liang Wannian, an official at the National Health Commission, said there shouldn't be a one-size-fits-all rule across China and local governments should balance the need for people to reunite with their families with COVID-19 control. 

But Beijing city as well as regions with higher virus risks such as those with border cities and ports should have stricter rules, he said. Higher risk groups such as the elderly should also avoid unnecessary trips and gatherings, Liang added.

(Reuters) - OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma could be years away from paying billions of dollars to address the U.S. opioid crisis after a judge blew up a deal that gave provided legal immunity to the Sackler family that owned the company, people close to the negotiations said.
In a surprise ruling on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan found that a bankruptcy judge overstepped his authority by approving the plan that gave the Sacklers immunity in return for $4.5 billion for those harmed by Purdue. 
The deal had been hammered out over two years by U.S. states, local governments and others who had filed thousands of lawsuits accusing Purdue and the Sacklers of aggressively marketing OxyContin while downplaying its addiction and overdose risks. 
The company and family members have denied the allegations.
Purdue said it will appeal McMahon's ruling, which it said would not impact its operations but will delay or even end the ability of states and others to receive billions of dollars. 
Representatives for the Sackler family did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Eight hold-out states and the U.S. Department of Justice's bankruptcy watchdog had challenged the plan in part because of the legal protections it granted the Sacklers. The appeal process won't end with McMahon, who encouraged the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to review her decision.
The family has come under scrutiny for withdrawing $10 billion from Purdue between 2008 and 2017. 
The Sacklers have said almost half the money went to paying taxes, but opponents of the plan allege the withdrawals strengthened the family's hand in bankruptcy negotiations and gave them leverage to demand legal immunity. 
Purdue has been estimated to be worth around $2 billion without the Sackler contribution, making their participation critical.
Those involved in the case doubt a new deal could be agreed before the appeals court weighs in, a process that could take up to 18 months given the importance of the issue of so-called nondebtor releases in corporate bankruptcy cases.
Ryan Hampton, who served through most of the bankruptcy as the co-chair of the unsecured creditors committee, a key player in the deal negotiations, said there were talks earlier this year on a plan that excluded a Sackler contribution. 
""It was almost dead on arrival,"" he said. ""It will very hard to negotiate something before the 2nd Circuit decides because I've seen it live and in-person trying to negotiate a deal without a Sackler contribution,"" he said.
If the plan had gone into effect, it would have started providing funds to state and local governments and others to address the damage caused to communities reeling from the opioid epidemic, which has claimed 500,000 lives since 1999.
The appeals might not end at the 2nd Circuit, as Washington's attorney general has vowed to take the issue to the U.S. Supreme Court, a process that could add another year.
Even then, resolving the question of Sackler immunity might require sending the entire deal negotiation back to the bankruptcy court to start over.
There is also the possibility the Sacklers kick in more money, something the family did during the bankruptcy process to win over about a dozen states.
""Maybe the Sacklers put up more money and maybe the objecting parties drop the objections and we reach unanimity,"" said Scott Bickford, who represented a committee of children born dependent on opioids, a plan supporter.
The bankruptcy court judge, Robert Drain, said he approved the plan including immunity for the family in part because it was unclear whether the Sacklers could be held liable and uncertain if judgments against them could be collected. 
The family has used trusts organized in the Bailiwick of Jersey, in the Channel Islands between England and France, among other jurisdictions, to hold their wealth, according to McMahon's opinion.

Bickford said any plan without Sackler funds leaves Purdue with less money and victims with difficult legal claims.
""Essentially everyone takes a haircut and then we pursue the Sacklers for 100 years,"" he said.

774,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2021 02:41AM ET</span>","Japan business lobbyist backs Myanmar coup, urges investment","By Ju-min Park and Antoni Slodkowski
TOKYO (Reuters) -A Japanese former politician who campaigned to bring billions http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/12/09/JapanMyanmar.pdf of dollars of investment from some of Japan’s top companies to Myanmar has urged Japan to endorse its military regime, saying the nation's coup leader has ""grown fantastically as a human being,"" while praising his ""democratisation efforts.""
The 87-year-old former cabinet minister, Hideo Watanabe, is also pursuing a $42-million shopping mall investment in a tie-up with a firm linked to a sanctioned army conglomerate, according to a transcript of his remarks seen by Reuters and corporate filings.
Watanabe’s outspoken push for Japan’s re-engagement with the Myanmar military government stands in contrast with Tokyo’s official stance, which has cut new aid and called on the military to stop the violence. Japan has sought to balance its support for Myanmar democracy against its efforts to counter China’s influence there, officials and analysts have said.
Watanabe and the Japan Myanmar Association (JMA) he chairs declined to comment, as did Japan's foreign ministry.
His position also poses a dilemma for some of Japan's largest companies who sponsor the JMA – a kind of lobby group and information exchange for Myanmar investment in Japan that he founded, business leaders and activists say. These JMA members, like other multinationals, are under pressure from activists to step away from their investments in Myanmar, including in the special economic zone that Watanabe helped establish.
Watanabe, who also said the military's seizure of power in Myanmar was “lawful”, made his remarks at the JMA's regular meeting on June 30, when discussing his recent trips to the country, during which he met junta leader Min Aung Hlaing. His comments, first reported by business publication Toyo Keizai in Japanese, were printed in a newsletter circulated to association sponsors and seen by Reuters.
At least six companies have quit the JMA this year and one member company has pushed back on Watanabe’s comments, according to the companies involved.
That company, XYMAX Corp, a property management firm, said it had expressed concerns to the JMA about the association’s position on the coup several times this year. “We don’t support the coup at all, and we can’t support comments that seem to endorse the coup. There’s no change in our position there,” Ryuhei Mori, an executive for international business at XYMAX, told Reuters.
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, which in 2019 announced plans to make Hilux pick-up trucks in the special economic zone, quit Watanabe’s group earlier this year. A spokesperson declined to discuss Toyota’s departure, including its timing. The company’s production plans for Myanmar have been put on hold since the coup, Toyota said.
Hotel chain Vessel Hotel Development Co and IT firm Global Innovation Consulting told Reuters they quit the association after the coup. Vessel said the company “wanted to cut costs,” and Global Innovation Consulting said the membership did not yield “continuing benefits” for the company.
Musashi Fusoh, a garment maker, told Reuters it resigned because it judged the information it was getting did not justify the cost. SPARX Asset Management and credit card company JCB International Co said they also left the association earlier this year.
Some companies, while distancing themselves from the Myanmar military, have remained in the JMA. Among them, Kirin Holdings (2503.T) in February scrapped its long-standing alliance with a conglomerate linked to the Myanmar military after outcry from human rights observers over the coup.
Kirin decided to terminate the partnership as the coup was against its human rights policy, a spokesperson said. The company declined to comment on Watanabe’s remarks.
Automaker Suzuki Motor Corp and Japan’s largest trading house, Mitsubishi Corp, which have remained in the JMA, declined to comment on Watanabe’s remarks. Suzuki said it prioritised the safety of its staff, while Mitsubishi said human rights are one of the factors it considers when doing business.
Masao Imamura, a professor of Southeast Asian history at Japan’s Yamagata University, said Watanabe was influential in framing Tokyo’s economic policy on Myanmar and Japanese corporations have relied on his influence and access to do business.
“Large Japanese corporations active in Myanmar have been embedded with people like Watanabe too long and too deeply, so they don’t know how to exit,” Imamura, who was part of a coalition that challenged the JMA’s policy on Myanmar earlier this year, told Reuters.
In May, a month before the JMA meeting, Yusuke Watanabe, Watanabe's son and the association’s secretary general, wrote an article published in the Diplomat saying Japan should act as a bridge to Myanmar's junta rather than following the Western policy of ""regime change"".
Imamura, and others, including representatives of Myanmar citizens in Japan, human rights groups and foreign policy experts, wrote an open letter to JMA corporate sponsors in response. 
Yusuke Watanabe’s article, they said, neglected to mention “human rights violations such as killing, violence, detention, and suppression of speech against civilians by the military.” They asked every member company whether they supported the JMA's position, as expressed by the younger Watanabe. The group said his remarks were a way to ""justify the coup.""
‘FRIENDSHIP AND TRUST'
Hideo Watanabe has acted as Japan's top-level conduit to Myanmar on economic ties since 1987. His personal connections mean he has more access to senior officials than all but a few foreigners. Watanabe was central to a 2011 deal that saw Japan provide nearly $5 billion in aid and debt forgiveness in exchange for rights to develop a port near Yangon.
In a written statement, Myanmar’s military government told Reuters Watanabe was ""a long-time friend"" who ""always seeks better relations between the governments and citizens of the two nations”.
Underscoring his standing in Myanmar, last month the junta credited https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-distances-itself-report-its-envoy-helped-free-us-reporter-2021-11-16 Watanabe, along with U.S. former diplomat Bill Richardson and Yohei Sasakawa, chairman of the Nippon Foundation, when it released a jailed U.S. journalist, Danny Fenster.
Beyond its business membership, the JMA is stacked with politicians from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, including ex-prime minister Taro Aso and several former ambassadors to Myanmar. Aso's office declined to comment on Watanabe’s remarks.
Myanmar's military overthrew the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, claiming election fraud, and earlier this month sentenced her to four years in prison. More than 1,300 protesters have been killed by troops, independent observers say.
Despite his support for Myanmar, Watanabe expressed some misgivings. At the June meeting, Watanabe told the association that ""not everything that the military is doing was OK"" and said he had asked the general for a roadmap to democracy in return for investment. He said it was important to create conditions to hold elections promised by the junta by 2023.

At the same time, Watanabe spoke of his ""friendship"" and ""trust"" with the junta leader, who is under sanctions by the European Union and United States, saying that ""to prevent the outbreak of civil war in Myanmar, Japan should support the current national system, even if just to a minimal extent.""
The junta said in response to questions posed by Reuters that Watanabe’s mall project was ongoing. Watanabe, who said he did not encourage investments that would directly benefit the military, told the JMA he would update on the project once ""there are concrete developments.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly tested positive for COVID-19 after appearing at a U.S. Senate hearing on Wednesday, the airline confirmed on Friday.
Kelly appeared at the Senate Commerce hearing with the CEOs of United Airlines and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) as well as a senior Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) executive and the head of a flight attendants union. Kelly drew attention at the hearing for questioning the health benefits of masks on airplanes.
Delta chief of operations John Laughter, United CEO Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) and American Airlines Doug Parker have all tested negative, the airlines said.
Southwest said that although he tested negative multiple times prior to the hearing, ""Kelly tested positive for COVID-19 after returning home, experiencing mild symptoms, and taking a PCR test.""
The airline said Kelly, who is fully vaccinated and received a booster, ""is doing well and currently resting at home."" It added his ""symptoms continue to be mild, and each day he is moving closer to a full recovery.""
Kelly is set to step down next year as chief executive.
Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, also tested negative, the union said late Friday. She said in a statement earlier Kelly advised her he tested positive ""just as I was returning to work after getting the booster shot. I am following CDC protocols and will test several times within the 5-7 day recommended period, and before traveling with my family for the holidays.""
Southwest confirmed Kelly's positive test after Reuters learned of it through other officials. Kelly tested positive Thursday and told other airlines of the positive test the same day, the officials said.
Kelly did not wear a mask during the hearing and questioned the health benefit of masks on airplanes.
""I think the case is very strong that masks don't add much if anything in the air cabin environment -- it's very safe, very high quality compared to any other indoor setting,"" Kelly said.
Late Friday, Southwest released an email Kelly sent to employees that sought to clarify his comments, saying the airline supports the current federal mask mandate at airports and on airplanes: ""There is no effort underway to change it before it expires ... The majority of our Employees and Customers have felt it has been an important layer of protection, and I certainly agree with that.""

Earlier this month, the Biden administration extended the federal mandate on masks on airplanes and other transit modes through March 18.
Senate Commerce chair Maria Cantwell said Kelly's COVID-19 diagnosis ""underscores the importance of everyone getting vaccinated and following health and safety protocol."" Cantwell plans to get a COVID-19 test on Saturday, her office said.

Alibaba promised to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 in its own direct emissions - known as ""scope 1"" - as well as its indirect ""scope 2"" emissions - derived from the consumption of electricity or heating.
It also said it would reduce carbon intensity - the amount of carbon per unit of revenue - from the ""scope 3"" emissions - produced across its wider value chain in areas such as transportation, purchased goods and services and waste - by 50% by 2030. 
The company also pledged to cut overall CO2 across all its businesses by 1.5 gigatonnes by 2035.
To achieve its goals, Alibaba plans to deploy new energy-saving, high-efficiency technologies, make further use of renewables and also explore ""carbon removal initiatives"" that could extract climate-warming greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. 
Daniel Zhang, the company's chief executive, said the company also sought to ""mobilise actions and behavioural changes among consumers, merchants and partners in China and around the world"".
President Xi Jinping announced last year that China would aim to become carbon neutral by around 2060, putting the country's giant corporations under pressure to draw up their own roadmaps to reach ""net zero"".
But China's giant tech firms remain hugely dependent on the country's coal-dominated energy system, with only a small number so far committed to switching to renewable sources of electricity.
In a report published earlier this year, environment group Greenpeace ranked Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) as the best-performing Chinese cloud service provider in terms of procuring renewable energy and cutting emissions. Huawei Technologies came second, Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) third and Alibaba fourth. 

This story corrects first paragraph one to remove target, and paragraph two to show company aims to achieve carbon neutrality, not ""net zero"".

777,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2021 08:38PM ET</span>","Amazon partnered with China propaganda arm to win Beijing's favor, document shows","By Steve Stecklow and Jeffrey Dastin
LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) was marketing a collection of President Xi Jinping's speeches and writings on its Chinese website about two years ago, when Beijing delivered an edict, according to two people familiar with the incident. The American e-commerce giant must stop allowing any customer ratings and reviews in China.
A negative review of Xi's book prompted the demand, one of the people said. ""I think the issue was anything under five stars,"" the highest rating in Amazon's five-point system, said the other person.
Ratings and reviews are a crucial part of Amazon's e-commerce business, a major way of engaging shoppers. But Amazon complied, the two people said. Currently, on its Chinese site Amazon.cn, the government-published book has no customer reviews or any ratings. And the comments section is disabled.
Amazon's compliance with the Chinese government edict, which has not been reported before, is part of a deeper, decade-long effort by the company to win favor in Beijing to protect and grow its business in one of the world's largest marketplaces.
An internal 2018 Amazon briefing document that describes the company's China business lays out a number of ""Core Issues"" the Seattle-based giant has faced in the country. Among them: ""Ideological control and propaganda is the core of the toolkit for the communist party to achieve and maintain its success,"" the document notes. ""We are not making judgement on whether it is right or wrong.""
That briefing document, and interviews with more than two dozen people who have been involved in Amazon's China operation, reveal how the company has survived and thrived in China by helping to further the ruling Communist Party's global economic and political agenda, while at times pushing back on some government demands.
In a core element of this strategy, the internal document and interviews show, Amazon partnered with an arm of China's propaganda apparatus to create a selling portal on the company's U.S. site, Amazon.com – a project that came to be known as China Books. The venture – which eventually offered more than 90,000 publications for sale – hasn't generated significant revenue. But the document shows that it was seen by Amazon as crucial to winning support in China as the company grew its Kindle electronic-book device, cloud-computing and e-commerce businesses.
The 2018 briefing document spells out the strategic stakes of the China Books project for Jay Carney, the global head of Amazon's lobbying and public-policy operations, ahead of a trip he took to Beijing. ""Kindle has been operating in China in a policy grey area,"" the document stated, and noted that Amazon was having difficulty obtaining a license to sell e-books in the country.
""The key element to safeguard"" against its license problem with the Chinese government ""is the Chinabooks project,"" the document stated.
The document also noted: ""Amazon.com/China books project has also gained wide recognition among Chinese regulators.""
LIFE IN XINJIANG
The books include many apolitical titles, such as Chinese language textbooks, cookbooks and children's bedtime stories. But they also include titles that amplify the Communist Party's official line.
One book extols life in Xinjiang, where United Nations experts have said China interned one million ethnic Uyghurs in a network of camps. The book – ""Incredible Xinjiang: Stories of Passion and Heritage"" – discusses an online comedy show situated in the region. The book quotes an actor who plays a Uyghur ""country bumpkin"" saying that ethnicity is ""not a problem"" there. That echoes the position of Beijing, which has denied mistreating minority groups.
Some books portray China's battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, in heroic terms. One is titled ""Stories of Courage and Determination: Wuhan in Coronavirus Lockdown."" Another begins with commentary from Xi: ""Our success to date has once again demonstrated the strengths of CPC (the Communist Party of China) leadership and Chinese socialism.""
The state-owned firm that partners with Amazon on China books, China International Book Trading Corp, or CIBTC, told Reuters that the venture is a ""commercial relationship between two enterprises."" China's National Press and Publication Administration, or NPPA, the state propaganda arm with which Amazon has had a partnership, had no comment.
In response to questions, Amazon said it ""complies with all applicable laws and regulations, wherever we operate, and China is no exception."" It added that ""as a bookseller, we believe that providing access to the written word and diverse perspectives is important. That includes books that some may find objectionable.""
Amazon said it has ""a wide selection of books"" on China, and the China Books portal ""is an additional channel for serving our Chinese readers in the United States and elsewhere."" CIBTC is ""just one of the millions of selling partners around the world offering products in our stores.""
Reuters News Agency provides news to China Central Television, the state-controlled broadcaster. The agency also distributes CCTV content via Reuters Connect, a marketplace that offers news from about 100 providers. The marketplace partnerships aren't connected to the Reuters newsroom.
The new details about Amazon's China strategy demonstrate the challenges Western companies face in accessing the world's most populous market – and in coping with an authoritarian regime that has been tightening control over public discourse.
The company's compromises with Beijing contrast with its efforts to get around regulators in the world's two largest democracies. In India, Reuters this year has documented how Amazon circumvented local regulations and, to promote its own brands, rigged search results on its Indian website. In the United States, Reuters detailed how Amazon gutted or killed state privacy bills designed to protect consumers.
Amazon said it has always complied with the law in India and doesn't favor its private-label products in search results. Regarding the United States, the company said it prefers U.S. federal privacy legislation, and that it protects consumers' privacy and doesn't sell their data.
Some companies have responded to Beijing's demands by leaving the market. Yahoo recently exited China and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s LinkedIn announced it would pull out some of its services. Both cited the country's difficult business environment and regulatory requirements.
Amazon, by contrast, has grown into a powerful economic force in China in recent years, providing lucrative export opportunities to thousands of Chinese businesses while growing its own industry-leading cloud-services unit. Amazon Web Services, or AWS, is now one of the largest providers to Chinese companies globally, according to a report this year by analysis firm iResearch in China, and people who have worked for AWS.
Still, by 2018, Amazon was receiving an ""increasing number of requests from (Chinese) watchdogs to take down certain content, mostly politically sensitive ones,"" stated the briefing document prepared that year for Carney. He previously served as communications director for U.S. President Joe Biden, when Biden was vice president, and as press secretary for President Barack Obama.
Amazon declined to make Carney available for an interview.
According to the briefing document, the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC, asked Amazon in 2018 to take down a ""link to China's new blockbuster film Amazing China because of especially harsh user reviews."" The CAC is responsible for online security and content regulation.
""Amazing China"" praises the country's accomplishments since Xi became president in 2013. CAC wanted the link removed from IMDb, an Amazon-owned website of movie information and reviews.
Amazon's China office responded to CAC that ""it is difficult for Amazon China to accommodate such requests, and we'll relay the message to"" Amazon headquarters ""and seek their views about possibilities,"" the briefing document stated.
The film remains on IMDb's U.S. website. Shortly after the request, some negative reviews disappeared, archived screenshots of IMDb.com on archive.org show. Others remain, and ""Amazing China"" currently has an overall rating of just 2.3 out of a top score of 10. Some reviews call it ""pathetic,"" ""garbage"" or ""government propaganda.""
""Some reviews submitted for the title 'Amazing China' were removed because they violated our user review content guidelines, with the majority being off topic,"" Amazon told Reuters. ""IMDb is not aware of any request from external parties (including the Chinese government) to do anything about reviews for this title.""
CAC didn't respond to a request for comment.
'WINK AND A NOD'
Amazon entered China in 2004 through a $75 million deal to acquire Joyo.com, an online book-and-media seller. Eventually, Amazon wanted to introduce e-books and its popular Kindle reading devices to the Chinese market.
To accomplish that, it worked with the General Administration of Press and Publication, or GAPP, a regulator that engages in state censorship in its role as overseer of publications in China. NPPA now handles most of GAPP's responsibilities. NPPA, in turn, is overseen by the Communist Party's Publicity Department, which was previously known as the Propaganda Department.
According to a former Amazon executive involved in talks with China, the company secured some, but not all, of the government approvals it needed to sell Kindle devices and e-books. That situation gave the government leverage over the retailer, the former executive said. Amazon's public-policy team came up with the China Books project as a novel way ""to get what we wanted on Kindle and other things,"" the person said. ""It was a wink and a nod.""
Amazon soon began working with GAPP to set up China Books, according to the briefing document. The company planned to tout the portal to Chinese authorities as Amazon's only store named after a country, the document said. Amazon dedicated several employees to the effort, which involved CIBTC, the government book-trading company, which the document described as ""the executing body from GAPP.""
A photograph on CIBTC's website shows Chinese officials toasting the launch of the project at a hotel in Beijing in September 2011.
In October 2012, China Books was awarded the title, ""a key national culture export"" project, by a group of Chinese government bodies, including GAPP, as well as the entity now known as the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China. Two months later, Amazon launched its electronic-books business in China and soon began selling Kindles.
By the end of 2017, China had become Kindle's largest global market, ""accounting for 40%+ of our world device sales volume,"" according to the 2018 briefing document. By then, Amazon had added a Chinese e-book store to its American website and had translated 19 books.
And Carney, the top public-policy executive who then reported to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, went to China in April 2018. There, he told an alternate member of the Communist Party central committee that Amazon would make ""every effort"" to promote China Books and make it ""bigger and stronger,"" according to a CIBTC press release.
The briefing document prepared for Carney stated: ""Both China Books and Kindle Chinese eBook Store are Amazon China's main commitment to assist China in 'Going Abroad,' an umbrella project that aims to promote Chinese culture to the world.""
Amazon's China Books webpage prominently displays CIBTC's name, but doesn't disclose that it's a project that Amazon created in a partnership with a Chinese government agency.
""Details about the company are readily available online,"" Amazon told Reuters, ""and CIBTC has placed its name and logo prominently throughout its page. Our relationship with CIBTC is entirely appropriate.""
Eventually, the China Books project flopped financially, according to a person who has been involved in it. Few of the portal's titles have sold well, and Amazon even shipped back books because its warehouses lacked space for them.
Nonetheless, the China Books project continues. The Chinese-language version of ""Xi Jinping: The Governance of China Volume Three"" – is listed first on China Books' "" BEST  (NYSE:BEST) SELLER"" page. It recently showed a sales rank of 1,347,071. Another ""best seller,"" about COVID-19, was ranked 10,654,483. The Xinjiang title, which Reuters purchased, had been ranked 13,441,455.
But sales weren't the goal, according to the person who has been involved in the project. ""It's a high-level photo-op,"" part of a ""soft-power campaign to basically put the books out there and just have it be visible.""
In its statement to Reuters, CIBTC, the government book-trading company, said it doesn't ""rank books sold through Amazon."" It didn't elaborate.
A THREAT TO 'RETALIATE'
Amazon continued its Chinese expansion in 2013, announcing the introduction in Beijing of Amazon Web Services, its cloud-computing business. At the time, no Chinese law regulated cloud services, the 2018 briefing document noted.
In 2016, China began taking actions that made it more difficult for foreign cloud-computing firms, such as AWS, to operate in the country.
The government began requiring cloud providers to hold a new license that only Chinese-owned companies could obtain, according to the briefing document. ""Regulators have since become very hostile"" toward AWS, the 2018 document stated.
The result was that Amazon took an unusual step for the company: It handed off its cloud technology to local companies so it could keep operating in China. The Chinese companies – not Amazon – were responsible for ""monitoring and taking down illegal content, collecting and reporting basic information of customers … and working with PRC (the People's Republic of China) authorities on all compliance-related inquiries that may arise,"" the 2018 document stated.
In its statement to Reuters, Amazon said that AWS, as a foreign cloud provider, has to license or sell technology to local partners in China in order to have a presence there.
That structure didn't shield AWS from Chinese pressure, however.
In February 2018, China's Ministry of Public Security, or MPS, called AWS to a meeting, the briefing document stated. MPS threatened to ""retaliate"" against Amazon unless it removed content and blocked a website it hosted in the United States for Guo Wengui, a Chinese dissident. AWS refused, the document said. But the company asked Guo to take an action that exposed the dissident's Internet Protocol, or IP address, and AWS ""provided to MPS"" this data, the document stated. An IP address is a unique code that identifies a computer accessing the internet.
The ministry ""recognized our effort to find a solution, though not ... to their satisfactory level,"" the document stated.
The 2018 briefing document advised Carney to raise the government's request on Guo when meeting a top Ministry of Commerce official in Beijing, and stress that China shouldn't make requests that involve data stored abroad.
Asked about the Guo incident, Amazon confirmed it received the Chinese government's request, but said it ""did not provide any non-public information or any other customer information.""
The commerce ministry said Guo wasn't discussed at the meeting with Carney. Amazon didn't say whether Guo came up.
An employee for MPS said the ministry doesn't respond to requests for comment. An attorney for Guo said Guo had no comment.
AWS's China business continues to grow. Despite being blocked from selling cloud services to the government and some state-owned enterprises, AWS has landed key customers in China, say people familiar with the matter.

Among them are two Chinese companies, Tiktok developer ByteDance and video-surveillance firm Hikvision, as well as multinationals  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), Samsung (KS:005930) and Philips, according to the 2018 briefing document and a 2019 blog on AWS's website. Philips declined to comment; the other four companies didn't respond to requests for comment.
In June, AWS announced it was expanding further in the country, ""to support the demands of our growing customer base in China.""

778,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2021 07:31PM ET</span>","Rivian warns supply issues to hit production, shares drop to record low","By Akash Sriram and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - Rivian Automotive Inc shares skidded nearly 15% on Friday to hit a record low after the electric vehicle maker's first result as a listed company highlighted the challenges it was likely to face in ramping up production to take on EV leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
Rivian's shares slumped to $92.62 in early trading - opening below the $100 mark for the first time - and were still off about 11% in the afternoon. Before Friday's decline, they had gained about 40% since the company's blockbuster market debut in November.
Rivian announced plans on Thursday to build a $5 billion plant in Georgia to boost capacity, while flagging production challenges even as it receives about 2,000 pre-orders every week. 
""We don't want to read too much into near-term issues ... but it does highlight the risk that Rivian has a lot on its plate,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak. 
The Irvine, California-based company expects production to fall ""a few hundred vehicles short"" of its 2021 target of 1,200 due to supply chain constraints.
Increasing production of the R1T truck, R1S SUV and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s delivery vans within a few months would be akin to ""a really complex orchestra,"" Chief Executive Officer RJ Scaringe said.
Rivian has 71,000 pre-orders for its R1 vehicles, up from 55,400 in October, but some on Wall Street said that total is on the low end of expectations. Rivian also has struggled to get the vehicles into customers' hands.
""The strong order book provides support for the production ramp, though it does add pressure to get vehicles to customers that may get impatient as current R1 orders won't be ready until the end of 2023,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Colin Langan said. 
Construction of Rivian's new Georgia plant will begin next summer and vehicle production will start in 2024. The company plans to increase production by 50,000 vehicles at its plant in Normal, Illinois, which began building the R1T pickup in September and added the R1S SUV this week with the delivery van to follow this month.
Rivian faces fresh challenges in building volume as demand rises while squashing doubts on whether a new electric vehicle company will be able to survive what Tesla CEO Elon Musk has called ""production hell.""

Soon after Rivian's IPO, Musk said that high production and breakeven cash flow would be the ""true test"" for Rivian.
Georgia economic development officials on Friday declined to say what the incentives for Rivian will total as they are still being finalized. Georgia previously gave Korean automaker Kia more than $450 million in incentives for a new plant in the state, according to some reports, and officials in Texas offered Rivian up to $440 million for the new plant.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 ended the week in the red Friday, as selling intensified into the close amid a rout in financials and energy.
The S&P 500 fell 1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5%, or 532 points, the NASDAQ fell 0.07%.
Financials, mostly banking stocks, fell 2%, as the 10-year yield dipped further below 1.4% on concerns about the impact of the Omicron variant.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), People’s United Financial (NASDAQ:PBCT), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) were among the biggest decliners, with the latter ending the day down 4%.
Energy wasn’t far behind, down about 1% as investors continued to assess the threat of Omicron on energy demand.
Industrials also added to the selloff in cyclical sectors even as FedEx (NYSE:FDX) surged after reporting quarterly results that beat on both the top and bottom lines.
FedEx reported better-than-expected earnings per share of $4.83, as higher shipping rates helped offset increased costs during the fiscal second quarter.
“FDX reported fiscal 2Q results that were better than feared, and the company raised its full year guidance,” Deutsche Bank said as it lifted it price target on the FedEx to $310 from $299.
Despite the selling in cyclicals, which trade in tandem with the economy, some continued to back this economically sensitive sector to deliver gains.
“Given our outlook on the economy that eventually once we get past the omicron impact, this economy will continue its post recessionary growth,” Peter Duffy, chief investment officer of credit at Penn Capital Management said in an interview with Investing.com on Friday.
“We would tend to favor economic cyclicality value names as opposed to the growth themes,” Duffy added.
Big tech, meanwhile, continued to bleed, paced by declines in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), as investors reassess their appetite for growth sectors of the market amid expectations for the rates to rise.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) proved an exception to the selloff.
Health care was one of the few sectors in the green as a rally in health-care information company Cerner offset weakness in Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Eli Lilly & Company.
Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) rose by more than 12% following a Wall Street Journal reported suggesting the company was in talks about a potential sale to Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).
Johnson & Johnson fell 2.8% after an advisory panel for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted to recommend vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna over the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. 
The CDC flagged new data showing an increased risk of blood clots from the JNJ vaccine.
Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) fell 4% amid concerns about its Alzheimer’s disease securing approval after The European Union's drug regulator on Friday rejected Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) Alzheimer's drug, Aduhelm.
In other news,  General Motors (NYSE:GM) fell more than 5% after Dan Ammann, CEO of its autonomous vehicle business Cruise, reportedly left the company."

(Reuters) - Wall Street finished lower on Friday, weighed down by Big Tech as investors worried about the Omicron coronavirus variant and digested the Federal Reserve's decision to end its pandemic-era stimulus faster.
All three main U.S. stock indexes ended with a decline for the week after the Fed on Wednesday signaled three quarter-percentage-point interest rate hikes by the end of 2022 to combat surging inflation.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) dropped 2.1% and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) lost 1.9%, both weighing on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.
The S&P 500 growth index lost 0.7% and the value index declined 1.4%.
All of the 11 major S&P 500 sector indexes fell, with financials leading the way down with a 2.3% drop. Energy lost 2.2%.
Adding to uncertainty,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) said on Friday the pandemic could extend through next year. European countries geared up for further travel and social restrictions and a study warned that the rapidly spreading Omicron coronavirus variant was five times more likely to reinfect people than its predecessor, Delta. 
Traders also pointed to year-end tax selling and the simultaneous expiration of stock options, stock index futures and index options contracts - known as triple witching - as potential causes for volatility.
""It's a big options expiration day,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. ""And now you draw on top of that some Omicron, and you've got volatility, and I think it creates a lot of uncertainty amongst investors. Where are you going to position for the end of the year?"" Heavyweight growth stocks including Nvidia and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have outperformed the broader market in 2021, while the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index has surged about 35%. The benchmark S&P 500 index gained around 23% in the same period.
In Friday's session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.48% to end at 35,365.44 points, while the S&P 500 lost 1.03% to 4,620.64. 
The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.07% to 15,169.68.
On a positive note, the small-cap Russell 2000 index rallied 1% after having fallen more than 10% from a record high in early November. 
With options expiring, volume on U.S. exchanges jumped to 16.6 billion shares, far above the 11.9 billion average over the last 20 trading days.
For the week, the S&P 500 fell 1.9%, the Dow lost 1.7% and the Nasdaq declined 2.9%.
In Friday's session, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) tumbled 6.4% after the Wall Street Journal reported the enterprise software maker is in talks to buy electronic medical records company Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) in a deal that could be valued at $30 billion. Shares of Cerner surged 12.9%.
FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) rose almost 5% after the delivery firm reinstated its original fiscal 2022 forecast on Thursday, even as persistent labor woes chipped away profits.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.50-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.16-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and seven new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 28 new highs and 341 new lows.

781,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2021 05:45PM ET</span>","Brazil's oil auction raises $2 billion as Total, Shell pile in","By Gram Slattery, Marta Nogueira and Sabrina Valle
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - France's TotalEnergies, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), Malaysia's Petronas and Qatar Energy on Friday scooped up big offshore fields in Brazil together with state-owned Petrobras, paying nearly $2 billion to its cash-strapped government.
While TotalEnergies (28%), Qatar Energy (21%) and Petronas (21%) made the top offer for Sepia field, Petrobras, formally Petroleo Brasileiro SA, later entered the consortium by exercising preference rights to take a 30% stake.
Petrobras (52.5%), Shell (25%) and Total (22.5%) secured the nearby Atapu field.
Officials, who had been keen to attract major foreign players, deemed the auction a success, and analysts said the offers agreed to were relatively rich. 
The selloff was widely seen as a test of Brazil's investment climate and of large oil producers' willingness to keep spending big on traditional oil assets, despite increasing pressure over climate change and toward energy transition. 
TotalEnergies, which snapped up a stake in both blocks, said the investment will bring output with ""costs well below $20 per barrel of oil equivalent"" and with carbon emissions rates below industry levels.
""These are unique opportunities to access giant low-cost and low emissions oil reserves,"" CEO Patrick Pouyanné said in a statement.
Signing bonuses were fixed in reais at the equivalent of $1.3 billion for Sepia and $740,000 for Atapu. Companies bid for a percentage of the production they were willing to share with the government, winning the highest: 37.43% for Sepia and 31.68% for Atapu.
Petrobras, TotalEergies and Shell shares fell on Friday, following a 2.60% decrease in Brent prices.
Brazil attempted to auction both fields in 2019, but neither received offers, even from Petrobras. At the time, complex legal issues and rich signing bonuses kept oil majors away. 
This time, the bidding terms were considered more attractive, several industry sources told Reuters, largely due to big cuts in both signing bonuses and minimum profit oil.
Government moves to streamline rules and lower fees ""drew bids well above the minimums for both assets,"" said Andre Fangundes, vice president of consultancy Welligence.

782,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2021 05:45PM ET</span>","Brazil's oil auction raises $2 billion as Total, Shell pile in","By Gram Slattery, Marta Nogueira and Sabrina Valle
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - France's TotalEnergies, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), Malaysia's Petronas and Qatar Energy on Friday scooped up big offshore fields in Brazil together with state-owned Petrobras, paying nearly $2 billion to its cash-strapped government.
While TotalEnergies (28%), Qatar Energy (21%) and Petronas (21%) made the top offer for Sepia field, Petrobras, formally Petroleo Brasileiro SA, later entered the consortium by exercising preference rights to take a 30% stake.
Petrobras (52.5%), Shell (25%) and Total (22.5%) secured the nearby Atapu field.
Officials, who had been keen to attract major foreign players, deemed the auction a success, and analysts said the offers agreed to were relatively rich. 
The selloff was widely seen as a test of Brazil's investment climate and of large oil producers' willingness to keep spending big on traditional oil assets, despite increasing pressure over climate change and toward energy transition. 
TotalEnergies, which snapped up a stake in both blocks, said the investment will bring output with ""costs well below $20 per barrel of oil equivalent"" and with carbon emissions rates below industry levels.
""These are unique opportunities to access giant low-cost and low emissions oil reserves,"" CEO Patrick Pouyanné said in a statement.
Signing bonuses were fixed in reais at the equivalent of $1.3 billion for Sepia and $740,000 for Atapu. Companies bid for a percentage of the production they were willing to share with the government, winning the highest: 37.43% for Sepia and 31.68% for Atapu.
Petrobras, TotalEergies and Shell shares fell on Friday, following a 2.60% decrease in Brent prices.
Brazil attempted to auction both fields in 2019, but neither received offers, even from Petrobras. At the time, complex legal issues and rich signing bonuses kept oil majors away. 
This time, the bidding terms were considered more attractive, several industry sources told Reuters, largely due to big cuts in both signing bonuses and minimum profit oil.
Government moves to streamline rules and lower fees ""drew bids well above the minimums for both assets,"" said Andre Fangundes, vice president of consultancy Welligence. 
""Companies were more aggressive than we expected,"" said Marcelo de Assis, head of Latin America upstream research at Wood Mackenzie.

783,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2021 05:41PM ET</span>",Bidding race on for Vertical Aerospace eVTOL plant as shares debut,"By Tim Hepher
(Reuters) - As the flying taxi market takes off, the race is on to decide where the future vehicles will be built with one of the backers of newly listed Vertical Aerospace - Irish leasing boss Domhnal Slattery - pushing for a manufacturing base in Ireland.
Shares in the electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOL) maker, backed by investors such as Slattery's Avolon aircraft leasing company and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), rose sharply at their market debut on Friday after a blank-check merger valued at $2.2 billion.
Unlike many other entrants in the increasingly busy eVTOL market, Vertical Aerospace is focusing only on design, manufacture and services rather than ride-sharing operations, sparking a bidding race to secure high-tech production work - and the highly skilled jobs that go with it.
It has reported pre-orders for up to 1,350 aircraft worth $5 billion from customers including American and Virgin Atlantic.
""We have been speaking to a number of different governments about where we might build the production facility. Domhnal is very keen on us taking it to Ireland,"" founder and Chief Executive Stephen Fitzpatrick said after ringing the opening bell in New York.
While the Republic of Ireland is a global hub for aviation finance, it does not host any major aerospace manufacturing. A plant would help the government achieve two of its objectives: boosting its green technology sector and diversifying away from investment dependent on the country's low corporate tax rate.
""I would love to see it in Ireland. I think it would be a fantastic location. The UK is equally attractive and indeed other jurisdictions,"" Slattery told Reuters in an interview. 
Bristol in the UK, where Vertical Aerospace is based, has thousands of aerospace engineers and discussion of where to place the plant is for now ""hypothetical,"" Fitzpatrick said.
Even once a decision is made on where to build the vehicles, analysts warn a key question is how long it will take for new electric aircraft to be certified by aviation authorities. 
Vertical Aerospace is aiming for 2024 and expects to commission a dedicated certification vehicle in coming weeks.
""We are on programme for the end of 2024; we are giving ourselves a window of 2024-2025,"" Fitzpatrick told Reuters.

""The key challenge we have is to certify the aircraft, there is no doubt about it,"" he said, adding partners including Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) and Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) would handle key components.
""We are going to have these aircraft flying over cities all over the world in not less than three years but not more than five.""

Benzene is classified as a substance that can potentially cause cancer depending on the level and extent of exposure.

In addition, Wall Street analysts expect these names to advance more than 45% in price in the near term. Read on.The major stock market indexes plunged on Thursday as big tech shares fell sharply, causing the NASDAQ Composite Index to shed 385.15 points or 2.47% to close at 15,180.43. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 29.79 points to close at 35,897.64, while the S&P 500 declined 0.8% to close at 4,668.67. The markets have remained volatile as investors gauge economic growth prospects and rising COVD-19 omicron cases.
In November, inflation surged to a 6.8% 40-year high because consumer prices have risen at their fastest clip since 1982. Inflationary pressures have forced the Fed to act, and it promised to halt its pandemic-driven asset purchases early next year, giving way to three interest rate hikes in 2022 to counter the inflation threat. Meanwhile, the omicron variant has spooked investors as top Federal health officials warn that the variant is spreading rapidly and could peak by next month.
Amid this market uncertainty, we think it could be wise to bet on quality dividend-yielding stocks to hedge one’s portfolio against market volatility by ensuring a steady income stream. So, it could be wise to add quality dividend-paying stocks Thor Industries, Inc. (THO), Select Medical Holdings Corporation (SEM), and Tecnoglass Inc. (TGLS) to one’s portfolio.

The global apparel market is expected to grow at 7.5% CAGR to $797.30 billion by 2025.
Strong vaccination rates, declining jobless claims, and a consistent rise in consumer spending since August made the National Retail Federation (NRF) forecast holiday retail sales to rise between 8.5% -10.5% this holiday season.

According to AMC, around 1.1 million people watched the film at a U.S. AMC theater on Thursday.
""Needless to say, we are ever so happy to see a record-setting number of people returning to the cinema to capture the magic offered at AMC movie theatres,” said Adam Aron, AMC chairman and CEO.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global stock benchmarks and oil prices fell on Friday while safe havens such as the dollar and Treasury bonds rose as investors wrestled with rising numbers of Omicron cases and a hawkish turn from major central banks in the fight against inflation. 
Asian shares closed near lows for the year, and broad-based European stock benchmarks slid 0.5%. Treasury bonds yields touched their lowest levels since early December. 
""Central bankers have delivered a hawk for the holidays. The balance of 2021 will be spent focused on the ramifications from Omicron and any associated restrictions and/or delays in the return to normal,"" said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets. 
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.84%.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 531.08 points, or 1.48%, to 35,366.56, the S&P 500 lost 48.12 points, or 1.03%, to 4,620.55, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 10.75 points, or 0.07%, to 15,169.68.
U.S. stocks have reversed all of their gains from Wednesday, when markets welcomed the Federal Reserve's commitment to tackle rising inflation with faster bond tapering and interest rate hikes next year.
The hawkish tilt from central banks this week, including the Fed and the Bank of England and to a lesser degree the European Central Bank, was initially greeted by a wave of buying from investors confident policymakers would curb higher inflation.
But the mood has turned gloomier as traders fret that markets pumped up on cheap money are vulnerable to even the smallest of pullbacks in stimulus.
""Volatility is rising again, lowering the predictability of what may happen next,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote. 
The Bank of Japan dialed back some emergency pandemic funding on Friday but maintained its ultra-loose policy and extended financial relief for small firms, cementing expectations it will remain among the most dovish central banks for the foreseeable future.
Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 5/32 in price to yield 1.4072%, from 1.422% late on Thursday. The dollar index rose 0.728%. 
Adding to the caution are worries that rising Omicron infection rates mean a rocky few months for the global economy, although most economists think the damage will be much less severe than in previous waves of COVID-19 cases. 
""Ordinarily, in the wake of a more hawkish (Fed) outcome, yields would be expected to rise in anticipation of the Fed tightening cycle,"" said analysts at Westpac.
""However, there are competing dynamics at present, with ongoing inflation fears sparking the Fed's tougher rhetoric being offset by fears that economic growth will be derailed by Omicron in the near term,"" they added.

 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) said Friday that the coronavirus pandemic could extend through 2023.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co suspended its coronavirus vaccination requirement for U.S.-based employees, the U.S. planemaker said on Friday, capping weeks of uncertainty as thousands of workers sought exemptions and challenges to a federal mandate played out in court. 
In an internal announcement, Boeing said its decision came after a review of a U.S. District Court ruling earlier this month that halted the enforcement of President Joe Biden's vaccine requirement for federal contractors.
Some big healthcare chains and companies such as  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR), and Amtrak have also suspended vaccine mandates for workers. 
In recent weeks, the number of Boeing employees seeking a vaccine exemption on religious or medical grounds had reached more than 11,000 - or nearly 9% of its U.S. workforce - a level many times higher than executives initially estimated, Reuters first reported. 
The fact that the vast majority of applications were on religious grounds thrust one of America's largest employers into the center of a debate about the ethics of probing an employee's religious beliefs.
It also left executives searching for a strategy that keeps employees safe, but avoids an exodus of engineering and factory labor.
Boeing's vaccination requirement has resulted in more than 92% of U.S.-based workers having registered as being fully vaccinated, or having received a religious or medical accommodation, according to the Friday memo.
""The success of Boeing's vaccination requirement to date positions the company well to comply with the federal executive order should it be reinstated in the future,"" it added.
A Boeing spokesperson confirmed the decision, and added that the company was ""committed to maintaining a safe working environment for our employees, and advancing the health and safety of our global workforce.""

Boeing suspended its vaccination requirement in line with the court's decision prohibiting enforcement of the federal contractor executive order and a number of state laws, the spokesperson added. 
Last month, the White House pushed back to Jan. 4 its deadline for employees at federal contractors to be vaccinated or be tested regularly if they receive exemptions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A woman has accused two former members of a Virginia police department of sexually assaulting her as part of a deal to protect the leader of a human trafficking ring, according to a lawsuit filed on Thursday night.
The woman, who is referred to only as Jane Doe because she is a trafficking victim, alleges that the Fairfax County, Virginia, police department, including its former chief Edwin Roessler, knew that some officers were possibly participating in and protecting the ring, but allowed the officers to retire with full pensions rather than prosecute them.
Roessler did not respond to requests for comment sent to his LinkedIn profile or email. 
A spokesperson for the Washington, D.C.-area Fairfax County Police Department said the department was handling other matters and did not have any immediate comment on the lawsuit. 
The lawsuit accuses two former officers of having had sex with trafficking victims, including the plaintiff.
It also accuses two other former officers, Roessler and the county of thwarting trafficking investigations.
The two officers accused of sexual assault could not be reached by Reuters, while those accused of interfering with the investigations did not respond to LinkedIn messages.
The lawsuit says the FBI was aware of possible crimes by the officers after agents discovered their numbers on a cell phone used by the plaintiff, and referred the matter to the Fairfax County Police. 
An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment on any specific case, but told Reuters the bureau takes allegations of criminal misconduct seriously.
""Allegations such as these regarding law enforcement misconduct and human trafficking are promptly investigated or shared as appropriate,"" she said, adding that the FBI is committed to investigating possible crimes against children and human trafficking.
The alleged obstruction of sex-trafficking investigations by Fairfax officers occurred at the same time the county was receiving a $500,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice to help fund such investigations.
The defendants ""engaged in a conspiracy to obstruct the investigation and exposure of sex trafficking taking place within Fairfax County,"" the lawsuit said. 
The plaintiff is a victim of Hazel Marie Sanchez Cerdas, a woman who ran a prostitution ring in Fairfax County, according to the lawsuit. It said the two police officers provided ""protective services to Sanchez's trafficking ring"" and she in turn ""made trafficked women, including Jane Doe, available to them for sexual services gratis."" 
Federal prosecutors said Sanchez lured women from Costa Rica and coerced them into prostitution.
Sanchez pleaded guilty in 2019 to one count of interstate or foreign travel to aid in racketeering enterprises and was ordered to serve 2 -1/2 years in prison.
The lawsuit also said that department officials repeatedly thwarted trafficking investigations by former detective William Woolf. Officers repeatedly derided Woolf as a ""social worker"" and portrayed victims as prostitutes who voluntarily engaged in sex work, the lawsuit said.
In about 2014 or 2015, one of Woolf's bosses took a sudden interest in his cases, and directed him to provide a telephone number for one of the victims, according to the lawsuit. The boss also became increasingly hostile toward Woolf's investigations, it said.
Woolf tried to blow the whistle about his boss's actions but officials ordered him to keep his mouth shut, the lawsuit said. Woolf left the department in 2017. He declined to comment.

Mexico's lower house of Congress in March backed decriminalization of cannabis for recreational, scientific, medical and industrial uses, in a move supporters hailed as a major step for a country long ravaged by drug gang violence.
However, final approval has been held up in the Senate.
Mexico's Supreme Court on Dec. 1 made Canadian company Xebra Brands' local subsidiary, Desart MX, the first company allowed to import seeds, as well as grow, process, manufacture, sell and export marijuana products with 1% or less THC, the plant's psychoactive substance.
""The impact is significant because it sets a precedent in Mexico and is also a historical event,"" Xebra Brands President Robert Giustra told Reuters in an interview.   
""Mexico is clearly legalizing. It's going to happen, probably next year,"" he said, arguing that Mexico has an industrial advantage as well as a large consumer market.
An official from MORENA, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's ruling party, told Reuters that despite obstacles, approval of the measure in the Senate was expected in 2022. That could make Mexico the world's largest single weed market.
The global market for legal marijuana is estimated to hit $73.6 billion by 2027, according to Grand View Research.
Access to land, a skilled labor force and a trade pact with the United States and Canada are all attractive qualities in the Mexican market, Giustra said. 
Other industry players, like Canada's  Khiron Life  Sciences (OTC:KHRNF), have also expressed interest in Mexico. 
Xebra is waiting on authorization by Mexico's health regulator, Cofepris, which Giustra expects no later than February. Cofepris did not respond to a request for comment. 

For now, Xebra is looking for land in the central State of Mexico and on the Yucatan Peninsula for growing marijuana and building an extraction facility to produce hemp derivatives for beauty products and beverages for the Mexican market and exports to Europe.
Giustra predicted his company would have the market for cannabidiol, or CBD, and cannabigerol (CBG) to itself for up to three years.

The shares of movie theater operator AMC were last up 23.1% at $30.09 and on track for their biggest one-day percentage gain since July. 
Some market participants tied the jump to big preview numbers for the ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" movie ahead of what is expected to be a massive weekend at cinemas.
AMC's chief executive, Adam Aron, earlier on Friday posted a tweet celebrating the movie's big box office numbers.
Shares of GameStop, meanwhile, were up 9.0% at $157.58.
About 30% of AMC's open options were set to expire at the end of Friday's session, leading to a surge in trading volume as traders placed wagers on where the stock would end the day.
AMC saw about 1 million contracts traded by 1300 EST (1800 GMT), or three times expected volume. Options volume was projected to hit 1.6 million contracts for the day, making it the busiest day for AMC options in about four months, according to Trade Alert data.
Trading sentiment leaned toward bullish bets, with about 60% of the volume in contracts set to expire by the end of the session, according to Trade Alert. 
""It’s a classic meme stock rally. There’s some enthusiasm about 'Spider-Man' pushing the stock higher,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR). ""That today is an expiration certainly helps.""
Both stocks soared earlier this year, fueled in part by individual traders' coordinating in online chatrooms. AMC is up about 1,300% year-to-date while GameStop has gained about 740%.

AMC shares had fallen as much as 54.7% from their most recent intraday peak of $45.95 on Nov. 8 to the most recent low of $20.80 on Dec. 14. 
GameStop shares fell 49% from their recent intraday peak of $255.69 to the most recent low of $129.50 reached on Dec. 14.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 fell Friday, as banking stocks gave up their gains from a day earlier, and big tech continued to nurse losses.
The S&P 500 fell 0.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1%, or 393 points, the NASDAQ climbed 0.2%.
Financials, mostly banking stocks, fell nearly 2%, as the 10-year yield fell further below 1.4% on concerns about the impact of the Omicron variant.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), People’s United Financial (NASDAQ:PBCT), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) were among the biggest decliners, with the latter down 4%.
Energy wasn’t far behind, down about 1% as investors continued to assess the threat of Omicron on energy demand.
Industrials also added to the selloff in cyclical sectors even as FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reported quarterly results that beat on both the top and bottom lines.
FedEx reported better-than-expected earnings per share of $4.83, as higher shipping rates helped offset increased costs during the fiscal second quarter.
“FDX reported fiscal 2Q results that were better than feared, and the company raised its full year guidance,” Deutsche Bank said as it lifted it price target on the FedEx to $310 from $299.
Despite the selling in cyclicals, which trade in tandem with the economy, some continued to back this economically sensitive sector to deliver gains.
“Given our outlook on the economy that eventually once we get past the omicron impact, this economy will continue its post recessionary growth,” Peter Duffy, chief investment officer of credit at Penn Capital Management said in an interview with Investing.com on Friday.
“We would tend to favor economic cyclicality value names as opposed to the growth themes,” Duffy added.
Big tech, meanwhile, continued to bleed, paced by declines in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), as investors reassess their appetite for growth sectors of the market amid expectations for the rates to rise.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) proved an exception to the selloff.
Health care was one of the few sectors in the green as a rally in health-care information company Cerner offset weakness in Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Eli Lilly & Company.
Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) rose by more than 12% following a Wall Street Journal reported suggesting the company was in talks about a potential sale to Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).
Johnson & Johnson fell more than 2% after an advisory panel for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted to recommend vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna over the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
More evidence points to antibody weakness vs Omicron
Evidence emerging from lab experiments reveals weaknesses of vaccines and antibody drugs against the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. 
In a study reported Wednesday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review, researchers at Columbia University found Omicron ""to be markedly resistant to neutralization"" by antibodies in blood from recipients of vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) or Oxford/AstraZeneca or from survivors of COVID-19. Next, they tested nine monoclonal antibodies that have been authorized for use and 10 that are still experimental. Neutralizing abilities of 18 of the 19 antibodies ""were either abolished or impaired,"" including ones already authorized for use, they said. 
European researchers reported similar results in a separate paper, also posted on Wednesday on bioRxiv. ""Omicron was totally or partially resistant to neutralization"" by the nine monoclonal antibodies they tested and by antibodies in blood samples from 90 vaccine recipients and COVID-19 survivors. 
Both teams also found that even in vaccine recipients who received a booster dose, and in survivors who received vaccines, antibodies had substantially diminished neutralizing power. In these individuals, the European group said, neutralizing antibody levels were 5 to 31 times lower against Omicron than against Delta.
More frequent treatment may help COVID-19 patients on ventilators
A new study considers why COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilators have trouble breathing and how refining a common treatment could help save lives. 
A thin layer of fluid called pulmonary surfactant lines the air sacs in the lungs, helping to keep the sacs from collapsing at the end of each exhalation. Surfactant was first found to be important in premature babies, who are born without enough surfactant. 
The study, published this month in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, shows for the first time that COVID-19 patients on ventilators have less surfactant in their lungs than healthy people. 
When researchers treated 10 adult patients with the same artificial surfactant used in preterm babies, the benefit of treatment wore off very quickly and patients needed repeat doses far more often than expected. 

The virus that causes COVID-19 infects and kills the lung cells that produce surfactant, but these cells will recover in time once the infection is over, the researchers said. The new findings suggest that in the meantime, ""multiple surfactant doses over a number of days will be required ... until the lungs start to make their own surfactant.""

MILAN (Reuters) - State-owned Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) said on Friday it needed 2.5 billion euros ($2.8 billion) in capital, as Rome seeks more time to reprivatise it following a failed sale attempt.
Italy has worked in vain to meet an end-2021 deadline to return MPS to private hands after a 2017 bailout handed the state a 64% stake. 
After labouring for years to rid MPS of its mountain of problem loans, Italy sought to clinch a sale to UniCredit but negotiations collapsed in October when Rome decided terms set by the country's second-biggest bank were too costly.
Italy is now in talks with European Union authorities to push back beyond 2023 the re-privatisation deadline. 
MPS, which in July emerged as the most vulnerable euro zone lender in a sector health check, approved a new 2022-2026 strategic plan on Friday which it will submit to EU banking supervisors and market competition authorities.
The Tuscan bank targets a pre-tax profit of around 700 million euros in 2024, after cutting staff costs for up to 275 million euros a year through voluntary redundancies.
MPS estimated restructuring costs under the plan at 1 billion euros.
Italian banks only lay off staff through a costly early retirement scheme. CEO Guido Bastianini told parliament last month that MPS was looking to cut 4,000 staff. He said on Monday he hoped to start talks with unions soon.
To fund the restructuring, MPS said it planned to raise 2.5 billion euros in 2022 by selling new shares, a figure which needs the approval of European authorities.
Italy's Treasury has said it will support the capital raising but MPS needs to find investors for the 36% portion that cannot be covered by the state.
Sources have told Reuters the bank could seek to strengthen ties with its commercial partners, which include French insurer AXA and asset manager Anima.

Bastianini said on Monday relations with them were paramount but that it was too early to say whether they could become investors in the bank.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Starbucks Corp will be headed to the bargaining table at its first officially unionized corporate-owned U.S. location after the National Labor Relations Board on Friday certified the results of a vote to unionize.
Employees at one Buffalo, New York area store on Elmwood Avenue voted last week to join Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union. 
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which has not had unionized employees anywhere in the United States for years, did not object to the Elmwood results, the NLRB confirmed.
""We remain committed to supporting our partners and are considering all options that will best protect the work flexibility, transferability and equitable benefits of all our partners,"" a Starbucks spokesperson told Reuters.
Baristas and shift supervisors at another location rejected the union, which has challenged those results. The outcome at a third location is still being determined as several ballots are under review. 
Starbucks repeatedly challenged aspects of the NLRB election along the way, including arguing unsuccessfully that the entire Buffalo market of about 20 cafes should all have to vote at the same time, which would have made it more difficult for the union to organize at each location.

""We're offering an olive branch to Starbucks. We're asking them to put the past behind us, to sit down at the bargaining table to show the world they're ready to bargain with their partners,"" Michelle Eisen, an employee at the Elmwood location who helped lead the unionization effort, said in a statement. 
Starbucks had a handful of unionized U.S. locations decades ago, but they eventually decertified. More than 1,000 workers at West Coast Starbucks kiosks inside grocery stores are United Food and Commercial Workers members, but they are franchisee - not Starbucks - employees.

806,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2021 03:17PM ET</span>","U.S. relaxes restriction on abortion pill, allows women to obtain by mail","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Thursday permanently eased some restrictions on a pill used to terminate early pregnancies, allowing the drug to be sent by mail rather than requiring it to be dispensed in person.
The decision by the Food and Drug Administration comes as the right to obtain an abortion, established in the 1973 Supreme Court ruling Roe v. Wade, hangs in the balance.
The medication, generically known as mifepristone, is approved for use up to 10 weeks of pregnancy and is also sometimes prescribed to treat women who are having miscarriages. 
""The FDA’s decision will come as a tremendous relief for countless abortion and miscarriage patients,"" said Georgeanne Usova, senior legislative counsel at the ACLU. 
The restrictions on the pill had been in place since the FDA approved the drug in 2000 and were lifted temporarily by the government earlier this year due to the pandemic. That enabled women to consult healthcare providers by telemedicine and receive the pills by mail. The FDA's decision makes that temporary change permanent. 
As a result of the FDA rule change, many patients will not need to go to a clinic, medical office or hospital in person to receive the medication, but can opt to receive the pill through the mail from a certified prescriber or pharmacy.
The decision will increase access to medication abortion for women in remote and rural areas without providers nearby. 
Low-income women who face obstacles reaching clinics such as lack of transportation and inability to take time off work will also gain greater access to the drug.
However, 19 states including Texas have laws that supersede the FDA decision by barring telehealth consultations or mailing of abortion pills. Women in those states would not be able to make use of the rule change at home but could potentially travel to other states to obtain medication abortion. 
States such as California and New York that have sought to strengthen access to abortion may make the drug available to women from other states. 
The change is likely to add to the intense U.S. political debate over abortion. Conservative Supreme Court justices indicated https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-consider-rolling-back-abortion-rights-2021-12-01 in Dec. 1 oral arguments over an abortion ban in Mississippi at 15-weeks of pregnancy that they are open to either gutting Roe or overturning it entirely. A decision is due by the end of June.
The Charlotte Lozier Institute and Susan B. Anthony List, which advocate against abortion, said in a statement that the FDA decision ignored data on complications and put women at risk. 
The groups called on the FDA to restore the in-person dispensing requirement and add restrictions.
FDA records show that of the 3.7 million women who took Mifeprex, the branded version of the drug, to terminate a pregnancy between September 2000 and December 2018, 24 died from complications.
SOME RESTRICTIONS REMAIN 
The FDA left in place some restrictions, such as the need to use a certified pharmacy and requiring the prescribers to be certified. The ACLU said it was ""disappointing that the FDA fell short of repealing all of its medically unnecessary restrictions on mifepristone and these remaining obstacles should also be lifted.”  
The organization sued the U.S. government on behalf of a
Hawaii doctor and several professional health care associations in 2017 challenging the restrictions that it said limited access to medication abortion.

Medication abortion involves two drugs, taken over a day or two. The first, mifepristone, blocks the pregnancy-sustaining hormone progesterone. The second, misoprostol, induces uterine contractions.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Shares in Mexican airline Grupo Aeromexico fell 27% in early afternoon trading on Friday following a temporary suspension earlier in the session due to a sharp drop in the stock triggered a day earlier.
The stock plunged on Thursday after the carrier, which has been under a Chapter 11 restructuring process in the United States since last year, announced that a third party would make an offer for its stock and valued its shares at a fraction of their previous price at 0.01 Mexican cent apiece. 
In a midday release following its suspension from the bourse, Aeromexico said it had informed investors ""of the imminent dilution of the current shareholders"" because of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, in which debt holders like Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc will end up with most of its stock.

The company, which produces about 7.2 million hogs a year, ""will no longer sell certain whole pork products into California due to California's Proposition 12,"" spokesman David Eaheart said. 
The measure, approved by voters in November 2018, is slated to take effect Jan. 1. 
Supporters say it will make food production more humane by setting minimum space requirements for calves raised for veal, breeding pigs and egg-laying hens. It also forbids the sale of raw veal, pork or eggs from animals enclosed in too little space.
Opponents in the U.S. meat industry argue that enforcement will hurt producers and consumers by increasing food costs, and violate the U.S. Constitution's Commerce Clause by requiring out-of-state producers to comply or face the sales ban.

California represents about 15% of the U.S. pork market, according to the trade group the National Pork Producers Council. The meat industry estimates it would cost pork producers billions of dollars to convert barns to meet Proposition 12 standards, the council said.
 Hormel Foods Corp  (NYSE:HRL) said it is preparing to fully comply with the law.

Tesla investor David Wagner called for access to internal documents to investigate whether Tesla and Musk violated an agreement with the U.S. securities regulator and its board members failed to adhere to their fiduciary duties. 
In 2018, Musk settled a lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission over his tweet on taking the company private, agreeing to have the company’s lawyers pre-approve tweets with material information about the company.
Tesla shares, which had hovered near record-highs, lost their value by about a quarter after Musk said on Nov. 6 he would sell 10% of his stake if Twitter users agreed. He has since sold nearly $14 billion worth of shares so far.

The lawsuit, filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery on Thursday, seeks to obtain records and books related to his tweets, including documents to identify whether the stock sales tweets were reviewed or pre-approved in advance.
In March, another shareholder sued Musk and its board in March, accusing him of violating his 2018 settlement with the SEC and exposing shareholders to billions of dollars of losses.

(Reuters) - U.S. cannabis firm  Acreage  Holdings (OTC:ACRGF) Inc said on Thursday it had secured a $100 million credit line from cannabis REIT AFC Gamma Inc and Viridescent Realty Trust, indicating growing investor optimism in a sector still underfinanced by traditional lenders.
Expectations of policy changes including federal decriminalization have raised prospects for the U.S. cannabis industry, which analysts have estimated is currently worth $24 billion in annual sales and could triple in size over the next decade.
AFC Gamma has committed $60 million under the senior secured credit facility, with $10 million syndicated to an affiliate and the remaining $30 million committed by Viridescent. 
The credit line also includes an option for a further $50 million once certain milestones are achieved, AFC Gamma added. 
""We believe Acreage is well positioned in high-growth, limited license markets such as New York, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania, amongst others,"" Leonard Tannenbaum, AFC Gamma's chief executive officer, said.
Acreage said it intends to use proceeds from the new credit facility to repay existing debt, fund expansion initiatives and provide additional working capital. Its total debt as of Sept. 30 stood at $142.6 million.

The facility will bear interest at 9.75% per annum, payable monthly in arrears, with a maturity date of Jan. 1, 2026.

(Reuters) - A federal judge's decision to unravel a settlement shielding members of the Sackler family from future opioid litigation could upend a controversial corner of U.S. bankruptcy law: protecting third parties who have not filed for Chapter 11 themselves. 
In a written opinion late Thursday, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon said federal law did ""not authorize"" so-called nondebtor releases granted in September to Sackler family members in the court restructuring of their company, OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP. 
Whether such releases are allowed represented the ""great unsettled question"" of the case, which had split federal appeals courts for decades, McMahon said.
Companies or individuals filing for bankruptcy are entitled to protections against creditors, including plaintiffs suing them, while they attempt to reorganize. 
Judges increasingly over the years have shielded nondebtors with releases when approving a reorganization plan, especially when those third parties contribute money to the restructuring.
Indeed, absent releases, the Sacklers threatened to withdraw their $4.5 billion contribution to Purdue's reorganization -- a settlement aimed at resolving thousands of opioid lawsuits by steering money to U.S. communities reeling from the epidemic.
""This, if it stands, will completely upend Chapter 11 practice,"" said Lindsey Simon, an assistant law professor at the University of Georgia's law school. ""It effectively takes nondebtor releases off the table."" 
Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, among those who had objected to Purdue's reorganization, said on Thursday he was prepared to eventually take his argument to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Purdue late Thursday said it would appeal McMahon's ruling. On Friday, the company said nondebtor releases have ""long been allowed under the law in most jurisdictions ... because they have long played a critical role in the successful resolution of mass tort bankruptcies in the United States.""
Sackler representatives declined to comment or did not immediately respond to a request. 
Such releases, or the potential for their use, have sparked controversy not only in the Purdue case, but bankruptcy proceedings arising from litigation over sexual abuse involving the Boy Scouts and former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. 
Members of the bankruptcy bar who favor the releases contend they facilitate complex settlements, encouraging otherwise reluctant third parties to contribute funds toward reorganizations that rehabilitate businesses or resolve widespread litigation. 
Critics argue the releases allow rich and powerful companies, directors, executives and investors to latch onto a bankruptcy case and extinguish their legal liability without subjecting themselves to their own Chapter 11 filing. 
Congress designed bankruptcy filings for debtors facing crushing liabilities, not defendants seeking an end run around trial courts and juries, according to some legal experts. 
In October, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Inc created a company to shoulder liabilities from 38,000 lawsuits alleging talc in its iconic Baby Powder contained asbestos and caused cancer. The subsidiary then filed for bankruptcy. 
In what is often a precursor to third parties obtaining nondebtor releases, a judge granted an injunction halting litigation not only against the company under bankruptcy protection but also J&J, which did not file for Chapter 11. 
J&J maintains its consumer talc products are safe and confirmed through thousands of tests to be asbestos-free.
Federal appeals courts over the years have issued conflicting decisions on whether such releases are allowed, with extra attention paid to whether they are being granted without permission from creditors. 
McMahon, in her decision overturning Purdue's bankruptcy plan, lamented a 2005 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals opinion that urged nondebtor releases be granted sparingly in unique cases because they are ripe for abuse. 
""This will no longer do,"" McMahon said, noting the appeals court questioned whether bankruptcy law allows the releases. ""Either statutory authority exists or it does not."" She said the Bankruptcy Code only allows nondebtor releases over creditor objections in cases arising from asbestos exposure.
In 1994, Congress authorized nondebtor releases specifically to help companies faced with monumental asbestos liabilities. Under the law, insurers would contribute to a trust to pay claims from people dying of mesothelioma and other asbestos-related illnesses. 
In return, those insurers received nondebtor releases to prevent asbestos victims from turning around and suing them after collecting from the trust. 
In her ruling, McMahon said Congress never authorized the release mechanism beyond that circumstance.
More than 95% of Purdue's 120,000-plus voting creditors approved the company's reorganization, including 43 states and territories, the company has said. 
Those objecting to Purdue's plan included eight states, and more than 2,600 personal injury claimants, McMahon said. The U.S. Justice Department's bankruptcy watchdog and the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan also objected.
Democratic lawmakers have introduced legislation that would all but ban nondebtor releases, and further restrict the ability of third parties to have litigation against them halted while a debtor's bankruptcy is pending. 

""The Sacklers must not be permitted to evade accountability by abusing our bankruptcy system, and I applaud the District Court for recognizing what I've long believed -- that nonconsensual third-party releases are not only immoral and unjust, but also illegal,"" House Oversight Chairwoman Caroyln Maloney, among the legislation's backers, said in a statement late Thursday. 
U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland late Thursday also applauded McMahon's decision to overturn the Purdue plan.

812,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2021 02:28PM ET</span>","Pfizer says pandemic could extend through 2023, studies three-dose vaccine course for children","By Clara-Laeila Laudette and Conor Humphries
MADRID/DUBLIN (Reuters) -Pfizer Inc said on Friday the COVID-19 pandemic could extend through next year and announced plans to develop a three-dose vaccine regimen for children ages 2 to 16, a move that could delay its authorisation. 
The U.S. pharmaceutical company made its comments as European countries geared up for further travel and social restrictions and a study warned that the rapidly spreading Omicron coronavirus variant was five times more likely to reinfect people than its predecessor, Delta.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) executives said the company believed that by 2024, the disease should be endemic around the globe, meaning it would no longer be a pandemic. The company projected that ""COVID will transition to an endemic state potentially by 2024."" 
Prior to the Omicron variant, top U.S. disease doctor Anthony Fauci forecast the pandemic would end in 2022 in the United States.
Announcing plans to develop a three-dose regimen for ages 2 to 16, Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten told a conference call that results of three doses among people older than 16 showed that approach offered greater protection. 
""Therefore, we have decided to modify each of the pediatric studies to incorporate a third dose to the series and seek licensure for a three-dose series rather than a two-dose series as originally anticipated,"" the company said. 
Pfizer developed its COVID-19 vaccine with Germany's BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). The companies have been developing a version of their vaccine tailored to combat the Omicron variant, but have not decided whether it will be needed. They expect to start a clinical trial for the updated vaccine in January, the Pfizer executives said.
The risk of reinfection with the Omicron variant is 5.4 times higher https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/omicron-five-times-more-likely-reinfect-than-delta-study-says-2021-12-17 and it shows no sign of being milder than the Delta variant, a study by Imperial College London found, as cases soar across Europe and threaten year-end festivities. 
Past infection may offer as little as 19% protection against reinfection by the new variant, Imperial College said, noting that the study of hundreds of thousands of cases, including 1,846 confirmed as Omicron, had not been peer reviewed. 
MOVES TOWARDS MORE RESTRICTIONS 
The new findings may add urgency to countries' efforts to speed up vaccination booster campaigns to try to diminish the burden on hospitals and health systems. So far, a spike in infections in Britain and elsewhere in Europe has not led to a big jump in hospitalizations or deaths.
Uncertainty about the impact Omicron's quickfire spread will have on a global economic recovery was reflected in diverging paths taken by major central banks this week.
The Bank of Japan maintained its ultra-loose monetary policy on Friday, although it dialed-back emergency pandemic funding.
Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and Denmark were all moving toward further travel restrictions, following the footsteps of France, which closed its borders this week to most non-resident Britons.
Switzerland will from Monday until Jan. 24 expand the requirement to show proof of vaccination or recovery from the coronavirus in order to access indoor venues like restaurants, while discos and bars will require a negative test result.
With the new variant accounting for a fifth of daily cases, the Danish government proposed closing theatres, cinemas, entertainment parks and conference centres, as well as limiting large crowds in stores and shops just seven days before Christmas Eve.
""In record time, the rules of the game have again been changed,"" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters. ""This is not a complete closure of the society, as we saw last winter. Our aim is still to keep as much of society open as possible.""
Denmark logged almost 3,000 Omicron infections in the 24 hours to Thursday evening - doubling the previous day's count - while overall daily infections broke another record. Denmark's parliament must approve the proposed restrictions before they can be implemented.
Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said that in the face of a ""cruel virus,"" his government had no choice but to consider unpopular measures including early closing times for bars and restaurants. 
Under rules that could be announced later on Friday, travellers to Germany from Britain would be required to quarantine for two weeks, a German Health Ministry spokesperson said.
RISING DEATH TOLL
Since the coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China almost two years ago, more than 5 million people have died of COVID-19 globally and more than 272 million cases have been reported.
More than 8.5 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered worldwide - an effort now complicated by Omicron's emergence.

The variant has driven infections in Britain close to peak levels seen in early 2021, although hospitalisations and deaths remain much lower. European countries and the United States have also seen infections spike in December. 
European Union governments have agreed to order over 180 million doses of the adapted version of the vaccine being developed by BioNTech and Pfizer, the head of the EU executive body, the European Commission, said.

(Reuters) - Families and friends of six workers who died after a tornado tore into an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse expressed sadness and anger as they said final farewells to the victims in a series of vigils Friday.
On Dec. 10, a barrage of tornadoes ripped through six U.S. states, leaving a trail of death and destruction at homes and businesses stretching more than 200 miles (322 km). 
The six workers in an Amazon delivery station were among those who died. The site received tornado warnings between 8:06 p.m. and 8:16 p.m. before the tornado struck the building at 8:27 p.m., according to Amazon. 
Amazon managers had directed workers to shelter in bathrooms after receiving emergency alerts on mobile phones from authorities, several employees previously told Reuters. At least one worker died while sheltering in the bathroom, his co-worker said.
Paige Marquis, friend and former roommate of Clayton Lynn Cope, one of the workers who perished, said, “They all want to blame the building. But what about the response inside? They shouldn’t have had to keep working when they knew the storm was coming.""
One Amazon employee who asked not to be identified said lots of workers are confused and angry. She told Reuters that all the dead were contractors and not Amazon employees.
Amazon previously said employees had been directed to shelter in place at a designated assembly area at the front of the building, which was near a restroom.

A dogwood tree was planted outside a municipal building in remembrance of the victims. ""We're a tight knit community,"" Edwardsville Mayor Art Risavy said Friday. ""It will take time to heal.”
The National Weather Service said the tornado hit the area between 8:28 and 8:32 p.m. central time, intensifying rapidly as it struck the Amazon warehouse.

817,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2021 01:36PM ET</span>",Canada's vaccine mandate for foreign crews a headache for European airlines,"By Allison Lampert and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - European airlines are walking an increasingly fine line to meet both foreign inoculation and local privacy requirements, as more countries require flight crews to be vaccinated against COVID-19, carriers say. 
Canada is slated on Jan. 15 to end an exemption that allowed entry of unvaccinated foreign flight crews, joining others that have vaccine mandates for pilots and passengers alike. 
That's creating a logistical headache for European carriers, who are unable to ask for their employees' vaccination status since they are bound to strict data protection laws in Europe, a spokesperson for the trade group Airlines For Europe (A4E) said.
""Carriers will need to find workarounds in order to comply with the Canadian entry requirement,"" A4E spokesperson Jennifer Janzen said by email.
U.S. carriers like United Airlines require their cabin crew to be fully vaccinated, while rivals like American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) have delayed the effective date of vaccine mandates until 2022 for employees. 
Airlines, which have suffered steep losses due to COVID-19 travel restrictions and bans, are blaming a patchwork of shifting rules for increased red-tape and depressed demand for international travel.
Airlines expect to see more inoculation mandates for crew as the fast-spreading Omicron variant forces governments to tighten border restrictions.
""We now see that more and more countries are mandating or considering immunization of flight crews,"" said KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in a statement.
The carrier identified intercontinental flights to about 10 destinations where crew are currently not exempt from vaccine requirements. 
As more countries demand proof of inoculation from everyone on planes, international flights will no longer be practical without vaccinated crews, said a spokesperson for Germany's Lufthansa AG (DE:LHAG) which can't obligate its personnel to be vaccinated against COVID-19.
Canada, which implored residents on Wednesday not to leave the country due to Omicron, is expected to announce on Friday that it will again require people returning from short foreign trips to submit a negative COVID-19 test.
Still, some countries give foreign flight crews a pass from vaccination rules aimed at international travelers, as recommended by the U.N.'s aviation agency.
International flight crews are exempted from U.S. requirements that all non-U.S. citizens travelling from abroad be vaccinated. 
Transport Canada said in a statement it is working closely ""with public health officials on the vaccination requirements impacting international aircrew."" 

Since KLM does not require crew members to be inoculated or share their vaccination status, employees must instead seek a generalized ""travel restriction"" so they are not scheduled to fly to a destination with entry requirements they cannot meet, the carrier said. 
""Managers do not gain insight into the reason for the restriction,"" the airline said in the emailed statement. ""Only in this way we can continue to fill in the rosters properly and keep our operation feasible.""

VILNIUS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - China is pressuring German car parts giant Continental to stop using components made in Lithuania, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, amid a dispute between Beijing and the Baltic state over the status of Taiwan.
The targeting of Continental is an example of how the China-Lithuania diplomatic spat is spilling over into business in an era of global supply chains and affecting Germany's car industry, a lucrative pillar of Europe's biggest economy.
The Chinese government, which views self-ruled Taiwan as its territory, downgraded https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-downgrades-its-diplomatic-ties-with-lithuania-over-taiwan-issue-2021-11-21 diplomatic ties with Lithuania last month after the opening of a representative office by Taiwan in Vilnius. Lithuania's ruling coalition had also agreed last year https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lithuania-china-idUSKBN27P1PQ to support what it described as ""those fighting for freedom"" on the island.
Continental, one of the world's largest car parts maker, has production facilities in Lithuania, making electronic parts such as controllers for vehicle doors and seats, and exports to clients globally including China. 
German industry sources said the pressure was not only being felt by Continental but up to a dozen companies, mainly from the automotive and agricultural sectors, they said.
Continental, which supplies all of Germany's big automakers, declined to comment on whether it had been asked by the Chinese government to cut links with Lithuania.
China's foreign ministry denied that Beijing had pressured multinational companies not to use Lithuanian-produced parts though said its companies no longer trusted Lithuania. 
""The practice of 'one China, one Taiwan' grossly interferes in China's internal affairs and seriously violates China's core interests,"" a spokesperson added.
""I heard that many Chinese companies no longer regard Lithuania as a trustworthy partner,"" the spokesperson said. ""Lithuania has to look at itself for the reason why Lithuanian companies are facing difficulties in trade and economic cooperation in China."" 
China has pressured countries to downgrade or sever their relations with democratically governed Taiwan. Earlier this month, a senior official and an industry body said China had told multinationals to sever ties https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-lithuania-braces-china-led-corporate-boycott-2021-12-09 with Lithuania or face being shut out of the Chinese market.
Lithuania's direct trade with China is modest, but its export-based economy is home to hundreds of companies that make products such as furniture, lasers, food and clothing for multinationals that sell to China.

Lithuania's foreign office said: ""Companies operating in Lithuania have successfully integrated themselves into international supply chains, so China's economic pressure measures may cause various disruptions to companies operating in Lithuania.""
""We closely monitor, analyse and evaluate each such case, including among these German companies,"" said the spokesperson, adding that it was ""looking for long-term sustainable solutions and ways to resume trade flows with China"".

With the agreement, the world's largest luxury group and owner of the Louis Vuitton and Dior fashion houses, avoids a public trial that could have aired details of work undertaken by former domestic intelligence services head Bernard Squarcini.
Squarcini, who was hired by the luxury goods giant in 2013 is supected of drawing on his influence to collect classified information and notably of spying on activist journalist Francois Ruffin, according to court documents.
In 2016, Ruffin produced a documentary film called ""Merci Patron"" that put the spotlight on LVMH boss Bernard Arnault, following a family that lost their jobs at a supplier to the group. 
The former intelligence chief, who served as a consultant for the luxury group for several years, is under investigation for influence peddling, illegally collecting information on private individuals and violating privacy laws. 
A lawyer for Squarcini, who has previously denied any wrongdoing, declined to comment on Friday.
The Paris public prosecutor's office said the agreement was ""an efficient means of sanctioning acts prohibited under penal law,"" that were proven by the company to have ceased. 
LVMH's acceptance of the agreement does not imply admission of guilt or a judgement against the company, said Caroline Viguier, a judge at the the Paris court Friday.

The settlement reflects acknowledgement of ""past shortcomings, that belong to the past,"" said LVMH lawyer Jacqueline Laffont, speaking in a hearing before the decision was announced.

The Nasdaq-listed Chinese firms are two of the biggest players in the sector and a ban would block millions of retail investors in mainland China from trading securities easily in markets such as the United States and Hong Kong. Concerns over data security and capital outflows are driving the potential ban, sources said. 
The looming restrictions come on the heels of a clampdown that has affected a broad scope of companies over the past year, in sectors ranging from technology to education and real estate.
Firms affected by the latest crackdown are likely to be notified of a ban in ""the coming months"", said one of four sources who spoke with Reuters. All sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media.
Futu and UP Fintech are both registered with the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong but that permit does not extend to the mainland. No mainland licence exists for online brokerages specialising in cross-border trades, the sources said.
Futu, a $5.5 billion company by market value, said in a statement to Reuters it had been communicating with Chinese authorities but had not received any formal orders along the lines of those suggested by Reuters reporting. It added that it was operating normally.
It flagged in a prospectus for a follow-on share offering in April that its business could be affected by a change in stance on the part of authorities who have wide discretion in interpreting regulations.
UP Fintech, which is valued at $737 million, said it had been following rules laid out by global regulators and would comply with and implement any new rules.
Shares of Futu were recently 1.5% higher while UP Fintech's were down around 2%. Both companies' shares had fallen in Friday's premarket trading, after the Reuters report.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) and the central bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Chinese authorities raised concern about ""cross-border"" brokerages in October, exacerbating declines in shares in both firms which have plunged more than 80% since this year's peak in February.
FRUITLESS LOBBYING
Authorities have been clamping down on a wide range of sectors over the past year and data security has emerged as a key concern https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/exclusive-fretting-about-data-security-chinas-government-expands-its-use-golden-2021-12-15.
In October, the official People's Daily warned that the vast amounts of information collected by these brokerages was at risk if data were to be required by authorities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Authorities are also concerned about capital outflows and are worried that the firms' rapidly growing businesses could run afoul of China's agenda on foreign exchange control, three of the sources said.
Futu executives have been lobbying authorities including the CSRC, SAFE and the central bank but have yet to receive any positive feedback, according to two sources. 
A ban would affect a big chunk of business at firms like Futu, the two sources said. About 40% of Futu's clients have opened their trading accounts with Chinese ID cards, said one of them. Most other accounts have been opened by those with U.S., Singapore and Hong Kong IDs.
Backed by gaming and social media giant Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), Futu had 2.6 million clients as of end-September who had opened one or more trading accounts.
Futu's trading turnover rose to HK$1.4 trillion ($179 billion) in the July-September quarter from HK$1.01 trillion in the same period a year ago, with trade in U.S. and Hong Kong stocks accounting for more than 90% of that.

Individuals can still open new accounts on Futu with mainland ID cards, but the company now insists those clients have overseas bank accounts, according to one source. 
Apart from services offered by brokerages like Futu and UP Fintech, mainland investors can only invest in securities outside China through so-called qualified domestic institutional investor (QDII) schemes as well as connect schemes that link the Hong Kong and mainland stock markets. Both schemes are tightly regulated.

Investing.com — Shares of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) fell more than 7% just after midday Friday after it revealed it won't be able to meet U.S. demand for Wegovy in the first half of 2022. 
Wegvoy is a prescription medicine used for adults with weight-related medical problems to help them lose weight and keep the weight off. 
Novo Nordisk explained the supply issue was due to a contract manufacturer filling syringes for Wegovy pens temporarily stopping deliveries and making product following issues with good manufacturing practices.
As a result, ""few new patients are expected to be able to initiate treatment.""
Novo will prioritize patients who have already started treatment with Wegovy in the first half of the year, although it expects to meet demand in the U.S in the second half of 2022.
The company concluded that the supply challenges will not affect the previously announced financial outlook for 2021."

The bank said on Dec. 8 that Horta-Osorio broke the rules during a November trip to Switzerland when he left the country earlier than a 10-day quarantine period allowed.
Horta-Osorio apologised and said he regretted the mistake and would report himself to the relevant authorities. On Friday, a spokesperson for the Public Prosecutors Office of St Gallen said it had received a submission about the incident.
""The proceedings are pending,"" the spokesperson said, adding no further information could be provided.
A representative for Horta-Osorio declined to comment. 
Credit Suisse has said he entered Switzerland on Nov 28 and left on Dec 1 when a 10-day quarantine was required. Switzerland's banking regulator has said it is also in touch with the bank over the matter.

The incident comes after the Portuguese banker has said stamping out bad and reckless behaviour at the scandal-hit bank was his priority. Swiss media have honed in on the affair as damaging his ability to reform the bank's culture.

However, while the performance has been disappointing, it has contributed to the worst sentiment readings we've seen in years for gold miners, and it has left their valuations at their most attractive levels in several years. Meanwhile, though the GDX remains in an intermediate downtrend and a deep correction, we've seen no real damage to the long-term technical picture.

Furthermore, U.S. implied petroleum products demand recently rose to a record high, and uncertainties related to the Fed’s monetary policies were removed. All this bodes well for Southwestern Energy (SWN) and  PDC Energy  (NASDAQ:PDCE). But which of these stocks is a better choice now? Read more to learn more.Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE:SWN) is a Houston, Tex.-based independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, oil, and natural gas liquids (NGLs). The company focuses on developing unconventional natural gas and oil reservoirs in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. Denver, Colo.-based PDC Energy, Inc. (PDCE) is also an independent exploration and production company that acquires, explores for, develops, and produces crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.
Oil and gas prices rose to multi-year highs this year, driven by solid demand amid supply cuts. As of December 15, gasoline prices had risen 58.1% over the last year, their largest increase since April 1980. In addition, fuel oil prices increased 59.3%, while natural gas prices rose 25.1% over the past year.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. implied petroleum products demand rose to a record 23.191 million bpd for the week ending December 10.

Given the upbeat backdrop, we think oil and gas companies PDCE and SWN should benefit. Over the past nine months, PDCE’s stock has gained 22.8% in price, while SWN has returned 5.1%. In terms of their past year’s performance, PDCE is the winner with 139.3% gains versus SWN’s 48.2%. Also, PDCE’s 125.8% gains year-to-date compare with SWN’s 52.7% returns.

Earlier this month, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd restructured its e-commerce business into separate China and international divisions, with the latter to be led by Jiang Fan, head of Alibaba's flagship Taobao and Tmall marketplaces [L4N2SR04E]
Alibaba Deputy CFO Toby Xu, making his first major public remarks since being named this month to take over as CFO, said that international e-commerce ""will become one of the key growth drivers"", adding that 57% of revenue for Cainiao, Alibaba's logistics unit, comes from overseas.
Earlier in the two-day investor event, Alibaba said it had set a target of $100 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) for Lazada, its e-commerce service for Southeast Asia.
Lazada generated $21 billion in GMV from September 2020 to the same month in 2021, the presentation showed. [L4N2T21EI]
Outgoing CFO Maggie Wu said that Alibaba would include international commerce under Alibaba's larger ""Core Commerce"" financial segment in earnings, alongside commerce from its domestic facing marketplaces.
Local consumer services, which includes delivery and mapping services, and Cainiao will also fall within this category.
There was also a nod to social welfare, with four of seven investment categories outlined by Xu related to initiatives such as rural revitalization and China's ageing population.
CEO Daniel Zhang, meanwhile, pledged to slash emissions from Alibaba's supply chains and transportation networks by 50% by the end of the decade. [L4N2T21UC]
Missing from the presentation was any mention of Ant Group, the financial services firm that is 33% owned by Alibaba.
Last year, Beijing intervened at the last minute to abort a planned $37 billion listing of Ant. Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma subsequently slipped from the public spotlight and Chinese authorities began a year-long regulatory clampdown.

In November, Alibaba slashed its annual revenue forecast for its current fiscal year, from an initial growth target of 29.5% to between 20% and 23%.
The company has been facing stiff competition from rivals including  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc, which has won over consumers in rural China, and ByteDance-owned Douyin, which has grown in China's booming livestreamed e-commerce sector.

831,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2021 12:18PM ET</span>","U.S. regulators flag climate change, stablecoins as potential systemic risks","By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Climate change, the rapid growth of ""stablecoins"" and financial innovations that led to frenzied trading of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) shares early this year are threats to the U.S. financial system that merit closer scrutiny, a Treasury Department-led regulatory panel said on Friday.
In its annual report, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) added that while the U.S. economy has improved since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, risks to the financial system are higher than prior to the health crisis, with the outlook for global growth still uncertain.
The report marked the first time the body, which was created in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis to spot looming threats, has flagged climate change as a major risk, reflecting President Joe Biden's push to address rising global temperatures. 
The FSOC, which comprises the Treasury and other financial regulators, said the physical risks posed by more frequent severe weather events and government policies transitioning away from carbon-heavy industry could dent asset values and weaken institutions, it wrote, echoing an October FSOC paper.
""If these changes occur in a disorderly way owing to substantial delays in action or abrupt changes in policy, their impact is likely to be more sudden and disruptive,"" the FSOC said.
Similarly, the body reiterated concerns flagged in November that stablecoins, a fast-growing type of digital asset pegged to traditional currencies, could become a threat if widely adopted. 
While that market is currently only worth about $127 billion, its market value has ballooned more than 500% over the past 12 months and may be vulnerable to runs if investors lose confidence in the asset class's reliability, the FSOC said.
The body also noted a surge of volatility earlier this year sparked by retail investors, who coordinated on social media and used zero-commission trading apps to fuel sharp rises in a handful of stocks, including videogame maker GameStop. 

The episode suggested financial innovations and social media are changing market participation, raising the risk of sudden asset price movements unrelated to fundamental news.
That ""could represent a vulnerability if they lead to cascading impacts by causing asset liquidations or putting stress on financial institutions,"" the FSOC wrote.

The health crisis had fuelled rapid growth at DiaSorin's molecular division, which in 2020 accounted for 29% of sales.
But the company said on Thursday that 2022 revenue is expected to fall 2% from the previous year, with COVID-19 revenue decreasing to about 150 million euros ($169.9 million) from about 370 million euros in 2021. 
Shares in DiaSorin fell as much as 13.6% on Friday to hit their lowest since late June as forecasts fell short of analysts' expectations. 
Presenting its business plan to 2025, the company said its estimates were conservative and that it could do better than forecast.
""We have given forecasts for 2022 with visibility limited to the first quarter, nobody knows what is going to happen with COVID, its variants and vaccines,"" CEO Carlo Rosa told analysts during a presentation. 
The company projected an adjusted core earnings margin - a measure of operating profit as a percentage of revenue - of about 35% for 2022 and 38% for 2025, compared with about 43% forecast for 2021.
""We see the 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin as significantly lower than our current forecast (40%)"", Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) analysts said in a note.
In a bid to boost its molecular business and offset a potential drop in demand for COVID-19 tests, DiaSorin agreed to buy U.S. rival Luminex (NASDAQ:LMNX) Corp for $1.8 billion earlier this year.
On Thursday it forecast cost and revenue synergies from the integration of about $90 million in 2025.
""Based on the 2025 outlined financial targets, we have the impression that the Luminex integration could turn out to be slower than previously expected,"" Intesa Sanpaolo analysts said. 
Italy's pandemic situation was on the mend, but with the new Omicron variant spreading rapidly worldwide, the country has extended a COVID-19 state of emergency and again tightened measures to limit contagion.
Without the COVID contribution, DiaSorin forecast revenue growth of about 24% for 2022 and year-over-year growth of 10% for 2022 to 2025. 

The company also said it would launch three new molecular diagnostics platforms.

(Reuters) - Several companies, including Grab Holdings and BuzzFeed, that merged with shell entities to go public have seen their shares tumble, as investors pull the rug out from under the stocks hyped in Wall Street's frenzied blank-check deals this year.
Shares of BuzzFeed, which merged with blank-check firm 890 5th Avenue Partners, have plunged 40% since their debut on Dec. 6. The digital media firm raised a paltry $16 million out of $288 million in the SPAC's trust as 94% of its investors took their money back.
Grab Holdings, southeast Asia's biggest ride-hailing and delivery firm, has lost half its market capitalization since its Nasdaq debut on Dec. 2 following the company's record $40 billion merger with a blank-check firm.
""A lot of investors are now looking more toward companies that have proven track records, that have demonstrated history of delivering profit,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. ""The frenzy that has been driving some of the momentum in SPACs that we saw earlier in the year has clearly gone away.""
Special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC) are shell companies that raise money in an initial public offering (IPO) and put it in a trust for the purpose of merging with a private company and taking it public.
Since investors are unaware of the target company ahead of the IPO, SPACs often grant them the right to redeem their initial investment as an incentive to put their money in the trust.
The average redemption rate has more than doubled to 58% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, data from Dealogic showed, as many companies fall short of investors' lofty expectations. 
In the case of Zoom Video Communications-backed event management software company Cvent, nearly 85% of investors redeemed their shares for cash two days before its debut, its filing showed.
Vacation rental management company Vacasa received gross proceeds of about $340 million from its debut on Dec. 8, $145 million below its expectations due to redemption.
""SPACS got crazy in February and investors started looking at them like meme stocks. Then Lucid crashed and the SEC starting issuing negative comments and SPACs fell out of favor,"" said Matthew Tuttle, chief executive officer of Tuttle Capital Management LLC. 
U.S. regulators said last week they were considering toughening rules around how underwriters, boards of directors and sponsors of SPAC structure fees, issue projections and disclose conflicts.
SPACs are among the group that have seen a decline in retail investor participation, according to Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research
The De-SPAC index, which tracks the 25 largest companies to have completed a blank-check merger, is down around 43% so far this year after touching a record high in mid-February. 

Still, merging with blank-check firms remains a popular option, with 2021 being a record-breaking year as 604 SPACs raised $144 billion, Renaissance Capital disclosed in its annual review. However, 62% of the entire year's proceeds were raised in just the first quarter. 
Grab, BuzzFeed, Vacasa and Cvent were not immediately available for comment.

Therefore, Wall Street analysts expect solar stocks ReneSola (SOL), SPI Energy (SPI), and I Sun (ISUN) to more than double in price over the next 12 months. Read on to learn more.According to a recent Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) report, the solar industry surpassed three million solar installations in 2021 and the residential solar market increased 21% year-over-year. Although supply chain constraints and rising raw material costs have negatively affected installations, the year-over-year increase in utility prices has supported the sector’s growth.
Furthermore, with the introduction of the federal solar investment tax credit (ITC), which provides a 26% tax credit for systems installed in 2020-2022, more homeowners and commercial sectors have been installing solar panels. The global solar energy market is projected to reach $223.3 billion by 2026, achieving a 20.5% CAGR.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be worth adding solar stocks ReneSola Ltd (SOL), SPI Energy Co., Ltd. (SPI), and iSun, Inc. (ISUN) to one’s watchlist. Wall Street analysts expect them to more than double in price over the next 12 months.

Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on quality lumber-related stocks  Weyerhaeuser  (WY), UFP Industries (UFPI), and Boise Cascade (NYSE:BCC). Read on.Lumber prices fell from $1,515 per thousand board feet in May 2021 to $389 per thousand in August 2021. However, a demand-supply imbalance has caused lumber prices to rebound. According to a Bloomberg report, lumber futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange surged 4.4% to a six-month high of $1,069.30 per 1,000 board feet on December 10.
According to the Commerce Department data, housing starts increased 11.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.679 million units last month, the highest rate since March. So, the demand for lumber is expected to increase amid a surge in homebuilding. However, a bad wildfire season in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and British Columbia, and Western Canadian flooding, continues to impact lumber supply. So, lumber prices could continue their ascent. According to Richard Fung, a custom home builder with Forever Homes, “Lumber prices are expected to rise in the next year, and if this fluctuation of high prices continues, the price will have tripled by 2025.”
Therefore, we think it could be wise to scoop up the shares of fundamentally sound lumber-related stocks Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY), UFP Industries, Inc. (UFPI), and Boise Cascade Company (BCC). They are well-positioned to take advantage of the rising lumber prices.

However, Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York, stated, “There's a real good chance that a lot of the things that have caused turbulence in both November and much of December are now in the rear-view mirror, and markets might now be able to glide higher.” This outlook indicates an eventual recovery by the teach-heavy indices.
In addition, experts expect the tech market to withstand initial losses caused by a high-interest-rate environment. This may be due to the continuing hybrid work culture amid concerns surrounding the COVID-10 omicron variant. Continuing digital transformation should also support the industry’s growth. Investor interest in the industry is evidenced by the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLK) 7% gains over the past three months versus SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 4.3% returns.
Therefore, we think it could be wise to scoop up shares of quality tech stocks SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (SSNC), Avnet, Inc. (AVT), and Himax Technologies, Inc. (HIMX), which are expected to rally in the near term. They are A (Strong Buy) or B (Buy) rated in our POWR Ratings system.

LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC has been fined 64 million pounds ($85 million) by British regulators for failings in its anti-money laundering processes spanning eight years.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it had found that three key parts of HSBC's transaction monitoring systems in Britain showed serious weaknesses over a period from March 31, 2010 to March 31, 2018.
The fine comes amid a renewed crackdown by the regulator on money laundering failures. 
On Monday, HSBC's domestic rival NatWest was fined 265 million pounds by a British court for failing to prevent the laundering of nearly 400 million pounds, some of it deposited at a branch in bin bags.
The FCA said HSBC had made a string of failings, including inadequate monitoring of money laundering and terrorist financing scenarios until 2014, and poor risk assessment of ""new scenarios"" after 2016.
The bank was also found to have had inappropriate testing and did not check the accuracy and completeness of data in monitoring systems.
Among the shortcomings identified - which were specific to the UK - the bank failed to spot suspicious activity on the account of a construction director who also played a leading role in a criminal gang trying to steal millions of pounds by setting up fake companies.
HSBC also failed to detect a customer imprisoned for smuggling cigarettes into the UK and ordered to pay 1.2 million pounds by the HMRC tax office, where the bank missed ""a sustained period of unusual activity,"" the FCA said.
""These failings are unacceptable and exposed the bank and community to avoidable risks, especially as the remediation took such a long time,"" said Mark Steward, executive director at the FCA.
HSBC did not dispute the findings, resulting in its penalty being reduced from 91 million pounds, the regulator said. 
""We are pleased to resolve this matter, which relates to HSBC's legacy anti-money laundering systems and controls in the UK,"" a HSBC spokesperson said in a statement.
""HSBC is deeply committed to combating financial crime and protecting the integrity of the global financial system."" 
The bank has had to tighten up its money-laundering controls globally after a string of past scandals. 

In 2012 it had to pay a $1.9 billion fine to U.S. regulators for serving as a middleman for Mexican drug cartels, and was monitored for five years. The FCA said its fine did not relate to the U.S. action.

Investing.com —Merck & Company Inc (NYSE:MRK) shares edged up 0.4% on Friday after Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Shibutani started coverage of the pharmaceutical company with a conviction buy rating.
The analyst set a price target of $93 on the shares, implying a 22% upside from current levels. 
Shibutani noted that there had been a series of disappointing updates from the company regarding molnupiravir, Merck's Covid pill, and islatravir its HIV drug, but other assets were undervalued. 
 ""Against a backdrop dominated by the challenge of growing and diversifying revenues beyond the significant success of Keytruda, MRK shares have notably underperformed. Through our analysis of Growth portfolio and pipeline assets, however, we believe the market is undervaluing the outlook for several asset,"" the Goldman's analyst said in a research note, pointing to sotatercept, and Vaxneuvance and Gardasil as undervalued assets.
Sotatercept is Merck's pulmonary arterial hypertension treatment, Vaxneuvance a vaccine for the prevention of invasive disease caused by streptococcus pneumonia, and Gardasil, a vaccine intended to protect against diseases caused by Human Papillomavirus.
Shibutani concluded by adding that Goldman's sees Merck as ""having capacity to pursue significant business development opportunities, and note optionality from its Animal Health business,"" which they view as underappreciated.  
Elsewhere, Merck announced ahead of the opening bell that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency has taken a positive opinion on recommending Keytruda, the company's therapy for the treatment of adults with renal cell carcinoma."

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Shares in Brazilian food processor BRF SA (NYSE:BRFS) soared on Friday after it proposed a capital increase through the issuance of 325 million new common shares, potentially raising 6.63 billion reais ($1.17 billion).
The move prompted analysts and market players to speculate if minority shareholder Marfrig Global Foods SA intends to acquire a controlling stake in the company without the risk of triggering a poison pill.
One source with knowledge of the matter, however, said Marfrig controlling shareholder Marcos Molina did not have discussions with BRF about the transaction and did not intend to increase its current 33% stake significantly during the offer.
BRF said in a late Thursday securities filing it plans to expand its operations and make strategic investments.
The deal is still pending approval from a shareholders' meeting scheduled for January and will depend on market conditions.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said it would be a ""very solid opportunity"" for Marfrig to buy an incremental stake without being subject to the 40% premium over the last 30 days average price set in poison pill rules, which are not triggered by the proposed capital raise.
Itau BBA and BTG Pactual analysts expressed a similar view.
""If Marfrig goes for a significant premium over the current stock price and no other shareholder follows along with a share subscription, Marfrig could reach a stake of 51%,"" Itau noted.
""We've never thought Marfrig would just be a passive shareholder of BRF. The company has a long track record of aggressive and transformative M&A deals,"" BTG said.
Marfrig did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

BRF shares, which closed at 20.40 reais on Thursday, were up 5.4% at 21.52 reais on Friday. Those of Marfrig rose 4.2% to 23.90 reais. They were the top gainers on the Bovespa index.

Therefore, Wall Street analysts expect cruise stocks Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corporation (CCL) and Norwegian Cruise (NCLH) to rally 55% or more in price in the near term. So, let’s discuss.The vacation travel sector, which includes the cruise industry, suffered through a rough phase last year as cruise lines were docked for more than a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent travel restrictions. However, the easing of travel restrictions and cruise companies’ efforts to better serve their customers have helped the cruise industry rebound this year. Global revenue under the cruise segment is expected to grow at a 38.4% CAGR through2026.
The industry is expected to see a huge surge in bookings in 2022 and beyond. This is evidenced by Oceania’s world cruise for 2023, which was sold out within one day of opening for sale to the public. Also, river cruise operator Uniworld saw a 425% year-over-year increase in bookings to exotic destinations. According to a report by Cruise Industry News, there has been a fifteenfold year-over-year increase in ships that will be operating commercially this month.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's antitrust agency suspended Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s 2019 deal with Future Group on Friday, potentially denting the U.S. e-commerce giant's attempts to block the sale of Future's retail assets to an Indian market leader. 
The regulator ruled that the U.S. company had suppressed information while seeking regulatory approval on an investment into Indian retailer Future Group two years ago. 
The ruling by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) could have far-reaching consequences for Amazon's legal battles with now estranged partner Future.
Amazon has for months successfully used the terms of its toehold $200 million investment in Future in 2019 to block the Indian retailer's attempt to sell retail assets to Reliance Industries for $3.4 billion.
The regulator's 57-page order said it considers ""it necessary to examine the combination (deal) afresh,"" adding its approval from 2019 ""shall remain in abeyance"" until then.
The CCI's order said Amazon had ""suppressed the actual scope"" of the deal and had made ""false and incorrect statements"" while seeking approvals. 
""The approval is suspended. This is absolutely unprecedented,"" said Shweta Dubey, a partner at Indian law firm SD Partners, who was formerly a CCI official.
""The order seems to have found new power for CCI to keep the combination approval in abeyance,"" she added.
With the 2019 Future deal's antitrust approval now suspended, it could dent Amazon's legal position and retail ambitions, while making it easier for Reliance - the country's largest retailer - to acquire number two player Future, people familiar with the dispute said. 
The CCI also imposed a penalty of around 2 billion rupees ($27 million) on the U.S. company, adding that Amazon will be given time to submit information again to seek approvals, the CCI added.
Future Group, however, is unlikely to cooperate with Amazon if it tries to reapply for antitrust clearance after the CCI's decision, a source with direct knowledge told Reuters.
The Indian company is also set to take CCI's Friday decision before various legal forums to argue that Amazon has no legal basis to challenge its asset sale, the source added.
Future and Reliance did not respond to a request for comment. Amazon said it is reviewing the order ""and will decide on its next steps in due course."" 
RETAIL BATTLE 
The dispute over Future Retail, which has more than 1,500 supermarket and other outlets, is the most hostile flashpoint between Jeff Bezos' Amazon and Reliance, run by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani, as they try to gain the upper hand in winning retail consumers. 
Hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, Future last year decided to sell its retail assets to Reliance for $3.4 billion, but Amazon managed to block the sale successfully through legal challenges.
Amazon cited breach of contracts by Future, arguing that terms agreed in 2019 to pay $200 million for a 49% stake in Future's gift voucher unit prevented its parent, Future Group, from selling its Future Retail Ltd business to certain rivals, including Reliance. 
The CCI review of the deal started after Future, which denies any wrongdoing, complained, saying that Amazon was making contradictory statements before different legal forums about the intent of the 2019 transaction. 
In June, the CCI told Amazon http://reut.rs/3I1MJ4r the U.S. firm in 2019 explained its interest in investing in Future's gift voucher unit as one that would address gaps in India's payments industry. But later, the CCI said, Amazon disclosed in other legal forums the foundation of its investment in the Future unit was to obtain special rights over the retail arm, Future Retail.

In the Friday order, CCI said there was ""a deliberate design on the part of Amazon to suppress the actual scope and purpose of the"" deal.
Ahead of CCI's decision, Amazon denied concealing any information and warned the watchdog https://reut.rs/3q526kb that Future's bid to unwind the 2019 deal to allow Reliance to consolidate its position ""will further restrict competition in the Indian retail market"".

Investing.com — Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) stock fell more than 2% to $17.97 Friday, continuing its recent trend from the start of November despite the U.S. Army triggering another phase of a contract.
Palantir has stoked bullish and bearish opinions. Some argue the company's products and platforms have a strong edge, while others believe it is overvalued and are concerned with its secrecy because of its contracts with intelligence agencies. 
The bearish calls have weighed on the company's shares lately. They began falling in early November after its third quarter earnings. But Friday's fall comes despite the announcement from the data analytics firm that the U.S. Army's Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems has triggered the second option year of its partnership with Palantir on the Army Vantage program for $116.3 million. 
In December 2019, the U.S. Army chose Palantir for a $458 million production agreement to power Army Vantage, a data analytics platform. The contract had an initial base year and three option years. Palantir was paid $110 million for the base year, and $113.8 million in December 2020 for the first option year.
""The Army Vantage program is the cornerstone of the Army's ability to make data driven decisions across the force"" said Doug Philippone, Global Defense Lead at Palantir Technologies.

(Reuters) - California's civil rights regulator is investigating Google's treatment of Black female workers following alleged incidents of harassment and discrimination, according to two people familiar with the matter and emails from the agency seen by Reuters.
Attorneys and analysts at the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) have repeatedly interviewed several Black women who have worked at the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc company about their experiences there, according to the documents and the sources. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing the work. 
Questions have centered on alleged harassment and discrimination in the workplace, according to the emails. Conversations have taken place as recently as last month, one of the sources said. 
The DFEH declined to comment. 
Google said it is focused on ""building sustainable equity"" for its Black workers and that 2020 was its largest year for hiring what it calls ""Black+"" workers, a designation inclusive of people belonging to multiple races.
""Our goal is to ensure that every employee experiences Google as an inclusive workplace,"" it said. ""We’ll continue to focus on this important work and thoroughly investigate any concerns, to make sure our workplace is representative and equitable.""
The DFEH has interviewed workers who have filed formal complaints and those who have not, the people said, showing that the regulator has sought more examples of potential mistreatment.
The agency is involved in ongoing lawsuits against video game companies Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY)' Riot Games and Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) alleging widespread discrimination and harassment. 
But its cases do not always result in charges.
For years Black men in the tech industry have said they have faced disparaging comments and discouraging experiences, such as being shut out of offices because security guards and colleagues questioned whether they actually worked there. 
As more Black women have joined the workforce, such complaints have increased. Seven current and former Google employees told Reuters this year about being marginalized on projects as Black women and not taken as seriously as colleagues with different backgrounds.

Artificial intelligence researcher Timnit Gebru has said Google fired her a year ago for criticizing its lack of workforce diversity and for fighting managers who objected to publishing a critical paper she co-wrote. Erika Munro Kennerly, who oversaw diversity and strategy teams at Google before resigning last year, told magazine Corporate Counsel in January that ""there's an overall tone of being undervalued"" as a Black woman at Google.
Workers identifying as ""Black+ female"" left Google at the highest rate of any racial-gender group other than ""Native ""American+ female"" last year, according to company data. Google last year said it planned to boost retention by increasing support staffing and programs.

The current collective agreement negotiated by the union will end on Dec. 31 and the company has responded negatively to all invitations to discuss new conditions, Pro said in a statement.
UPM responded by saying it would not sign another collective agreement with Pro and added it hopes union members come to work despite Pro's announcement. 
Pro is the second workers union to warn of a strike. On Tuesday the Finnish paper workers union said it planned to begin a three-week strike at UPM mills in Finland starting Jan. 1.
""Just the paper workers on strike would mean all Finnish plants would need to be shut down,"" Inderes analyst Antti Viljakainen told Reuters, noting the strike would have a bigger impact on UPM's results than a previous strike did.
After strikes in 2020 which closed UPM's pulp and paper mills for two weeks and its plywood and timber mills for four, UPM estimated the cost at 30 million euros. 
""They can roughly at least double that figure since the pulp market is so good now,"" Viljakainen said. 
The strike will begin on Jan. 1 and last until Jan. 22, provided new working conditions are not settled beforehand, Pro and the paper workers union have said. 
Around 700 employees would take part, a Pro spokesperson told Reuters, adding to 2,200 from the paper workers union.

The Finnish Forest Industries Federation representing employers decided in 2020 it would exit collective agreements, and working conditions would be negotiated on a company level once ongoing agreements ended.
UPM rival Stora Enso (OTC:SEOAY) signed company-specific collective agreements in October with both Pro and the paper workers union.

Also weighing on the stock was the restaurant chain accelerating its previous decision to hike wages. In January, minimum hourly earnings for Darden’s staff will be $12, gratuities included. Lee said the hike will translate into average hourly earnings of $20.

Adjusted profit per share doubled to $1.48, and like sales, beat estimates.

And the demand-supply imbalance has caused record high lithium prices and pushed some stocks to trade at lofty valuations.  Albemarle  (NYSE:ALB) and Livent (NYSE:LTHM) are two lithium stocks that look overvalued at their current price levels, and we think are best avoided now. Read on.The demand for lithium is showing no signs of relenting. Lithium is a crucial component in electric vehicle (EVs) batteries, and demand for it has ballooned almost in sync with the burgeoning demand for EVs. The demand for lithium has now outstripped its supply, leading to record high lithium prices.
With supply constraints expected to remain well into 2022, lithium prices are expected to remain elevated. According to an S&P Global Market Intelligence forecast, lithium supply will rise to 636,000 MT from an estimated supply of 497,000 MT in 2021, while lithium demand in 2022 will be 641,000 MT LCE, up from an estimated 504,000 MT in 2021, which indicates that there will be a 5,000 MT LCE supply deficit in 2022. With the supply of lithium failing to meet growing demand, there has been a rise in interest in alternatives to lithium-ion batteries, such as hydrogen fuel cells, graphene supercapacitors, aluminum graphite batteries, solid-state batteries, and others.
Against this backdrop, we think it could be wise to avoid lithium stocks Albemarle Corporation (ALB) and Livent Corporation (LTHM). They look overvalued at their current price levels. Also, analysts have recently downgraded them.

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - As a long-running Sino-U.S. diplomatic spat threatens to force Chinese companies off American stock exchanges, global equity investors are assessing ways to retain or add exposure to the world's second-biggest economy. 
Fund managers are planning or accelerating a shift out of Chinese American Depository Receipts (ADRs) into their Hong Kong-listed counterparts, or buying more shares listed on the mainland. Some activist investors are going as far as pressing U.S.-listed Chinese companies not yet listed in Hong Kong to do so as soon as possible.
Meanwhile, retail U.S. investors with no access to Hong Kong's markets have begun dumping Chinese ADRs after the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) this month finalised rules to kick non-compliant Chinese companies off American exchanges in three years. 
""It looks like we're going down the track where these companies will be delisted from the United States,"" said Thomas Masi, New York-based partner and equity portfolio manager at GW&K, citing lingering tensions between the world's two biggest economies. 
Washington is demanding complete access to the books of U.S-listed Chinese companies, but Beijing bars foreign inspection of working papers from local accounting firms - an auditing dispute that puts hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. investments at stake. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimates a quarter of the $1 trillion market value of China ADRs is with American investors.
The rules are forcing a rethink. GW&K's Masi said the asset manager is reviewing its retail-focused ADR strategy ""to see if they do have long term viability."" 
Individual U.S. investors flocked out of Didi Global after the Chinese ride-hailing company unveiled plans on Dec.3 to withdraw from the New York Stock Exchange and pursue a Hong Kong listing. 
SHARE SWAP 
The uncertainty has also caused a near halving of the market capitalisation of Chinese ADRs over the year, to about $828 billion, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.
The strategy for GW&K's emerging market fund, which owns shares in Chinese companies including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Trip.com Group, is to swap out of ADRs into their Hong Kong-traded shares, but only when liquidity in the latter improves, Masi said.
Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer of KraneShares, said he is also ready to make the shift when the time is ripe. 
""We've got our finger on the trigger to make that migration,"" Ahern told investors in a webinar, held after the SEC rules and the Didi delisting announcement sent Chinese tech shares tumbling. ""We're not going to stand idle and watch these companies go away.""
The New York-based, China-focused asset manager, which runs a $7.5 billion exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking China internet stocks including U.S.-traded JD (NASDAQ:JD).com, has tested conversions into Hong Kong listings and found them operationally simple. 
""You simply tell your custodian, you want to make that conversion. The ADR custodian bank charges like 4 cents a share to make that conversion ... overnight, your U.S. names become the Hong Kong share class."" 
DUAL LISTING
According to accounting firm EY, five of the top 10 Hong Kong listings in 2021 were secondary listings of U.S-listed Chinese companies including Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) Inc.
""U.S-listed companies coming home is the big trend,"" said Lawrence Lau, EY Greater China Financial Accounting Advisory Services leader. ""If one day, their shares cannot change hands in the U.S., Hong Kong can serve as a safety net platform where their shares can still trade normally.""
A lot of companies have already done that, making life easier for investors. 
Aaron Costello, Beijing-based regional head for Asia at investment consulting firm Cambridge Associates, notes that 12 of the 15 largest U.S.-listed Chinese companies already have a secondary Hong Kong listing and these companies comprise roughly 85% of the market value of China ADRs in the MSCI China index.
Nuno Fernandes, partner and portfolio manager at GW&K, said he is pressing companies which are lagging. 
""We're having active conversations with the management of those companies, and we are sending them a clear message: it's your obligation to pursue all the opportunities to dual-list in Hong Kong as soon as possible,"" he said.
Many companies have done so, so those that have not ""better have a very good explanation why they're not dual-listed yet. And how they plan to solve it.""
Philip Li, investor director at Wellington Management Co, concurred: ""the worst case scenario would be that an ADR would be delisted and have nowhere else to go."" 
GO TO SOURCE 
Some investors are going directly to China's increasingly deregulated domestic market. 
Catherine Hickey, vice-president at consultancy Segal Marco Advisors, said most of the emerging market managers it uses now tend to invest directly into Chinese companies through the A-share market, which is increasingly open and liquid. 
So if there were fewer ADRs ""it doesn't make that much of a difference."" 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) also recommends exposure to China-listed A-shares, while expressing caution towards the MSCI China index, which has roughly one-fourth of its weightings in ADRs.

""In the next three years, we're going to see very few IPOs of Chinese companies in the U.S., if any,"" said GW&K's Fernandes. 
""So by definition, the focus is going to be more on the mainland Chinese market, because that's where the IPOs are going to come from.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. regulators fined J.P. Morgan Securities $200 million for ""widespread"" failures to preserve staff communications on personal mobile devices, messaging apps and emails, and are probing similar lapses at other financial institutions, they said on Friday.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)'s broker-dealer subsidiary admitted to the charges and to violating securities laws. It also agreed to implement robust improvements to compliance policies, in addition to a fine, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in its $125 million order.
The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday it had fined the firm $75 million for the same issues.
""The firm's actions meaningfully impacted the SEC's ability to investigate potential violations of the federal securities laws,"" the SEC said. 
JPMorgan declined to comment.
The penalty is one of the first major enforcement actions brought under SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden and who has pledged to crack down on misconduct by Wall Street companies. 
The SEC said it discovered that J.P. Morgan Securities had been violating rules that require firms to preserve written business communications when the broker was unable to produce records during the course of other investigations.
As a result of the JPMorgan probe, the SEC has opened investigations into other firms' records-keeping practices, it said, confirming an October Reuters report https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-sec-wallstreet-communication-idCNL1N2R70P2.
""This is an issue that we're seeing at other firms,"" said an SEC official, adding that ""individuals and entities that self-report"" will fare better in penalty negotiations. 
From at least January 2018 through November 2020, J.P. Morgan Securities' employees often communicated about securities business matters on their personal devices, using text messages, WhatsApp, and personal email accounts, the SEC said. 

None of these records were preserved. The lapses were institution-wide and known to senior management, who also used personal devices to discuss business matters, the SEC said. 
It added that J.P. Morgan Securities agreed to retain a compliance consultant and to conduct a comprehensive review of its policies and procedures relating to the retention of electronic communications found on personal devices, among other remedies.

858,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2021 09:07AM ET</span>","U.S. curbs Chinese drone maker DJI, other firms it accuses of aiding rights abuses","By Alexandra Alper and Daphne Psaledakis
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government put investment and export restrictions on dozens of Chinese companies on Thursday, including top drone maker DJI, accusing them of complicity in the oppression of China's Uyghur minority or helping the military, further ratcheting up tensions between the world's top two economies.
Blaming DJI and seven other tech firms for supporting ""the biometric surveillance and tracking"" of Uyghurs, the U.S. Treasury Department added them to a list of entities suspected of having Chinese military links, barring Americans from trading in their securities. 
Separately, the Commerce Department added China's Academy of Military Medical Sciences and its 11 research institutes to a trade blacklist, restricting access to U.S. exports. 
It said the academy uses biotechnology for military uses, including ""purported brain-control weaponry"", without defining the technology further.
The term was used by the academy's president in a 2015 Chinese military newspaper article outlining future warfare, to describe ""equipment that interferes with and controls human consciousness"" during combat.
Reuters recently reported that a four year project by the academy's head of brain science included China's biggest gene firm BGI conducting genetic research on military recruits at high altitude in Tibet. Two BGI Group subsidiaries were put on the trade blacklist last year. 
The department also added HMN International, formerly Huawei Marine, Jiangsu Hengtong Marine Cable Systems, Jiangsu Hengtong OpticElectric, Shanghai Aoshi Control Technology Co, Ltd, and Zhongtian Technology Submarine Cable to the list over U.S. allegations of acquiring, or attempting to acquire, technology from the United States to help modernize the People's Liberation Army. 
The Chinese embassy in Washington called the actions ""unwarranted suppression"" that violated free trade rules, adding that Beijing would take ""all essential measures"" to uphold the interests of Chinese companies and research institutions. 
""China's development of biotechnology has always been for the well-being of mankind. The relevant claims of the U.S. side are totally groundless,"" embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu said in an email. 
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a regular briefing on Friday that China firmly opposes the latest U.S. moves and urged the U.S. to ""rectify"" its ""mistaken ways"". 
Echoing these remarks, China's commerce ministry described the U.S. actions as ""bullying"" and said they were not conducive to the recovery of the global economy. 
It added in a statement that in the absence of any factual basis for the measures, Washington has ""fabricated reasons out of thin air"".
A DJI spokesperson declined to comment on the U.S. announcement on Friday, but directed Reuters to the company's statement when the U.S. Commerce Department put it on the so-called entity list a year ago for the same reasons. That step barred it from buying or using U.S. technology or components.
At the time, DJI said it had done nothing to justify the move and would continue to sell products in the United States.
U.N. experts and rights groups estimate that more than a million people, mainly Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities, have been detained in recent years in a vast system of camps in China's far-west region of Xinjiang.
China denies rights abuses in Xinjiang and has pushed back against U.S. ""interference"" in its affairs, vowing to protect its companies against U.S. sanctions.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said China is choosing to use biotechnologies ""to pursue control over its people and its repression of members of ethnic and religious minority groups."" 
""We cannot allow U.S. commodities, technologies, and software that support medical science and biotechnical innovation to be diverted toward uses contrary to U.S. national security,"" she said in a statement.
Thursday's announcement coupled with last week's investment ban on Chinese facial recognition company SenseTime could worsen already rocky relations between Beijing and Washington, despite President Joe Biden’s trying in a November virtual meeting with China’s leader Xi Jinping to establish “guardrails” to prevent the two superpowers from sliding toward conflict.
Also on Thursday, the Senate passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. Biden has said he will sign it into law. The bill would ban imports from China's Xinjiang region over concerns about forced labor.
SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY
The investment ban, which will also apply to Megvii Technology Limited and Cloudwalk Technology Co Ltd, was first imposed by Donald Trump's administration and revised by Biden. It prohibits U.S. entities from investing in dozens of Chinese companies with alleged ties to the defense or surveillance technology sectors. It now spans dozens of companies, from China's top chipmaker SMIC to oil producer CNOOC (NYSE:CEO).
All eight companies added to the list on Thursday are already on the entity list. The list has become a go-to tool for Washington in the U.S.-China tech feud. Suppliers to companies on the list must seek a special license from the Commerce Department to ship goods to the targeted company. The license requests face a tough standard of review.
Cloudwalk and Megvii both said in separate statements they opposed the U.S. Treasury's decision, with Megvii adding that its inclusion on the list would not impact the company's daily operations. 
Beijing and Washington have clashed over several issues, including U.S. criticism of China’s expanding nuclear arsenal and the Biden administration’s decision this month for U.S. government officials to boycott the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics over rights abuses.
China’s telecommunications equipment company Huawei Technologies was added to the entity list in 2019. Submarine cable maker HMN Technologies was added later that year.

Washington has become increasingly concerned about security threats posed by the company's role in building undersea internet cables, which have far greater data capacity than satellites. Last year, it sent warnings to Pacific Island nations about HMN's bid to participate in a project to improve communications in the region, Reuters reported.
Beijing says it has no intention of using cable infrastructure for spying.

859,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 17, 2021 09:00AM ET</span>",JPMorgan Bosses Addicted to WhatsApp Fuel $200 Million in Fines,"(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) executives were supposed to make sure employee communications were archived for regulatory scrutiny. But for years, even the bosses were using their mobile phones to tap out work-related messages -- a practice so pervasive that U.S. authorities dropped the hammer Friday, imposing $200 million in fines.
The revelation that even “managing directors and other senior supervisors” had shrugged off surveillance duties by using platforms such as WhatsApp or personal email addresses helped prompt the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission to impose unusually stiff penalties on the firm and its subsidiaries for record-keeping violations. Both agencies even extracted rare admissions from the largest U.S. bank that it broke rules -- rather than letting the company settle without acknowledging wrongdoing.
“JPMorgan’s failures hindered several commission investigations and required the staff to take additional steps that should not have been necessary,” Sanjay Wadhwa, the SEC’s deputy director of enforcement, said in a statement announcing the agency’s $125 million fine. “This settlement reflects the seriousness of these violations. Firms must share the mission of investor protection rather than inhibit it.”
The parallel investigations sent shivers through JPMorgan’s workforce this year, when the company ordered traders, bankers, financial advisers and even some branch employees to preserve messages on personal devices in case they need to be inspected later. Regulators hope the fines will now send a message industrywide, where use of platforms such as WhatsApp has become common in recent years -- especially during a pandemic that’s sent legions of Wall Streeters home. 
The SEC’s punishment for JPMorgan dwarfs the $15 million penalty the agency imposed on  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in 2006 during a prior look at industry record keeping.
“As technology changes, it’s even more important that registrants ensure that their communications are appropriately recorded and are not conducted outside of official channels in order to avoid market oversight,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in the statement.
Probe Continues
The CFTC said it found lapses as early as mid-2015, while the SEC focused on record-keeping from January 2018 through November of 2020. That agency noted that JPMorgan has already taken corrective measures.
SEC officials said they’re aware of more than 100 people and tens of thousands of messages that skirted routine surveillance at JPMorgan -- but even that may be scratching the surface. The communications that investigators are aware of involved discussions of company business, client meetings, investment strategies, and market analysis and color.
The probe is ongoing and will look at other firms, officials said, adding that they’re encouraging companies to self-report any violations. The officials declined to say whether executives might be targeted too. 
Wall Street firms have been required for decades to closely monitor and save their employees’ business communications, a task that’s been complicated in recent years by the proliferation of mobile technology and messaging apps. The system was strained all the more as firms sent workers home at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, making it harder to see who might be using an unmonitored device. 
Around mid-2021, JPMorgan asked staff to root through their devices for messages sent or received since the start of 2018, saving those related to work until the company’s legal department instructed them otherwise.
The firm later disclosed in an August filing that it had been responding to requests for information “concerning its compliance with records preservation requirements in connection with business communications sent over electronic messaging channels that have not been approved by the firm.”

Investing.com – FedEx stock (NYSE:FDX) jumped 6% in Friday’s premarket trading as higher shipping rates took the company’s fiscal second-quarter numbers well past analysts’ estimates.
A top-up of $5 billion in share buybacks and the company’s restoration of earlier, higher, revenue guidance were also adding to the gains in the stock.
FedEx said revenue per shipment was higher in the second quarter and that improved operating income, notwithstanding the challenges of a labor shortage.  
A scarcity of labor and an 83% rise in fuel costs boosted overall expenditures by an estimated $470 million year over year in the three months through November. Adjusted operating margins were thus weaker by 0.3 percentage point at 7.1%. Total revenue was up 14% at $23.47 billion but net profit fell 15% to $1 billion.
The company said the buyback includes a $1.5-billion accelerated exercise that will be completed by end-May.  
Excluding items, FedEx now expects full-year earnings per share of $21 at the center of its guidance range, as it had first forecast in June. FedEx had lowered that range to $19.75-$21 in its last quarterly update.
Sales at FedEx Express, the largest unit of the company, were up 12% on a combination of higher yields and volume.  
Ground unit sales, usually the courier’s fastest-growing and most profitable, rose 13%, helped by a 9% increase in package prices.

864,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2021 08:20AM ET</span>",Hong Kong's tweaked regime for SPAC listings starts on Jan. 1,"By Scott Murdoch and Alun John
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Blank-cheque companies known as SPACs can list in Hong Kong from Jan. 1, the stock exchange operator said on Friday, the latest global bourse to tap demand for the investment vehicles although interest in them has waned from earlier this year.
Market participants said Hong Kong hoped to attract investors from mainland-China to list SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies that raise cash to buy private firms and take them public without a traditional initial public offering (IPO).
The move to open up to SPACs follows scrutiny from both Chinese and U.S. regulators that caused a sharp slowdown in Chinese listings in the United States. 
Friday's statement from Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing also set out adjustments to proposals for a SPAC regime that had been published in a consultation document this year, relaxing some of those initial rules.
Tweaks included saying a SPAC's securities must be distributed to a minimum of 20 institutional professional investors not 30 and adjusting rules that had restricted the circumstances in which investors could redeem shares in a SPAC.
Some investment banks and corporate advisers had said the initial regime proposals were too onerous and would make Hong Kong uncompetitive, although the adjusted rules remain stricter than those in the United States.
Victoria Lloyd, a partner in Baker McKenzie's capital markets practice in Hong Kong, expected a pick up in listing activity early in 2022, but added: ""The question remains as to whether this level of activity will be sustainable given the relatively more stringent Hong Kong SPAC rules.""
A Hong Kong capital markets banker welcomed the changes. ""The exchange has taken consideration of the market and made this regime quite commercial and practical now ... It won't be like the U.S. but we expect to see decent interest,"" he said.
But others have opposed any move to open up to SPACs.
""SPACs are unsuitable for a market such as Hong Kong which has historically suffered from manipulation of shell stocks,"" the Asian Corporate Governance Association said.

SPACs surged in popularity in the United States about a year ago but the pace of capital raising has slowed as investors have taken a more cautious approach after the poor financial performance of many SPACs and a regulatory crackdown led by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Several companies are preparing to list SPACs on Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY), which also changed its rules this year.

865,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2021 08:11AM ET</span>",Analysis: Reddit IPO to test social media platform's 'meme' stock hype,"By Dawn Chmielewski and Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - Reddit users have helped fuel dozens of ""meme"" stock rallies this year, from retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) to movie operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc. Some analysts are skeptical this will be the social media platform's saving grace as it prepares to sell its own shares in the stock market.
The San Francisco-based company filed confidentially this week with U.S. regulators for an initial public offering (IPO). It is aiming for a valuation of at least $15 billion, Reuters reported in September. 
Reddit co-founder and Chief Executive Steve Huffman is hoping that retail investors will play a big role in the stock market debut. ""I want our users to be shareholders and I want our shareholders to be users,"" he told an audience at the Wall Street Journal's Tech Live conference in October.
Many Reddit users indicated in posts on Thursday that they would back the IPO. But several industry analysts questioned whether the ""meme"" stock trend will carry Reddit's stock over the long term.
Wedbush internet securities analyst Ygal Arounian said it was unclear whether the influx of Reddit users, who were drawn to the company's forums to rally around buying certain stocks, including GameStop's shares in January, would be enough to support further growth at the company. ""The question is, was that lift sustainable?"" he said.
A Reddit spokesperson declined to respond to industry analysts' skepticism of its public company's growth prospects, citing the ""quiet period"" that accompanies the filing of paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
At a $15 billion valuation, Reddit would be valued at 20-times revenue, or three times the multiple of Facebook-owner Meta Platforms, according to Breakingviews.
That is despite the 16-year-old company significantly trailing Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and other major social media companies in users and revenue.
Reddit brought in $100 million in advertising revenue in the second quarter of this year, according to the company. That reflects a tripling from a year ago, or about $400 million annually on a run-rate basis, serving about 52 million users daily.
Facebook, which was founded just a year before Reddit, generated $85.9 billion in 2020 and serves about 3 billion global users. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), which launched in 2006, reported $3.72 billion in revenue last year and now attracts 211 million users a day.
Reddit's appeal to advertisers is limited as it remains a sideshow in their marketing plans compared to platforms like Facebook that offer far larger audiences, said Matt Navarra, a Britain-based social media consultant whose previous clients include Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the BBC and International Red Cross. 
This is because Facebook and YouTube lure marketers with highly targeted text and video ads that are designed to drive sales. Reddit's users have also been critical of the platform carrying too much advertising.
Reddit has taken a more hands-off approach to content moderation compared to its bigger rivals, counting on its loyal communities to police themselves. This approach has resulted in material such as hate speech that advertisers avoid, though the company has made progress in recent years in limiting that content. 
""It feels like quite a scary place to be for many small to medium and bigger brands who are cautious about where they place themselves,"" said Navarra.
NEW FEATURES NEEDED
Reddit has changed little in its basic features since it was spun off from magazine conglomerate Conde Nast in 2011. Its recent surge in appeal is down to the popularity of WallStreetBets and other forums on its platform that have become a venue for retail investors to speculate on stocks. 
Drawing more users will require new features as Reddit's rivals chase the metaverse, virtual reality, audio chatrooms and newsletters, analysts said.
The company has made some efforts to freshen its appeal. In December, it acquired Dubsmash, a TikTok-like app. It has also launched real-time features for the first time such as voting animations and typing indicators.

Reddit may also be able to generate more advertising revenue from its existing base of loyal users, which could be catnip for some advertisers, said research firm LightShed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield.
""Whether that’s on video gaming, whether that’s on stocks like WallStreetBets, or whether that’s on Marvel or Star Wars lore, Reddit creates an environment where you can target passionate communities of consumers,"" Greenfield said.

NEW YORK/SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's presidential election, the most polarized in decades, has given markets the wobbles. But there may be a silver lining for investors within the stark divides: buffers from a split Congress and candidates' moderating stances to lure key centrist voters.
The Sunday head-to-head sees leftist former student protest leader Gabriel Boric take on far-right Jose Antonio Kast, both from outside the mainstream political parties who have risen on the back of voter anger and demand for change.
Boric has threatened to bury Chile's neoliberal economic model that dates to the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Kast, oft likened to Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro, has joked about having Pinochet over for tea.
But both candidates have moderated as the race has tightened to win over key moderate votes. Congress, elected in November, is split down the middle between left and right, creating a likely brake on radical reform.
""Both candidates have been making major adjustments to their programs, they have introduced concepts of prudence and realism,"" Chile's central bank president, Mario Marcel, said this week, adding that would be valuable reassuring investors.
J.P. Morgan in a report said it had noted ""a turn to moderation"" by both candidates. Congress, it said, would temper Boric's policy plans if he were to win, while a left-leaning assembly redrafting the constitution would pressure Kast.
Nonetheless, the uncertainty has hit Chile's assets hard. The peso has tumbled 16% this year versus the dollar, among the weakest emerging markets currencies. The dollar-denominated Chile MSCI stock index is down 14%.
Wary Chileans have been pulling assets out of the country over the last two years, partly the effect of the pandemic, but uncertainty was also sparked by a social unrest breakout in 2019 and the current constitutional reform process.
Some $10 billion in household and company wealth has flowed out of Chile this year, according to central bank data through November, on top of the $12 billion that exited last year. The number was closer to $2 billion in 2018 and 2019.
""These capital outflows, so far, have been quite similar to those that occurred during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009,"" Marcel said. ""They are important numbers, no doubt.""
'WILD CARD'
The election - currently too close to call with some polls showing a dead heat - will see Chileans choose from two very different visions of the future for the world's top copper producer and a bastion of stability in volatile Latin America.
""Chile's upcoming presidential election is the most divisive since the country's transition to democracy,"" Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank said in a note, referring to the end of the dictatorship in 1990.
But for many, the constitutional redraft, which will see a national referendum on the new text next year, poses even larger risks. If approved it would likely shift away somewhat from the market-driven Pinochet era text, which underpinned Chile's economic model penned by the so-called Chicago Boys.
""The wild card in Chile is the constituent assembly and the new constitution,"" said Carlos de Sousa, emerging market debt strategist at Vontobel Asset Management in Zurich.
Mining could be central to that. Areas like taxation are coming under scrutiny as are environmental protections, which could impact copper and lithium, an ultra-light battery metal in big demand due to the shift to electric vehicles.
""The Constitutional Convention and presidential election have put mining investments on hold,"" said Alvaro Merino, chief of studies at the National Mining Association (Sonami).
He said Chile has a portfolio of $69 billion in investments over the next 10 years, which needed regulations that provide legal certainty, stability and do not compromise competitiveness.
""We need to clear up uncertainties so that mining investment is deployed with full force,"" he said.
A tough external factor for Chile is the outlook for emerging markets as developed economies move to abandon years of loose monetary policy. The prospect of higher interest rates in the United States has already dried portfolio flows into some EMs.

Vontobel's de Sousa said Chilean assets could be worth a bet because the peso was so weak right now, but rising political risks would give him pause for thought.
""Strategically, on a long-term perspective, we don't like Chile much right now,"" he said.

874,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2021 06:46AM ET</span>","Don't cut off euro clearing in London for now, says EU watchdog","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - London's two big derivatives clearing houses should not be cut off from customers in the European Union until there are 'incentives' to shift business to the bloc such as capital charges, the EU's securities watchdog said on Friday.
Even before Brexit, EU policymakers have long wanted multi-trillion euro clearing moved to Frankfurt where it can be overseen by its own agencies such as the European Central Bank, particularly in times of market turmoil.
Despite Britain's full departure from the EU a year ago, the London Stock Exchange (LSEG) still clears some 90% of euro interest rate swaps used by companies on the continent to hedge against adverse moves in borrowing costs.
The bloc has sought to persuade banks to shift clearing from London to Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) in Frankfurt but with little success.
The EU's European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published its keenly-awaited report on Friday into whether euro clearing in London was of such importance that it should be relocated to the EU.
ESMA said it concluded that euro and Polish zloty clearing at LSEG and ICE (NYSE:ICE) Clear were of ""substantial systemic importance"" and posed risks to EU financial stability which may not be fully mitigated under current rules.
But the costs and risks of stopping EU customers using London-based clearers would outweigh the benefits to the EU at this time, ESMA said.
The watchdog proposed ""appropriate incentives for reducing the size of EU exposures"" to the two clearers in London.
These could include requirements for alternative clearing arrangements for clearing members or clients, and appropriate prudential requirements - capital charges - to ""effectively incentivise"" the participants to reduce their exposures.
""If these incentives are brought forward, we expect that the liquidity will shift in a way that makes the EU CCPs (clearers) attractive, the cost lower, the product offering broader,"" Froukelien Wendt, member of ESMA's clearing supervisory committee, told reporters. 
ESMA said it also wanted to widen its cooperation agreement with the Bank of England to give itself more powers to intervene in London clearers if they suffer failures.

While much of Britain's financial sector is now cut off from the EU, Brussels allowed banks in the bloc to continue clearing contracts in London until June 2022.
The EU's financial services chief Mairead McGuinness has said she will propose a further, temporary extension, using the ESMA report to help her determine its length and end overreliance on London.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Friday, with tech stocks set to underperform after the Federal Reserve pointed to a series of interest rate hikes next year in an attempt to contain inflationary pressures.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 25 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 12 points, or 0.3%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 100 points, or 0.6%.
The major averages closed lower Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite suffering the most, dropping 2.5%, its worst day since September as investors appeared to rotate from high-growth tech names to consumer staples. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped just 30 points, or 0.1%, and the S&P 500 fell 0.9%.
“The Fed looks to have pivoted to a significantly more hawkish stance,” said analysts at ABN Amro, in a note. “If anything, the recent continued upside surprises in inflation and in the labour market suggest the risk at this stage is of an even earlier rates lift-off than our current June projection.”
Investors initially bought into the confidence that the Fed showed that the U.S. economy would be able to withstand tighter monetary policy even as a new variant of coronavirus threatens to upend travel and business.
However, the rapid growth of cases of the Omicron Covid variant has stoked worries that the economic recovery could suddenly reverse, especially after President Joe Biden warned of a “winter of severe illness and death” for citizens who have not been vaccinated.
Turning to the corporate sector, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) will be in the spotlight after the shipping company reinstated its original fiscal 2022 forecast late Thursday, even amid persistent labor challenges during its peak holiday season.
Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) will also be in focus after the electric vehicle manufacturer reported a hefty net loss in its first quarterly results as a public company, and also said its expected production would fall short of its 2021 target.
Staying in the auto sector, General Motors (NYSE:GM) said Thursday that Dan Ammann, the chief executive of its self-driving car subsidiary Cruise, is leaving with immediate effect.
Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) and Winnebago (NYSE:WGO) are scheduled to report quarterly earnings results before the bell.
Oil prices weakened Friday, on course for a negative week, as surging cases of the Omicron Covid-19 variant raised concerns new restrictions may hit demand for crude. 
Traders will look to the release of the Baker Hughes oil rig count and the CFTC positioning data later in the session to round the week off. 
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.8% lower at $71.11 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.8% to $73.70. Brent is headed for a 1.9% loss this week, while the U.S. contract is poised to finish the week down 0.9%.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.7% to $1,810.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1317.

Investing.com – General Motors stock (NYSE:GM) traded nearly 3% lower in Friday’s premarket after the company said that Dan Ammann, the chief executive of its self-driving car subsidiary Cruise, is leaving with immediate effect.
Ammann’s departure comes as the company waits for approval to operate a self-driving car service in San Francisco.
Cruise last month sough California Public Utility Commission’s permit to charge for rides in autonomous vehicles that have no safety driver. According to Bloomberg, GM CEO Mary Barra is counting on the business for $50 billion in revenue within six years.
Ammann had a key role in GM’s purchase of Cruise in 2016 and was named CEO of the unit in 2019. The outgoing chief executive had restricted stock in the venture, holding prospects of a windfall in the event of the company getting listed -- “a long-term consideration” in Barra’s words, according to Bloomberg.
Cruise founder Kyle Vogt, who is the business’s president and chief technical officer, will serve as interim CEO. Wesley Bush, former chairman and CEO of  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) and a member of the GM board, will join the Cruise board, GM said in a statement.
According to GM, Cruise will play an integral role in building its autonomous vehicle platform in its pursuit of markets beyond rideshare and delivery.

""We are assessing how to apply the (work) programme developed by the Federal Penitentiary Service,"" Kogogin told reporters. 
The firm faces a shortage of 4,000 staff at its production facilities in Naberezhnye Chelny, an industrial city more than 900 kilometres (560 miles) east of Moscow, he said. It has 24,000 employees there. 
The company, which is 47% owned by state conglomerate Rostec and 15% by Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), has already brought in migrant workers from Uzbekistan and is now considering looking to Russian prisons for labourers, he said. 
Restrictions linked to the pandemic have prompted many migrant workers to leave Russia, forcing authorities and private companies to ponder ways to fill worker shortages. 

The Federal Penitentiary Service earlier this year proposed a plan to use convicts to supplement he workforce, insisting the new system would not resemble the vast GULAG labour camp system of the Soviet era. 
In April, a government document ordered officials to assess the feasibility of using convicts to build railways.

The downgrades could trigger some creditors to demand immediate repayment, market watchers cautioned, further pressuring Shimao's liquidity. 
Separately, S&P downgraded China Evergrande Group to ""selective default"" on Friday, and Moody's and Fitch downgraded Guangzhou R&F Properties to Caa2 from B3, and C from B-, respectively.
Evergrande, which has more than $300 billion in liabilities, missed a debt payment deadline last week, putting the developer at risk of becoming the country's biggest defaulter. Fitch has already downgraded the developer to ""restricted default"".
Chinese developers are facing an unprecedented liquidity squeeze due to regulatory curbs on borrowing, causing a string of offshore debt defaults, credit-rating downgrades and sell-offs in developers' shares and bonds.
On Friday, Moody's downgraded Shimao's corporate family rating (CFR) to Ba3 from Ba1, while Fitch cut its Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to BB from BBB-, both on review for further potential downgrade. 
""The rating downgrade reflects Shimao's increased refinancing risk due to its constrained funding access and sizable debt maturities over the next 6-12 months,"" Moody's said in a statement.
Shimao in 2022 has $1.7 billion maturities offshore and 8.9 billion yuan ($1.40 billion) onshore, according to Moody's.
Shimao saw sharp falls in its shares and debt earlier this week, triggered by worries over an asset sale and cancelled apartment deals. 
Fitch said the negative news flow related has diminished investor confidence, which could constrain Shimao's refinancing channels and add to liquidity pressure. 
Earlier in the day, bonds sold by subsidiaries of Shimao rose broadly in Shanghai after a report the Chinese developer plans to repay publicly issued debts due this month.
The developer has also asked for trust firms for short-term extensions of loans coming due, as it expects 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) worth of cash to be released from presale escrow accounts from Jan. 1, financial intelligence provider REDD said, citing unidentified sources.
Shimao did not respond to a request for comment.
Its flagship unit later said in a filing it has transferred funds worth 31.4 million yuan to repay a yuan bond.
Bonds issued by Shanghai Shimao Co Ltd and Shanghai Shimao Construction Co Ltd, both owned by Shimao, were among top gainers in Shanghai Stock Exchange's corporate bond market on Friday. 
A Shanghai Shimao bond that matures in September, 2024 jumped over 7%. 
Shimao's biggest creditor, China Merchants Bank, plans to increase its loan exposure to Shimao - currently at 30 billion yuan - and plans to rally financial support for Shimao from other lenders, REDD also said, the developer plans to pay migrant workers salaries before the Chinese New Year.

The EV-maker, touted as an emerging rival to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), said it will spend $5 billion to set up a plant in Georgia, its second.  
Net loss at the company soared to $1.2 billion, mostly due to higher R&D spend and losses on convertible debt.
Compounding the disappointment were the pre-orders for its pickup R1T and special utility vehicle R1S that at 71,000 units, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas, as quoted by Reuters, were at the low end of expectations.
The company also said production will be ""a few hundred vehicles short"" of its 2021 target of 1,200 due to supply chain constraints.

MILAN (Reuters) -Carmaker Stellantis is in exclusive talks with BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) and Santander (MC:SAN) over the reorganisation of its leasing and financing operations in Europe, it said on Friday.
The group plans to create a 50-50 long-term leasing company with Credit Agricole Consumer Finance, and to reorganise its financing activities through exclusive joint ventures with BNP Paribas Personal Finance and Santander Consumer Finance.
The plan marks a further step in Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares' strategy to shape the world's fourth-largest carmaker, which was formed just less than a year ago through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA.
It will allow Stellantis to cut the number of financing and leasing entities it now operates in each European country from five to two.
""This is a strategic move to leverage our financial performance across all European countries,"" Tavares said in a statement. 
Chief Affiliates Officer Philippe de Rovira said the plan would also allow Stellantis to enhance its position in the European corporate leased vehicle market, where it aims to more than double its fleet by the end of the decade.
""We consider that in this segment, we have a huge opportunity for growth in the coming years,"" he said.
Stellantis' corporate leased vehicle fleet, now at 700,000, is expected to reach one million in 2026, he said.
As part of the plan, Stellantis will operate financing activities through JVs with BNP Paribas Personal Finance in Germany, Austria and the UK, and with Santander Consumer Finance in France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Poland and the Netherlands. 
In Portugal it will work with Santander via a commercial agreement. 
It will also sell its 50% stake in Fiat Chrysler's former financial service arm FCA Bank, including Leasys' short-term rent business, to Credit Agricole Consumer Finance, which currently owns the other half of the business. 
De Rovira said the overhaul of its European financing operation would not impact jobs. 
The deals could be signed in the first quarter of next year, and the transactions completed in the first half of 2023, Stellantis added.
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) is acting as financial adviser to Stellantis. 

The European plan comes after Stellantis earlier this year agreed to buy U.S. auto finance provider First Investors Financial Services Group for about $285 million.
It had been the only major automaker operating in the United States without owning a captive auto finance provider.

The CDC's move came on the advice of the Advisory Committee on Immunization.
With only around 16 million of the 200 million fully-vaccinated American receiving J&J's vaccine and the company selling it at a not-for-profit price, the revenue impact on the company's accounts so far has been negligible. The CDC advice deals a blow to the chances of it contributing more to cash flow in future.
In more adverse news for the company, members of the panel also said that J&J's vaccine is less effective in stopping the virus than the other two vaccines.
J&J said in a statement that the safety and well-being of those who use its vaccine is its top priority and it looks forward to working with the CDC on the next steps.
Blood clots accompanied by low levels of platelets have previously been reported in recipients of the J&J vaccine.
The updated CDC recommendation follows similar recommendations from other countries, including Canada and the U.K.
The ACIP and the CDC reaffirmed that receiving any vaccine is better than being unvaccinated. Individuals who are unable or unwilling to receive an mRNA shot will continue to have access to J&J’s vaccine, the CDC said.
J&J’s is the only single-shot vaccine available in the U.S. while the other two are double-dose.

The Bank of Japan continued the theme by saying it too will trim its quantitative easing program at the end of March, ending its purchases of corporate bonds and commercial paper.

In October, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) barred Supermax's imports over alleged forced labour practices, making it the fifth Malaysian firm to face such a ban in the past 18 months.
Supermax said it was in contact with CBP to obtain more clarity, adding that it will speed up a process it had begun in 2019 to meet the International Labour Organisation's standards.
The new facility will help Supermax cater to at least 10% to 15% of the total annual medical glove imports into the United States over the next two to four years and 20% to 25% of U.S. demand over the next four to six years, it said in a statement. 
The United States accounts for about 20% of Supermax's total sales. 
The facility will be built by its U.S.-based unit, Maxter Healthcare Inc, on 215 acres in Texas. 
Maxter will build the facility in four phases, with each expected to produce 400 million gloves per month, giving the plant an annual production capacity of 19.2 billion pieces of gloves. The first phase will begin production in the last quarter of 2022.

SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) - In Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's factory of the future, immersive 3-D engineering designs will be twinned with robots that speak to each other, while mechanics around the world will be linked by $3,500 HoloLens headsets made by  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). 
It is a snapshot of an ambitious new Boeing strategy to unify sprawling design, production and airline services operations under a single digital ecosystem - in as little as two years. 
Critics say Boeing has repeatedly made similar bold pledges on a digital revolution, with mixed results. But insiders say the overarching goals of improving quality and safety have taken on greater urgency and significance as the company tackles multiple threats.
The planemaker is entering 2022 fighting to reassert its engineering dominance after the 737 MAX crisis, while laying the foundation for a future aircraft program over the next decade - a $15 billion gamble. It also aims to prevent future manufacturing problems like the structural flaws that have waylaid its 787 Dreamliner over the past year.
""It's about strengthening engineering,"" Boeing's chief engineer, Greg Hyslop, told Reuters in his first interview in nearly two years. ""We are talking about changing the way we work across the entire company.""
After years of wild market competition, the need to deliver on bulging order books has opened up a new front in Boeing's war with Europe's Airbus, this time on the factory floor.
Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury, a former automobile research boss, has pledged to ""invent new production systems and leverage the power of data"" to optimize its industrial system.
Boeing's approach so far has been marked by incremental advances within specific jet programs or tooling, rather than the systemic overhaul that characterizes Hyslop's push today. 
The simultaneous push by both plane giants is emblematic of a digital revolution happening globally, as automakers like Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and social media companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent Meta Platforms Inc shift work and play into an immersive virtual world sometimes called the metaverse.
So how does the metaverse - a shared digital space often using virtual reality or augmented reality and accessible via the internet - work in aviation? 
Like Airbus, Boeing's holy grail for its next new aircraft is to build and link virtual three-dimensional ""digital twin"" replicas of the jet and the production system able to run simulations. 
The digital mockups are backed by a ""digital thread"" that stitches together every piece of information about the aircraft from its infancy - from airline requirements, to millions of parts, to thousands of pages of certification documents - extending deep into the supply chain. 
Overhauling antiquated paper-based practices could bring powerful change.
More than 70% of quality issues at Boeing trace back to some kind of design issue, Hyslop said. Boeing believes such tools will be central to bringing a new aircraft from inception to market in as little as four or five years.
""You will get speed, you will get improved quality, better communication, and better responsiveness when issues occur,"" Hyslop said. 
""When the quality from the supply base is better, when the airplane build goes together more smoothly, when you minimize re-work, the financial performance will follow from that."" 
ENORMOUS CHALLENGE
Yet the plan faces enormous challenges. 
Skeptics point to technical problems on Boeing's 777X mini-jumbo and T-7A RedHawk military training jet, which were developed using digital tools.
Boeing has also placed too great an emphasis on shareholder returns at the expense of engineering dominance, and continues to cut R&D spending, Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said.
""Is it worth pursuing? By all means,"" Aboulafia said. ""Will it solve all their problems? No."" 
Juggernauts like aircraft parts maker Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR) have already invested in digital technology. Major planemakers have partnerships with French software maker Dassault Systèmes. But hundreds of smaller suppliers spread globally lack the capital or human resources to make big leaps. 
Many have been weakened by the MAX and coronavirus crises, which followed a decade of price pressure from Boeing or Airbus.
""They not only tell us what hardware we can buy, they are now going to specify all this fancy digital junk that goes on top of it?"" one supply chain executive said. 
'A LONG GAME'
Boeing itself has come to realize that digital technology alone is not a panacea. It must come with organizational and cultural changes across the company, industry sources say. 
Boeing recently tapped veteran engineer Linda Hapgood to oversee the ""digital transformation,"" which one industry source said was underpinned by more than 100 engineers.
Hapgood is best known for turning black-and-white paper drawings of the 767 tanker's wiring bundles into 3-D images, and then outfitting mechanics with tablets and HoloLens augmented-reality headsets. Quality improved by 90%, one insider said.
In her new role, Hapgood hired engineers who worked on a digital twin for a now-scrapped midmarket airplane known as NMA.
She is also drawing on lessons learned from the MQ-25 aerial refueling drone and the T-7A Red Hawk. 
Boeing ""built"" the first T-7A jets in simulation, following a model-based design. The T-7A was brought to market in just 36 months. 
Even so, the program is grappling with parts shortages, design delays and additional testing requirements. 

Boeing has a running start with its 777X wing factory in Washington state, where the layout and robot optimization was first done digitally. But the broader program is years behind schedule and mired in certification challenges. 
""This is a long game,"" Hyslop said. ""Every one of these efforts was addressing part of the problem. But now what we want to do is do it from end to end.""

887,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2021 02:58AM ET</span>","Facebook exposes mercenary spy firms that targeted 50,000 people","By Raphael Satter and Elizabeth Culliford
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms Inc is calling out half a dozen private surveillance companies for hacking or other abuses, accusing them in a report published Thursday of collectively targeting about 50,000 people across its platforms.
The company's fight with the spy firms comes amid a wider move by American tech companies, U.S. lawmakers and President Joe Biden's administration against purveyors of digital espionage services, notably the Israeli spyware company NSO Group, which was blacklisted earlier this month following weeks of revelations about how its technology was being deployed against civil society.
Meta is already suing NSO in a U.S. court. Nathaniel Gleicher, Meta's head of security policy, told Reuters that Thursday's crackdown was meant to signal that ""the surveillance-for-hire industry is much broader than one company.""
Meta's report said it was suspending roughly 1,500, mostly fake accounts run by seven organizations across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta said the entities targeted people in more than 100 countries.
Meta did not provide a detailed explanation of how it identified the surveillance firms, but it operates some of the world's biggest social and communications networks and regularly touts its ability to find and remove malicious actors from its platforms.
Among them is Israel's Black Cube, which became notorious for deploying its spies on behalf of Hollywood rapist Harvey Weinstein. Meta said the intelligence firm was deploying phantom personas to chat its targets up online and gather their emails, ""likely for later phishing attacks.""
In a statement, Black Cube said it ""does not undertake any phishing or hacking"" and said the firm routinely ensured ""all our agents' activities are fully compliant with local laws.""
Others called out by Meta include BellTroX, an Indian cyber mercenary firm exposed by Reuters and the internet watchdog Citizen Lab last year, an Israeli company called Bluehawk CI, and a European firm named Cytrox - all of whom Meta accused of hacking. 
Cognyte, which was spun off from security giant  Verint Systems  (NASDAQ:VRNT) Inc in February, and Israeli firms Cobwebs Technologies were accused not of hacking but of using fake profiles to trick people into revealing private data.
Cognyte, Verint and Bluehawk did not immediately return messages seeking comment. 
In an email, Cobwebs spokesperson Meital Levi Tal said the company drew on open sources and that its products ""are not intrusive by any means."" Messages left with Ivo Malinovski – who until recently identified himself as Cytrox's chief executive on LinkedIn – received no immediate response. BellTroX founder Sumit Gupta has not returned Reuters reporters' messages since his firm was exposed last year. He had previously denied wrongdoing.
Gleicher refused to identify any of the targets by name but Citizen Lab, in a report published at the same time as Meta's, said that one of Cytrox's victims was Egyptian opposition figure Ayman Nour. 
Nour blamed the Egyptian government for the spying, telling Reuters in an interview from Istanbul that he had long suspected he was under surveillance by officials there. 
""For the first time I have evidence,"" he said.
Egyptian authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Gleicher said other targets of the spy firms included celebrities, politicians, journalists, lawyers, executives and regular citizens. Friends and family of the targets were also swept up in the espionage campaigns, he said.
Meta cybersecurity official David Agranovich said he hoped Thursday's announcement would ""kickstart the disruption of the surveillance-for-hire market."" There were some signs that other social media firms were taking similar action, with Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) announcing the removal of 300 accounts a few hours after Meta's announcement.
Whether the takedowns deal the companies involved more than a temporary setback remains to be seen. Two of the companies, Black Cube and BellTroX, have bounced back after being embroiled in previous spy scandals.
Gleicher said that targets of the spy firms would receive automated warnings, but he said Facebook would stop short of identifying the specific firms involved or their clients. That's despite the fact that Facebook said it had identified several customers of Cobwebs, Cognyte, Cytrox, and Black Cube - the latter of which includes law firms.

Marta Pardavi, one of several Hungarian human rights defenders who say they were targeted by Black Cube in 2017 and 2018, said she was gratified by the news of Facebook's report but wanted more information.
""They name law firms,"" she said. ""But law firms have clients. Who are the clients for these law firms?""

888,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2021 02:56AM ET</span>",Batteries included? Northvolt goes all out to meet 2021 launch goal,"By Helena Soderpalm and Supantha Mukherjee
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Northvolt Chief Executive Peter Carlsson wants to take on his old boss Elon Musk with the greenest electric vehicle batteries in the world. But he needs to start producing them first.
The Swede is determined to get his factory, roughly 200 km south of the Arctic circle, open for business this month, meaning he and his team of engineers and technicians are labouring at a pace that would rival Santa's little helpers.
""We are working extremely intensely right now to keep that schedule, and even if it means the first battery is made on New Year's Eve, it's going out this year,"" Carlsson told Reuters.
The lithium-ion plant was the first to be built in the European Union by a European company and it is meant to be the launchpad for a regional battery champion that can compete not only with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) but also Asian suppliers including Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY), LG Chem, and CATL.
Northvolt has raised more than $6.5 billion in funding from the likes of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), the European Commission and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) founder Daniel Ek as well as contracts worth over $27 billion from automakers. 
It plans to produce enough batteries to power over 1 million electric vehicles (EV) annually in its Swedish plant in the former gold mining town of Skelleftea, and later supply to other sectors switching to electric, such as industrial machinery and ferries. 
Carlsson aims to open at least two more factories in the next ten years.
A former head of production and supply chain at Tesla, which he left in 2015, Carlsson is hoping his experience working with Musk to scale up the billionaire's California factory will help him in the snowy reaches of northern Sweden.
""During my years at Tesla with Elon I got to know how fun it is to build and scale, and also how very challenging,"" Carlsson said.
""There is always supply chain issues when you are starting to scale ... I think this is something we are going to be very, very focused on during the next two years.""
Recalls of EV batteries from some of the biggest producers have shown how demanding it is to produce batteries on a large scale, coupled with setting up an ""extremely complex"" supply chain with both corporate and geopolitical risks.
""To get that (product quality) right while scaling production for the first time is obviously a huge challenge,"" said Hans Eric Melin, founder of London-based consultancy Circular Energy Storage.
GREEN CREDENTIALS
Northvolt currently employs about 2,500 people from 108 countries, and plans to add 5,000 more engineers over the next five years. 
Northvolt and Volvo Cars, which aims to go fully electric by 2030, are due to announce a location in Europe for a joint gigafactory early next year.
""We could make our own batteries and start from zero,"" Volvo CEO Hakan Samuelsson said in an interview. ""But I don't think that would be efficient enough.""
Competition for talent is fierce. Most of the battery engineers are based in Asia and Asian suppliers such as LG and Samsung (KS:005930) SDI are setting up factories in Europe. Other startups are also trying to get a foothold.
Tesla is looking to recruit for its gigafactory in Berlin.
Skelleftea -- pronounced like 'she left you' -- can't compete with the German capital's club scene and its climate can be foreboding with snow cover from November to April and only a few hours of sunshine during the winter. 
But Carlsson is banking on the green credentials of the city and the plant to attract engineers. Skelleftea runs largely on renewable energy from hydropower and wind and the plant will be 100% renewable. Batteries will also be recycled there. 
""As we go into new generations of skill and talent, a paycheck is not enough, they want purpose, they want to be part of a mission,"" he said.
Money is still important, however, with every employee being offered a slice of the company in the form of an equity stake as part of their salary package. 
And Northvolt is setting up an entire ecosystem to accommodate staff from as far away as South Korea, Japan and India with housing and company-sponsored social activities including ice hockey and cross-country skiing. It plans to run electric helicopters between Skelleftea airport and the plant underway.
To fulfil Northvolt's expansion plan, the company needs regular infusions of money.
The $6.5 billion in funding already raised will not be enough, according to Carlsson. 
Northvolt is aiming for the Skelleftea plant to achieve production capacity of 60 gigawatt hours - that could power up to 1 million cars per year depending on battery size - as it wants to grab at least a 20-25% market share in Europe by 2030. 
Last week, Volvo Cars and Northvolt said they will open a joint research and development centre in Sweden as part of a $3.3 billion investment.

Melin, the consultant, said Northvolt could well reach its production and market share targets. 
""With tailwinds, secured supply of raw materials and a well-positioned product mix I can't see what could stop them. But those are big ifs,"" he said.

A global semiconductor shortage and other supply chain issues have dampened deliveries of cars globally, with carmakers sitting on half-finished goods and unable to meet demand.

The number of new vehicles registered in the European Union, Britain and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) rose four months in a row to June this year but has fallen every month since then, data from Europe's auto association ACEA has shown.
Still, the number of new vehicles registered in the European Union, Britain and European Free Trade Association countries in November was just 17.5% below last year's levels, compared to a 30% drop in November, 25% in September and 23.6% in August.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open lower Friday, with sentiment hit by central banks tightening monetary policy as cases of Omicron-variant Covid-19 soar.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.7% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.5%.
Two of Europe’s senior central banks took steps to combat surging inflation on Thursday, with the Bank of England raising interest rates for the first time since the pandemic started and the European Central Bank saying it will cut its bond purchases in three months' time.
The Bank of Japan continued the theme by dialing back its emergency pandemic funding earlier Friday, after the Federal Reserve upped the pace of the tapering of its bond-buying program earlier in the week.
The general trend towards tightening monetary policy appears to be clear, even though the different paths taken by central banks underline deep uncertainties about how the fast-spreading Omicron variant will hit economies. 
The U.K. recorded a record number of daily coronavirus cases for the second day running, with almost 90,000 infections confirmed on Thursday. France has tightened the restrictions on arrivals from the U.K., while Italy has done so for the rest of the EU. Over in the U.S., President Joe Biden warned that unvaccinated Americans face “a winter of severe illness and death.”
Adding to the negative sentiment, tensions between China and the U.S. flared again after the Biden administration imposed trade restrictions on more than 30 Chinese research institutes and entities.
In corporate news,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) is likely to be in the spotlight Friday after the Financial Times reported that Eric Varvel, chairman of the Swiss lender’s investment bank, is in discussions to leave the company.
The European economic data slate is headed up by the November consumer price index for the Eurozone, which is expected to show inflation remains elevated, and the widely-watched December German Ifo business climate index.
Oil prices weakened Friday, on course for a negative week, as surging cases of the Omicron Covid-19 variant raise concerns new restrictions may hit oil demand. 
Traders will look to the release of the Baker Hughes oil rig count and the CFTC positioning data later in the session to round the week off. 
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% lower at $71.70 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.8% to $74.46. Brent is headed for a 1.2% loss this week, while the U.S. contract is poised to finish the week down 0.1%.

In a notice published on Unigroup's public social media account, attributed simply to Unigroup's management, the company linked its debt situation directly to the leadership of Zhao Weiguo, who spearheaded a wave of asset purchases in the previous decade.
Zhao has retained the post of chairman but China's state council appointed a working group to assume leadership of the company after it defaulted on bonds in November 2020.
The notice comes a day after Zhao published a memo via his personal investment vehicle, Beijing Jiankun, arguing that Beijing Jianguang Asset Management (JAC Capital) and Wise Road Capital, two state-backed firms poised to take over Unigroup, were undervaluing its assets.
Zhao's Beijing Jiankun holds a 49% stake in Unigroup, with the remainder held by China's elite Tsinghua University. In the previous decade, with government funding, Unigroup built up stakes in a number of Chinese chip companies.
In its post, Unigroup management said the value in Zhao's stake in Unigroup via Beijing Jiankun had become negative, and that after several rounds of bidding from strategic investors, the highest offers ""still cannot cover all of Tsinghua Unigroup's debts"". 
Unigroup's management said it ""firmly opposes"" Zhao's attempt to ""interfere with and affect the judicial reorganisation process"" of Unigroup, and will ""take measures to pursue legal liabilities of relevant individuals in accordance with the law"".

The company added that a vote on the pending investment would take place on December 29.

895,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2021 10:45PM ET</span>",U.S. judge tosses $4.5 billion deal shielding Sacklers from opioid lawsuits,"By Brendan Pierson, Mike Spector and Maria Chutchian
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge overturned a roughly $4.5 billion settlement that legally shielded members of the Sackler family who stand accused of helping fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic, a decision that threatened to upend the bankruptcy reorganization of their company, OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP.
U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon said in a written opinion on Thursday the New York bankruptcy court that approved the settlement did not have authority to grant the Sacklers the legal protection from future opioid litigation that formed the linchpin of Purdue’s reorganization.
Purdue said it would appeal the decision.
""While the district court decision does not affect Purdue’s rock-solid operational stability or its ability to produce its many medications safely and effectively, it will delay, and perhaps end, the ability of creditors, communities, and individuals to receive billions in value to abate the opioid crisis,"" Purdue Chairman Steve Miller said in a statement.
The Sacklers had insisted on the legal shields, known as nondebtor releases because they protect parties that have not filed for bankruptcy themselves, in exchange for contributing $4.5 billion toward resolving widespread opioid litigation. 
The Sacklers threatened to walk away from the settlement absent the guaranteed legal protections.
Representatives for the Sacklers did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Thursday.
Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement he was pleased with the ruling.
""The bankruptcy court did not have the authority to deprive victims of the opioid crisis of their right to sue the Sackler family,"" Garland said.
Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who had objected to Purdue's reorganization, also praised McMahon's decision.
“There cannot be two forms of justice – one for ordinary Americans and a different one for billionaires,” Ferguson said. “I’m prepared to take this fight all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary, to ensure true accountability for the Sackler family.”
More than 95% of creditors – in this case predominantly plaintiffs suing Purdue and the Sacklers – voted to approve the drugmaker’s reorganization.
But eight states, Washington, D.C., Seattle and more than 2,600 personal injury claimants voted against Purdue’s reorganization, McMahon said. The U.S. Justice Department’s bankruptcy watchdog and the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office also objected.
McMahon raised questions about more than $10 billion Purdue distributed to the Sacklers spanning a roughly decade-long period that preceded the company’s bankruptcy filing.
The Sacklers have faced allegations, which they deny, that they authorized the financial transfers to prevent the money from being drained in future litigation against Purdue. The Sacklers have said much of the money went toward taxes and investments, as opposed to their pockets.
McMahon's ruling came a week after the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Sacklers, long known for their philanthropy, announced an agreement to remove Sackler name from seven exhibition spaces.
Purdue filed for bankruptcy in September 2019 in the face of 3,000 lawsuits accusing the company and Sackler family members of contributing to a public health crisis that has claimed the lives of about 500,000 people since 1999.
The litigation accused the company and family members of aggressively marketing OxyContin while downplaying its addiction and overdose risks. The company and family members have denied the allegations.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New York, agreed early in Purdue's court restructuring to halt litigation against the company and Sackler family members, who had not filed for Chapter 11 protection themselves.
The Stamford, Connecticut, drugmaker last year pleaded guilty to criminal charges stemming from its handling of opioids. At the outset of its bankruptcy case, Purdue said there were a number of legal defenses it could mount in response to lawsuits alleging improper conduct.
Drain said it was clear the wrongful marketing of the company's opioid products contributed to the addiction crisis that touched every corner of the country.

But he overruled objections to the legal releases shielding the Sacklers. Drain predicted that denying the releases would unravel Purdue’s reorganization – settlement aimed at steering funds toward communities reeling from the opioid epidemic – and result in the company’s liquidation, leaving little to nothing for victims.
McMahon, though, found that the Bankruptcy Code “does not authorize” granting such nonconsensual third-party releases.

896,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2021 10:41PM ET</span>","Beijing rule changes to revive China's IPO prospects in 2022, bankers say","By Scott Murdoch and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Greater China's flagging initial public offerings (IPOs) are set to get a fillip in 2022 from the expected unveiling of new rules by Beijing for Chinese firms' offshore listings, giving clarity to jittery investors, investment bankers and analysts said.
Regulators are contemplating new rules scrutinising offshore listing plans of Chinese companies with variable interest entity (VIE) structure, where a Chinese company sets up an offshore company for overseas listing purposes that allows foreign investors to buy into the stock.
That structure that has enabled a flood of listings in the United States over the past two decades, Reuters has reported.
The new rules will come after a tepid 2021 for Hong Kong, which accounts for 16% of Asia-Pacific listing volume: The city has seen $26.7 billion worth of IPOs so far this year, compared with $31.8 billion for the same period in 2020, Refinitiv data showed.
Adding second listings, which include dual-primary and secondary floats of U.S.-listed Chinese firms, there was $41.3 billion worth of activity in Hong Kong in 2021 to date, compared with $50.8 billion in 2020.
Bankers said the new rules will provide transparency to listing prospects and will enthuse them to turn to public markets, especially firms in the technology and media sectors that were at the centre of an unprecedented regulatory crackdown this year.
""If you're using one word to describe IPOs in 2021, that would have to be 'uncertainty'. There is too much uncertainty on policy,"" said Li Hang, investment bank CLSA's head of equity capital markets (ECM) and syndicate. 
""Next year there will be more and more policy certainty compared to 2021 ... Certainty could mean tougher (rules) but there should be less uncertainty. That is a key thing. The uncertainty really hurts IPOs.""
Bankers expect Hong Kong second listing numbers to improve during 2022 as the threat of being delisted from the U.S. due to not meeting auditing rules there remains high. 
""There are more than 50 U.S.-listed Chinese companies which are not listed in Hong Kong yet but meet the listing requirements here,"" UBS's China head David Chin said.
""We will probably see many of them come to Hong Kong for (second) listings next year.""
STRONG YEAR ELSEWHERE
Despite the Chinese easing in deal volume, across the Asia-Pacific region including Japan, there were $166 billion worth of IPOs this year, well up from $120.1 billion last year, making it the region's strongest year since 2010. 
South Korea, India and Australia each recorded major increases in the value of deals.
""Historically when China slowed down, the region slowed down. This year, despite a slowdown in China, other markets filled that vacuum,"" said William Smiley, co-head of equity capital markets at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asia ex-Japan.
Technology and healthcare sectors provided more than a third of the IPOs in the region during the year. 
""Next year's pipeline looks more diverse both in terms of geography, with Korea, India, Southeast Asia and Australia together being bigger relative to China and more diverse in terms of sector exposure,"" said Magnus Andersson, co-head of Asia Pacific ECM,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).

""We are seeing probably less tech and media and more healthcare, industrials and FIG (financial institutions group). There is a rotation into the cyclicals theme that is playing out globally.""

897,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2021 10:40PM ET</span>","CDC recommends Moderna, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines over J&J's","By Michael Erman
(Reuters) -The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday recommended Americans choose to receive one of two other authorised COVID-19 vaccines over Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s shot, due to rare but sometimes fatal cases of blood-clotting.
The CDC's move came after its Advisory Committee on Immunization voted unanimously to make the recommendation in favour of the vaccines made by  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and Pfizer/BioNTech over the J&J shot. 
Fewer Americans have received the J&J shot than the other two vaccines by a significant margin. Out of more than 200 million fully vaccinated people in the United States, around 16 million received J&J's vaccine, according to CDC data.
J&J said in a statement that the safety and well-being of those who use their vaccine is its top priority and it looks forward to working with the CDC on the next steps.
Cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), which involves blood clots accompanied by a low level of platelets, have previously been reported in recipients of the J&J vaccine. The highest reporting rates are in women under 50. 
The CDC said that the rate of such incidents is higher than previously estimated, both in women and men. The agency has identified more than 50 cases of TTS in the U.S., about 3.83 cases per million J&J doses administered.
At least nine people have died following the blood clotting incidents in the United States, the CDC has said.
Members of the panel also said J&J's vaccine is less effective in preventing COVID-19 than the other two authorized vaccines. 
In a presentation to the committee, a leading J&J vaccine scientist said the vaccine generates a strong and long-lasting immune response with just a single shot.
""In the setting where many people do not return for a second dose or a booster, the durability of the single shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine as a primary regimen could make a crucial difference in saving lives in the U.S. and around the globe,"" J&J's Dr. Penny Heaton said.
J&J's vaccine uses a technology based on a modified version of an adenovirus to spur immunity in recipients, while the other two authorized vaccines use messenger RNA technology.
In the United States, the shot has been useful for reaching some hard-to-reach populations and settings like the homeless and residents of corrections facilities. The vaccine can also be stored and moved at higher temperatures than the mRNA vaccines, which could allow it to be used more easily in some low- and middle-income countries.
J&J's one-dose vaccine received emergency use authorization in March. In April, U.S. regulators paused administering the vaccine for 10 days in order to investigate the blood clotting.

A CDC scientist said on Thursday that the rate of deaths from TTS did not decrease after the pause in April.
J&J shares closed up around 1 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. The company sells the vaccine at a not-for-profit price, so it has not been a significant revenue driver.

The activist fund has been seeking a board seat and believes the company needs to sell assets aggressively and buy back stock.
American Campus said that one of its board committees interviewed Land & Buildings' Chief Executive Jonathan Litt for a board seat on Nov. 18 and that he did not provide follow-up information he had indicated he would give. 
A Land & Buildings spokesperson said American Campus did not respond Land & Buildings' last communication. In a presentation to American Campus shareholders on Thursday, Litt reiterated his demands for a board seat and said discussions with the company ""had stalled out over the past weeks.""
American Campus staved off a board challenge from Land & Buildings in January by agreeing to replenish its board with three new directors. Since then, its shares have returned 39% and are trading near their all-time highs, as students returned to college campuses when vaccines became available to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
Litt argues the shares could have done even better, saying that they have underperformed the Bloomberg Apartment REIT Index by 18 percentage points since January.
He has called on American Campus to speed up asset sales, cut expenses, return capital to shareholders and explore strategic alternatives, including a sale of the company.
American Campus said on Thursday it had refined its portfolio to focus on properties within walking distance of popular universities and returned its total property net operating income to pre-pandemic levels a year earlier than expected.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration still has not decided whether to block more sales of U.S. technology to Chinese chipmaker SMIC, but raised the possibility of discussing with allies further restrictions on selling chip-making equipment to China, sources familiar with a Thursday meeting on the topic said.
Officials at the meeting of deputies from various U.S. agencies talked about a proposal to toughen sales to SMIC and other chipmakers in China, the sources said. The officials appeared to agree that the U.S. should work with friendly countries on a more restrictive policy, one source said.
A spokesperson for the White House declined to comment.
The Trump administration placed Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) on the U.S. Department of Commerce's trade blacklist late last year over concerns of SMIC's aiding China's military.
The listing, which requires U.S. suppliers to obtain a license before shipping chipmaking equipment and other goods, allows most sales to be decided on a case-by-case basis. However, equipment that can be used to make only the most advanced, 10-nanometer and smaller chips is held to a higher standard and is likely to be denied.
The policy change being considered would restrict sales of items that could also be used for less advanced chips.

However, chip equipment makers argue that if SMIC is not supplied by U.S. equipment makers, the company will buy from other countries.
Reuters has reported that export license requests for SMIC were already slow to get approval.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's second-largest lender, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY), defended its environmental credentials on Friday as investors at an annual meeting complained its emissions disclosures are less complete than its Big Four rivals.
Almost half of all questions put to Chairman Philip Chronican at the meeting came from investors and shareholder groups who said they were concerned about the bank's reputation and risks from its funding of carbon-intensive industries.
""Compared to us, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) and Westpac, both disclose their exposure to the energy value chain,"" shareholder Johanna Gardner said.
She complained that NAB instead was only disclosing exposures to oil and gas extraction and coal mining, but not to coal ports, oil and gas transportation, refining and retail distribution.
NAB does not disclose emissions from the entire value chain, but Chronican denied the bank was a laggard, saying it was the only major Australian lender to put clear restrictions on direct financing of greenfield oil and gas extraction.
It was also the only big Australian bank to have set a goal to reduce oil and gas exposures from 2026 through 2050, and was planning to publish ""emissions intensity exposure plans"" for eight sectors in the next 12 months, he added.
""We should not be making any commitment or making any disclosure that we cannot support,"" Chronican told the virtual meeting from Melbourne.
""By this time next year we should be able to satisfy you by having a clear, coherent and well-thought through position ... (and) making sure that it is fully auditable.""

Chronican urged investors to reject a shareholder resolution calling for stricter environmental policies and disclosures that was not tabled due to restrictions under Australian corporate law. 
The resolution, which also asked for a firm commitment from the bank to not fund any fossil fuel projects in line with calls by the International Energy Agency, was therefore rejected. It received 10.8% of proxy votes of support before the meeting.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Friday morning, even as the recent tighter monetary policies from central banks boosted investor sentiment.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.80% by 9:19 PM ET (2:19 AM GMT), while South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.12%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.70%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.60%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.55% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.53%.
Central banks globally are tightening their monetary settings to curb high inflation, while also monitoring the impact from the omicron COVID-19 variant.
The U.S. Federal Reserve quickened the pace of its asset tapering program while projecting three quarter-point rate increases in 2022, another three in 2023, and two more in 2024, as it handed down its policy decision on Wednesday.
Some investors are now warning that global stocks could be due for a rougher patch after almost doubling from COVID-19 lows.
“The cycle you are seeing here is really about a change in tone, a change in regime, the possibility of tighter policy in 2022, not just at the Fed, but globally,” BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) Wealth Management head of equities and capital markets advisory Alicia Levine told Bloomberg.
In a surprise move, the Bank of England hiked its interest rate to 0.25% when it handed down its policy decision on Thursday. The European Central Bank, which handed down its policy on the same day, temporarily boosted regular monthly bond-buying for half a year.
In Asia Pacific, the Bank of Japan will hand down its monetary policy decision later in the day.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate failed to pass a bill for President Joe Biden’s $2 trillion economic agenda, with action on the tax and spending bill delayed to January 2022.
However, it did pass legislation that will ban goods from China’s Xinjiang region unless there is proof that they were not made with forced labor. The U.S. also added 34 Chinese targets to its banned entity list.
On the U.S. data front, the number of initial jobless claims for the week was a higher-than-expected 206,000 and building permits were at 1.712 million in November. The manufacturing purchasing managers index was at 57.8, and the services PMI was 57.5, for December.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on Thursday asked five ""buy-now, pay-later"" companies for information on their business practices, amid concerns that the financing products are putting consumers at risk. 
The agency issued the order to Affirm Holdings, Afterpay Ltd, Klarna, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Zip Co in the wake of a boom in ""buy-now, pay-later"" services, which allow consumers to split purchase payments into installments, driven in part by online shopping growth during the coronavirus pandemic. 
The CFPB said it is concerned about ""accumulating debt, regulatory arbitrage, and data harvesting"" and is seeking data on the risks and benefits of the products.
""The consumer gets the product immediately but gets the debt immediately too,"" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement.
A survey in September by personal finance company Credit Karma found that one-third of U.S. consumers who used ""buy-now, pay-later"" services have fallen behind on one or more payments, and 72% of those said their credit scores declined.
A Klarna spokesperson told Reuters that ""we believe proportionate regulation is a good thing."" 
""We welcome the CFPB's review and support regulatory efforts that benefit consumers and promote transparency,"" a spokesperson for Affirm said.
Afterpay said it supports ""efforts to ensure that there are appropriate regulatory protections for consumers"" in relation to ""buy-now pay-later"" practices.
PayPal said it was reviewing the CFPB inquiry and would comply. ""Our customers trust us to be transparent and we take this responsibility very seriously,"" a spokesperson said.
Zip did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The information requests are part of a broader push by Chopra, a former Democratic commissioner at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, to stamp out market abuses and boost competition in the consumer finance sector.
He is under pressure from Democratic progressives to reinvigorate the CFPB after it pulled back from enforcement and tough policymaking during the Trump administration.
Banking groups, who have lobbied for regulators to scrutinize non-traditional financial firms, cheered the agency's move, which sent stocks of Australia-listed Afterpay, Zip and Sezzle Inc tumbling more than 6% in early trading on Friday.

""It's good to see the CFPB take this much-needed step to protect consumers,"" said Richard Hunt, who leads the Washington-based Consumer Bankers Association.
Thursday's request follows an October CFPB order demanding information from big tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), PayPal, Square and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent company, Meta, on how they gather and use consumer payment data.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - The 10 people who died in a stampede at rapper Travis Scott's concert at the Astroworld Festival in Houston last month accidentally suffocated, the Harris County medical examiner ruled on Thursday.
The victims, aged 9 to 27 years old, died of compression asphyxia, the examiner's report concluded, essentially crushed to death in the crowd surrounding the stage. Another 300 people were injured among the audience of 50,000 people.
Victims were trapped and hemmed in by barricades on three sides, unable to escape as thousands of fans rushed toward the stage while Scott performed. Eyewitnesses said spectators fell to the ground and some were trampled by the crowd. 
The medical examiner ruled out homicide, or death caused by another person, in all 10 cases.
“This re-opens a fresh wound for many families who are still trying to make sense of what happened,"" said Harris County's top executive Lina Hidalgo.
""Bharti Shahani suffered a horrific death as she was suffocated within a massive crowd,"" said attorney James Lassiter, who represents the Shahani family. The findings ""confirm Bharti's family's worst fears,"" he said. 
A spokesperson for Scott declined immediate comment. His attorney and representatives for Live Nation did not reply to requests for comment. 
A Houston police spokesperson declined immediate comment.
The medical examiner's finding could shape the direction of a police criminal investigation into the tragedy, which has shaken Houston and raised issues about crowd control and security at entertainment mega-events. 
There have been no charges filed by police but at least 200 lawsuits including several by family members of the deceased have been filed against 29-year-old Scott, festival promoter Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV), the NRG Park concert venue, and others involved in the event.
The family of Mirza Danish Baig, 27, sued organizers for negligence and wrongful death, alleging they failed to stop the show ""when it was obvious they had lost complete control of the situation,"" according to their lawyer. At least two other families also filed negligence lawsuits.
Compression asphyxia is caused by a force from the front or back preventing the lungs from expanding, said Dr. Ron Albarado, an acute care trauma surgeon, at UT Health Houston. Deaths can occur in about 15-20 minutes in a crowd surging back and forth, he said. 

What Scott and organizers knew of the unfolding tragedy before ending the concert is part of the police investigation. The concert continued for more than 30 minutes after it was declared a mass casualty event, and after police told the promoter to halt it, Houston Chief Troy Finner has said.
Scott was unaware of the full extent of what had happened until the next morning, his attorney has said, and the rapper offered to help with the families' funeral expenses. Festival director and executive producers, not Scott, were responsible for deciding when to end the concert, his attorney has said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fox News Network on Thursday lost its attempt to dismiss a $1.6 billion lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems Inc, a voting machine company that says Fox defamed it by amplifying conspiracy theories about its technology.
In a written ruling, Delaware court judge Eric Davis said Dominion had sufficiently alleged it was defamed by Fox News' 2020 election coverage and the case should proceed toward trial.
""At this stage, it is reasonably conceivable that Dominion has a claim for defamation per se,"" Davis said in his ruling. ""Accordingly, Fox’s Motion should be denied.""
Dominion's lawsuit, filed in March, accused Fox of trying to boost its TV ratings by amplifying false conspiracy theories that the company rigged the presidential election against Republican Donald Trump, who lost to Joe Biden, a Democrat.
Trump campaign surrogates, including lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, floated conspiracy theories that Dominion rigged vote totals in the weeks after the Nov. 3, 2020 presidential election.
In a statement, a Fox News spokesperson called Dominion's lawsuit ""baseless"" and said the network remains committed to defending itself.
“As we have maintained, FOX News, along with every single news organization across the country, vigorously covered the breaking news surrounding the unprecedented 2020 election, providing full context of every story with in-depth reporting and clear-cut analysis,"" the Fox spokesperson said.

Dominion and Smartmatic, another election software company at the center of pro-Trump conspiracy theories, are seeking billions of dollars in damages from Trump allies they accuse of defamation, including Powell, Giuliani, and MyPillow Inc Chief Executive Mike Lindell.
In August, a judge denied motions to dismiss filed by Powell, Giuliani, and Lindell. The Trump allies continue to defend themselves in court, arguing that their remarks about Dominion and Smartmatic were free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

(Reuters) -Kellogg Co and the union representing striking workers at its U.S. breakfast cereal plants have reached a tentative agreement on a new five-year contract that could pave the way for the employees to return to work two days after Christmas.
The 1,400 workers have been on strike since Oct. 5 and earlier this month overwhelmingly rejected the last tentative deal after which Kellogg (NYSE:K) said it would permanently replace the striking workers, a move criticized by U.S. President Joe Biden.
The union said on Thursday progress has been made on a few key issues from the previous proposal, including increases in the cost of living wages and removal of the term ""legacy employee.""
""Transitional employees have an accelerated, defined path to legacy wages and benefits as compared to the current contract,"" Kellogg said.
Voting on the new deal will be held on Sunday and votes will be counted in Kingston, Maryland on Tuesday, according to Dan Osborn, president of the local union in Omaha. 
If the workers vote in favor of the proposal, plants in Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania and Tennessee could function at full capacity again. Those plants are currently being run by temporary hires.
""The fact that they (Kellogg) have suggested yet another agreement does highlight the fact that the workers really have the upper hand at this point,"" said Ileen DeVault, a labor history professor at Cornell University.
The retiree healthcare coverage cap and the limit on the number of lower-tier employees, however, continue to be a sticking point in the negotiations.

""Increasing the cap for premiums on retiree health insurance would prevent workers from accruing too much medical debt during the golden years,"" Osborn said.
Striking workers have also said a two-tier employee system proposed by Kellogg, in which transitional employees get lesser pay and benefits compared with longer-tenured workers, would gradually reduce the union's power.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) reinstated its original fiscal 2022 forecast on Thursday, even as persistent labor woes chipped away profits ahead of the peak holiday season when the number of packages it handles often doubles.
Shares in the company, which also reported flat year-over-year adjusted profit for the fiscal second quarter, were up 5% to $250.50 in after-hours trading.
FedEx Chief Operating Officer Raj Subramaniam said labor pressures should ease going forward. 
""We are essentially staffed up for peak,"" said Subramaniam. He added that the carrier believes it can retain required labor for the remainder of its fiscal year. 
Concerns have eased that this year's festive season could see a repeat of 2020's ""Shipageddon"" pandemic delivery delays. Retailers have reduced the pressure on carriers like FedEx and  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) by urging early shopping and expanding pick-up and gig-delivery options. At the same time, most stores remain open despite accelerating numbers of Omicron variant infections. 
Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx now expects full-year earnings, excluding items, of $20.50 to $21.50 per share, as it had first forecast. In September, FedEx lowered that range to $19.75 to $21.00 per share. 
Adjusted net income was $1.3 billion, or $4.83 per share, for the quarter ended Nov. 30, unchanged from the year earlier.
During the company's fiscal second quarter, labor shortages again disrupted normal work flows - resulting in network inefficiencies, higher purchased transportation costs, and higher wage rates. Those factors increased costs by an estimated $470 million year-over-year, primarily at FedEx Ground. The company put those costs at $450 million for its fiscal first quarter. 
In the latest quarter, FedEx paid ""significantly"" higher taxes, but benefited from lower fuel prices. 
Revenue increased 14% to $23.5 billion, fueled in part by elevated demand for e-commerce home deliveries - including some holiday gifts.
Experts and some customers said FedEx is trailing UPS and the U.S. Postal Service in on-time deliveries, however.
""FedEx delivery times are really lagging and I believe it's due to their staffing issue,"" said Cathy Morrow Roberson, president of consultancy Logistics Trends & Insights.
From Nov. 14 to Dec. 4 - which included the Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday holiday shopping days - on-time performance was 85.7% for FedEx, 96.4% at UPS, and 95.1% for the U.S. Postal Service, according to delivery invoice auditor ShipMatrix. 

Results for the week of Dec. 5 so far appear to be mostly in line with prior weeks, ShipMatrix founder Satish Jindel said. 
FedEx's Ground deadline for Christmas delivery was Wednesday, Dec. 15.

DETROIT (Reuters) -Amazon-backed electric vehicle startup Rivian Automotive Inc on Thursday said it will build a $5 billion plant in Georgia, its second U.S. assembly plant, as it looks to expand production.
In its first publicly reported quarterly results since it went public last month, Rivian posted a third-quarter net loss of $1.2 billion. Rivian's shares tumbled 9.8% in after-hours trading after the company said it expected production to fall a few hundred vehicles short of its 2021 target of 1,200 and its pre-order numbers disappointed some on Wall Street.
""Launching and ramping production of three different vehicles within a few months is an incredibly tough challenge,"" Chief Executive R.J. Scaringe said on a conference call. 
Issues he cited included global supply-chain constraints, the COVID-19 pandemic, a tight labor market and short-term issues around building electric battery modules. 
Scaringe added Rivian was focused on pulling ahead the timeline for increasing production of its vehicles.
The pickup launched in September and the SUV this week, and Rivian has delivered 386 of the 652 vehicles it has built. It said it plans to ship the first vans to Amazon this month. 
With a market value of almost $93 billion, Rivian made its Nasdaq debut last month in the world's biggest initial public offering of 2021. Rivian raised almost $14 billion in the IPO to fund future growth on top of the $10.5 billion it had raised privately from such investors as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. Amazon owns 20% of Rivian and Ford owns about 12%. 
The Irvine, California-based company has struggled with the launch of its R1T pickup, R1S SUV and delivery van for Amazon as supply-chain constraints, including chip shortages, hit automakers globally. 
During the pandemic, the chip shortage forced automakers to curtail vehicle production and limited inventories pushed up prices. Companies are now scrambling to protect operations against the spread of the omicron variant of the coronavirus. 
Rivian, other startups and established automakers are racing to take on EV leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc as pressure grows in regions including China and Europe to eliminate vehicle emissions. 
Rivian's Georgia plant will eventually employ more than 7,500 people and build 400,000 vehicles a year. It is scheduled to open in 2024 with in-house battery cell production, largely confirming plans previously outlined in documents filed with other states. Rivian and the state of Georgia did not disclose the tax incentives the company will receive.
The new plant east of Atlanta, with construction set to begin next summer, will join the one in Normal, Illinois. Rivian intends to eventually open plants in Europe and China. Scaringe previously said Rivian plans to build at least 1 million vehicles a year by the end of the decade.
The Illinois plant currently has an annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles and Rivian has said it intends to increase that to 200,000 by 2023 as it adds new vehicles. The company said it is adding as many as 1,000 new jobs there by the second quarter of 2022. 
On Thursday, Rivian said that as of Dec. 15, it had about 71,000 R1T and R1S pre-orders in the United States and Canada, up from 55,400 it reported at the end of October.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas said the new order count seems to have come in at the low end of expectations.
Ford said this month it had capped reservations for its F-150 Lightning electric pickup at 200,000. 

Rivian also has a contract to build 100,000 electric delivery vans for Amazon by 2025. 
On Thursday, Rivian reported a third-quarter net loss of $1.2 billion, or $12.21 a share. Excluding a loss of $458 million after issuing senior convertible notes, its adjusted operated loss was $776 million. Rivian also reported revenue of $1 million after it started to ship its first vehicles in September.

The U.S. automaker did not give a reason for the departure of Ammann, a former GM president and chief financial officer.

Cruise had once hoped to start its commercial robo-taxi service by the end of 2019. Two years later, it is still waiting for final permits to start a limited service in a section of San Francisco. 
GM said on Thursday it would accelerate its strategy in which Cruise will play an integral role in building GM's autonomous vehicle (AV) platform as it ""aggressively pursues addressable AV markets beyond rideshare and delivery."" 
""By continuing to work together, GM and Cruise bring massive manufacturing and technological scale to autonomy that will rapidly drive costs down.""
Self-driving startups are racing to build warchests to develop and scale up technology, an expensive and time-consuming process.
Cruise said in June it would gain access to a multi-year $5 billion line of credit, with GM's finance arm to fund its purchase of Origin vehicles starting in early 2023.
Cruise in April raised $2.75 billion with additional investment from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and others, taking the startup's valuation over $30 billion, Reuters reported at the time.

Earlier this month, Cruise pushed back on claims from San Francisco authorities that its robotaxis are illegally double-parking, saying they have the right to block traffic for quick stops.
The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) has challenged Cruise's application for a permit to deploy robotaxis in San Francisco on the grounds that it was illegally ""double parking"" during testing, creating safety and traffic concerns. The agency called for denying the permit until Cruise's technology could demonstrate greater competency.

913,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2021 05:51PM ET</span>","Wall Street firms retreat from office, holiday parties as virus spreads","By Noor Zainab Hussain, Matt Scuffham and Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) - Wall Street banks and investment firms are retrenching from their push to get staff back to the office, with  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS),  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc, Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and MetLife among the latest to adjust plans as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus spreads. 
The institutions are rethinking their plans to return to business-as-usual amid a spike in COVID-19 cases in New York and other financial hubs and growing concerns over the fast-spreading Omicron.
""Even before Omicron, it was clear that there was not going to be a full ‘back to normal’ in most office-based jobs – some form of work from home is likely to endure into the future,"" Rachel Lipson, Project on Workforce at Harvard University’s Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy, said in a recent interview.
Citigroup told staff at its New York metro area offices on Wednesday they should work from home if they are able to, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Vaccinated staff had been allowed to return to some Citigroup offices in recent months.
U.S. insurer MetLife Inc (NYSE:MET) on Thursday told its nearly 14,000 U.S. staff it had postponed plans for them to return to the office to March from Jan. 10 previously, a spokeswoman for the company said.
Blackstone employees were welcome to work from home through the rest of the month given the increasing spread of COVID-19 in the United States, a spokesperson said.
Goldman Sachs, which has not sent staff home, had hosted holiday parties over the last few weeks but on Thursday said it was canceling remaining gatherings due to worries over COVID-19, according to a source familiar with the bank's plans. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is expecting staff who are not required to be in the office to take advantage of that flexibility and work from home and spend more time with their families, but it is not sending staff home and doesn't have a work-from-home policy, a source familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
Investment firms followed suit. Carlyle is encouraging its U.S. employees to work from home for the remainder of the year and plans to return to a hybrid work model in the new year, a source familiar with the situation said. It is also not planning a firm-wide holiday party, the source said.
The Omicron variant has been detected in 77 countries since it was first identified three weeks ago, fuelling concerns that its large number of mutations will help it spread faster and evade protection provided by COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics.
""We are in transition period still,"" Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman said in a CNBC interview on Monday. ""I thought we would be out of it by Labor day, past Labor day. We're not. I think we will still be in it through most of next year. Everyone is still finding their way.""

Earlier this week, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) told unvaccinated staff in Manhattan to work from home, while investment bank Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Financial Group last week asked staff in Manhattan and elsewhere to again steer clear of the office due to a spate of COVID-19 cases.
A similar situation is occurring with institutions in Canada offices amid growing concerns over the spread of the Omicron variant in that country. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) said on Wednesday they have asked staff in Canada to work remotely, joining Bank of Nova Scotia in halting plans for a return to work.

914,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2021 05:31PM ET</span>",World shares mixed after flurry of cenbank statements,"By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - World share markets were mixed on Thursday, with European shares rising after Britain and Norway hiked interest rates and the ECB trimmed its super-sized bond buying program, while global markets struggled to maintain direction a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve sped up the pace of tapering.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.23% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe was down 0.13% after shifting from positive to negative territory over the U.S. trading day.
In the United States, recent readings on surging producer and consumer prices as well as the fast-spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus have fueled anxiety.
The Nasdaq ended the day sharply lower as the Federal Reserve's decision to taper sooner than previously stated pushed investors toward more economically sensitive sectors and away from growth and technology stocks.
Oil settled above $75 a barrel, supported by record U.S. implied demand and falling crude stockpiles, as well as the positive economic outlook indicated by the Fed on Wednesday.
UK bank shares shot up after the BOE hiked rates by 0.15 percentage point to 0.25%, while Turkey's lira took another bashing after its own central bank plowed on with rate cuts. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.08% to end at 35,897.64, while the S&P 500 lost 0.87% to 4,668.67. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.47% to 15,180.44.
U.S. crude settled 2.13% higher at $72.38 a barrel, while Brent settled up 1.54% at $75.02.
The dollar index fell 0.409%, and the euro rose 0.02% to $1.133. 
U.S. 10-year yields were at 1.4241%, while 30-year yields were at 1.8668% .
The Fed had laid out a scenario in which the pandemic, despite the Omicron surge, gives way to a benign set of economic conditions, with inflation easing largely on its own, interest rates increasing slowly and unemployment staying low.
Data out Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased moderately last week, though they remained at levels consistent with tightening labor market conditions.
Separately, a survey showed production at U.S. factories increased to its highest level in nearly three years in November.
""After the (Fed meeting Wednesday), it is hard to get excited about this round of economic data, but so far it mostly supports the Fed’s hawkish course,"" said Edward Moya, analyst at OANDA. 
The ECB in Frankfurt said it would cut its bond purchases under its 1.85 trillion euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) next quarter and wind down the scheme by March in a long-flagged move.
It will, however, keep reinvesting PEPP profits until the end of 2024 and ramp up the longer-running but more rigid Asset Purchase Programme to limit the withdrawal effects.
""On balance, the new approach to quantitative easing is slightly dovish,"" said Gurpreet Gill, macro strategist, global fixed income, at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management. 
Norway's central bank, which had hiked in September on the back of an economic rebound, went ahead with a further rise as expected and said more were likely to follow. The Swiss National Bank kept its rates locked at -0.75%.

The Turkish lira plunged as much as 5.6% to a record low of 15.689 against the dollar on Thursday after the central bank slashed its policy rate in line with an unorthodox economic program set out by President Tayyip Erdogan.
The dollar has more than doubled in value against the lira this year, rattling Turkey's big emerging market economy. Worries are mounting about what could happen if low rates and stimulus ahead of presidential elections in 2023 continue to ramp up inflation, which already stands above 20%.

Given the industry’s solid long-term growth prospects, it is wise to bet on chip stocks Micron (MU),  NXP Semiconductors  (NASDAQ:NXPI), ON Semiconductor (ON), and Kulicke and Soffa (KLIC) now.Analysts expect the ongoing semiconductor shortage to last through next year. However, the global semiconductor industry delivered a 24% year-over-year sales growth in October 2021. Also, the possibility of the House’s passage of the $52 billion CHIPS Act by the end of this year and increasing corporate investments to ramp up chip production is likely to ease the situation by the end of 2022. The growing investor optimism in this space is evident in the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF’s (XSD) 16.8% gains over the past three months, surpassing the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 5.1% returns.
Moreover, consistent chipmaking breakthroughs should foster the industry’s long-term growth. The global semiconductor chips market is expected to grow at 7.8% CAGR and reach $553.60 billion by 2026.

As part of the settlement, ex-CEO Steve Easterbrook returned equity awards and cash worth over $105 million that he received as a severance package in 2019, McDonald's said in a statement on Thursday.
McDonald's sued Easterbrook in August 2020, nine months after reaching a severance deal, claiming he never gave directors a complete picture of his relationships with employees. 
The company said that when it fired Easterbrook, it only knew of one non-physical consensual relationship with an employee. But an anonymous tip after his ouster led to the discovery of dozens of sexually explicit photos of women, including three employees, that Easterbrook sent to his personal email from his company account.
In his response to the lawsuit at the time, Easterbrook had claimed that McDonald's had information about his relationships on its computer systems when it negotiated his severance package.
""Today's resolution avoids a protracted court process and moves us beyond a chapter that belongs in our past,"" McDonald's Chairman Enrique Hernandez Jr. said in a message to employees seen by Reuters.
McDonald's said it would dismiss its action against Easterbrook with prejudice.

""During my tenure as CEO, I failed at times to uphold McDonald's values and fulfill certain of my responsibilities as a leader of the company. I apologize to my former co-workers, the Board, and the company's franchisees and suppliers for doing so,""  Easterbrook said in the same news statement provided by McDonald's.
McDonald's said in April it would require new training at its restaurants to fight harassment and discrimination after facing lawsuits accusing it of subjecting female employees at corporate-owned outlets to widespread sexual harassment.

PARIS (Reuters) - Recent order wins by Airbus have strengthened the European planemaker's case for raising production of its A320-family narrowbody jets beyond a firm target of 65 a month, a senior executive said on Thursday.
Asked whether deals with Qantas and Air France-KLM had reinforced Airbus' ambitions to go ahead with further increases, opposed by some suppliers and leasing firms, Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said ""yes.""
""What we are seeing materialise in formal decisions is something that we could see coming for months now,"" Scherer told Reuters in an interview. 
""It now publicly strengthens what we kind of knew all along,"" he said, adding he did not want to seem over-confident.
Airbus has been arguing for months that post-pandemic demand for the industry's most widely used narrowbody models will justify an increase in output to well above pre-crisis rates.
Airbus A320-family output reached a record 60 a month in 2019 before falling back to 40 a month when the crisis hit air travel last year.
Airbus now plans to increase output to 65 a month and has said it is pondering rates as high as 75.
Engine makers and some other suppliers have voiced reservations, fearing the snapback in demand would either be short-lived or would push existing jets into retirement too quickly, harming their maintenance profits for older jets.
Others say supply chains remain too tight to raise rates.
However, the latest Airbus orders generated a significant breakthrough for U.S. engine maker Pratt & Whitney at Qantas.
""It would seem that Pratt & Whitney's recent success indicates they are in agreement with the Airbus view of the market,"" Scherer said.
He hailed the sale of new A350 freighters to two airlines - Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) and Air France-KLM - in as many days.
After launching the jet mid-year, Airbus had to wait several months to win the first order at last month's Dubai Airshow.
This week's tentative deals for a combined total of 11 freighters are the first from major network carriers.

""We were right to believe in it and were ... surprised by how quickly and how forcefully the market has endorsed the product,"" Scherer said.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is expected to hit back with a freighter version of its future 777X in an effort to maintain its dominance of the air cargo market, with Qatar Airways dangling a large order.

(Reuters) -Workers at a Kentucky candle factory that was destroyed by a tornado last week have filed a lawsuit claiming supervisors threatened to fire employees who left work as the storm approached.
The proposed class-action lawsuit filed Wednesday in Kentucky state court claims Mayfield Consumer Products barred 110 workers from leaving the premises even though it had more than three hours' notice before the tornado touched down.
Elijah Johnson, 20, says in the lawsuit that the company showed flagrant indifference toward workers' safety by forcing them to remain on the job even after they expressed concerns about the approaching storm.

929,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2021 04:16PM ET</span>",Italy's TIM issues third profit warning of 2021 amid boardroom battle,"By Francesca Landini
MILAN (Reuters) -  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) has issued its third profit warning this year ahead of a board meeting on Friday that is expected to take more time before acting on a takeover offer from U.S. fund KKR.
TIM, which is Europe's sixth-largest telecoms group, said late on Wednesday that it cut the 2021 earnings forecast for its domestic business due to lower-than-expected fixed-line revenue from its partnership with DAZN to screen Italian soccer.
Top shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) has blamed former TIM Chief Executive Officer Luigi Gubitosi for the phone group's poor financial performance and could seek an overhaul to oust him from its board of directors, four sources told Reuters on Wednesday on condition of anonymity.
The board will meet on Friday to discuss, among other things, KKR's 33 billion euro ($37.29 billion) takeover proposal, but a source said it was unlikely any major step forward would occur.
""Telecom can't evaluate the KKR approach at the moment because the conditions are not there,"" the source said, adding that a decision to grant the fund access to its books was improbable.
Any decision may have to wait for the group's new business plan early next year, the source said.
""Such a scenario slightly reduces the likelihood of a bid, testing the patience of KKR,"" Banca Akros analyst Andrea De Vita said in a note.
KKR, which already has a stake in TIM's last-mile network FiberCop, has requested a period of due diligence before it formalises the offer it submitted on Nov. 19, but it has set no deadline.
The impasse over governance also risks complicating things. 
If Gubitosi does not resign as a director at Friday's meeting, Vivendi could request an extraordinary shareholder meeting be called to appoint a new board, two sources have said. 
A board revamp could also be triggered by the resignation of a majority of directors.
TIM shares ended down 0.9 on Thursday.
TIM now expects a ""low-teens decrease"" in 2021 organic earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation after leases (EBITDA-AL) for its domestic business. In October, it forecast a ""high single-digit decrease"" for the business.
""This new guidance implies a very negative fourth quarter (for domestic business core earnings) compared to the 9.8% fall posted in the nine months, leading to a potential drop of more than 20% year-on-year,"" De Vita said.
DAZN DEAL
Earlier this year, TIM entered into a 1 billion euro deal with sport streaming service DAZN to try to boost its broadband and pay-TV services.
TIM is now looking to cut the cost of the deal after the accord to distribute Italy's top-flight soccer league matches generated less revenue than expected.
Any non-recurring provision will be determined in light of the ongoing negotiation of the DAZN agreement and will be booked in 2021, TIM said in a statement.
TIM said it expected group organic EBITDA-AL for 2021 to be higher than 5.4 billion euros thanks to growth at its Brazilian business unit, which was confirmed at a ""mid-single-digit"" rate.
EBITDA-AL was 6.3 billion euros in 2020, according to TIM's annual report, and the group previously flagged a ""mid-single-digit"" drop for this year.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) brokerage said consensus for 2021 organic EBITDA-AL was 5.8 billion euros at group level.
After a payment of 435 million euros for licences, the company's adjusted consolidated net financial debt is expected to be around 17.6 billion euros.

Investing.com -- Stocks fell Thursday, especially technology shares, after central bankers in the U.S. and Europe signaled different approaches to combating surging prices while trying to help their economies recover from the pandemic.
The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday decided to hold rates steady for now but hastened its efforts to wind down monthly bond buying by spring, which would clear the way for three rate hikes next year. 
Meanwhile, the Bank of England said Thursday it would raise its benchmark rate, and the European Central Bank said it would phase out bond buying but increase other stimulus efforts.
Many wondered if the so-called “Santa rally” could sustain itself after the quick pivot of policy makers to taming inflation even as a new variant of coronavirus threatens to upend travel and business.
The Omicron variant has stoked worries that the economic recovery could suddenly reverse, though vaccines and boosters have shown some effectiveness in holding back serious illness.
On Thursday, data showed new claims for unemployment benefits ticked higher slightly last week though still remain far below the pandemic peak. 
Homebuilder  Lennar  Corporation (NYSE:LEN)fell after reporting higher lumber costs and supply chain issues.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Adobe tumble
Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE) tumbled 9% Thursday after the company’s forecast for 2022 revenue came in short of expectations.
The design software-maker expects revenue to hit $17.9 billion in the ongoing financial year, up over 13% year-on-year but sharply slower than the 23% rate the 2021 revenue grew to top $15 billion.
According to Bloomberg estimates, the company was expected to peg its annual forecast at $18.2 billion.
2. Breadstick, anyone?
Darden Restaurants Inc (NYSE:DRI) will report its second-quarter numbers Friday. The full-service dining chain is expected to report a profit per share of $1.44 on revenue of $2.23 billion.
3. RV earnings
 Winnebago Industries Inc  (NYSE:WGO) is seen reporting a first-quarter revenue of $1.04 billion and profit per share of $2.36.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 slipped Thursday, as a rout in big tech more than offset a rise in cyclicals a day after the Federal Reserve laid out a plan to speed up bond purchase tapering and begin hiking rates next year.
The S&P 500 fell 0.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained fell 0.1%, or 29.7 points, the Nasdaq fell 2.5%. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell more than 3% leading the rout in big tech as Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), also ending the day in the red.
Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) was also a big loser on the day, shedding more than 10% after software maker’s fiscal 2022 fell short of Wall Street estimates.
The selloff in growth sectors like tech come a day after the Federal Reserve said it would double the pace of its monthly bond tapering to $30 billion per month, and forecast up to three hikes for next year and 2023.
“That decision [of when to hike rates] will be taken ‘in coming meetings’, which puts June in play, one quarter earlier than our call for 3Q22 liftoff,” Morgan Stanley said in a note.
Financials, meanwhile, racked up gains as investors bet that the U.S. Treasury yields are set for a boost following the slightly more hawkish than expected path of rate hikes laid out by the U.S. central bank on Wednesday.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK),  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) were among the biggest gainers as banks' net interest margin will benefit from a rising yield environment.
Other value sectors of the market, which tend to move tandem with economy, like materials and energy also advanced.
Energy was up nearly 1%, riding the climb higher in the oil prices as investors continued to assess the demand the outlook for energy following a bullish update from the Energy Information Agency.
“[The] US Department of Energy reported a considerable decline in crude oil and oil product stocks, with crude oil seeing its most pronounced inventory reduction since September,” Commerzbank said.
In health care, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) ended the day more than 1% higher despite an advisory panel for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted unanimously to recommend vaccines from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) over the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

Investing.com —  Affirm Holdings  Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM) shares have taken a 16% tumble Thursday after Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced a series of orders to five companies that offer ""Buy Now Pay Later"" (BNPL) credit.
BNPL credit is a payment option that allows the consumer to defer payments and split them into smaller installments.
The orders were for the CFPB to collect information on the risks and benefits of the rapidly growing loan firms. The orders were sent to Affirm, Afterpay Ltd (OTC:AFTPY), Klarna,  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Zip. 
Alongside Affirm, PayPal shares have dipped just 0.8%. U.S. over-the-counter shares of Afterpay, which is being acquired by Square, a part of Block Inc (NYSE:SQ), have fallen over 5%.
In a consumer credit market quickly changing due to technology, the regulator said it is concerned with accumulating debt, regulatory arbitrage, and data harvesting. 
“Buy now, pay later is the new version of the old layaway plan, but with modern, faster twists where the consumer gets the product immediately but gets the debt immediately too,” explained CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. 
“We have ordered Affirm, Afterpay, Klarna, PayPal, and Zip to submit information so that we can report to the public about industry practices and risks.”
The CFPB concluded by saying it is working with international partners in Australia, Sweden, Germany and the U.K., specifically the Financial Conduct Authority. "

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration's nominee to serve as the top auto safety regulator said Thursday he hopes the agency will soon finish its investigations into crashes involving automated driving systems used in electric vehicles made by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
Steven Cliff, deputy administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and nominated for the top job, was asked about the agency's probes into Tesla and he said ""we hope to have those investigations wrapped up soon."" He said he did not have a ""precise timeline.""
Cliff added the agency works closely with automakers on probes. ""We're gathering data now and we'll determine what those next steps will be,"" Cliff said.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
NHTSA in August opened a formal safety probe into Tesla's Autopilot system in 765,000 U.S. vehicles after a series of crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles.
The investigation is a preliminary evaluation and the agency aims to complete those reviews within 120 days -- and then decides whether upgrade it to an engineering analysis or close it.
An engineering analysis is a required step before NHTSA can demand an automaker issue a recall.
To date, NHTSA has identified 12 crashes that involved Tesla vehicles using the advanced driver-assistance systems and emergency vehicles.
NHTSA in October asked Tesla why it has not issued recalls to address software updates made to its Autopilot driver-assistance system to improve the vehicles' ability to detect emergency vehicles.
Tesla in November recalled nearly 12,000 U.S. vehicles sold since 2017 because a communication error may cause a false forward-collision warning or unexpected activation of the emergency brakes.
NHTSA is also separately reviewing 30 Tesla crashes involving 10 deaths since 2016 where it suspected advanced driver assistance systems use.

Last week, NHTSA said it was discussing with Tesla its software update that lets users play video games on a touch screen mounted in front of the dashboard as well as its decision to replace some cameras in vehicles without issuing a recall.
Under pressure from NHTSA, Tesla in February agreed to recall 135,000 vehicles with touch-screen displays that could fail and raise the risk of a crash. NHTSA warning the issue could result in loss of rearview or backup camera images, exterior turn-signal lighting, and windshield defrosting systems.

LIMA (Reuters) -Peru's prime minister Mirtha Vasquez said on Thursday that declaring a state of emergency would be a ""last resort"" to defuse a road blockade that led miner MMG Ltd to suspend operations at its Las Bambas copper mine for the first time. 
""We are trying to reach an understanding... but when all dialogue options are exhausted we will probably have to evaluate how we will restore the rule of law,"" Vasquez said. 
Under a state of emergency, civil liberties are suspended. 
The mine stopped operations on Wednesday, an executive said, after it failed to reach an agreement with the local community that has blocked a transport road used by the facility for almost 30 days. 
""The Las Bambas mining operation has already stopped,"" Las Bambas head of corporate affairs Carlos Castro said at a news conference. ""The (last) plant that has been reducing its processing will end production on Saturday.""
The Chinese-owned mine started operations in 2016 and has been a flashpoint of protests and road blockades since it began.
The current blockade has been in place since Nov. 20 by residents of Chumbivilcas province who complain that the mineral wealth of the mine simply bypasses them https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/perus-poor-andean-hamlets-backed-by-state-unleash-anger-mines-2021-12-14 and want the company to provide more jobs and money for the area.
Peru is the world's no. 2 copper producer and Las Bambas accounts for 2% of world copper supply. The news sent Hong Kong-listed shares of MMG down as much as 12%, before they recouped some losses to close 5% lower at HK$2.30. The copper price rose.
Leftist President Pedro Castillo is in a delicate position. On the one hand, he has given support to the communities, who strongly backed him at the last election. He has not imposed a state of emergency in mining conflict situations where previous governments have.
On the other, the government needs the income and investment that mines like Las Bambas represent. Castillo is in the midst of trying to raise taxes on the mining sector to fund social programs.
Las Bambas is the second mine to announce a halt this week. Nexa Resources said it would do the same at its Cerro Lindo zinc mine due to a similar road blockade. 
With mining conflicts in Peru on the rise, the president of Peru's mining chamber Raul Jacob said protests this year had resulted in 150,000 fewer tonnes of copper being produced. Protests have also targeted Glencore (OTC:GLNCY)'s Antapaccay, Hudbay Minerals (NYSE:HBM)' Constancia and top producer Antamina, co-owned by Glencore and BHP.
CHRISTMAS TRUCE? 
Victor Villa, a legal adviser to the Chumbivilcas protesters, told Reuters on Thursday there had been no progress in reaching a deal. 
He said Chumbivilcas residents were considering unblocking the road for the Christmas holidays, but would immediately restart the blockade afterward.
If put in place, the temporary truce is unlikely to meaningfully help Las Bambas to restart production. 
Castro said the company was concerned that it had not been able to get all workers out of the mine. Vasquez also said the government was looking into options to get workers out of the mine. 

Chumbivilcas and Las Bambas reached a preliminary agreement in October for jobs for residents and economic contributions. But talks have since reached an impasse, leading to the current blockade.
The government failed earlier this week to facilitate a meeting between the parties as talks stalled, with Villa saying the company's latest proposal on jobs and contributions was a ""joke.""

(Reuters) - A group of gun manufacturers, distributors and retailers on Thursday filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a New York law that allows the state and people affected by gun violence to sue the industry.
The National Shooting Sports Foundation and gun manufacturers, including Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger & Co, said in a lawsuit filed in federal court in Syracuse that the state was impermissibly trying to regulate out-of-state gun sales.
The trade group and the 14 companies said the state is doing so through a novel measure that former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo signed into law in July that seeks to overcome legal hurdles that have largely prevented such lawsuits.
Other gun manufacturers suing include Glock Inc and Beretta USA.
New York Attorney General Letitia James vowed to defend the law, saying the ""gun lobby is trying to exert total control over this country and thwart common-sense efforts to protect lives.""
The law was enacted amid a spree of mass shootings nationally. It allows firearm sellers, manufacturers and distributors to be sued by the state, cities or individuals for creating a ""public nuisance"" that endangers the public's safety and health.
The gun industry group argues the law wrongly imposes liability on companies operating anywhere in the country that make, sell or market guns or ammunition that are misused by criminals in New York.

The lawsuit contends the New York measure violates the U.S. Constitution by seeking to override a 2005 federal law, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, that provides gun manufacturers protection from lawsuits over their products' misuse.
The group also contended the measure unconstitutionally regulates interstate commerce and infringes on the gun companies' due process rights.

(Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc is shutting down Sidewalk Labs after the founder and chief executive of the unit developing smart-city technology disclosed that doctors say he may have the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's Disease, a deadly neurodegenerative condition.
Alphabet said its Google unit will take over the Sidewalk Labs projects, which include sensors to send information about available parking spaces to driver apps and to automate building heating and cooling systems for maximum efficiency.
Dan Doctoroff, who previously led financial data company Bloomberg LP, founded Sidewalk Labs in 2015 with encouragement from then-Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt and CEO Larry Page. They had spoken of improving quality of life in urban living by cutting housing costs, increasing safety and improving sustainability.
Sidewalk's flagship plan had been developing a massive waterfront business district in Toronto to showcase its technologies. But community concerns about surveillance and other issues, along with rising costs, led Sidewalk to drop the idea last year. 
In a blog post on Thursday, Doctoroff said doctors believe he likely has ALS. He said he tested negative for a gene mutation that indicates ALS and that had been present in family with the disease, so it is possible ""that I have symptoms that mimic ALS but are not ALS.""
Doctoroff said he now plans to focus on raising $250 million for medical research through  Target  (NYSE:TGT) ALS, a group he founded.
Among several projects Google will take over from Sidewalk include the parking technology Pebble and the low-cost energy tracking system Mesa. A spokesman said the company did not have a transition date to share yet.

""These products will continue to be led by Sidewalk Labs President of Urban Products Prem Ramaswami and Chief Technology Officer Craig Nevill-Manning, both Google alumni, and the teams will continue to execute on their vision and serve customers,"" Doctoroff said.

(Reuters) -Reddit Inc, whose message boards became the go-to destination for day traders during this year's meme stock frenzy, said on Wednesday it had confidentially filed for an initial public offering with U.S. securities regulators.
Reuters first reported on Reddit's IPO plans in September. The social media company is aiming for a valuation of over $15 billion at the time of its flotation, sources have previously told Reuters.
Reddit's message boards, especially its WallStreetBets thread, were at the heart of a pitched battle between small-time traders and some of the big Wall Street firms, helping drive big gains in highly shorted shares of companies such as GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC, while popularizing the term meme stocks.
At the height of the trading frenzy in February, Reddit's value doubled to $6 billion from a year earlier. The company was valued at $10 billion in a private fundraising round in August.
Although a decent valuation, it still pales in comparison to  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR)'s $35 billion or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms' nearly $1 trillion market capitalizations, despite all three companies being founded around the same time.
""(Reddit) is hoping to be priced at a substantial premium to the typical tech stock IPO this year,"" University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter said.
""As with many money-losing companies going public, the rapid growth rate of revenue offers the potential to have high future profits, justifying a high multiple,"" Ritter added.
On Reddit thread WallStreetBets some users joked about potentially pumping the offering when it became available.
""I'm in. When do we start?"" a Reddit user called 9axle said in a post.
The San Francisco-based company, founded in 2005 by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, reported $100 million in advertising revenue in the second quarter, an almost threefold jump from the same period last year.
As of January, Reddit had more than 52 million daily active users and over 100,000 communities. In comparison, Facebook had nearly 2 billion daily active users in September, while Twitter had 211 million monetizable daily active users, a term for users who see the ads placed on their platforms.

Reddit's investors over the years have included venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, funds such as Sequoia Capital and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), as well as rap star Snoop Dogg.
Reddit did not disclose the number of shares to be offered or the price range of the IPO in the draft registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Some of the world’s largest technology companies are still struggling to make their products safe from a gaping vulnerability in common logging software a week after hackers began trying to exploit it.
Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO),  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), VMware (NYSE:VMW) and Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) were among the companies with multiple pieces of flawed software being used by customers on Thursday without available patches for the Log4j vulnerability, according to a running tally published by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
Logging software is ubiquitous software that tracks activity such as site visits, clicks and chats.
The company efforts underscore the wide reach of the flaw found inside open-source software, described by officials and researchers as the worst flaw they have seen in years. 
A researcher for Chinese tech company  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) warned the nonprofit Apache (NASDAQ:APA) Software Foundation early this month that Log4j would not just keep track of chats or clicks, but also follow links to outside sites, which could let a hacker take control of the server.
Apache rushed out a fix for the program. But thousands of other programs use the free logger, and those responsible for them must prepare and distribute their own patches to prevent takeovers. That includes other free software, which is maintained by volunteers, as well as programs from companies big and small, some of which have engineers working around the clock.
""Lots of vendors are without security patches for this vulnerability,"" said security threat analyst Kevin Beaumont, who is helping compile the list for CISA. ""Software vendors need to have better, and public, inventories around open-source software usage so it is easier to assess risk - both for themselves and their customers."" 
Some companies, including Cisco, are updating guidance multiple times daily with confirmation of vulnerabilities, available patches or strategies for mitigating or detecting intrusions when they occur.
As of Thursday, the CISA list included about 20 Cisco products that were vulnerable to attack without a patch available, including Cisco WebEx Meetings Server and Cisco Umbrella, a cloud security product.
But many more were listed as “under investigation” to see if they were vulnerable as well.
“Cisco has investigated over 200 products and approximately 130 are not vulnerable,” a company spokesperson said. “Many affected products have dates available for software patches.”
VMware is steadily updating an advisory on its site with dozens of impacted products, many with critical vulnerabilities and “patch pending.” Some of those without a patch have workarounds to mitigate the holes.
Splunk has a similar list, along with tips for hunting for hackers trying to abuse the flaw.

IBM listed nonvulnerable products but said it ""does not confirm or otherwise disclose vulnerabilities externally, even to individual customers, until a fix or remediation is available.” 
Though Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Mandiant and CrowdStrike have all said they see nation-state attackers from better-equipped U.S. adversaries probing for the Log4j flaw, CISA officials said Wednesday they had not confirmed any successful government-backed attacks or any intrusions inside U.S. government equipment.

The Canadian lender has held initial talks with BNP to buy its Bank of the West, a retail banking unit based in San Francisco, according to the report.
Shares in Bank of Montreal were down 1.6% C$137.87 in afternoon trading.
BNP and Bank of Montreal did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Reuters had reported in November the French bank was working with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to assess a sale of the 147-year-old unit in a deal that could value it at around $15 billion, with potential suitors including Bank of Montreal, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Ohio-based KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY).

BNP has been struggling to keep with its larger and better capitalised rivals in the American retail banking market, and the sale will help strengthen Bank of Montreal's foothold in the United States.
The French lender had acquired Bank of the West in 1979 before merging it with French Bank of California (FBC). The unit is BNP's largest business outside of Europe, with $99.2 billion of assets under management as of June 30.

948,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2021 02:05PM ET</span>","Airbus lands Air France-KLM jet order, capping trio of deals","By Tim Hepher and Tassilo Hummel
PARIS (Reuters) -Airbus completed a triple crown of aircraft orders at the expense of rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) on Thursday with a deal to supply 100 narrowbody jets to Air France-KLM subsidiaries in the airline group's largest purchase based on number of jets.
The planemaker's third big win in 36 hours - after deals in Singapore and Australia - involves Dutch subsidiary KLM and a pair of low-cost units, all of which have traditionally relied solely on Boeing for widely used medium-haul passenger planes.
The contract covers Airbus A320neo and A321neo aircraft and will renew the medium-haul fleets of KLM and Dutch low-cost unit Transavia Netherlands, while also allowing for both the renewal and expansion of the fleet at sister unit Transavia France. 
The bigger-than-expected order from Europe's second-largest airline group by fleet size came hours after Airbus clinched a deal to supply two tranches of aircraft to Australia's Qantas in a separate defeat for existing supplier Boeing. 
Air France-KLM said it had also signed a letter of intent to buy four Airbus A350 freighters. 
Collectively, those orders cap a dramatic week for Airbus after Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) threw its weight behind its efforts to break Boeing's grip on the cargo plane market, with its own tentative order for seven A350 freighters.
Reuters reported earlier on Thursday that Airbus was poised to win all or part of the widely watched Air France-KLM deal after emerging as front-runner last week.
First deliveries are expected in the second half of 2023, with the bulk of deliveries expected beyond mid-decade.
Neither side gave a value for the deal, which experts said is worth billions of dollars.
Factors in Airbus's favour in recent months have included a gradual thawing of relations between French and Dutch arms of the airline group, which have different suppliers, and tensions over recent Boeing 787 delays, industry sources said.
U.S. analysts said pressure from European governments to buy Airbus planes in return for bailouts may have played a role.
Even so, Boeing is ahead on firm orders so far this year as of the end of November, due to a sharp recovery in sales of the 737 MAX after it returned to service following a safety ban.

Boeing is expected to grab at least one more order before year-end and has the edge in a relaunched narrowbody contest at British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG), industry sources said.
Airlines are once again placing orders for jets as the industry starts to map growth beyond the pandemic and take advantage of lower fuel costs and emissions.

It comes as officials in key tourist cities around the world have blamed home sharing sites such as Airbnb for worsening housing shortages as property owners favour lucrative short-term rentals, pushing out lower-income residents.
In Paris, which counts the largest number of Airbnb listings among cities worldwide, a large share of local commerce has disappeared in some parts of the capital as ground-level shops are transformed into accommodation for visiting tourists booking their stays on sites such as Airbnb,  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG).com, according to city officials. 
In the past six years, Paris has lost 59,000 square metres of commercial space to accommodation for short-term stays while 900 businesses have disappeared over four years, the city said in a document outlining plans for the new rules. 
Asked about the new rules, Airbnb said the ""overwhelming majority"" of hosts in Paris are locals renting out their home for supplementary income, and does not expect the new rules targeting ""professionals and investors"" to have ""a noticeable impact on our activity in the city"". 

Last year, over 95% of homes rented on the site were rented for less than the 120-day cap, as required by local regulations, the site added.
According to the new rules, authorisation to transform a commercial space into short-term accommodation will not be granted if it seen as disrupting the balance of local employment, housing and commerce.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said its investigation found that CK Hutchison should have sold its passive infrastructure assets, including towers and masts, to an alternative buyer rather than market leader Cellnex.
Cellnex last year agreed to buy 24,600 telecom towers across Europe from CK Hutchison, which owns the Three mobile network in the UK, for 10 billion euros ($11.31 billion).
""CK Hutchison had a range of options to commercialise these assets and the deal with Cellnex was not the only option available to it to pursue its broader commercial objectives,"" the CMA said in a statement on Thursday.
The regulator said the sale could result in higher prices or lower quality services for mobile network operators, with a knock-on adverse impact for users of mobile networks across the UK.
Cellnex said it was reviewing the CMA findings and would respond with any ""practical alternative remedies"" the company wishes the regulator to consider. 
It added that it continued to believe the deal would improve mobile coverage, including 5G, across the UK.
CK Hutchison said it strongly disagreed with CMA's findings and would be responding to the issues raised by the regulator.

The CMA launched an inquiry into the proposed deal in May and referred it for an in-depth investigation in July.

And since China has been witnessing rapid EV adoption, Wall Street analysts expect Chinese electric vehicle stocks NIO (NIO), XPeng (XPEV), and Li Auto (LI) to rally 50% or more in price in the near term. So, please read on for details.The automotive industry experienced a rough phase last year. However, the increasing cost of fossil fuels and government initiatives to transition to a zero-emission environment should keep driving the electric vehicle (EV) industry’s growth. In addition, rising investments from automakers and the expansion of charging infrastructure are expected to play major roles in driving the EV market’s growth.
China, which is considered the global leader in the production and sale of EVs, saw an explosion of EV consumer uptake this year, with a 177.6% increase in EV adoption year-over-year. The November sales of new-energy vehicles in China grew 16.8% over the past month.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be worth adding Chinese electric vehicles stocks NIO Inc. (NIO), XPeng Inc. (XPEV), and Li Auto Inc. (LI) to one’s watchlist. Wall Street analysts expect them to rally by more than 50% in price in the near term.

The organizations, which included the National Restaurant Association, National Retail Federation and American Association of Advertising Agencies, said in a brief letter that the provisions ""would create an unprecedented and unjustified broad civil penalty authority.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration said on Thursday it has tapped a Canadian airline safety official to head the agency’s aviation safety organization.
Billy Nolen, who has most recently been vice president for safety, security and quality for WestJet Airlines in Canada, will begin early next year as the FAA's associate administrator for aviation safety, leading a team of more than 7,600 FAA employees. 
The FAA's safety efforts and oversight of Boeing (NYSE:BA) have come under criticism after two fatal 737 MAX crashes in a five-month period between October 2018 and March 2019 that killed 346 people. In December last year, Congress passed legislation to reform how the FAA certifies new airplanes and to reduce how much it delegates some duties to manufacturers like Boeing.
Nolen will Ali Bahrami, who stepped down in June after facing harsh criticism from relatives of the two fatal 737 MAX crashes and some lawmakers.
Nolen ""understands aviation safety, and he understands that our journey requires constant vigilance and continuous improvement,"" FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said. 
Nolen began his professional career in 1989 as a pilot for American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and later became the airline’s managing director for corporate safety and regulatory affairs.
Despite last year's legislation, a U.S. Senate report said on Monday the FAA must do a better job overseeing Boeing and the certification of new airplanes.
It found the ""FAA’s oversight of the certification process has eroded,"" adding the agency ""over time, increasingly delegated away its authority"" to Boeing and others.

The agency ""should take immediate action to address undue pressure at the Boeing"" safety oversight office, it said, adding that the FAA is chronically understaffed.
Dickson said in November the FAA was delegating fewer responsibilities to Boeing for aircraft certification. The FAA is currently scrutinizing a number of issues involving Boeing airplanes and working to implement many of the reforms mandated by Congress.

On Tuesday, Adagio's stock plummeted after it reported its antibody treatment for Covid-19 showed reduced effectiveness on the Omicron variant. It resulted in downgrades and price target reductions for the stock, with Morgan Stanley saying the news ""will limit the drug's utility.""
However, a note from Jefferies analyst Michael Yee has reversed the fall in the stock.
Yee, who kept a buy rating on the shares but lowered its price target to $46 from $60, told investors that two new pre-print publications from respected independent laboratories indicate that the drug maintains neutralization activity against Omicron. 
Yee added the therapy ""could be similar"" to GSK and Vir Biotechnology, who said this week their monoclonal antibodies have activity. 
While the analyst's note contrasts with Adagio's recent comments, Yee concluded by saying Adagio still has work to do to confirm the new data, which might suggest the therapy is useful against Omicron."

The investment bank said parents - whether through new birth, adoption, foster care or surrogacy - would be entitled to a minimum of 16 weeks of paid leave. 
Employees would also get between six and eight weeks of medical leave post-pregnancy, it said in the memo.
Staff will be able to take four weeks of paid leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition, the bank said.
Morgan Stanley will increase its contribution to employees' 401(k) retirement plans to 5% from 4% of eligible pay, unless workers receive a 2% fixed contribution or if their eligible pay exceeds $275,000. 
Eligible staff will also be given the option to purchase the bank's stock at a 10% discount.

All the changes, the details of which were first reported by Bloomberg News, would be launched throughout 2022.
Rival  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) also introduced a slew of benefits for its workers last month, including increasing contribution to the retirement fund for its U.S. employees.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Families of victims of the two 737 MAX crashes on Thursday said the U.S. Justice Department violated their rights when it struck a deferred prosecution agreement with Boeing (NYSE:BA) in January.
Relatives filed a motion arguing the United States Government ""lied and violated their rights through a secret process."" They have asked a U.S. judge to declare that the order violated victims’ families rights to rescind Boeing's immunity from criminal prosecution that was part of a $2.5 billion agreement.
The Justice Department did not immediately comment. Boeing declined to comment.
The settlement allowed Boeing to avoid prosecution, includes a fine of $243.6 million, compensation to airlines of $1.77 billion and a $500 million crash-victim fund over fraud conspiracy charges related to the plane's flawed design.
The deferred prosecution agreement is a form of corporate plea bargain.
The Justice Department ""chose to deliberately conceal its investigation and covertly negotiate with Boeing about resolving the case,"" the family members said.
They asked a U.S. judge to order that Boeing be publicly arraigned on the felony charges.
The Justice Department deal capped a 21-month investigation into the design and development of the 737 MAX following the two crashes, in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019, respectively.
The crashes ""exposed fraudulent and deceptive conduct by employees of one of the world's leading commercial airplane manufacturers,"" the Justice Department said in January.
In October, a former Boeing chief technical pilot for Boeing was charged with fraud for deceiving federal regulators evaluating the company's 737 MAX jet. He has denied wrongdoing.
The crashes, which have cost Boeing some $20 billion, prompted the U.S. Congress to pass legislation in December reforming how the FAA certifies new airplanes.
U.S. House Transportation Committee chairman Peter DeFazio said earlier the ""settlement amounts to a slap on the wrist and is an insult to the 346 victims who died as a result of corporate greed.""
Analysts noted the $1.77-billion airline compensation was already covered by accounting provisions and some had already been paid, meaning the remaining burden was relatively small.

The 737 MAX was grounded in March 2019, and the grounding was not lifted until November 2020, after Boeing made significant safety upgrades and improvements in pilot training.
The $243 million fine, which the Justice Department said was at the ""low end"" of the sentencing guidelines, represents the amount Boeing saved by not implementing full-flight simulator training.

(Reuters) -U.S. short-selling firm Muddy Waters (NYSE:WAT) said on Thursday it had acquired a short position in KE Holdings Inc, the biggest housing brokers in China, pushing its shares down as much as 10.9% premarket. 
KE's stocks most of the earlier losses and were down about 2% in morning trading. 
The short seller questioned the value of the company's transaction volumes, store count and agent count, as well as the company's reported revenue. 
KE did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Muddy Waters wrote in a research note https://d.muddywatersresearch.com/content/uploads/2021/12/MW_BEKE_12162021.pdf KE Holdings had inflated its new home sales and its commission revenues, listed ghost stores as ""active"" on its platform and also overstated the value of some acquired assets.
""Similar to  Luckin Coffee  (OTC:LKNCY), this is a real business with significant amounts of fraud,"" said Muddy Waters, comparing it to the Chinese rival to Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which fraudulently inflated its share price by falsifying revenue.
According to Muddy Waters, the company inflated its new home sales GTV (Gross Transaction Value) by over 126% and its commission revenues by about 77%–96%, while operating far fewer brokerages than its platform count shows.
Beijing-based KE, backed by Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) and SoftBank Group Corp, raised $2.1 billion in its New York IPO last year, making it the second largest U.S. listing for a Chinese company at the time.
KE provides an online and offline platform for housing transactions and services in China. It is one of the so-called ""platform"" companies that control vast amounts of data and are now being subjected to an unprecedented regulatory crackdown by Beijing. 
Earlier this year, Reuters reported that KE Holdings was planning a Hong Kong stock market listing and had hired Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to lead a float. However, the company had denied this report stating they had no imminent plan.
U.S. regulators has tightened its scrutiny over Chinese IPO hopefuls in the U.S this year. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has launched a series of new disclosure requirements following the fallout of Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi's shortlived New York debut in the summer.[L1N2PU1GE] 
The development underscores U.S. policymakers' concerns that Chinese companies are systematically flouting U.S. rules that require public companies to disclose to investors a range of potential risks to their financial performance.

So, we think it could be wise to scoop up fundamentally sound maritime shipping stocks Mærsk (AMKBY (OTC:AMKBY)), ZIM Integrated Shipping (ZIM), and Safe Bulkers (NYSE:SB). So, let’s examine these names.In November, inflation surged to a 40-year high of 6.8%. Consumer prices have risen at their fastest clip since 1982. These inflationary pressures have forced the Fed to act, and it has promised to halt its pandemic-driven asset purchases early next year and will likely raise interest rates three times in 2022 to counter the inflation threat.
But supply chain issues persist and are expected to last longer than expected. While many companies have been harmed by supply chain issues, shipping companies are expected to benefit because they can exploit strong demand as worldwide trade surges and raise freight prices. According to a Drewry report, container shipping pre-tax profit for 2021 and 2022 could be as high as $300 billion. The industry brought in a mere $25.40 billion in 2020.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to invest in quality shipping stocks A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S (AMKBY), ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd. (ZIM), and Safe Bulkers, Inc. (SB). They each possess a solid combination of growth attributes and fundamental strength.

However, they are down by more than 70% from when the stock peaked in the first week of June at $72. Here is what Wall Street analysts have been saying about the stock.AMC Entertainment (AMC) has had quite a roller coaster ride in 2021. Overall, shares are still up more than 900% from the company’s opening print of $2.20 to start the year. However, they are down by more than 70% from when the stock peaked in the first week of June at $72.
The selling has intensified over the last month as the stock is down nearly 50% over that timeframe. The main catalyst is rising short-term rates as the Fed pivots to grappling inflation with the market expecting an acceleration in the taper and rate hike timetable. This has caused weakness in ‘meme stocks’ across the board as froth gets squeezed out of the market. 
Despite the volatility in the stock price, there’s been little change in terms of analysts’ forecasts for earnings and revenue in 2022. Currently, the consensus seems to be that AMC will lose $0.71 per share in 2022 which would follow a loss of $2.72 per share this year. Both figures haven’t changed much over the past 6 months.

Despite the company’s impressive revenue and earnings growth in its last reported quarter, PINS’ shares plunged in price due to its sluggish user growth. Furthermore, the company expects lower levels of user engagement in the coming months. Also, the stock looks overvalued at its current price level. So, is PINS a buy now? Read on to learn our view.Pinterest, Inc. (PINS) in San Francisco delivers a visual discovery engine in the United States and internationally. The company’s engine allows people to find inspiration for their lives, including recipes, style, and home inspiration, DIY, and others. The image-based search engine gained popularity during the pandemic last year. However, the post-pandemic period has not been as generous to the company. PINS reported a decreasing monthly active user base for the previous two quarters because people started to re-engage with outdoor activities. Furthermore, its advertising business took a hit as advertisers’ willingness to spend on PINS’ services fluctuated due to several pandemic-related factors. The company expects its user engagement, growth, and retention rates to remain low as the nation gradually emerges from pandemic-related restrictions.
Earlier, PINS said Apple’s Inc. (AAPL) iOS privacy changes had affected its “ability to track user actions off our platform and connect their interactions with on-platform advertising.” Also U.S. payments giant PayPal’s cancellation of its acquisition of PINS caused its share price to decline more than 12% on the news. PINS delivered better-than-expected revenue and earnings, but its monthly user base decline in its last reported quarter made investors anxious. The company’s Monthly Active Users (MAU) declined 10% in the United States, while its global MAU increased only marginally. The stock plunged in price following the quarterly release.

(Reuters) -European shares had their best day in more than a week on Thursday, led by gains in banks and miners after the European Central Bank promised continued support to the economy, still choosing to incrementally withdraw stimulus. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.2%, while the euro zone index closed up 0.9%. 
The ECB only slightly reined in stimulus, as it strives for sustainable economic growth, saying it would wind down its 1.85 trillion euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme by March. 
New data showed euro zone business growth slowed more than expected in December as renewed measures to curb the Omicron coronavirus variant curtailed recovery.
But the central bank plans to double bond buys to 40 billion euros under the longer-running Asset Purchase Programme in the second quarter before cutting them to 30 billion euros in the third quarter.
""Despite a somewhat faster transition phase after PEPP ends, the open ended nature of purchases should be seen as a sign that the ECB is still significantly more dovish than its peers,"" Rabobank analysts said in a note.
""While the new inflation projections are significantly higher, at 1.8% the medium-term forecasts still fall short of the levels needed for sharper policy tightening.""
The ECB decision came shortly after the Bank of England became the first major central bank to raise borrowing costs since the pandemic began, hiking rates to 0.25% from 0.1%.
That pushed Britain's benchmark bond yields slightly higher to 0.75%. HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC), Lloyds (LON:LLOY) and Barclay's jumped between 3.2% and 4.6% and were among the top boosts on the FTSE 100 index. 
On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve flagged a long-awaited end to its pandemic-era bond purchases in March and signalled as many as three rate hikes in 2022, but delivered an otherwise upbeat economic outlook.

LONDON (Reuters) - The explosion in DIY investing since the start of the pandemic has led to a scramble among Britain's more traditional asset managers and banks to buy or build online platforms that give consumers more direct control of their investment portfolios. 
While the 'meme stock' frenzy that saw a rush by consumers to buy shares in companies talked up on social media such as Gamestop has simmered down a notch, there's still a growth in demand from people to pick their own investments or tailored wealth products. 
This month abrdn bought interactive investor for 1.5 billion pounds ($1.98 billion) while earlier this year banks JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Lloyds (LON:LLOY) snapped up wealth platforms Nutmeg and Embark respectively to bolt-on more customer-friendly digital products.
""If you don't move as an incumbent, you are in trouble. No doubt,"" Antonio Lorenzo, head of insurance and wealth at Lloyds, told Reuters.
Platforms offering investment tools directly to consumers are the fastest growing part of the consumer investment industry, according to data shared with Reuters by research firm Platforum.
Assets under administration at these direct platforms jumped 40% to 289 billion pounds in the year to March, making up a third of the consumer market.
Reuters was unable to obtain more recent industry-wide data, but some of the industry's leading players said net inflows remained above pre-pandemic levels and were outstripping market gains. Research firm Fundscape forecasts the market will more than double in size to 658 billion pounds by 2026.
Independent online platform Freetrade says its assets had leapt to 1.1 billion pounds, from 240 million prior to the pandemic. Its best month for sign-ups was October with 115,000 joiners, compared to 75,000 in February at the height of the meme stocks phenomenon typified by social media favourite Gamestop.
""Gamestop was a catalyst for sure, but it's not like that was the peak,"" Freetrade co-founder Viktor Nebehaj said.
""It's obvious to us that investment accounts are going to be as normal as bank accounts.""
NEW GENERATION OF INVESTORS
Britain may not be as synonymous with have-a-go investors as the United States, but it's growing a more lively retail investor community.
Around 14% of adults in Britain are interested in automated investing, behind the U.S. (16%) but ahead of France (12%), surveys by Forrester show.
UK consumers posted the highest rise in the world of those likely to invest in future, at 58% from 41% pre-pandemic, according to a survey by fund network Calastone.
Britain sports a band of fast-growing platforms, including  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), Trading 212 and Moneyfarm.
Joiners are more likely to be younger or first-time investors. 
More than half of new investors - with less than two years experience - are less than 35 years old, according to a survey by Oliver Wyman in October. Freetrade said over 55% of its new customers were first-time investors. 
The platforms sense further opportunities. As many as 8.6 million people in Britain consistently have more than 10,000 pounds in cash deposits, research by the Financial Conduct Authority shows, a figure the regulator wants to reduce.
SCRAMBLE
Among those maneuvering to appeal to this new cohort of investors is AJ Bell. The 26-year-old firm is launching commission-free investment app Dodl, with those new to investing offered guidance from furry ""monster"" characters.
Banks are also weighing in. JPMorgan plans to offer investments to customers of its fledgling British bank Chase next year via Nutmeg.
Lloyds wants to nearly double assets in personal pensions and investments to 100 billion pounds, from 60 billion today.
Experts are concerned though that the new band of investors could face a rude awakening whenever the bull market ends.
Only two in five DIY investors (41%) thought losing money they invested was a genuine risk, a survey by polling firm Britain Thinks found this year. The platforms say they educate customers on potential risks, but concerns remain.

""There's been a lot of concern about the gamification of investing,"" said Ryan Skinner, principal analyst at Forrester. ""In terms of the future of these platforms, a lot is going to be dependent on how regulators respond.""

973,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2021 11:46AM ET</span>",Analysis-Colombian conglomerate GEA could be cornered by hostile Gilinski,"By Nelson Bocanegra
BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's largest conglomerate, Grupo Empresarial Antioqueno (GEA), has limited options and little time to fight off hostile offers for stakes in some of its key companies, analysts told Reuters.
GEA - a sprawling group of more than 100 companies where many own significant stakes in one another - is so far facing two public acquisition offers led by Grupo Gilinski.
The contretemps with banker Jaime Gilinski - one of Colombia's richest men and the owner of GNB Sudameris, among many other businesses - is shaking up GEA's previously quiet conglomerate of tightly interwoven holdings, an arrangement that had until recently protected it from takeover attempts.
GEA groups many of Colombia's most important companies, including food producer Nutresa, industrial conglomerate Grupo Argos, bank Bancolombia (NYSE:CIB), cement-maker Cementos Argos, energy generator Celsia and pension fund Proteccion.
Investment holding company Grupo SURA, which owns 20% to 50% stakes in many of the other GEA companies, is the jewel in its crown. 
Gilinski launched a public acquisition offer for up to 62.625% of shares in Nutresa, a purchase worth some $2.2 billion, in November with the backing of Abu Dhabi's Royal Group.
Gilinski who has given few interviews, has told local media he thinks the company is simply a good investment.
Royal Group, an investment company chaired by Tahnoon Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the United Arab Emirates' national security advisor, will hold 49.9% of the shares bought through the offer, while Gilinski will control the rest. 
The offer for Nutresa was unprecedented on the Colombian market, both for its size and for attempting to move on the behemoth GEA. It has been extended until Jan. 12.
The market was further shocked three weeks later when Gilinski made another offer for up to 31.68% of Grupo SURA, at a cost of up to $1.19 billion, according to Reuters calculations of stock market data.
Both Argos and SURA have ruled out selling any of their stakes in Nutresa to Gilinski.
They said after the offer announcements they would seek international minority partners and they consider Gilinski's offers - especially for Nutresa - to be below market value. 
""It's a very hostile scenario for the (GEA) group,"" said Laura Triana, analyst at Acciones y Valores brokerage. ""This way, Gilinski really limits the possibilities for Grupo SURA and Grupo Argos to cover themselves because he's coming in from two fronts.""
Gilinski will hold all shares bought through the Grupo SURA offer, which is aided by financing from the  First Bank  (NASDAQ:FRBA) of Abu Dhabi, according to the formal offer announcement published on Thursday.
IHC Capital Holding LLC, also controlled by Al Nahyan, has signed a letter of intent with Gilinski to potentially act in future as a capital partner in his Grupo SURA participation, pending regulatory approval, the document showed.
The SURA offer will take place between Dec. 24 and Jan. 11.
Though major shareholders like other GEA members could make counteroffers - especially if they managed to raise funds from international partners - the clock is ticking and Gilinski's financial muscle is stronger thanks to his Royal Group backing, analysts told Reuters.
""The authorization by the financial regulator for the initial public offering for Nutresa came so fast that I'm not sure how quickly a counteroffer strategy can be pulled together,"" said independent analyst Daniel Escobar. 
Nutresa's share price has risen nearly 30% since Gilinski announced the acquisition offer, but it is still below the $7.71 per share he is offering.
Many in the market say Gilinski is undervaluing Nutresa and SURA, criticisms also leveled by SURA and Argos, which cited independent valuations by major banks.
""Gilinski isn't paying a control premium, it's almost a fair share price, and in these hostile buying operations normally the prices are higher,"" said Escobar.
Trading of Grupo SURA shares haa been suspended pending the formal announcement of the offer, but will resume on Friday.
Gilinski's son Gabriel told Reuters he could not comment until after the public offers have finished. Spokespeople for Grupo SURA, Grupo Argos and Nutresa declined to comment. 
Argos has also said it will speed efforts to consolidate several investments in road and airport concessions, energy and real estate into one vehicle that it hopes to list on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts said an offer for Argos itself could also be in Gilinski's plans and that the public offers may also be the first step for him to regain a lost asset - Bancolombia bank.
Grupo Gilinski sold the bank, then called Banco de Colombia, to GEA in 1997. A dispute about how the payment was made led to more than a decade of civil lawsuits, which finally ended in 2010 with an agreement between the two companies.
Two brokers who have spoken to Grupo Gilinski staff handling the public offers told Reuters on condition of anonymity that though Gilinski's principal focus is accumulating stakes in GEA companies, his desire to reach Bancolombia through the Grupo SURA offer is evident.
""When you listen to them the hostile tone is notable... they are going after it all,"" said a broker involved in the Nutresa offer. ""If Gilinski manages to buy, he'll be in the group and in the future he can go for Bancolombia.""

Grupo SURA owns about 46% of Bancolombia shares.
Bancolombia had no comment.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Tuesday that it handed over 34 airplanes to carriers in November, while adding 109 jets to its 737 MAX order tally.
The delivery tally - closely scrutinized by investors as deliveries generate much-needed cash during the coronavirus crisis - compares with 27 planes in October, and seven in the year ago period when Boeing was in the throes of the 737 MAX safety crises. 
Again in November, Boeing failed to deliver its advanced carbon-composite 787 Dreamliner, which remains mired in inspections and retrofits likely to keep the jets sidelined until April 2022. 
Of the 34 aircraft delivered last month, 28 were 737 MAXplanes - 10 of which were for European low-cost carrier Ryanair. Boeing also turned over one P-8 maritime patrol aircraft to Norway, Boeing said.
The remaining jets were larger widebodies: one 767 apiece for FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) and  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS), one 747-8 for the Egyptian defense ministry, and two 767 tankers for the U.S. Air Force, Boeing said.
During the pandemic, many airlines have been forced to idle unused passenger jets, driving up demand for cargo space on dedicated freighters at a time when e-commerce has been a lifeline for many.
This year through November, Boeing has delivered 302 aircraft, more than twice the 118 aircraft it delivered in the first 11 months of 2020.
Boeing had 91 orders for aircraft in November, after cancellations and instances where a buyer converted an order for one type of aircraft to another.
It had 109 gross orders, all of which were for its 737 MAX jetliner, which returned to service in late 2020 after a near two-year safety ban.
That includes an order for 72 MAX jets from India's Akasa Air, a deal valued at nearly $9 billion at list prices that could help the U.S. planemaker regain lost ground in one of the world's most promising markets.
It also included an order for 30 737 MAX jets for Miami-based 777 Partners, which owns part of Canadian low-cost carrier Flair Airlines, and a previously undisclosed order for seven 737 MAXs for Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).

At the same time, buyers canceled orders for 18 737 MAX jets.
Gross orders for the year increased from 720 to 829, or from 373 to 457 after cancellations, conversions and stricter accounting standards were applied, Boeing said.

Investing.com – Adobe stock (NASDAQ:ADBE) tumbled 9% Thursday after the company’s forecast for 2022 revenue came in short of expectations.
The design software-maker expects revenue to hit $17.9 billion in the ongoing financial year, up over 13% year-on-year but sharply slower than the 23% rate the 2021 revenue grew at to top $15 billion.
According to Bloomberg estimates, the company was expected to peg its annual forecast at $18.2 billion.
Adobe expects annual adjusted profit per share to touch $13.70 in the current financial year, higher than 2021’s $12.48 but lower than Bloomberg’s $14.20 estimate.
The company closed the quarter ending December 3 with remaining performance obligations of $14 billion, which is 23% higher than last year.
The company’s digital media unit, which includes creative and document cloud products such as Photoshop, PDF, and Illustrator, boomed during the pandemic as millions worked from home and online activities surged. But all those products now face increasing competition from the likes of Canva.
Fourth-quarter revenue grew 20% to a record $4.11 billion, driven by subscriptions. Product revenue rose negligibly while revenue from services fell. Adjusted EPS was $3.20.
Digital media segment revenue grew 21%, to $3 billion. Creative revenue rose 19%, to $2.48 billion. Document Cloud revenue was up 29%, at $532 million.

Most major U.S. banks have had staff working in offices since the summer, but some are now choosing not to host holiday parties and others are strongly recommending staff to get booster shots. The following are the pandemic-related rules among Wall Street's biggest banks. 
For a FACTBOX on Canadian financial firms, click on
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)
The bank since late summer has been encouraging employees to get fully vaccinated and now to get their booster shots when eligible. It offers onsite clinics in several locations.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)
Citigroup C.N told employees at its New York City office on Wednesday they could work from home if they were able to through the holidays, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The bank has been requiring employees in the United States to be vaccinated but is not mandating boosters. It is providing rapid test kits and encouraging testing for employees going into the office, a source said earlier.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)
The German lender has made COVID-19 boosters available to staff at its new midtown headquarters in New York City since early November, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)
As infections flared up in August due to the spreading of the Delta variant, the Wall Street bank mandated vaccines for all staff and visitors entering its offices in the United States.
Staff in the United States must be tested onsite on a weekly basis. The bank is also providing access to boosters for those eligible, although boosters are not mandatory.
Goldman postponed its remaining holiday parties in New York due to COVID-19 concerns, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The bank had held holiday parties over the last few weeks.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) 
The investment bank requires all staff who want to enter its offices to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and has said it will require boosters by Jan. 31, unless the person concerned is not yet eligible for the additional shot. The bank does not perform onsite testing.
Last week, following a spate of cases, the bank asked staff to work from home where possible and canceled all but essential travel.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)
The biggest U.S. bank, and one of the most aggressive in bringing employees back to the office, mandated face covering for its U.S. employees in August, saying they would be required to wear masks in public indoor settings and in common areas regardless of vaccination status.
In October, the bank said it would restrict business travel for employees who are unvaccinated or have not disclosed their vaccination status. Such employees are required to get tested twice a week and contribute more of their pay toward medical insurance. 
The bank mandated vaccines for new recruits in client-facing roles or those required to travel for business.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)
Morgan Stanley is asking employees, contractors and visitors to show proof of vaccination before entering its New York headquarters. The bank does not require additional COVID-19 testing for staff or visitors, a spokeswoman said.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co
The lender has said it strongly encourages employees to consider getting the COVID-19 vaccine but does not require it. The bank was providing all employees with four hours of paid leave to get the booster shot if eligible.
The bank also required employees to either document that they are fully vaccinated or get tested regularly.
Fidelity Investments

The company said it had paused its voluntary return to office plans in New England, citing a rising risk from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Let’s discuss these names.Green energy solutions are experiencing rapid growth on the back of global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit the hazardous effects of climate change. In its efforts to achieve a carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035 and net-zero emissions economy-wide by 2050, the U.S. government is pushing the adoption of green energy.
According to a report by Report Ocean, the global renewable energy market was estimated at roughly $881.50 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.2% CAGR between 2021 and 2027. However, high energy storage and infrastructure costs could hamper the green energy industry’s growth.

(Reuters) - Tax preparation company H&R Block Inc (NYSE:HRB) on Thursday sued payment company Block Inc, previously called  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ), saying the new name infringed its trademarks.
Block's chief executive,  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) co-founder Jack Dorsey, announced the name change earlier this month as the company looked to expand beyond its payment service into new areas, including blockchain.
In a complaint filed in Kansas City, Missouri, federal court, however, H&R Block accused the company of ""stealing Block's name in order to co-opt the reputation and goodwill that Block has earned through decades of hard work.""
Block did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
H&R Block said consumers were likely to be confused by the similar name, noting that it has referred to itself simply as ""Block"" in some advertisements since 2015. 

It said the two companies were direct competitors in tax preparation services since Block bought Credit Karma Tax, now called Cash App Taxes, last year. The logo for Cash App Taxes, a green square with rounded corners and a dollar sign, is confusingly similar to H&R Block's green square logo, according to the lawsuit.
H&R Block is seeking a court order barring Block from using the name or green square logo.

Since 2020, Coeure, 52, has headed the Innovation Hub of the Bank for International Settlements, a newly created body which he moved to after eight years at the ECB. 
Coeure would replace Isabelle de Silva, whose five-year mandate as head of the competition watchdog ended in October and comes as the regulator is due to make a ruling on the proposed merger of France's number one and two TV networks TF1 and M6. 
Coeure trained as an economist at France's prestigious Polytechnique university and earned a degree in Japanese before holding various positions at the French treasury, ranging from chief economist to G8 finance sherpa and head of the public debt management office.
    He later joined the ECB's Executive Board where he was in charge of market infrastructure and seen as one of then ECB chief Mario Draghi's closest lieutenants.
    While a widely respected macroeconomist, Coeure's approach to regulating big tech and companies is largely unknown. 
De Silva's tenure at the watchdog was marked by hefty fines against U.S. tech giants Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google.

    Coeure's name has come up in the past as a possible head of the French central bank.
His appointment to the antitrust watchdog will need to be approved by the French parliament, where Macron's centrist LREM party has a majority.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian businessman on a U.S. sanctions list claimed victory over Google in a court case on Thursday and said the U.S. tech giant now faced a potentially heavy fine. 
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google had appealed a Russian court order that it unblock the YouTube account of Tsargrad TV, a Christian Orthodox channel owned by businessman Konstantin Malofeev, or face a daily 100,000 rouble ($1,358) fine that would double each week Google failed to comply. 
Tsargrad said the Ninth Moscow Arbitration Court of Appeal upheld the fine. Malofeev also confirmed the verdict to Reuters, but the court could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts by phone and email.
Google did not respond to a request for comment.
The case reflects Russia's waning tolerance of foreign technology giants, several of which it has fined this year for failing to delete content Moscow deems illegal.
Tsargrad said the fine would stop compounding when it reached 1 billion roubles ($13.6 million), which it estimated would happen in mid-March next year. After nine months, the 1 billion rouble limit would be removed, it said.
The two parties have engaged in talks since the case first came to light in mid-2020, but Tsargrad said in August it had abandoned talks for a settlement and accused Google of dragging its feet in negotiations. 
Google said in May the proposed penalty was ""out of all proportion"" and the decision created uncertainty for foreign investors. 
The United States and European Union imposed sanctions on Malofeev in 2014 over accusations that he funded pro-Moscow separatists fighting in Ukraine, which he denies. Russia considers such Western sanctions illegal.
Malofeev told Reuters before the latest court decision that the choice facing Google was either to continue to break Russian law or reinstate his channel and face no penalty. ""Breaking the law is never part of the investment climate,"" he said.

YouTube also drew the ire of Russian state-backed broadcaster RT on Thursday after blocking its new RT DE channel on the day of its launch.

Beijing Bujia has agreed to order at least 10,000 new energy trucks from Kaixin over the next five years.
Bujia, a Chinese automotive retail logistics and service terminals platform, said that over the next five years, it plans to establish 300 automotive logistics transfer warehouses and 1,000 automotive terminal delivery centers. In addition, they will integrate a fleet of more than 60,000 delivery trucks, with new energy trucks accounting for no less than 30%.

PARIS (Reuters) - France imposed travel restrictions on travellers from Britain on Thursday due to surging COVID-19 cases there, and several European countries also strengthened border controls on visitors from other EU states.
Plans for Christmas celebrations in Europe and many countries across the globe have been thrown into disarray by the rapid spread of the highly infectious Omicron variant, which emerged in Hong Kong and Southern Africa last month.
Britain on Wednesday recorded its highest number of daily coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic. That prompted the French government to announce on Thursday that only certain categories of travellers, including truck drivers, would be allowed between the two countries. Anyone arriving from Britain would have to self-isolate. 
""Our goal is to limit as much as possible the spread of Omicron across our territory,"" French government spokesman Gabriel Attal said. ""Tourism and business travel for people who are not French nationals or Europeans, people who are not French residents, will be limited.""
British hospitals were struggling to maintain staffing levels due to people having to isolate with COVID-19, a senior medic told Reuters. The 95-year-old Queen Elizabeth canceled a pre-Christmas lunch with her family as a precaution. 
Sweden said it would require visitors from other Nordic nations to have a vaccine pass amid a jump in new infections in recent days.
Across the globe in Asia, South Korea said spiraling infections meant it too would reinstate strict rules constraining gatherings and closing restaurants, cafes and bars early.
The new wave of infections and the return to tighter restrictions comes just weeks before the second anniversary of the emergence of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China. Since then more than 5 million people have died of COVID-19 globally and more than 272 million cases have been reported.
Meanwhile, more than 8.5 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered to combat the disease - an effort that is now challenged by the Omicron variant's outburst.
ROUND THE BLOCK
At a summit of EU leaders in Brussels, tensions arose after Italy, Portugal and Greece said they would require people crossing their borders to have a negative COVID-19 test as well as a vaccine passport.
Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins said freedom of travel inside the EU's border-free Schengen Area must not end. 
Around Europe, vaccination booster campaigns and the administration of first doses to children aged 5 to 11 generated long queues that snaked around city blocks as hospitals, pharmacies and clinics struggled to cope with demand.
Preliminary data show vaccines are less effective against Omicron, but a booster increases protection.
England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty said vaccinations could cut the numbers admitted to intensive care and shorten the time spent in hospital.
Travel operators and retailers said the tightening of COVID regulations would hit them hard in the run-up to Christmas. 
Officials at the port of Dover (NYSE:DOV) on the British side of the Channel said France's new travel curbs would dampen already significantly reduced tourist numbers. 
British online fashion retailer Boohoo issued its second profit warning in four months, citing factors including a rise in partywear return rates amid canceled Christmas parties.
Weekendesk, a Spanish holiday website, said cancellations jumped 19% from the previous week and blamed a new requirement for vaccine passports in Catalonia, Valencia and Andalucia.
SPORTING LIFE
The impact was also being felt across the world of sport, from international and elite level down to grassroots.
Hundreds of amateur clubs in Britain across a range of sports have cancelled weekend fixtures and closed clubhouses, despite there being no government advice to do so.

A fourth Premier League match of the week was cancelled on Thursday after Brentford manager Thomas Frank called for all games in the coming week to be postponed to allow clubs to recover their depleted squads.
The Swedish national soccer team cancelled a planned friendly against Finland, while teams and leagues in the three major North American sports were trying to avoid cancellations after a massive outbreak of positive tests among players.

(ARLP) in Tulsa, Okla., is a diversified natural resource company that produces and markets coal primarily to utilities and industrial users in the United States. The company operates through three segments: Illinois Basin; Appalachia; and Minerals. In comparison, Arch Resources, Inc. (ARCH) in St. Louis, Miss., produces and sells thermal and metallurgical coal from surface and underground mines. The company sells its products to utility, industrial, and steel producers.
Last year, the coal industry was one of the worst-hit industries, owing to reduced global energy demand and weak commodity prices. However, the rising demand for coal with increased power usage and high natural gas prices, coupled with the continuing decline of utility stockpiles heading into the winter heating season, have driven a surge in coal prices. Transportation challenges and supply chain problems are also contributing to the rise in coal prices. In addition, domestic utilities have leaned on coal-fired power generation to meet rising electricity demand. And the continuing post-COVID economic recovery and reopening of the industrial sector should drive the coal industry's growth. Therefore, we think both ARLP and ARCH should benefit.

(Reuters) - Climate-focused investors are calling on the major U.S. banks to quickly scale back their financing of new fossil fuel development, saying current commitments by the banks to curb global emissions are not enough.
The investors have filed resolutions to try to bring the matter to shareholder votes at the annual meetings of the banks in 2022, according to documents seen by Reuters.
Banks receiving the resolutions include the nation's six largest by asset size -- JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
All six have already committed to curbing global emissions.

Representatives for Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Representatives from Bank of America did not respond to questions for this article. 
A Wells Fargo representative declined to comment on the resolution but noted other climate-focused steps the bank has taken such as planning $500 billion in financing for sustainable businesses and projects by 2030.
A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment on the resolutions but also cited steps it has taken such as setting carbon-reduction targets and creating a $2.5 trillion sustainability effort focused on things like renewable energy.
""We're basically saying to banks that you've made those commitments, now you need to put in place the policies to achieve those commitments,"" said Jonas Kron, chief advocacy officer for one of the filers, Trillium Asset Management. Others include the Sierra Club Foundation and Mercy Investment Services.
Additional resolutions ask Bank of America and Citigroup to report on how a dire climate forecast could cause some assets to face premature devaluation, such as underground oil and gas reserves.
There is no guarantee the resolutions will come up for a vote. The banks will decide in coming weeks whether to accept the resolutions for inclusion in their proxy statements, or whether to seek regulators' permission to leave them aside. 
Resolution sponsors account for just a small share of the total of $4 trillion managed by ICCR members, and a fraction of the banks' total market capitalizations.
But ICCR members often win backing from top investment funds for their proposals such as a call for a workforce diversity report that won support from more than 80% of votes cast at  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP) in May. Supporters included top asset manager BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). 
Meanwhile banks have been receptive to some investor outreach. ICCR members withdrew all of the half-dozen resolutions they filed at top banks for spring 2021 meetings after receiving commitments like a target from Bank of America to reach net-zero emissions from its financing activities by 2050. 

Many banks this year also signed up to the United Nations-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance, committing to align their lending with targets to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. But that is not as fast as the International Energy Agency has recommended. 
""Everybody inside and outside the banks understands the direction of travel here. The only question is how quickly that can happen,"" said Ivan Frishberg, chief sustainability officer for union-affiliated  Amalgamated Bank  (NASDAQ:AMAL), who serves on a steering group for the banking alliance.

The German sportswear company said it will cancel most of the shares repurchased during the programme, which would reduce the number of shares as well as share capital accordingly.
The buyback will start in January 2022 and run until 2025, it said.
The move is part of plans announced by Adidas earlier this year to return up to 9 billion euros to its shareholders in the next five years, through dividend payouts of between 30% and 50% of net income from continuing operations along with share buybacks.
""Over the next couple of years, our business will generate significantly more cash than ever before,"" Chief Financial Officer Harm Ohlmeyer said in a statement.
The company will also pass on to shareholders the majority of the cash proceeds from the divesture of U.S. subsidiary Reebok, which it expects to be finished in the first quarter of 2022, it said.

In August, Adidas said it was selling Reebok to Authentic Brands Group (ABG) for up to 2.1 billion euros ($2.5 billion) as the company concentrates on its core brand.

Investing.com — Hydrogen solutions provider  Plug Power  Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) and EV firm Edison Motors announced Wednesday a deal to develop and bring a hydrogen fuel cell-powered electric city bus to market.
Not to be confused with SPI Energy's EdisonFuture, Edison Motors is a Korean electric car manufacturer that boldly claims on its website that it ""will overtake Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)."" The company sold the most number of electric buses in Seoul this year, for the second consecutive year, and is considered the largest electric bus and truck manufacturer in Korea.
New York-based Plug Power's 125kW ProGen fuel cell engine will power Edison Motors' electric bus platform, with the companies expecting to have a prototype completed by the second half of 2022. After that, they are planning to launch a ""mass-market platform"" by the first half of 2023.
Edison Motors will mass-produce the fuel cell electric buses named ""SMART 110F,"" which will be distributed in South Korea.
Andy Marsh, CEO of Plug Power, said: ""Plug Power has a goal to expand our global footprint to stimulate the Asian hydrogen and fuel cell market. We acknowledge this is one of the fast-growing markets in the world and believe that this partnership with Edison Motors, will pave the way to achieving global net zero.""
Edison's Chairman Young-Kwon Kang said this is just the beginning of longer-term cooperation between the companies with plans for other mobility projects. 
""In the future, we hope to partner on other mobility applications including trucks, vessels, drones, and PAVs. We believe that our combined technology and know-how in electric buses will position us to sell fuel cell-powered electric buses not only in Korea but also in other overseas markets,"" stated Kang.
After initially climbing at the open, Plug Power shares are down 2.3%"

PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in EDF (PA:EDF) plunged on Thursday after the French power giant found faults at a nuclear power station and shut down another plant using the same kind of reactors, leading it to cut its core profit goal for this year.
France's Nuclear Safety Authority said EDF had informed it that it had detected cracks on the pipes of a reactor at the Civaux power plant in western France due to corrosion.
It said EDF, which has extended the outage of its Civaux station as a result and also stopped the Chooz plant in eastern France that uses the same technology, was investigating the cause of the faults. The watchdog will closely monitor EDF's review, it added.
Separately, the French Institute of Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, another public agency, said checks on other EDF reactors were likely to be necessary.
Shares in EDF were down nearly 13% at 1410 GMT.
The setback comes as France plans a major nuclear power station building programme, diverging from neighbour Germany which retreated from nuclear power after Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011.
The outage of the four reactors, with a combined daily capacity of 6 Gigawatt (GW), equivalent to around 13% of current availability in France, also comes close to the peak winter season and with power prices at record highs. 
""The risk of a power crunch for end-December is relatively weak but our models show that in January things could become more difficult,"" said Emeric de Vigan, head of energy data provider COR-e.
""It's too early to say how cold it's going to be, but if we have temperatures of 2 to 4 degrees Celsius below the season's average, then we'll start seeing some tensions."" 
European forward curve power prices surged to new contract highs on Thursday on the back of the French shutdown.
(Graphic: German and French year ahead and winter month contracts hit record highs, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgvdwoezqpo/Forward%20contracts%20reach%20record%20highs.jpeg) 
France's biggest electricity supplier said late Wednesday that some faults were detected close to the welds on the pipes of the safety injection-system circuit in the two reactors at Civaux. 
It said having the Civaux and Chooz reactors offline would result in a loss of about 1 Terawatt-hour by the end of 2021. As a result, it cut its core earnings (EBITDA) estimate to a range of 17.5 billion-18 billion euros from a previous target of more than 17.7 billion euros, based on current market prices.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Cazenove said the impact was likely to drag into next year. 
It said the French utility could need to spend about 2 billion-3 billion euros ($2.3 billion-$3.4 billion) in 2022 to buy back some of its power to cover outages at the nuclear reactors.

""These estimates are a worst-case scenario, yet this is very material,"" it said in a report.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts said the new core profit guidance for 2021 was 3.5% below consensus.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday it will award $2.89 billion to 3,075 airports under a new $1 trillion infrastructure bill signed into law last month.
Airports can use funds for runways, taxiways, safety, terminal, airport-transit connections and roadway projects. The infrastructure law provides $15 billion over five years and the FAA estimates there is a $43.6 billion backlog in airport modernization and safety projects.
Atlanta's International Airport will receive $92.5 million, the most of any airport, while Los Angeles International will get $79.3 million and Chicago O'Hare $73.7 million.
During the pandemic, some airports were forced to put some projects on hold because of lower passenger volumes.
Airports have received about $20 billion in emergency pandemic funding since March 2020 from Congress.
San Francisco International Airport is set to receive $49.35 million from the FAA for the current budget year. It will use the funds to completing the final phase of the Harvey Milk Terminal 1 – including the construction of a new check-in lobby, which was postponed due to COVID, and upgrading of the airport's electrical power distribution infrastructure.
In total, San Francisco's airport is set to receive about $250 million over five years. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the funds will shorten lines at the terminal.

The infrastructure law has $25 billion for aviation including $15 billion nationwide in formula funding for airport development grants based on passengers. There is also a $5-billion grant program nationally for airport terminal and landside improvements, and $5 billion for FAA towers and facilities funding.
The FAA said airports can submit proposals for review in the coming weeks and it encourages airport ""to prioritize projects that increase airport safety, equity and sustainability.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly higher on Thursday but with signs that the exuberant rally in the wake of Wednesday's decisions from the Federal Reserve is fading.
By 9:44 AM ET (1444 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 117 points, or 0.3% at 36,044 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3%. All three indices had posted sharp gains on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said it will phase out its bond purchases by March, paving the way for what its projections suggest will be three quarter-point interest rate hikes before the end of next year.
The Fed made its decisions against a backdrop of relative economic strength that was again reflected in data from the labor and housing markets on Thursday. Initial jobless claims ticked up to 206,000 last week but ongoing claims for regular unemployment benefits fell by over 150,000 to 1.845 million, their lowest since the start of the pandemic. 
In addition, housing starts and building permits numbers for November were both stronger than expected, with housing starts rising to their highest since March and building permits also rising 3.6% on the month.
The housing numbers weren't strong enough to stop  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) stock from falling 4.8% on a day when it reported problems with high lumber prices and other product shortages in its quarterly report. Lumber prices, which were trading at around $400 a ton before the pandemic started, have been on a wild ride in the last two years, peaking at over $1,700 in April before falling back to around $450 in the summer. However, they've since shot higher again and now trade at just over $1,100 a ton.
Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock also fell heavily, losing 7.2% after its guidance for the coming fiscal year fell well short of expectations. Its earnings guidance of $3.70 in earnings per share next year is barely a third of the market consensus ahead of time and leaves the stock trading at over 150 times expected earnings, a stark reminder of how stretched some technology stock valuations still are despite their declines in recent weeks.
Other software-focused stocks, followed, from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) through to Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU). Accenture (NYSE:ACN) stock bucked the trend, rising 8.7% after quarterly earnings that were well ahead of forecasts.
Megacaps were also giving up some of Wednesday's gains, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock losing 1.5% and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock falling 1.2%. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock also fell back below the $1,000 mark with a drop of 1.7%.
By contrast, financials continued to gain on the prospect of margin-boosting higher interest rates. Bank of America  (NYSE:BAC) stock rose 1.2% and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock rose 0.8%.

Investing.com – Visa stock (NYSE:V) rose 0.8% on Thursday after the company topped up its ongoing share repurchase program with $12 billion.
The company had $1.2 billion left from its previously authorized exercise. With the new approval, it has $13.2 billion committed for future share repurchases.
The authorizations have no expiration date, and the repurchases will be exercised from time to time at prices the company deems appropriate, a release said.
The repurchases may be undertaken through accelerated programs, open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, it said.
Companies have been using cash from pandemic-fueled record earnings to return money to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Repurchases also help in shoring up earnings per share by reducing the total shares available for trade.
In the year ended September 30, Visa returned $11.5 billion through dividends and repurchases. It reported annual net revenue of over $24 billion, up 10%.

Investing.com –  Lennar  Corporation stock (NYSE:LEN) fell 5% in Thursday’s premarket trading after the company’s fourth-quarter earnings and sales fell short of estimates.
High labor costs and expensive raw materials weighed on the earnings that otherwise rose 35% to $1.2 billion, or $3.91 per share, lower than the $4.15 analysts estimated.
Use of lumber the company had purchased when prices were high also weighed on the earnings. Profit would have been higher if not for mark-to-market losses on account of investments in technology.
Labor and supply chain issues constrained the company’s home-building efforts in the quarter ended November 30, the company said, even as deliveries rose 11%, to 17,819 homes.
The company closed the month with a backlog of 23,771 homes worth $11.4 billion, up 26% and 45%, respectively.
The company made progress on its strategy of being “land-light.” The number of years of owned homesites improved to 3 from 3.5 last year. The land-light approach helped improve cash flows, which the company used for share repurchases and debt repayment, the company said.
Revenue rose 24%, to $8.4 billion on the back of an 11% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 14% rise in the average sales price.
As a percentage of revenue from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved to 6% from 7.5% in the fourth quarter of last year. The company attributed this to lower commissions paid to brokers and its efforts to use more technology in its processes.
In the ongoing quarter, the company expects new orders for 14,800 of 15,100 units and deliveries to be about 12,500.
For the full year, it sees deliveries at about 67,000 units while it sees the average sales price to be around $460,000 in the quarter as well as in the year.

The New York-based company's series E funding round also saw participation from Wellington Management, Whale Rock Capital Management, Pavilion Capital and Square Peg. 
Growth in e-commerce since the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a demand for marketing software companies like Rokt. The company uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze online shoppers and their engagement with products and services. 
The company, which was founded in Australia in 2012, later expanded to 19 countries across North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. It plans to use the funds to invest in research and development, international expansion and acquisitions. 
The company that counts GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY),  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and Vistaprint among its customers acquired OfferLogic, a business-to-business marketplace, in 2019. It also bought mobile calendar marketing platform CalReply, which enables online retailers to track and gather data using calendar events added by users. 
Rokt raised $80 million in a funding round in October last year that valued it at more than $450 million.
More than a hundred technology companies have raised over $40 billion through initial public offerings in the United States this year, up from nearly $23 billion in the previous year, according to data compiled by Refinitiv.

The U.S. airline, however, said Omicron had slowed international bookings as many countries imposed new travel restrictions since the strain was first reported.
""Omicron (is) not going to impact our holiday bookings,"" the airline's chief executive officer, Ed Bastian, said in an interview to CNBC, but added that it will have some impact in the first quarter.
Rising COVID-19 cases as well as the newly imposed restrictions have threatened to upend a nascent recovery in the industry.
International travel, typically more lucrative for airlines, is crucial for the sector as it seeks to return to profits and shake off pandemic-related losses. Transatlantic routes accounted for up to 17% of 2019 passenger revenues for the major U.S. carriers. Delta itself had reported a 450% spike in international bookings in November.

Shares of the Atlanta-based carrier rose 2.40% in the pre-market trading as the company also said it expects to generate an adjusted pre-tax profit of $200 million in the December quarter. 
The carrier in October had flagged a pre-tax loss for the fourth quarter due to rising fuel costs. It now expects fuel costs per gallon between $2.20 and $2.30 down from $2.25 to $2.40 forecast earlier.

The BoE becomes the world's first major central bank to raise borrowing costs since the coronavirus pandemic as it expects inflation to hit 6% in April, three times above its policy target. 
The decision to raise interest rates wrongfooted markets who had predicted policymakers to hold fire in the backdrop of the raging Omicron variant of coronavirus sweeping across the country. 
It was a second policy decision in as many months that have caught markets off guard after it kept rates on hold in November.
""My initial thoughts are one of surprise given that they failed to raise rates in November and they clearly appear to have regretted that decision given that inflation has surprised to the upside and jobs numbers were good,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets in London. 
Yields on British government bonds, known as gilts, jumped following the decision and rose as 8-9 basis points on the day to their highest in over two weeks. 
Rate-sensitive two-year yields rose the most, by over 9 basis points to 0.584% by 1310 GMT. Benchmark 10-year yields were up 8 bps to 0.81% and 30-year yields were up 9 bps to 0.99%, all their biggest daily jumps since November 10. 
Sterling jumped as much as 0.8% versus the U.S. dollar at $1.3368 and spiked 0.7% versus the euro at 84.54 pence.
Rate-sensitive banks rallied, sending the FTSE 350 Bank index rallying almost 4%.
Data this week showed British inflation surged to its highest in more than 10 years in November and far exceeded expectations at 5.1% even as employers hired a record number of staff.
The surprise rate hike prompted traders to push back their bets on subsequent rate hikes, with markets now expecting roughly 15 bps of hikes at the Bank of England's February meeting, down from nearly 23 bps before the vote. 
They now expect 84 bps of hikes by the end of 2022, down from around 97 bps before the decision. 
The yield curve between two and 10-year bonds narrowed to the flattest since October 2020 at 23.6 bps, continuing a trend in recent weeks which analysts say expresses concern that early rate hikes may hurt future growth prospects.
But reaction on broader equity indexes was more muted with the internationally exposed FTSE 100 index reducing gains to 1% on the day given sterling's rise.
""Still, the wage numbers suggest fears of second round effects from inflation are a bit overdone,"" Daiwa's Scicluna said.

""It's especially surprising given the new wave of the pandemic. Clearly their communication (leaves) a bit to be desired and there are significant downside risks to activity from the latest wave of the pandemic.""
As part of the decision the BoE also cut its growth forecasts for December and the first quarter of 2022 because of the spread of the Omicron variant.

This strong industry-wide growth will likely be sustainable, as the pandemic helped create a multi-year IT spending cycle, Wedbush Securities analyst Moshe Katri said.

1005,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2021 08:11AM ET</span>",Motional partners with Uber to provide autonomous food deliveries in California,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - Motional, the self-driving joint venture of Hyundai Motor Co and Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) PLC, on Thursday said it was entering the autonomous delivery market by providing meal kits for some California Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc customers.
Motional said it would start delivering meals from select restaurants on Uber's food delivery app Eats in Santa Monica in early 2022.
The companies did not say whether the partnership would be expanded to other locations. But Motional President and Chief Executive Karl Iagnemma in a statement said the joint-venture was seeing ""many long-term opportunities for further deploying Motional's technology across the Uber platform.""
The deliveries will be made in Hyundai's fully electric IONIQ-5 vehicles, converted to operate autonomously. A spokesperson said a safety driver will be present inside the vehicles.
Asked whether Uber Eats customers would have to walk to the vehicles to accept their meal orders, the spokesperson said the companies would share more details on the service ahead of the launch.
Motional's pivot to food delivery follows a move by many companies in the self-driving industry to expand from their original ambition of providing a consumer robotaxi services.
Self-driving companies have repeatedly pushed out timelines to provide truly driverless rides, with only a few limited fully autonomous programs available across the U.S. 

Automating the delivery of goods in less challenging environments, such as suburbs or along highway stretches, is offering a faster way to generate returns.
Motional has been operating a robotaxi pilot program in Las Vegas with U.S. Uber rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) over the last three years. Motional and Lyft in November said they will launch a fully driverless ride-hail service in Las Vegas in 2023.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Qantas Airways on Thursday picked Airbus as the preferred supplier to replace its domestic fleet, switching from Boeing (NYSE:BA) in a major win for the European planemaker that also triggered an upheaval in engine supplies.
The Australian national airline said it had committed to buying 20 Airbus A321XLR planes and 20 A220-300 jets, along with options for 94 aircraft, pushing shares in France-based Airbus 3% higher in early European trading.
""This is a clear sign of our confidence in the future and we've locked in pricing ahead of what is likely to be a big uptick in demand https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airlines-place-their-bets-looking-past-pandemic-renew-fleets-2021-12-15 for next-generation narrowbody aircraft,"" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said.
Qantas is the latest airline to join a growing race for efficient medium-haul jets as carriers look past the pandemic to lower fuel costs and help emissions targets.
The agreement is subject to board approval, expected by June 2022 after negotiations with pilots.
Deliveries would start in mid-2023 and continue over 10 years to replace an ageing fleet of 75 Boeing 737s and 20 717s.
The win caps a successful week for Airbus after Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) on Wednesday agreed to launch the A350 freighter https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/singapore-airlines-provisional-deal-buy-seven-a350-freighters-2021-12-15/#:~:text=SINGAPORE%2FPARIS%2C%20Dec%2015%20(,airline%20operator%20of%20the%20plane and the planemaker looks poised to seize a narrowbody order from KLM https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airbus-takes-lead-bid-win-dutch-klm-jet-deal-sources-2021-12-08, in what could become the second defection in 24 hours. 
For Boeing, the loss of the coveted Qantas contract, first reported by Bloomberg News, is a further blow to its 737 MAX. 
It interrupts a strong run of sales since the jet was cleared for flight late last year following a safety ban and means a further loss of narrowbody market share to Airbus.
Qantas has operated Boeing jets since 1959 and was once the world's only airline with an all 747 fleet. The U.S. planemaker will now supply only its long-haul 787 Dreamliners.
DOUBLE DEFECTION
Joyce said he was not concerned that his airline would be overly reliant on Airbus.
""I'm sure that Boeing will be very, very aggressive to maintain their relationship with us, which is a big one with the 787s, when other competitions come up,"" he told reporters.
Joyce said the flexibility to combine the Qantas narrowbody order with one already placed by low-cost arm Jetstar for more than 100 A320neos was a key attraction of the Airbus deal.
The world's third-oldest airline has been the scene of epic battles in the global plane duopoly including a hotly contested face-off in 2005 between the 787 and A350, which went to Boeing and prompted Airbus https://www.reuters.com/article/airbus-a350/flying-back-on-course-the-inside-story-of-the-new-airbus-a350-jet-idINKBN0K006G20141222 to tear up its original design.
The latest contest triggered a double defection as Qantas also switched to U.S. engine maker Pratt & Whitney.
Qantas plans to order the Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Technology subsidiary's engines for the fresh batch of Airbus A320neo-family jets, having chosen CFM International engines from GE and  Safran  (PA:SAF) for much of the Jetstar order. 
""Pratt & Whitney gave us the best arrangements,"" Joyce said. ""We do feel that since both airlines will have a large amount of aircraft there are not mixed fleet issues.""

CFM's engines are available on both Boeing and Airbus narrowbodies, meaning it has less incentive to weigh in with aggressive bids to help sway the aircraft choice, analysts say. 
Qantas is separately looking at A350 widebodies capable of the world's longest commercial flights from Sydney to London. A decision on ""Project Sunrise"" is expected next year.

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2021 07:28AM ET</span>",Telecom Italia investor Vivendi considers seeking board revamp -sources,"(Adds TIM comment on CEO search, paragraphs 4-5)
By Agnieszka Flak and Gwénaëlle Barzic
MILAN (Reuters) -Telecom Italia's (TIM) top investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) is considering pushing for a board reshuffle at the Italian phone group in an attempt to oust former CEO Luigi Gubitosi, according to four people familiar with the matter.
The boardroom battle comes at a crucial juncture for TIM, which is due to meet on Friday to discuss how to respond to a 33 billion euro ($37 billion) takeover proposal from U.S. fund KKR. 
Gubitosi quit as TIM chief executive last month following investor criticism of his performance, led by Vivendi, and disappointing results. 
However he did not step down as a board director, preventing Pietro Labriola, who was named general manager and who sources said was seen as a likely CEO candidate, from joining the board.
A TIM spokeswoman on Thursday reiterated that a search for a new CEO was still ongoing as indicated by the group in its Nov. 26 statement.
Labriola, the head of TIM's Brazilian unit, was promoted to general manager pending a free board seat. 
If Gubitosi does not resign as a director at the Friday meeting, France's Vivendi is considering pushing for the board revamp, according to two of the sources. 
The two people said that, should Vivendi choose that course of action, it would request an extraordinary shareholder meeting to be called to appoint a new board, a move that would need the board's backing to go through. 
TIM declined to comment.
A board revamp could also be triggered by the resignation of a majority of directors. 
Even if another board member decided to step down and thus opened up a seat for Labriola, this is unlikely satisfy Vivendi, which wants Gubitosi out, the two sources said.
Nonetheless, Vivendi is also considering seeking a board reshuffle because it wants to map out an alternative plan to KKR's to relaunch the group, the people added.
KKR's proposal exposes Vivendi to a capital loss on its 24% TIM stake. In acquiring the holding, the French media group spent more than twice the 0.505 euros per share KKR is offering. 
Vivendi, which has a 24% stake in TIM and two of its 15 board seats, is seeking the support of Italian state investor CDP for its board revamp plans, one of the sources said.

CDP, TIM's second-largest shareholder, declined to comment.

1009,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2021 07:14AM ET</span>","SenseTime plans Hong Kong IPO relaunch Monday, sources say","HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese artificial intelligence startup SenseTime Group plans to keep its Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) at $767 million as it considers re-launching the withdrawn deal as early as Monday, four people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The people could not be identified as the information is not public.
A spokesperson for SenseTime, which withdrew its Hong Kong IPO on Monday after the administration of U.S. President Biden put the company on a blacklist, declined to comment to Reuters.
The U.S. Treasury added SenseTime to a list of ""Chinese military-industrial complex companies,"" last week accusing it of having developed a facial recognition programme to determine a target's ethnicity, with a focus on identifying ethnic Uyghurs.
SenseTime and its advisers were working on Thursday to finalise the cornerstone investor stake in the new IPO, one of the sources said.
It was likely the cornerstone stake would be about $450 million, in line with the first IPO attempt, but the composition of investors could change, they added.
SenseTime is expected to price the deal by the end of next week and list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange before Dec. 31.
Chinese buyers were likely to take nearly all of the $317 million worth of stock in the IPO not taken by cornerstone shareholders, two of the sources said.
SenseTime had not expected the U.S decision, sources told Reuters at the time. It came as the bookbuild to raise $767 million was being finalised.
The company was working to update its prospectus to include the investment ban in its risk factor sections, sources had told Reuters.
SenseTime could launch the deal on Monday to raise the same amount as the initial Hong Kong IPO, they said, pending approval from the Hong Kong exchange of the amended risk disclosures.

SenseTime had planned to sell 1.5 billion shares in a price range of HK$3.85 to HK3.99 each, according to its initial filings.
Bloomberg News first reported the deal's relaunch on Thursday.

1010,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2021 07:12AM ET</span>",DHL orders 100 self-driving U.S. trucks from TuSimple and Navistar,"By Tina Bellon
AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - DHL Supply Chain has placed a U.S. order for 100 trucks equipped with TuSimple's self-driving technology and manufactured by Navistar (NYSE:NAV) to further expand its understanding of driverless trucks in its supply chain.
DHL, a subsidiary of  Deutsche Post  AG (DE:DPWGn), in a statement said that while the partnership was currently in its infant stages, it looked forward to deploying TuSimple's driverless technology across multiple regions outside the United States in the future.
The logistics provider, which also has partnerships with other self-driving companies, began working on a pilot program with California-based TuSimple earlier this month to transport daily hauls between Dallas and San Antonio, Texas.
Those hauls are currently operated by TuSimple-owned trucks retrofitted with the company's self-driving technology. The new trucks, expected to be delivered to DHL between 2024 and 2025, will be owned by the logistics company and equipped with autonomous technology from the start. 
TuSimple will then provide its self-driving services to DHL on a subscription basis as part of the company's long-term business plan, TuSimple Chief Executive Cheng Lu said in an interview.
""Retrofitting a truck is simple not scalable,"" Lu said.
TuSimple last year partnered with Illinois-based Navistar to co-develop self-driving trucks targeted for 2024 production. Navistar took a minority stake in TuSimple.
For DHL, autonomous truck deployment is currently limited and a spokesman said the company was vendor-agnostic, allowing it to partner with the optimal suppliers and technologies in different regions.

DHL in October submitted a reservation for 100 trucks with TuSimple competitor Embark Trucks Inc, and said it will submit further reservations with a yet unnamed third autonomous trucking provider. 
The DHL order brings TuSimple's total truck reservations to nearly 6,900. The company already has a partnership with UPS and said it aims to remove safety drivers from its trucks on an 80-mile (130-km) test route between Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona, in the coming months.

1011,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2021 07:07AM ET</span>","Fretting about data security, China's government expands its use of 'golden shares'","BEIJING (Reuters) -The Chinese government has been expanding its practice of taking minority stakes in private companies beyond those specialising in online news and content to firms possessing large amounts of key data, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
It has made a de facto special management stake or ""golden share"" arrangement with Full Truck Alliance Co Ltd, a Chinese platform arranging trucking services, according to one of the people.
Troubled Didi Global Inc has also been in talks about a golden share for its core ride-hailing business, a third source with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Seeking influence, Beijing began taking golden shares in private online media companies - usually about 1% of a firm - some five years ago. The stakes are bought by government-backed funds or companies which gain a board seat and/or veto rights for key business decisions.
Authorities are now also keen to have some control over vast troves of data owned by certain companies, the sources said, adding that the data is seen as a national asset at risk of attack and misuse, including by foreign states.
""They have broadened their attention to other companies that possess strategically important data and are considered operators of critical information infrastructure,"" said one person with direct knowledge of how some state investors handle such stakes.
Often there is no evidence of a golden share until the share ownership is publicly registered but that can take a year or longer. More golden shares in data-rich companies will come to light in due course, the person said, adding that authorities were now more willing to highlight their ownership.
A separate source said a golden share had been taken in a data-rich company very recently but declined to disclose which one.
Reuters was not able to ascertain how many other data-rich firms authorities were seeking to take a golden share in.
The sources declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. The internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), did not respond to a request for comment.
The golden shares are a ""sword of Damocles hanging over the heads of firms that have them, a reminder that data security is now under close watch by the authorities,"" said Feng Chucheng, a partner at consultancy Plenum in Beijing.
Their expanded use is in line with China's tougher stance on data protection. A new data security law went into effect in September as did other rules that compel operators of critical information infrastructure to conduct security inspections and risk assessments.
TRANSPORT PLATFORMS IN CROSSHAIRS
Full Truck Alliance disclosed in May that the China Internet Investment Fund (CIIF) had become a shareholder. The fund is backed by the CAC and its holding - taken sometime around 2019 or 2020 - is in essence, a special management stake arrangement, according to one source.
Full Truck Alliance and the CIIF did not respond to requests for comment.
Didi's talks about a golden share are part of a planned business restructuring, according to a separate source. That restructuring has come after Didi angered Chinese regulators by pressing ahead with a U.S. IPO despite being asked to put it on hold for a cybersecurity review, prompting authorities in July to order a takedown of its apps from app stores.
Didi also did not respond to a request for comment. 
Both Full Truck Alliance and Didi are listed in the United States and the CAC launched investigations into both in July.
One source said U.S.-listed firms or those seeking U.S. listings are more likely to gain attention when authorities think about firms they want to have a special management stake in.
ONLINE OVERSIGHT 
The Chinese government also remains focused on control of online content. Spotify-like Ximalaya is in discussions with a Shanghai government body for a special management stake, two sources said. 
Ximalaya declined to comment. Representatives for the government body, the Shanghai Municipal Administration of Radio and Television, could not be reached for comment.
The internet content sector has had to contend with tougher oversight since 2017 when rules were amended to make government-affiliated investments in ""qualified online news and information providers"" compulsory. The same year, online media platforms were also required to obtain licenses to disseminate news and other content.
ByteDance, owner of TikTok and its Chinese sister app Douyin, agreed to a golden share for one of its China subsidiaries in late 2019, a year and a half before the stake in the unit was registered, according to one source. 
ByteDance did not respond to a request for comment.
It was implied that accepting a special management stake would be helpful for firms to obtain these licenses, the same source added. 
Operators of news aggregators Yidian Zixun and  Qutoutiao  (NASDAQ:QTT) have also sold stakes to government-related entities while Sina (NASDAQ:SINA) News has sold one in an affiliated company, public filings show.
ByteDance's news aggregator Jinri Toutiao and the other three news apps all obtained operating licenses within two years of agreeing to the golden share.
Board seats held by government-related officials need not have a direct impact on day-to-day operations, a separate source said.

The CAC has sent an official, Wu Shugang, to sit on the board of the ByteDance unit in which a CIIF subsidiary holds its golden share. While Wu has an office in one of ByteDance's Beijing premises, he rarely attends meetings and ByteDance usually deals with the CAC directly, the source said. 
Reuters was not able to reach Wu for comment.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Thursday, continuing the previous session’s strong gains after the Federal Reserve expressed confidence in the strength of the economic recovery, turning more aggressive in the speed of its tapering.
At 7:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 230 points, or 0.6%, S&P 500 Futures traded 33 points, or 0.7%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 125 points, or 0.8%.
The major averages closed firmly higher Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping just under 400 points, or 1.1%, the S&P 500 rose 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite closed 2.2% higher.
The Fed kept interest rates near zero Wednesday, as expected, but said it would speed up the wind-down of its bond purchases and its timeline on rate hikes to curb elevated inflation.
Risk sentiment improved as the central bank predicted that the Covid-19 pandemic, despite the Omicron variant, would eventually dissipate, leaving in a strong economy with interest rates increasing slowly, inflation gradually easing and employment near record levels.
That said, investors are paying close attention to the Covid situation in the U.K. after Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned over the weekend of a coming “tidal wave” of cases, driven by the Omicron variant. On Wednesday, the U.K. reported its highest ever daily number of Covid cases since the pandemic began, with over 78,000 new infections.
The Bank of England decided to hike its interest rates for the first time since the pandemic, lifting its key rate to 0.25% from 0.1%, while the European Central Bank is expected, at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), to confirm it will stop its bond purchases at the end of March, while keeping interest rates at all-time lows. 
There are a number of economic indicators due for release later Thursday, including the weekly jobless claims data, November housing starts and building permits, November industrial production and December manufacturing PMI.
In the corporate sector, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) joined the fast-expanding list of companies that are either delaying the return to the office or putting it off indefinitely till the world has a tighter grip on Omicron.
Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Accenture (NYSE:ACN) are scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the opening bell, while FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and  Rivian Automotive  (NASDAQ:RIVN) are due after the bell.
Oil prices rose Thursday after U.S. crude stockpiles fell the most since September, suggesting demand remained strong in the world's largest consumer even as the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus threatens to curb global consumption. 
U.S. crude inventories shrunk by 4.58 million barrels last week, according to a report from the Energy Information Administration released late Wednesday. This was a much larger drop than an industry report from the American Petroleum Institute had indicated on Tuesday.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% higher at $71.83 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.3% to $74.83. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 1.2% to $1,785.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1296."

The carmaker, which reduced its forecast for 2021 vehicle deliveries last week to 9 million from 9.3 million, is preparing for the possibility that the current chips shortage could last until at least early 2023, the report said.
In the worst-case scenario, deliveries could fall to 8 million cars next year - but even if things go relatively well, deliveries could be slightly below this year's, it said.
Volkswagen declined to comment on the report, stating it expected a slight easing of the supply situation in 2022 but that the first half of the year would remain very volatile.
Carmakers including BMW and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) have said they expect chip problems to continue well into 2022, with BMW confirming to Reuters on Thursday it did not expect the crisis to ease until the second half of next year.
Whether buying computer chips directly from manufacturers, reconfiguring cars, or producing them with parts missing, many carmakers are getting creative to cope with the global shortage that some had expected would ease by the beginning of next year.
Volkswagen's Audi, which alongside its Skoda brand is lengthening its Christmas break to Jan. 10 because of the supply bottleneck, said it expected the situation to carry on for ""months on end.""
""We expect to be occupied with this crisis for months on end in the coming year,"" a spokesperson said. ""The scarcity could extend for even longer.""

Porsche, also owned by Volkswagen, said in November the crisis highlighted the need for automakers to take production into their own hands.
""Anyone who believes the chip crisis will calm itself in the next year is mistaken,"" CEO Oliver Blume told Germany's Boersen-Zeitung.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - U.S. life sciences company Illumina on Thursday criticised EU antitrust regulators for scrutinising its $8 billion cash-and-stock takeover of Grail even though the cancer detection test maker has no activities in Europe.
The Commission's decision to scrutinise the deal via a rarely used power marked a troubling change in its policy, Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN)'s lawyer told a hearing at Europe's second-top court, the General Court.
""If the Commission is going to radically change policy, then businesses should know. Think about business certainty,"" Daniel Beard said.
Commission lawyer Nicholas Khan said Illumina's arguments were incongruous, but Grail lawyer Javier Ruiz Calzado was equally critical.
""The Commission has decided on a Copernican change in policy,"" he told judges, saying the policy change could hurt start-ups and the venture capitalist industry in Europe.
EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager is seeking to extend her power to examine big companies' acquisitions of start-ups in order to shut down nascent rivals.
Critics warn of over-reach while some national competition agencies worry about a power grab by the EU executive. The Commission, however, said it took up the Illumina case at the request of Belgium, France, Greece, Iceland, the Netherlands and Norway.
Following a Commission order to seek its approval for the deal, Illumina complied but also launched litigation against the EU executive.
Illumina riled the Commission when it completed the acquisition in August without waiting for the green light, resulting in an order to keep Grail separate and to have independent managers run the company until an EU decision.
The deal, unveiled in September last year, would give Illumina access to Grail's flagship Galleri blood test used to diagnose cancers at early stages when the disease is easier to treat.

A judgment is likely to come next year.
The case is T-227/21 Illumina v Commission.

LONDON (Reuters) - British online fashion retailer Boohoo on Thursday warned on annual profit for the second time in four months, blaming a spike in product return rates, disruption to international deliveries and higher inbound freight costs.
It said the new Omicron coronavirus variant could pose further demand uncertainty and elevated returns rates, particularly in January and February if purchased partywear is left unworn by cancelled social gatherings.
Shares in the Manchester, northern England, based group, which sells clothing, shoes, accessories and beauty products aimed at 16 to 40-year olds, were down 16.3% at 1012 GMT, extending 2021 losses to 66.4%.
Shares in rival ASOS (LON:ASOS), which warned on profit in October, were down 4.4%.
Boohoo's latest warning adds to concerns over Christmas trading after electricals retailer Currys said on Wednesday its market had softened.
Boohoo has been seeking to improve its image following negative publicity over supply chain failings but had warned on the outlook in September.
It said it expected net sales growth in the year to Feb. 28 2022 to be 12% to 14%, compared to previous guidance of 20% to 25%.
Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin for the year was expected to be 6% to 7%, compared to previous guidance of 9% to 9.5%, implying adjusted EBITDA of 117-139 million pounds ($155.2-$184.4 million).
That compares to analysts' average forecast prior to the update of 190 million pounds and 173.6 million pounds made in 2020-21.
""This is due to significantly higher returns rates impacting net sales growth and costs, with continued extended delivery times impacting international demand, consequently driving lower returns on marketing expenditure, and significant ongoing pandemic-related inbound freight cost inflation,"" it said.
DRESSES GOING BACK
Boohoo said UK return rates in its third quarter to Nov. 30 were 12.5 percentage points higher than the same period last year and 7 percentage points higher than pre-pandemic levels driven by an exceptionally high dress mix. Boohoo shoppers typically have 28 days for UK returns.
Group net sales were up 10% to 506.2 million pounds in the quarter. But while net sales were up 32% in the United Kingdom, they fell 12% in the Rest of Europe division, were down 14% in the United States and plunged 21% in the Rest of World division.
The poor overseas performance reflected significantly longer customer delivery times. It said the United States had not seen the recovery previously anticipated due to the continued impact of reduced air freight capacity.
Boohoo fulfills all international sales from its UK distribution network. Its first U.S. distribution centre is not set to go live until 2023, although the company is considering options to expedite this process.
""The current headwinds are short term and we expect them to soften when pandemic related disruption begins to ease,"" said CEO John Lyttle.

Boohoo also flagged higher exceptional items for the year of around 33 million pounds, primarily due to warehouse and new brand restructuring.

Investing.com – Valneva ADRs (NASDAQ:VALN) climbed more than 10% in Thursday’s premarket trading after the company said its Covid booster worked on people who had received the same shot initially.
The company said initial results show “excellent immune response” after a third dose of VLA2001 administered seven-to-eight months after the second dose. Antibody levels measured two weeks after the booster dose were approximately four-fold higher compared to those observed two weeks after primary immunization, the company said in a release.
The findings come almost two weeks after a British study showed the company’s vaccine, VLA2001, was the only one that offered no immunity boost when given to people previously immunized with  Pfizer  's (NYSE:PFE) Covid-19 vaccine, the most administered shot in the world.
Valneva had then countered by pointing out that participants in the study were given booster doses after a shorter interval than usual and that vaccines made from inactivated viruses, such as its candidate, typically require longer to be effective.
The company today said it will launch a trial to evaluate a VLA2001 booster shot provided at least six months after primary vaccination with other vaccines or following natural infection. This study is expected to commence in early 2022, it said.
It will also test the booster’s efficacy against Omicron, the variant behind the latest surge in cases in Europe, Australia and elsewhere.

Investing.com – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has joined the fast-expanding list of companies that are either delaying the return to the office or putting it off indefinitely till the world has a tighter grip on Omicron.
CEO Tim Cook sent a memo to staff Wednesday informing them of the company delaying its corporate return-to-office deadline from February 1 to a “date yet to be determined.”
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the second most valuable company in the world after the iPhone-maker, had scrapped its return-to-work date in September. Others to have also put off the return include Uber (NYSE:UBER), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Ford (NYSE:F).
Apple has previously delayed its office-return plans several times, with some staff rebelling on occasions against the company’s desire to reopen offices. Several companies in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street have faced resistance against reopening as well as vaccination mandates.
Tuesday, a divided U.S. appeals court declined a request by six employees to stop United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) imposing unpaid leave on staff who are granted religious or medical exemption from its vaccination mandate.
In Apple’s case, the latest decision comes the same week the company restored its mask mandate to all U.S. retail stores and temporarily shut three locations because of rising virus cases among employees, according to Bloomberg.
Labelled ""of concern"" by the World Health Organization, Omicron has been reported in more than 60 countries, including China, and now dominates the Delta variant in many nations. Omicron, which studies show to have a far higher reproduction rate than Delta, has forced several countries to reimpose restrictions on the movement of people and on business activity.

1021,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2021 05:31AM ET</span>","Italy's Fiat need not pay $30 million in back taxes, EU court adviser says","By Foo Yun Chee
LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) -Italian carmaker Fiat Chrysler need not pay 30 million euros ($33.95 million) in back taxes to Luxembourg, an adviser to Europe's top court said on Thursday.
The Fiat case was part of European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager's crackdown on sweetheart deals between European Union countries and multinationals, the most high profile of which were Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Irish deal and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Luxembourg deal.
Fiat Chrysler, which merged with Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA earlier this year and rebranded itself Stellantis, had challenged the EU tax order at the General Court but lost. It then appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).
Ireland, which last year won its fight against an EU tax order requiring it to recoup a record 13 billion euros in back taxes from Apple, also appealed against the Fiat order.
Pronouncing on both appeals on Thursday, Priit Pikamae, advocate general at the EU Court of Justice, said Ireland's appeal against the EU tax order should be upheld and the Commission decision annulled.
The result would be Fiat need not pay the extra tax bill, even though the adviser said Fiat's appeal should be dismissed because of what he found unconvincing arguments.
In its 2015 decision, the Commission said Fiat Chrysler set prices for goods and services sold between subsidiaries, known as transfer prices, that were below market rates and which artificially lowered their taxes. 
The CJEU, which usually follows four out of five such non-binding opinions, will rule in the coming months.

The cases are C-885/19 P Fiat Chrysler Finance Europe v Commission and C-898/19 P Ireland v Commission.

On WallStreetBets, the subreddit responsible for igniting this year’s meme stock craze, the pile-ons were plentiful, the profanity more so. Many members worried that a stock market listing marked the beginning of the end of Reddit's free-wheeling culture, while others saw the opportunity for more fun — and potentially profit.
 
The realization that Reddit may never be the same seemed to galvanize many users. Long threads pointed to a group strategy: Could the WallStreetBets community pump the stock as it had done for companies such as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc. previously? Hundreds of upvotes later, a user by the name of LowercaseG_Sol seemed to sum up the consensus:
Comments often strayed into the Reddit version of the profound. Surveillance was a clear concern. ‘KetoIsRacist’ predicted ""mass censorship."" Meanwhile ‘wearethesamewave’ was convinced that the company had increased its ads to signal that change was coming.
On Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), people joked about the symbolism of buying shares in the ultimate meme stock company:
Details of Reddit’s planned public equity raising are still vague, with the company saying that the number of shares and proposed price range for an IPO haven’t yet been determined.

1023,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2021 04:52AM ET</span>",Refugees lack COVID shots because drugmakers fear lawsuits - documents,"By Francesco Guarascio and Panu Wongcha-um
BRUSSELS/BANGKOK (Reuters) - Tens of millions of migrants may be denied COVID-19 vaccines from a global programme because some major manufacturers are worried about legal risks from harmful side effects, according to officials and internal documents from Gavi, the charity operating the programme, reviewed by Reuters.
Nearly two years into a pandemic that has already killed more than 5 million people, only about 7% of people in low-income countries have received a dose. Vaccine deliveries worldwide have been delayed by production problems, hoarding by rich countries, export restrictions and red tape. Many programmes have also been hampered by hesitancy among the public.
The legal concerns are an additional hurdle for public health officials tackling the coronavirus – even as officials say unvaccinated people offer an ideal environment for it to mutate into new variants that threaten hard-won immunity around the world. Many COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers have required that countries indemnify them for any adverse events suffered by individuals as a result of the vaccines, the United Nations says.
Where governments are not in control, that is not possible.
The concerns affect people, such as those displaced by the Myanmar, Afghanistan and Ethiopian crises, who are beyond the reach of national governments' vaccination schemes.
For refugees, migrants and asylum-seekers, as well as people afflicted by natural disasters or other events that put them out of reach of government help, the global programme known as COVAX created a Humanitarian Buffer – a last-resort reserve of shots to be administered by humanitarian groups. Gavi, the vaccine alliance, is a public-private partnership set up in 2000 to promote vaccination around the world.
But that buffer does not have any mechanism to offer compensation. Gavi, which operates COVAX with the World Health Organization (WHO), says that where those applying for doses, mainly NGOs, can't bear legal risks, deliveries from that stockpile can only be made if vaccine-makers accept liability.
The companies that are willing to do so under these circumstances provide only a minority of the programme's vaccines, according to people familiar with the matter and the documents, written by Gavi staff for a board meeting starting at the end of November. 
More than two-thirds of COVAX doses have come from  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and its partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) PLC and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc., Gavi says. Moderna declined to comment. AstraZeneca and Pfizer said they were in talks with Gavi but declined to comment further. All three said they are committed to making doses available to poorer nations at relatively low prices. Pfizer said it was collaborating directly with governments in Jordan and Lebanon to donate doses for refugees.
Mainly because of the legal concerns, less than 2 million doses have so far been sent from the buffer, Gavi says. About 167 million people risk being excluded from national programmes, according to United Nations data cited in the documents.
Unless all the firms accept legal liability, ""access to vaccines for some populations will remain a challenge,"" the Gavi documents say, adding that new crises will generate additional demand to cover displaced populations.
The vaccine makers' reluctance to take on the legal risks is ""a major hurdle"" in attempts to provide vaccines for the buffer, a spokesperson for Gavi told Reuters. Gavi did not comment on the details in the documents, but said applications for vaccines are confidential until the doses are delivered. In September, Gavi's CEO, Seth Berkley, tweeted https://twitter.com/GaviSeth/status/1440780492324818945?s=20 an appeal to drugmakers to waive their requirements for legal indemnity.
Three Chinese drugmakers have agreed to shoulder legal risks when their shots are delivered through the buffer: SinoVac Biotech Ltd, Sinopharm Group Co (OTC:SHTDY). Ltd, and Clover Biopharmaceuticals Co. Ltd, according to the Gavi document. The drugmakers did not respond to requests for comment.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) of the United States confirmed it would waive a requirement for indemnity for deliveries from the buffer: ""We are proud to be part of this effort to protect the world's most vulnerable people,"" said Paul Stoffels, Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer. He did not elaborate.
However, less than one-third of COVAX supplies have come from these four firms, COVAX data shows: Clover's shot has not yet been approved so is not in use.
The global industry association, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), said ""no company has refused to consider"" taking on the legal risk. However, in the case of shots delivered from the buffer, it said some firms felt they could not do so without full knowledge of where and how vaccines would be used. 
It would be hard to continuously monitor vaccines for safety in refugee camps, and delivery is logistically very challenging and not suitable for all types, said the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), which represents large pharmaceutical companies in Europe.
People may blame vaccines for problems that emerge afterwards even if they are unrelated, it said.
""This could then lead to an increased number of litigation cases ... during which the safety and efficacy of the vaccine would be publicly questioned,"" it said in a statement to Reuters. That might lead to increased vaccine hesitancy and a slower recovery from the pandemic, it said.
So far there is scant information on COVID vaccine litigation, but claims made to out-of-court compensation programmes are one measure of the risk. A programme in the United States has so far not paid out anything, public data show; neither has one set up by the WHO for lower income countries, the WHO said. In Europe, a handful of compensation awards have been granted for undisclosed amounts of money, official data from Denmark, Germany, Norway and Switzerland show.
Globally there have been few reported COVID infections among refugees, migrants and asylum-seekers – testing is not always systematic and infections can generate only mild symptoms especially in younger people. 
But cramped conditions and weak healthcare expose them to high infection risk. This, combined with low levels of vaccination in a mobile population could favour the emergence of new variants and be a vector for infection, said Mireille Lembwadio, Global Vaccination Coordinator at the International Organization of Migration (IOM), a U.N.-related body that advises governments and migrants. 
""Leaving them unvaccinated could help spread the virus and its variants across the world,"" she said.
WAITING FOR DOSES
Francois Nosten, a French professor who helps coordinate healthcare for people from Myanmar living on the border with Thailand, is one of those waiting for vaccines. In June, he put in a request from the Humanitarian Buffer for 70,000 doses – some for some of the 90,000 or so who are sheltering in camps along the border, but most for unregistered migrants in the border town of Mae Sot and nearby villages.
Nosten, whose main work is researching malaria, is expecting the doses - a fraction of the more than 8 billion administered worldwide - this month. He has been told they will come from Sinopharm, and he hopes they can help inoculate key at-risk groups in Thailand's Tak province. Gavi said delivery arrangements are still being finalised.
About 20,000 doses will be given to people in the camps by the International Rescue Committee (IRC), a humanitarian group working with Nosten.
""At this point whatever vaccine we can secure we are grateful for,"" said its Thailand Director, Darren Hertz. He added that the IRC believed the likelihood that a member of the refugee population would attempt to take legal action in case of side-effects was ""extremely low.""
Hertz said the IRC has received a handful of ad hoc vaccine donations from the Thai government and is currently tackling significant outbreaks in five of nine camps on the border, where about 3,000 cases have been confirmed, including at least 26 deaths. A Thai foreign ministry spokesperson confirmed the government was working with the IRC on providing vaccinations in shelters along the border.
Nosten's charity, Border Health Foundation (BHF), is one of eight organisations worldwide that have applied to distribute the shots from the Humanitarian Buffer and one of three to be approved, Gavi said. 
Ann Burton, Chief of Public Health at the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, said the liability issue was one reason agencies have been slow to apply. The programme has also been delayed by the general shortage of vaccines and administrative hurdles. 
Organisations applying for supplies from the buffer may not choose which vaccines they receive. Working with displaced people, Nosten said it would be more convenient to give them Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, which offers protection after a single dose instead of the two doses needed for Sinopharm's.
But the Sinopharm version will be ""better than nothing,"" he said.
More than 100 national governments have promised to offer vaccines where possible to all the displaced people on their soil, according to the IOM. However, the U.N. group says migrants and refugees are often effectively excluded from such schemes because of administrative or cultural hurdles. 
In cases where governments aren't in charge or have not agreed to vaccinate migrants, COVAX's Humanitarian Buffer is the only option. At least 40 countries have yet to include unauthorised migrants in their vaccination programmes, according to the IOM – it and the UNHCR declined to name the countries.
Gavi set up the buffer in March 2021, planning to reserve up to 5% of vaccine doses as they become available to COVAX, which would amount to roughly 70 million doses so far. 
The only shots delivered from the buffer so far - just over 1.6 million Sinopharm doses – landed in Iran in November, where high numbers of displaced Afghans have arrived, UNICEF Iran said. That's enough to inoculate about 800,000 people; more will likely be needed, UNICEF said.
NEED FOR SPEED
The vaccine makers' legal concern is rooted in the unprecedented speed of the effort to develop the COVID shots, the EFPIA said.
In normal circumstances, drugmakers buy insurance to cover liability for vaccines' potential adverse effects. But COVID forced them to develop drugs so quickly that some side effects - for instance, a rare blood-clotting condition in some of those who took the AstraZeneca vaccine - are emerging as shots go into people's arms. 
Many governments and international agencies have set up compensation schemes to reimburse victims and avoid lengthy litigation. An emergency law invoked by the U.S. government provides legal immunity for drug companies for side effects from their COVID-19 vaccines used in the country. The only exception is for instances of ""wilful misconduct.""

For drug companies, accepting potential liability runs counter to standard practice.
""Vaccine manufacturers try to minimize legal risks in almost every setting,"" said John T. Monahan, Professor at Georgetown University. ""The gold standard is full immunity from lawsuits. If they accept carve-outs, it may become more difficult to reach that goal.""

Investing.com – Novartis ADRs (NYSE:NVS) traded 3.8% higher in Thursday’s premarket after the company said it will buy back shares worth up to $15 billion.
The money for the repurchase will come from the $20.7 billion the Swiss drugmaker got from selling part of its stake in rival Roche (SIX:ROG). 
The buyback, to begin in coming days, will be completed by end-2023, Novartis said. 
Novartis owned 33%, or 53.3 million, of Roche’s voting shares and used record-high share prices to exit the company it bought into between 2001 and 2003. 
The shares were acquired as part of a takeover attempt under then-Novartis Chief Executive Officer Daniel Vasella. The effort failed but gave Novartis a capital gain of $14 billion on the original investment. 
Roche will cancel the shares it buys back from Novartis. 
Novartis said the buyback program will still leave it with enough cash to fund a rising dividend, as well as investment in the company's business and bolt-on acquisitions. It reiterated its forecast of growing sales by 4% or more through 2026.

Supply bottlenecks for chips have been dampening the car industry across the globe. The shortages again dragged heavily on Czech industrial output in October, leading to a weak start to the fourth quarter.

The break will start on Dec. 23 at Skoda, but only part of it will be counted as a holiday for the workers. They will get compensation for the other part amounting to 80% of their wages because production will halt due to the company's troubles, the unions said in their weekly bulletin.

Investing.com -- The wheels are coming off at Boohoo.
Shares in the British online fast fashion house fell as much as 20% to their lowest in over five years on Thursday after the company cut its sales guidance sharply, blaming a surge in returns of unwanted products over recent weeks.  They subsequently pared losses to trade down 13.5% by 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT).
The company also said it was suffering from severe inflation in inbound freight costs and significantly longer delivery times, undermining a business proposition that depends on speed as much as price. It noted that this had affected iys U.S. business in particular, and that it's now looking at ways to accelerate the opening of its first fulfilment center in the U.S.
The developments are the clearest sign yet that Boohoo may have bitten off more than it can chew in trying to expand rapidly in the U.S. and Europe at a time when the pandemic and Brexit - which has raised shipping costs between the U.K. and EU - are making life more difficult for exporters. 
Boohoo said it now only expects net sales to rise by between 12% and 14% this year, barely half of the 20%-25% range it had previously forecast. It expects an EBITDA margin of only 6%-7%, compared to previous guidance of 9% to 9.5%. That implies adjusted EBITDA of between 117 million and 139 million pounds. 
CEO John Lyttle said in a statement the group is still confident of its business model and its medium-term forecast of an EBITDA margin around 10%. 
""The current headwinds are short term and we expect them to soften when pandemic related disruption begins to ease,"" Lyttle said in a statement. He noted that the group's strong performance in the U.K. ""clearly validates the Boohoo model.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) is in talks with China Life Insurance Group to launch an asset management joint venture in China, two sources said, as part of the Swiss bank's plan to bolster its presence in the world's second-largest economy.
UBS will hold a majority stake in the business unit, which, if finalised, will be China's first foreign majority-owned asset management joint venture with an insurer since it permitted majority foreign holdings in such partnerships in 2019.
China Life and UBS have signed a memorandum of understanding to set up the joint venture, the formal launch of which will be subject to approval from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), said one of the sources.
Both sources declined to be identified on grounds of the confidentiality of the talks.
UBS declined to comment, while a spokesperson for China Life Insurance Co Ltd, the listed arm of China Life Insurance Group, did not respond to Reuters request for comment.
China has been stepping up efforts to open up its financial sector, worth trillions of dollars to help lure in more foreign investment and shore up the economy, amid rifts with the United States.
A string of foreign financial firms have been in talks for, or have set up, majority-owned asset management businesses in the country in the last couple of years, lured by the prospects of increasing wealth despite near-term economic challenges.
BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY)' asset management arm is in talks to form a wealth management venture with a unit of Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF), Reuters reported in September, as the French firm pursues a bigger slice of the market.
UBS' talks to form a new China asset management venture come after its failed attempts this year to seal a similar deal with a wealth management unit of a state-owned Chinese bank, said the two sources.
""UBS has been keen to take an absolute-controlling status in a China unit, but its competitors are quick to snap up the best local partners,"" said the first source.
CHINA PRESENCE
A total of 31 insurance asset management companies in China ran 18.7 trillion yuan ($2.94 trillion) in assets by September, data from the regulator, CBIRC, shows.
The planned joint venture with China Life will further bolster the presence of UBS in China, a market where it already has presence in brokerage, investment banking and wealth management businesses. 
The bank has a stake of 49% in UBS SDIC Fund Management, an onshore fund management joint venture, via an acquisition in 2005, which had 149 billion yuan in retail fund assets by Nov. 18. 
In 2016, UBS's asset management unit set up a wholly-owned private fund management unit, which caters to wealthy individuals and institutional investors, with assets worth more than 2 billion yuan.
The scope of operations of the planned joint venture with China Life has not yet been finalised and deliberation with regulators is underway, the sources said.

The state-owned China Life Group is China's largest insurance group, with 4.5 trillion yuan in total assets under management as of 2020, mainly linked to its arm, China Life Asset Management Company.

The Fed is out of the way, having announced faster stimulus tapering, signalled three rate hikes for 2022 and upped inflation forecasts. And of the ten central bank meetings scheduled for Thursday, some will deliver rate hikes and most others are likely to flag some form of policy tightening ahead.
Given a hawkish Fed was already pencilled in, the dollar and U.S. yields rose modestly. But its message fired up stocks, especially lifting the tech-heavy Nasdaq more than 2%, the assumption being that long-term yields won't go too far.
That momentum has carried into Thursday, with world stocks rising, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures up as much as 0.7% and a pan-European bourse Europe tipped to open almost 2% higher. 
Japan's Nikkei enjoyed its biggest gain in almost seven weeks, helped also by data showing exports up 20.5% from year-ago levels. PMIs though showed a slowdown; the year's last set of PMI advance readings are due across the rest of the developed world today. 
But back on the central banking front, policymakers in Europe may find it hard to ignore risks from the Omicron COVID variant -- a 25 basis-point Norwegian rate hike for today has gone from a dead-cert some days ago to a probably after the expansion of COVID curbs.
The Bank of England is in a worse bind, with skyrocketing Omicron cases on one hand and 5%-plus inflation on the other.
In any case, it will end its bond-buying scheme, and the European Central Bank shortly afterwards is expected to flag its pandemic-time programme will expire on schedule in March.
Emerging markets, way ahead of the pack in the rate-rise race, will see Mexico raising rates for the fifth consecutive time. Expect Russia to follow with a 100 bps move on Friday. 
But there are exceptions, and Turkey is seen carrying on with rate cuts, despite 20%-plus inflation and a fast-falling currency. Anticipating a 100 bps cut on Thursday, the lira has blown past 15 per dollar, having started 2022 around 7.4.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Thursday:
-Philippines c.bank hold rates; Taiwan, Egypt, Indonesia decisions
- Shimao bonds benefit from news of possible support from Shanghai regulators 
-Markit Dec flash PMIs 
-Swiss National Bank meeting
-Norges Bank meeting
-Bank of England

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open higher Thursday as investors digest the Federal Reserve’s move to tackle inflation, ahead of policy decisions by both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England.. 
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.6% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 1.5% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%.
The U.S. central bank announced late Wednesday that it will double the pace of its asset tapering program to $30 billion a month and projected three quarter-point interest-rate increases in 2022. 
This suggested the Fed policymakers considered the U.S. economy strong enough to handle the Omicron variant as well as monetary policy tightening while they moved to tackle high levels of inflation.
""The economy no longer needs increasing amounts of policy support,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a news conference after the conclusion of the two-day policy meeting. 
There’s more central bank activity in Europe Thursday, with both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England having to strike a balance between the need to support economies threatened by the Covid-19 virus with the desire to combat inflationary pressures.
The BoE is seen as the more likely of the two to tighten monetary policy after data on Wednesday showed British consumer price inflation surged in November to its highest in more than 10 years.

1039,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2021 01:16AM ET</span>",Analysis-Fed's pivot raises investor question: When does QT start?,"By Karen Pierog and David Randall
NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Investors are asking a key question after the U.S. Federal Reserve accelerated its taper of bond purchases and unveiled more aggressive rate hike projections: When could the central bank eventually start to shrink its massive balance sheet?
Bond investors had largely absorbed the Fed's pivot to a more inflation-hawkish stance. The move to a faster reduction in new bond purchases from $120 billion a month to zero had been well telegraphed, as had the new forecasts from policymakers that have now convinced the market that the first interest rate increase will arrive no later than May, with more to follow by year end.
But one question remaining is when the Fed might move from tapering purchases of bonds to shrinking the central bank's balance sheet. 
After its 2014 taper, the Fed held its balance sheet in essentially a steady state for about three years and eventually began to shrink its holdings starting in 2018 by allowing some bonds to ""run off"" the portfolio without reinvesting the principal at maturity, a process that became known as ""quantitative tightening"" or ""QT.""
""Now that quantitative easing is being wound down more quickly, and the first policy rate increases are on the horizon, the ‘topic of greatest consternation’ will turn to the potential for balance sheet runoff,"" said Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of Global Fixed Income in a research note.
Still, Rieder thinks it would be ""low odds for starting runoff in 2022,"" with the consensus of market participants being it wouldn't occur before 2024.
Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, said he's paying attention to when the Fed's balance sheet runoff may begin, given the risk rate hikes could flatten the yield curve more or even invert it if long-term rates do not rise. An inverted yield curve can be a harbinger of a recession.
""If they start allowing bonds to mature and then they're not picking up the pace of their purchases, that means someone else needs to,"" he said. That could lead to less demand and higher long-term yields, preventing the yield curve from flattening too quickly.
Analysts at TD wrote in a research note they expect QT to start in March 2023.
VOLATILITY EXPECTED
At the Fed's press conference, Powell said policymakers ""haven't made any decisions at all about when run-off would start,"" but ""those are exactly the decisions we will be turning to in coming meetings.""
The reaction to the Fed's pivot was mixed, with stocks reversing earlier losses and ending sharply higher, while U.S. Treasury yields rose in choppy trading, and the U.S. dollar eventually turned lower. [.N] [US/] [USD/]
Fund managers generally welcomed the message the Fed would to dial back ultra-accommodative monetary policy. 
“The Fed is recognizing that the economy is very hot right now and they need to move off the present setting,” said Steve Bartolini, portfolio manager for the U.S. Core Bond Strategy at T Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW), who said he was focusing on assets such as bank loans that will benefit from a tightening cycle.
Still, investors saw volatility ahead. The ICE (NYSE:ICE) Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) MOVE Index, a measure of volatility expectations in the bond market, remains near its highest levels since April 2020.
""The one piece that I'm confident of as we try to dig ourselves out of this massive amount of stimulus is volatility will remain high,"" said Lon Erickson, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. ""We'll stay... conservative, keep that powder and be ready for opportunities as that volatility presents them to us.""
Jason England, global bonds portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors agreed the start of such tightening could create ""friction in fixed income markets."" 

Still, investors said the Fed seemed to be succeeding in avoiding panic, in contrast to 2013, when bond yields rocketed during the so-called ""taper tantrum"".
""Nobody's talking about dramatically tightening things up,"" said Brian Nick, Nuveen's chief investment strategist. ""And so this should still be a good environment for risk taking by investors.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian content-sharing platform ShareChat on Thursday said it had raised $266 million in fresh funding from U.S.-based Alkeon Capital and some existing investors, pushing its valuation to $3.7 billion.
The new investments, part of ShareChat's third funding round this year, was led by Alkeon and saw participation from Singapore's Temasek Holdings and Moore Strategic Ventures, among others, the company said in a statement.
Reuters is first to report the fund raising.
ShareChat raised $145 million in July from Temasek and others at a valuation of around $3 billion. 
Indian content-sharing and short-video apps have become popular since New Delhi last year banned ByteDance's TikTok and some other Chinese apps following an India-China border clash.
ShareChat - which has 180 million active users - allows users to post content in 15 Indian languages. After TikTok was banned, the Indian firm also launched a similar short-video sharing app named Moj which has 160 million users and counts Meta Platforms Inc's Instagram Reels as its key rival.
""Both our products have been leading the market ... This fresh funding will further strengthen our position and help us deliver immersive social experiences,"" Ankush Sachdeva, ShareChat's CEO, said in a statement.
The company will also use the funds to develop its apps' artificial-intelligence capabilities, it said.

Social media and video-sharing apps in India have been sought after by investors who want to cash in on India's radpily growing base of internet and smartphone users. Indian consumers - both in urban and rural areas - are increasingly consuming digital video content through apps or streaming platforms.
ShareChat said in its statement that users of its Moj app spent an average 34 minutes every day consuming video content.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -Intel Corp will invest more than $7 billion to build a new chip-packaging and testing factory in Malaysia, Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said on Thursday, expanding production in the country following a global shortage of semiconductors.
The new advanced packaging facility in Malaysia is expected to begin production in 2024, he said. 
The 30 billion ringgit ($7.10 billion) investment is expected to create over 4,000 Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) jobs and more than 5,000 construction jobs in the country, the Malaysian government said. 
""This undertaking is indeed timely given the bullish global demand driven by the chip shortages and the potential challenges arising from the recovery of the pandemic globally,"" Malaysian Minister of International Trade and Industry Mohamed Azmin Ali said in a statement.
A global shortage of semiconductor chips, caused partly by a pandemic-fuelled demand for electronics and disruptions in supply chains has seen car makers cut production and delays in smartphone deliveries at companies including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Malaysia's chip assembly industry, accounting for more than a tenth of a global trade worth over $20 billion, has warned that shortages will last at least two years.
Intel's Gelsinger said he expected the chip shortages to last into 2023.
""Overall the semiconductor industry this year will grow more than it has in the last two to three decades. But still the gaps are large ... and I predict that the limitations of the shortages will persist into 2023,"" he said. 
Intel hoped to announce the next locations in the United States and Europe early next year, he added.

Intel opened its first production facility outside the United States at a 5-acre assembly site in the Malaysian state of Penang in 1972. By 1975, it employed about 1,000 people and had become a crucial part of the company's manufacturing chain, its website said.
Last month, the United States and Malaysia said they plan to sign an agreement by early next year towards improving transparency, resilience and security in the semiconductor and manufacturing sector supply chains.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Thursday morning, with investors assured that the U.S. Federal Reserve’s monetary policy tightening will tackle inflation without derailing the economic recovery from COVID-19.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.53% by 9:17 PM ET (2:17 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.44%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.53%. Thursday’s employment data showed that the employment change was at 366,100 and the full employment change at 128,300, while the unemployment rate was 4.6%, in November.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.58%. Chinese companies listed in the U.S. saw their shares slide on Wednesday to their lowest levels since March 2020, with the U.S. likely to slap more companies with investment and export sanctions.
China’s Shanghai Composite gained 0.46% while the Shenzhen Component edged down 0.10%.
The Fed will double the pace of its asset tapering program to $30 billion a month, it said in its policy decision handed down on Wednesday. The central bank kept its interest rate steady but projected three quarter-point interest-rate increases in 2022, another three in 2023, and two more in 2024.
Although the policy decision lifted some uncertainty about the Fed’s response, some warned that it could take time for the full picture to emerge.
“The initial market reaction does not always stick, but we suspect that both the Fed and investors are satisfied that the Fed is aware of and responding to inflation risks, while taking a measured, data-dependent approach in responding,” Standard Chartered Bank head of global G10 FX research Steve Englander said in a note.
The Fed still faces challenges in bringing inflation down to its 2% target, with the five-year breakeven rate on U.S. Treasury inflation-protected securities approaching 2.8%. However, other investors remained optimistic.
“If there is a story here, it’s that the Fed is moving forward but they are not going to do anything rash to kill this market move forward that we’ve had over the last year. They are not looking to disrupt the kind of environment that we’ve had and that’s good news for markets,” Credit Suisse Group AG chief U.S. equity strategist Jonathan Golub told Bloomberg.
Investors now await policy decisions from the European Central Bank and Bank of England later in the day. The Bank of Japan will hand down its decision on Friday.
On the COVID-19 front, the omicron variant will likely be the dominant coronavirus variant in Europe by mid-January 2022, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen predicted."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Airlines Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) on Wednesday defended a decision to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for workers amid criticism from some Republican senators.
""We did this for safety. We believe it saved lives,"" Kirby said at a Senate Commerce hearing on aviation issues. ""We don't compromise on safety.""
Republican Senator Ted Cruz criticized United's vaccine mandate, calling it ""disturbing"" and was ""disregarding the rights of your employees.""
Cruz noted American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) both have said they do not plan to fire any employee over the vaccine requirements.
Kirby said about 200 employees did not comply with United's mandate and were fired of its 67,000 employees. He added about 6 pilots were fired and 80 on unpaid leave out of about 13,000.
On Monday, a panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected an emergency request for an injunction blocking the mandate while the employees appeal a November ruling by a federal judge in favor of United.
United Airlines was the first major air carrier to issue a vaccine requirement and others followed. United granted around 2,000 religious and medical exemptions to employees. Kirby said about 80% of those seeking religious exemptions were granted.
The wide ranging aviation hearing covered a number of issues.
Airlines said they were ramping up hiring and struggling to find enough pilots. Kirby said United effectively had nearly 100 regional airplanes grounded ""because there's not enough pilots to fly them.... The country is going to need thousands of pilots.""
Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly said at the hearing: ""I think the case is very strong that masks don't add much if anything in the air cabin environment -- it's very safe, very high quality compared to any other indoor setting.""

Republican Senator Roger Wicker asked when passengers will be able to stop wearing masks. This month, the Biden administration extended transportation mask requirements through March 18. 
Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, said lifting mask requirements was up to medical experts but added ""we absolutely look forward to the day that we no longer have the mask requirement.""

1046,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 09:01PM ET</span>",U.S. airlines warn 5G wireless could wreak havoc with flights,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Major U.S. air carriers warned on Wednesday that plans by wireless carriers to use spectrum for 5G wireless services starting Jan. 5 could disrupt thousands of daily flights and cost air passengers $1.6 billion annually in delays.
AT&T (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) must delay the plans to use C-Band spectrum for 5G wireless services, United Airlines Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said following a U.S. Senate Commerce Committee hearing, saying it could delay, divert or cancel about 4% of daily flights and impact hundreds of thousands of passengers.
""It would be a catastrophic failure of government,"" Kirby told reporters.
The aviation industry and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have raised concerns about potential interference of 5G with sensitive aircraft electronics like radio altimeters
Last week, the FAA issued new airworthiness directives warning that interference from 5G wireless spectrum could result in flight diversions, but did not quantify the impact. 
""Coming Jan. 5 -- unless something changes -- we will not be able to use radio altimeters at 40-something of the largest airports in the country,"" Kirby said. ""It is a certainty. This is not a debate.""
Kirby said it would mean that at major U.S. airports in the event of bad weather, cloud cover or even heavy smog ""you could only do visual approaches essentially.""
Trade group Airlines for America (A4A) said Wednesday that if the FAA 5G directive had been in effect in 2019, ""approximately 345,000 passenger flights, 32 million passengers, and 5,400 cargo flights would have been impacted in the form of delayed flights, diversions, or cancellations.""
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV)' chief executive, Gary Kelly, told the Senate hearing that if the FAA directive takes effect it ""would be a significant setback"" to its operations.
The wireless industry defended the technology.
""The aviation industry’s fearmongering relies on completely discredited information and deliberate distortions of fact,"" CTIA, a wireless trade group, said.
It said that 5G operates safely and without causing harmful interference to aviation operations in nearly 40 countries around the world.
The Biden administration is eager to see the issue resolved. White House National Economic Council director Brian Deese met with Federal Communications Commission Chair Jessica Rosenworcel and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on the issue Wednesday, sources told Reuters. The White House and the Transportation Department did not comment.
Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn at the hearing urged airlines to work with the wireless carriers to reach agreement.
Rosenworcel, who did not comment Wednesday, has said she believes the issues can be resolved and spectrum safely used.
In addition to agreeing to delay the commercial launch of C-band wireless service until Jan. 5, AT&T and Verizon in November adopted precautionary measures for six months to limit interference.
Aviation industry groups said they were insufficient to address air safety concerns and have made a counterproposal.
United's Kirby said the FCC and FAA ""need to get in a room and talk to each other and solve the problem,"" adding that the issue ""cannot be solved on the back of airlines.""
A4A said the FAA directive would ""materially disrupt airline operations"" and said cargo operators estimate it ""would have cost them $400 million annually.""
The group said ""the annual impact cost to passengers to be approximately $1.59 billion"" of travel delays.
Wireless carriers have shown no interest in further delays to using the spectrum, which the industry paid more than $80 billion to acquire.

The FAA directives order revising airplane and helicopter flight manuals to prohibit some operations requiring radio altimeter data when in the presence of 5G C-Band wireless broadband signals.
The FAA plans to issue further notices to airlines before Jan. 5 offering more detail on the potential interference and is in discussion about which altimeters could be used under the current mitigation plans.

1047,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 08:46PM ET</span>","Airlines place their bets, looking past pandemic to renew fleets","By Tim Hepher, Jamie Freed and Eric M. Johnson
PARIS/SINGAPORE/SEATTLE (Reuters) - As the world hunkers down for Omicron, some investors might expect the global jet market to be withering away. Far from it.
Business has begun humming again as airlines look to snap up the greener passenger and freight planes they believe will give them an edge in a post-pandemic recovery driven by predicted travel demand plus the relentless rise of online shopping.
From Arizona to Amsterdam, some of the industry's sharpest buyers are eyeing efficient jets for the second half of the decade, aiming to get ahead of the long waiting lists they fear could derail their growth and environmental targets.
On Wednesday, Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) kicked off a trio of major decisions, with a tentative order to replace its cargo fleet with a new A350 lightweight freighter offering from Airbus.
Australia's Qantas Airways on Thursday selected Airbus to replace its fleet of ageing narrowbodies in what Chief Executive Alan Joyce has described as a ""one-in-a-generation"" decision that involved a switch from Boeing (NYSE:BA).
The European planemaker also looks likely to seize a narrowbody order from Dutch airline KLM as early as Thursday. 
""People are thinking about long-term fleet plans and especially about ESG (environmental, social and governance),"" said Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at Ascend by Cirium.
""It's a case of: 'If I don't think about my replacement cycle now, am I going to get left behind',"" he added.
Airbus and Boeing are sold out on benchmark medium-haul models until mid-decade after a previous, much larger order boom that was losing momentum when the pandemic wreaked havoc.
But with such long lead times before jets can be delivered, the focus is now turning towards the second half of the decade and a move to get in the front of the queue for future capacity.
""It's a buyer's market and a great time to take advantage of that,"" said aviation consultant Brendan Sobie.
The starting pistol was fired last month when two industry heavyweights, Air Lease (NYSE:AL) Corp Executive Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy and a stable of airlines led by Indigo Partners founder Bill Franke, ordered over 300 jets at the Dubai Airshow. 
'FEEDING FRENZY'
Some were sceptical, noting the PR value of such events. But others said the delivery dates pointed to a preemptive strike.
""It is pretty obvious that ESG considerations are going to be critical through this cycle. There is a bit of a feeding frenzy again with people worried they will not be able to get enough slots,"" Morris said.
Not everyone is hungry for new capacity. Singapore Airlines cancelled some orders for passenger jets even as it ordered its new freighters. Asia is expected to be among the slowest regions to recover. 
Nonetheless, combined gross orders for Airbus and Boeing jets have trebled to 1,439 in the first 11 months of the year, compared to the pandemic-depressed levels of a year ago, lifted also by a surge in demand for the Boeing 737 MAX after it was cleared to fly following a safety ban. 
That figure is about 200 higher than at the same point of 2018, the last year of data undisturbed by the MAX crisis.
Whether investors who are gambling on buying new jets are proved right depends on factors that remain difficult to gauge, though. They include global travel demand, China's tight border controls and the impact of the Omicron variant, analysts warn.
Eamonn Brennan, director general of air traffic control agency Eurocontrol, cautioned that any delay in reopening China's massive market beyond the fourth quarter of next year could delay the whole aviation recovery by a year.
GREEN WAVE RISKS
Planemakers are playing up emissions savings of 15% compared to most earlier models as the industry strives to reach a target of net zero emissions by 2050. In the near term, the industry is otherwise reliant on energy firms to make more sustainable fuel.
Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle stressed the benefits of locking in those savings soon, rather than waiting for 2050, as he took part in the Indigo Partners order in Dubai.
A possible green order wave comes with new risks for some companies in the aviation industry, however.
The combination of pent-up demand from the pandemic and pressure from investors and customers - especially in Europe - to curb emissions could drive the previous generation out of service sooner than expected and upset industry economics.

That would be a pay-day for manufacturers who rely mainly on selling new product, but a blow for leasing and engine firms whose profits are spread over the whole life of a jet.
Olivier Andries, head of French engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF), told reporters earlier this month that the average retirement age of single-aisle jets could fall to 20 or more years from 23 years once the dust settles from the pandemic.

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 08:25PM ET</span>","U.S. SEC to tighten insider trading rules, boost money market fund resilience","By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday proposed tightening a legal safe-harbor that allows corporate insiders to trade in a company's shares, and other rules to improve the resilience of money market funds.
The agency also unveiled measures to increase transparency around share buybacks and the complex derivatives at the center of New York-based Archegos Capital Management's meltdown earlier this year. 
The slew of long-awaited changes mark a milestone for SEC Chair Gary Gensler who has outlined an ambitious agenda to crack down on corporate wrongdoing, improve corporate governance and address inequities in the markets. 
The changes, which are subject to public consultation, will affect a swathe of corporate America, from publicly traded companies and their top executives, to banking groups and asset managers including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Vanguard, Fidelity and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). 
The proposed tightening of ""10b5-1"" corporate trading plans in particular was pushed by progressives who have long criticized the rules, saying they allow insiders to game the system and reap windfalls at the expense of ordinary investors.
The plans allow insiders to trade in a company's stock on a pre-determined date, providing legal protection against potential allegations of insider trading. Critics say it is far too easy to adopt, amend or cancel trades with little scrutiny.
Wednesday's proposal requires executives to disclose those plans and any modifications. For executives, the SEC also wants a ""cooling-off"" period of 120 days between the adoption of a plan and the first trade. For companies trading in their own securities, the cooling-off period would be 30 days.
The proposal would also bar insiders from having several overlapping plans, which Gensler said could allow them to cherry-pick favorable plans as they please. 
While critics have long said the plans are flawed, trades by executives at  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) during the COVID-19 vaccine development process renewed scrutiny of such plans and highlighted transparency issues, said Daniel Taylor a professor with expertise on issues related to financial disclosures at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. 
""There is mounting evidence that these plans are, at best, being used in a manner in which they were not intended, and at worst, being abused to enrich corporate insiders,"" Taylor said.
The SEC also said it wants companies to disclose share buybacks one business day after execution, in contrast to the current quarterly disclosure rule.
Investor groups welcomed the changes. 
""Cleaning up practices that can be a pathway for abusive trades will help restore trust in our markets,” said Amy Borrus, head of the Council for Institutional Investors.
The SEC also detailed changes to address systemic risks in the $5 trillion U.S. money market fund sector, which was bailed out for a second time during the 2020 pandemic-induced turmoil. 
Critics say the sector enjoys an implicit government guarantee.
SEC proposed new liquidity requirements, scrapping redemption fees and restrictions, and adjusting funds' value in line with dealing activity, a process known as ""swing pricing.""
While the funds industry has conceded changes are necessary, corporate groups may oppose some of the trading disclosures.
""Some of this appears to be overkill,"" said Howard Berkenblit, partner at law firm Sullivan and Worcester. ""A long cooling-off period and limits on the number of plans will be less popular and could cause a decrease in use of these plans.""
The SEC also outlined a plan to stamp out misconduct via security-based swaps. 

Such derivatives were at the center of the Archegos meltdown, which left Wall Street banks on the other side of the family office's trades with $10 billion in losses. 
Under the new rule, investors will have to publicly disclose such trades.

1049,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 08:11PM ET</span>",Tesco express - British supermarket turns to rail to deliver Christmas,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) said on Thursday it has introduced a refrigerated rail freight service to help Britain's biggest supermarket group deliver for Christmas and cut its carbon emissions.
The new service from Tesco, which has a near 28% share of the country's grocery market, removes road transport from the British leg of the journey for fresh produce from Europe.
With Christmas approaching, the new service will transport hundreds of different products, including sprouts, parsnips, carrots, onions, oranges and lemons to customers shopping over the festive season. 
In the first domestic refrigerated rail service it has committed to, Tesco said it had partnered with Direct Rail Services (DRS) to distribute chilled goods from the Port of Tilbury, east of London, to Coatbridge in Scotland by low CO2 rail twice a day, seven days a week.
Tesco said the 415-mile service will take at least 17,000 containers off the road each year, saving 7.3 million road miles and nearly 9,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions.
From 65,000 containers a year on rail, Tesco has an ambition to increase that to 90,000 containers by the end of the year.
""We’ve been using rail to transport our goods since 2008 and this new service reflects our continuing commitment to rail which has clear advantages for our business, our customers and the planet,"" Jason Tarry, Tesco UK and Ireland CEO, said.
In September, Tesco extended its green targets by promising net zero carbon emissions by 2050 across its operations together with those generated by the products it sells and its supply chains.
It also pledged a new group-wide net zero target of 2035 for all its own operations, bringing it into line with the ambition set last year for its UK business alone.

British retailers are grappling with international supply chain delays that are being compounded by labour shortages in domestic transport and warehousing networks.
Tesco, however, has said it is coping well.

1050,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 07:46PM ET</span>",Tesla told France there was no sign of technical fault in Paris crash,"By Mathieu Rosemain and Elizabeth Pineau
PARIS (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has told the French government there is no indication that a fatal accident in Paris involving a Tesla Model 3 taxi was caused by a technical fault, a government spokesman said on Wednesday. 
Paris taxi company G7 has suspended the use of the 37 Model 3 cars in its fleet after the accident on Saturday evening, which involved one of its drivers.
BFM TV reported that the driver had been placed under formal investigation for suspected manslaughter. Under French law, a formal investigation means there is “serious or consistent evidence” implicating a suspect in a crime. It is one step closer to a trial, but such investigations can be dropped. 
One person was killed in the crash and 20 injured, three of them seriously. 
""We have been in contact, of course, with Tesla's management and they tell us that there is no technical problem to flag on their vehicles,"" government spokesman Gabriel Attal told reporters. 
He added that the government was waiting for the outcome of the ongoing judicial investigation. 
Still in shock four days after the accident, witnesses told Reuters the car ploughed through metal posts, a row of pay-to-ride bicycles, a recycling bin full of glass and hit pedestrians and a van before finally coming to a halt. 
""I thought it was an attack. There was glass, dust ... it was as if there had been a blast,"" Tillard Diomande, who was serving clients from behind his bar in a nearby restaurant, said.
The vehicle, which had stopped at a red traffic light, suddenly sped forward, hitting and dragging with it a cyclist who later died, a police source said, citing the driver's own version of events, witnesses and video surveillance.
The driver tested negative in an alcohol test, the police source said.
It was not clear whether the car was operating in Tesla's Autopilot mode, which handles some driving tasks.
NO SAFETY ALERTS
Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari told RMC radio that he had spoken with the chief executive of Tesla Europe, who told him there had been no safety alerts about the Model 3.
He added that the automaker, which collects detailed data from the sensors and cameras on its vehicles, notified him that it had provided the relevant technical data to investigators.
Tesla, which is at the forefront of the electrical and self-driving vehicle revolution and has a market value of nearly $1 trillion, has not responded to requests for comment. 
G7 Deputy Chief Executive Yann Ricordel told Reuters the accident occurred while an off-duty taxi driver was taking his family to a restaurant. The driver tried to brake but the car accelerated instead, Ricordel said. 
Last year, the U.S. auto safety regulator opened a formal review into over 200 complaints about sudden acceleration of Tesla cars, but the regulator later said it found no defects in Tesla's systems, saying the accidents were caused by ""pedal misapplication"".
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) did not consider software defects in its investigation, and French investigators need to look at software as a potential cause, Philip Koopman, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said on his blog posting. 
Video of the scene obtained by Reuters showed the wreckage of a black Tesla and debris strewn across the street. The vehicle's left-hand side was crumpled, the front left wheel collapsed and the windscreen shattered.
The car appeared to have collided with a white van, which suffered front-end damage. Other footage circulating on social media showed members of the public tending to the wounded and shocked bystanders in the aftermath of the accident.
Tesla boss Elon Musk was named 2021 ""person of the year"" by both Time magazine and the Financial Times for triggering a historic shift in the auto industry towards electric vehicles, and also sending rockets into orbit with his space company.
Tesla's Model 3 topped European car sales in September, marking the first time an electric vehicle has done so in monthly charts.
The NHTSA said in August it had sent teams to review 31 Tesla crashes involving 10 deaths since 2016 where it suspected advanced driver assistance systems use. 

It ruled out Autopilot in three of the crashes.
Musk has repeatedly defended Autopilot and in April tweeted that ""Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle.""

1051,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 07:35PM ET</span>","Qantas says competition to intensify, will report large H1 loss","By Jamie Freed
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Qantas Airways Ltd said on Thursday it expects domestic competition to intensify in the second half of the financial year as state borders open, after forecasting a first-half loss due to months of lockdowns.
The airline, which separately said it would switch its narrowbody fleet to Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) jets from Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, forecast a first-half underlying loss before interest and tax of more than A$1.1 billion ($788 million).
Qantas will focus next year on generating cash rather than posting a bottom-line profit as it begins to recover from pandemic-related border closures, Chief Executive Alan Joyce said.
""For us 2022 is not about making money,"" he said. ""It is about getting people back to work, generating positive cashflow and repairing the balance sheet.""
Qantas said it boosted its liquidity position during the half through the A$802 million sale of land near Sydney Airport. It expected to have A$5.6 billion of net debt as of Dec. 31, the end of the first half of its financial year, lower than its June 30 debt position of A$5.9 billion.
Joyce said the emergence of the Omicron variant in late November led to an initial pause in international bookings and a slowdown in domestic bookings but that had started to recover.
""We have confidence the market recovery is fundamentally on track,"" he said.
Australia's domestic airline industry, held back during the pandemic by state border closings, is gearing up for a price war as new entrants in the jet market challenge Qantas and its biggest rival, Virgin Australia.
In the international market, Qantas has slowed the ramp up of capacity by around 10 percentage points for the second half and now expects it to reach around 40% of pre-pandemic levels.
Chief Financial Officer Vanessa Hudson (NYSE:HUD) said the supply of international capacity in the market, including from competitors, remained ""very rational"" at a time when Australia's border is only partly open.

""We are not seeing an oversupply of capacity,"" she said.

(Reuters) -Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) said Wednesday they have asked staff in Canada to work remotely, joining Bank of Nova Scotia in halting plans for a return to offices amid growing concerns over the Omicron variant. 
Canada's top health official Theresa Tam warned on Monday that COVID-19 cases in the country could rise rapidly in the coming days, leading banks and financial firms to rethink return-to-office plans.
""We've made the decision to pause our plans"" for a return to work locations in January, Sandy Sharman, group head for people, culture and brand at CIBC, the country's fifth largest lender, said in an internal memo. 
Sharman cited increases in COVID-19 cases and uncertainties due to the new variant. Staff who had recently returned to on-site work were also being asked to work remotely. ""It's our intent to return as soon as it's safe to do so.""
Earlier on Wednesday, National Bank, the country's sixth-biggest lender, confirmed a similar message to employees.
""A message was just sent to our employees asking them to work remotely if they can,"" a spokesperson told Reuters in an email. ""In the longer term, we are staying the course with our plan of reopening gradually, on a voluntary basis, with no set date.""
The rapid spread of the Omicron strain has wreaked havoc on companies' efforts to return to normalcy.
Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's third largest lender, said Monday it would pause its plan for employees working remotely to return to its Toronto head office starting on Jan. 17.
In the United States, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said Wednesday it was making its annual healthcare conference in San Francisco a ""virtual"" event. The decision came after major biotech firms like  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) said they would not attend in person.
New York and New Jersey are experiencing the fastest spread of Omicron in the United States, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
A source at one major U.S. bank headquartered in Manhattan said there was ""heightened diligence"" as a result of the Omicron variant. A number of staff were choosing to work from home out of caution ahead of the holidays, the source said.
Insurer Prudential (NYSE:PUK) has pushed back its return to office plan in the United States to January on a voluntary basis, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. However, that decision was made prior to Thanksgiving, the source said.
Canadian insurer Sun Life Financial (NYSE:SLF) said on Tuesday it had paused its office re-opening pilot for more employees until the end of January. 

Last week, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) asked staff to work from home for the remainder of the year, due to a spate of COVID-19 cases. On Tuesday, JPMorgan told unvaccinated Manhattan staff to work from home.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Chief Executive James Gorman said Monday he expects COVID-19 to be an issue through the next year.

Shortages of raw materials and labor have weighed on operations for U.S. homebuilders, forcing several of them to limit orders even as demand for new homes stays strong in a tight market. 
Lennar's backlogs at the end of the fourth quarter rose to 23,771 from 18,821 a year ago.
""Our cycle time expanded about two weeks from the third quarter, driven by rapidly changing supply chain issues,"" Co-Chief Executive Officer Jon Jaffe said in a statement. 
Lennar's orders, an indicator of future revenue, rose 2.1% to 15,539 homes in the fourth quarter, while deliveries increased to 17,819 units from 16,090 units. 
The company expects to deliver about 67,000 homes in fiscal 2022, higher than 59,825 delivered a year earlier. Its gross margin forecast of 27.0% to 27.5% on home sales for this period, however, is lower than 28.0% in the reported quarter. 

Net earnings attributable to Lennar rose about 35% to $1.19 billion, or $3.91 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30. Analysts on average expected $4.15 per share, according to Refinitiv data. 
Total revenue rose to $8.43 billion, above Wall Street expectations.

1054,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 06:31PM ET</span>",European supermarkets stop selling Brazil beef over deforestation links,"By Jake Spring and Anthony Deutsch
SAO PAULO/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Six European supermarket chains, including two owned by Dutch firm Ahold Delhaize and a  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) subsidiary, said on Wednesday they would stop selling some or all beef products from Brazil due to links with destruction of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest.
The pledges ranged from supermarket chain Lidl Netherlands, which committed to stop selling all beef originating in South America starting in 2022, to more focused decisions to halt sales of certain corned beef or beef jerky products.
Many of the products affected are linked to the world's largest meatpacker,  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY).
The boycotts are in response to an investigation by Brazilian publication Reporter Brasil that alleged JBS indirectly sourced cows from illegally deforested areas, in a scheme known as ""cattle laundering."" 
This occurs when cattle raised on an illegally deforested plot of land are sold to a legitimate farm before sale to a slaughterhouse, to hide its origin.
JBS told Reuters it has zero tolerance for illegal deforestation and has blocked more than 14,000 suppliers for failing to comply with its policies. The company said monitoring indirect suppliers - the ones before the final seller to the slaughterhouse - is a challenge for the entire sector, but that JBS will institute a system capable of doing so by 2025.
The Brazilian meatpacker said that Reporter Brasil's research mentioned only five out of 77,000 direct JBS suppliers and that those suppliers met the company's policies at the time of purchase.
Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon, the world's largest tropical rainforest, has soared since right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro took office in 2019 and rolled back environmental protections. He has said he aims for more farming and mining to lift the region out of poverty. 
Deforestation hit a 15-year high in 2021 with an area larger than the U.S. state of Connecticut being cleared.
Most of the denuded land is used for cattle ranching.
Among other commitments, Ahold Delhaize's subsidiary Albert Heijn, the largest supermarket chain in the Netherlands, will stop sourcing beef from Brazil entirely.
An Albert Heijn spokesperson told Reuters that the company currently sells only a handful of corned beef and beef jerky with Brazilian origins each week.
Auchan France will also remove beef jerky products linked to JBS from its shelves. Carrefour Belgium and Delhaize supermarkets will stop selling Jack Link's brand beef jerky. 

JBS and Jack Link's have a joint venture that produces jerky. Jack Link's did not respond to a request for comment.
J Sainsbury (OTC:JSAIY) Plc's Sainsbury's UK will stop sourcing its store brand corned beef from Brazil, but said that 90% of its beef is already sourced from the Britain and Ireland.

(Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply higher on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said it would end its pandemic-era bond purchases in March as it exits from policies enacted at the start of the health crisis.
Following its two-day policy meeting, the Fed signaled its inflation target has been met, and its announcement on ending the bond purchases paved the way for three quarter-percentage-point interest rate increases by the end of 2022.
All three main U.S. stock indexes reversed earlier losses and climbed into positive territory. Wall Street extended those gains as Fed Chair Jerome Powell during his news conference struck an upbeat tone about the U.S. economic recovery and expressed willingness to raise interest rates as necessary to control inflation.
""What the markets are saying is, because the Fed is increasing their taper, maybe they feel inflation is under control,"" said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta. ""They did what was expected. It’s going to add to the credibility for the Fed and that will be - on balance - neutral to positive for the markets."" 
The S&P 500's sharp rise on Wednesday erased almost all of its losses from earlier this week and left it just short of its record-high close on Friday. 
For the session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.08% to end at 35,927.43 points, while the S&P 500 gained 1.63% to 4,709.85. 
The Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.15% to 15,565.58.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.2 billion shares, strong compared with the 11.6 billion average over the last 20 trading days.
Inflation and higher interest rates have become a major concern on Wall Street in recent months. Data on Tuesday showed producer prices increased more than expected in the 12 months through November, clocking their largest gain since 2010. Last week's consumer prices data showed the biggest gain in almost four decades.
""You had hedge funds positioned for the worst, in the terms of the worst for equities, coming in to the Fed statement,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. ""Today, I think, is a function of sell the expectation and buy the news."" 
Among the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes, technology jumped 2.7% and healthcare rallied 2.1%.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) climbed 2.85% and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp rallied 7.49%, with both lifting the S&P 500 more than any other stocks.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor index jumped 3.7%.
 Albemarle  (NYSE:ALB) Corp ended 1.67% lower after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) downgraded the lithium producer to ""sell"" from ""neutral.""
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.85-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.70-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 40 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 38 new highs and 545 new lows.

The company's employees were previously set to return to offices on February 1, according to the report, citing a memo sent by Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook.
Growing worries over the rapidly spreading Omicron coronavirus variant have derailed several companies' plans for a return to normalcy.
Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) told its employees they would lose pay and eventually be fired if they did not follow the company's vaccination rules, according to a report, while  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) & Co has asked its unvaccinated staff in Manhattan to work from home.
Apple's store closures in Miami, Annapolis and Ottawa come a day after the company reinstated its policy requiring all customers at its stores in the U.S. to wear masks.
All the employees at the three stores will be tested before the stores are reopened, the company said.

Through the pandemic, Apple has closed some stores for short periods of time around the world as coronavirus-related lockdowns were brought in and lifted.

Sergei Polevikov, who worked for OppenheimerFunds at the time, pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud. He now faces sentencing in April, and could face a prison term of between 57 and 71 months, according to his plea agreement. 
The U.S. Department of Justice said Polevikov generated more than $8.5 million of illegal profit from trades he conducted from January 2014 to October 2019 through his wife's brokerage account. 

The trades were intended to take advantage of small price movements he expected to take place when his employer filled large client orders. 
As part of the plea agreement, Polevikov agreed to forfeit around $8.5 million, prosecutors said.

(Reuters) - Private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners LLC has approached MoneyGram International Inc, one of the world's largest money transfer companies, with an acquisition offer, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The Dallas-based company has become an acquisition target as intense competition in the sector from digital rivals such as Remitly Global Inc and Revolut has weighed on its ability to capitalize on the growing market for payments and remittances.
There is no certainty that MoneyGram, which has a market value of about $700 million and carries $800 million in debt net of cash, will agree to any deal, the sources said. The company has engaged with potential buyers several times in the last few years, including in 2019, Reuters has reported.
Madison Dearborn and MoneyGram declined to comment. MoneyGram shares ended trading on Wednesday up 8.2% at $7.94.
MoneyGram, which according to its website has served 150 million people in the last five years, has been focusing on digital payments as an area of growth. In October, it announced a blockchain partnership that relies on financial technology firm Circle's USD Coin, one of the world's fastest-growing dollar digital currencies. 

A $1.2 billion deal for China's Ant Financial to acquire MoneyGram was blocked by the United States in January 2018 on national security concerns. MoneyGram shares took a hit as a result, but have since recovered. They are up 28% year-to-date versus an 18% rise in the Nasdaq Composite index.
The company reported third-quarter operating income of $26.8 million, down from $36.6 million a year ago, amid a rise in transactional expenses.

1060,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 05:28PM ET</span>",From China to Best Buy: Gaming controllers hit bumps on way to U.S. consumers,"By Timothy Aeppel and Xiaoyu Yin
PEMBROKE, Mass./DONGGUAN, China (Reuters) -Fraser Townley eyes two gaping holes in one side of a pallet one of his workers just pulled out of the orange Hapag-Lloyd shipping container that arrived here at his warehouse from China one recent chilly morning.
“Clearly a forklift,” he mutters.
The damage could have happened anywhere along the 10,710-mile odyssey his company's gaming controllers make from China's Guangdong province where they are manufactured to his warehouse 30 miles south of Boston, just one stop on their way to big-name retailers like Best Buy. Yet Townley, CEO of T2M, is grateful to have his products arrive at all. 
A global breakdown of supply chains in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a sharp contraction, then a snap back in demand that caught most businesses wrong-footed, has overwhelmed ports and left manufacturers, retailers, railroads, and truckers scrambling to get goods to shelves, especially in the crucial runup to the year-end holidays.
The number of container ships idling off Los Angeles - the nation’s busiest port complex - has hit record highs, while growing piles of empty containers crowd the docks.
The situation is so dire that a White House task force is working to ease the backlog, while shortages of imported goods are blamed with helping fuel an inflationary surge that has the Federal Reserve as well as many consumers on edge.
The pileup casts a shadow over a globalized system that T2M and many other producers have relied on to get products made cheaply in distant factories. As companies developed these supply chains, they whittled down to the bare minimum the stocks they kept on hand. That is great for the bottom line, but a disaster when supply lines clog as they have now.
T2M's mobile gaming controllers, including the only full-size device designed to work with a hard wire on an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone, are sold by Best Buy and other big chains such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT), and on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Townley doesn’t own a factory. Instead, like countless other consumer products companies, he designs the devices and has them made by a Chinese plant. He has a China-based employee, Breeze Feng, the company's senior structural engineer, keeping an eye on production at the Dongguan factory until the goods are packed into containers to be trucked to Hong Kong for shipping to the U.S. West Coast.
Feng said the crisis hit a boiling point in June, just as they were doing a push to get goods to the United States in time for the year-end holidays. ""We went to pick up containers three times but failed,"" she said, explaining that they had booked slots on ships. ""They didn't have a container to load our goods, so there is no way"" they could ship.
Speaking at the Chinese plant - where rows of workers in blue smocks and white caps hunched over workbenches assembling and testing controllers for T2M - Feng said it felt as though conditions were easing a bit by October.
""But now, after the new strain (Omicron) has appeared, we are actually still worried about whether it will go back to the situation as before,"" she said.
NOTHING IS NORMAL
T2M has limited ability to jump to other Chinese factories in this crisis. Feng noted that only a handful of factories are able to produce controllers that meet the Apple certification required by customers. ""If we were going to replace our factory, it would not have been fast,"" she said, so they didn't even try to find alternatives.
They did, however, have to find new routes to get containers to their Boston warehouse. T2M receives one or two containers a month, each able to hold up to 40,000 controllers, and Townley closely tracks their progress.
In the past, he would ship them to Boston via the Panama Canal, a more direct and less expensive route that had become harder to access as port traffic snarled.
Now his normal procedure is to ship goods to Los Angeles, where his containers are put on a train to Newark, New Jersey, which is their official port of entry for U.S. Customs. From there, a truck brings his boxes to his warehouse outside Boston. Workers at the warehouse then separate out the items and ship them on to distribution centers for the big retailers on trucks.
But nothing has been normal in recent months. 
In September, he had a shipment of controllers he was trying to get to a distribution center in Kentucky for a large retailer who had ordered a specific design and set a launch date for a promotion.
The controllers were on their way to Los Angeles when they got stuck waiting to be unloaded from a ship for what turned out to be an extra three weeks. Once the container came off, he tried to ship it directly to Kentucky in order to hit the deadline rather than first sending it cross-country to Newark and then on to his warehouse, as originally planned.
“Unfortunately, everyone but the Customs people could be flexible,” said Townley. His solution was to air freight more controllers straight from China to Tennessee, via Chicago. 
Costs have exploded accordingly. Townley now pays about $18,000 to ship one container from China to his warehouse compared to $3,500 at this time last year. “And last year I was complaining, because we’d been buying them for $2,800.”
Problems don't end once the controllers get to his warehouse. Finding truckers to haul goods to end customers has become such a challenge that Townley explored buying his own truck. He decided not to do it.
As a small company, he has no clout with his customers to pass along those expenses. Instead, he’s rushed to cut costs. He picks up one of his controllers and points to the brightly colored buttons. By skipping the color - the buttons are now just black - he shaved 50 cents of this piece, he notes. He also slightly reduced the size of each box and eliminated a plastic cradle that held the controller inside.
Townley is well positioned to play these games. He came to the United States from Britain decades ago to help Circuit City set up sourcing in China, so he’s spent most of his working life thinking about how goods make it from one place to another.
While no one anticipated the current crisis, there are some techniques that help keep products and profits flowing. Take the punctured pallet. One task assigned to T2M’s factory monitor Feng is to photograph every pallet before it’s loaded into a container in China. That allowed them to quickly determine that the pallet wasn’t damaged before it was loaded.

In this case, the container was pulled for a spot Customs inspection in New Jersey, so Townley is convinced the damage occurred there. 
“On this occasion, the damage was limited to two cases. So we’re in the $1,000’s, but not tens of thousands” range for the loss, he noted.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global shares and bond yields rose on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would end its pandemic-era bond purchases in March and begin raising interest rates as much as three times next year. 
The new economic projections forecast inflation will run at 2.6% next year, compared to the 2.2% projected in September, and the unemployment rate will fall to 3.5%.
""The economy no longer needs increasing amounts of policy support,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a news conference after the meeting.

Inflation is also an issue elsewhere, with British consumer price inflation surging in November to its highest in more than 10 years to 5.1%, exceeding all forecasts from economists ahead of a Bank of England rate-setting meeting on Thursday.
Investors sharply increased their bets that the BoE is about to raise rates.
The European Central Bank meets on Thursday and is expected to dial back stimulus one more notch, but will pledge copious support for the next year, sticking to its long-held view that alarmingly high inflation will abate on its own.

DETROIT (Reuters) -Electric vehicle startup Canoo Inc on Wednesday said it was accelerating its production plans in the United States while ending its deal for VDL Nedcar in Netherlands to serve as its contract manufacturer in Europe.
Canoo shares were up 3% in after hours trading.
The Arkansas-based company said the shift from using VDL Nedcar overseas to relying on the plants it is building in northwest Arkansas and Pryor, Oklahoma, was made to reduce supply-chain vulnerabilities and overseas shipping costs, and increase speed to market for its vehicles.
""The initiatives announced today are another step in executing our strategy of reducing risk and increasing certainty,"" Chief Executive Tony Aquila said in a statement. ""We have concluded that building in America is better aligned with our mission."" 
Canoo said starting production in Oklahoma remains on track for late 2023, but it also now expects to begin building electric vehicles in Arkansas next year, instead of using the VDL Nedcar plant.
It added that while the deal with VDL Nedcar was dead, it was still exploring partnership opportunities in Europe with the Dutch company's parent, VDL Groep BV. 
Canoo said VDL Nedcar will return Canoo's prepayment of $30.4 million, but VDL Groep will buy $8.4 million worth of Canoo stock. 
Canoo said it now expects to build 3,000 to 6,000 EVs next year in Arkansas, up from its previous target of up to 1,000 units overseas. It also plans to produce 14,000 to 17,000 EVs in 2023, compared with its prior target of 15,000.
The company also provided production targets of 40,000 to 50,000 vehicles for 2024, and 70,000 to 80,000 units for 2025. Canoo has previously said the Oklahoma plant will build more than 150,000 a year at full capacity.
Canoo said in November it would add a plant in Arkansas to build small package delivery vehicles, but a spokesman said the facility will be able to flex between that vehicle and the company's seven-seat, pod-shaped vans it calls ""lifestyle vehicles."" 

In December 2020, Canoo went public through a reverse merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). In April, it changed CEOs, with Aquila, a former software executive and one of Canoo's largest shareholders, taking over.
Canoo developed a ""skateboard,"" or a low-rise platform that bundles batteries and electric motors with such chassis components as steering, brakes and wheels, on which a variety of vehicle body types can be built. The company also plans to build a pickup truck.

(Reuters) - Aurora Innovation Inc on Wednesday said it had launched a pilot program with the freight unit of Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc to transport goods in Texas and to integrate autonomous trucking into Uber Freight's shipping platform.
Aurora said it began autonomously transporting loads for Uber Freight customers between Dallas and Houston last week. The company plans to launch its commercial autonomous trucking business by the end of 2023, starting in Texas.
Uber is an investor in Aurora after the self-driving company bought Uber's autonomous vehicle unit ATG last year https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-atg-idUKKBN28H2RX and Uber acquired a 26% ownership interest in Aurora. 
Uber Freight is a platform that acts as a middleman in connecting shippers who need goods hauled with available truck drivers, oftentimes independent contractors in a highly fragmented market. 
An Aurora spokesperson said prior to last week's launch, the company began collaborating with Uber Freight a year ago, hauling goods over thousands of miles in Texas to gain insight.
Aurora said carriers who subscribe to its self-driving product will be able to book autonomous trucks through the Uber Freight platform once commercial self-driving trucks launch in 2023.
Using autonomous trucks, carriers will be able to increase utilization of the truck and haul more goods more often between terminals, Aurora said. Human truck drivers are not allowed to drive more than 11 hours per day - restrictions that do not apply to self-driving trucks.

The pilot program deploys so-called drop-and-hook loads, an industry term that describes a driver dropping off a full container at a terminal and then immediately grabbing a new one, without waiting for it to be unloaded.
Human-operated trucks booked through the Uber Freight network then handle the last mile to the actual destination, where the goods are being unloaded, the companies said.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 cut losses to close sharply higher Wednesday, underpinned by a rebound in tech stocks after the Federal Reserve said it would accelerate its taper and projected the first liftoff in rates next year.  
The S&P 500 was up 1.63% to 4,709.85, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1%, or 383 points, and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.1%.
The committee said it would increase the taper of its bond purchases by $30 billion a month in January, double the $15 billion monthly pace announced in November. 
The timeline on rate hikes was brought forward, with up to three rate hikes projected next year, followed by another three in 2023, taking the Fed's benchmark rate to 1.6%. 
""We see our forecast of three interest rate hikes [in 2022], the first probably in the spring (second quarter), confirmed,"" Commerzbank said in a note. 
Risk sentiment improved following the announcement as a faster taper and earlier path to monetary policy tightening was largely priced in ahead of the Fed meeting. 
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which combined make up more than fifth of the broader S&P 500, cut their losses and sparked a broader market rebound.
Consumer discretionary also played a big role in the rebound as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) pared losses as investors appeared to renew their appetite on growth stocks.   
Health stocks were pushed higher by an 8% jump in Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) after the pharmaceutical giant upgraded its earnings outlook for 2021, and guided further strength for 2022.
Energy remained under pressure even as oil prices cut their losses as fears persisted about supply outpacing demand in the wake of growing concerns about the Omicron threat on travel, and ultimately energy demand.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU lawmakers voted on Wednesday to beef up draft rules to rein in U.S. tech giants, including extending the scope to their retailing activities and to their business users outside Europe, as part of their common position in forthcoming talks with EU countries.
The Digital Markets Act (DMA), unveiled by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager last December, sets out a list of dos and don'ts for U.S. tech giants designated as online gatekeepers with fines up to 10% of global turnover for violations, a global first.
Vestager's proposal targets Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) but the European Parliament wants to extend it to travel website booking.com, China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and online retailer Zalando.
EU lawmakers also want the rules to apply to web browsers, virtual assistants and connected TV, adding to Vestager's list of online intermediation services, social networks, search engines, operating systems, online advertising services, cloud computing and video-sharing services.
The lawmakers' proposal would also make it easier for users to switch default settings on their services and products to rivals.
They want the Commission to do an annual report on gatekeepers, with the possibility for lawmakers to propose investigations into new services and new products.
Vestager cheered the vote.

""It sends a clear message that in our EU democracy it is not for BigTech to set the rules of the game, it is for legislators,"" she said in a tweet.
Lawmakers will now have to reconcile their proposal with that of EU countries and the Commission next year before the draft rules can become law.

1070,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 03:57PM ET</span>",U.S. railroad Amtrak CEO to step down next month,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. passenger railroad Amtrak said on Wednesday that Chief Executive Bill Flynn will retire next month and be replaced by its president as it begins a big expansion of operations funded by Congress.
Flynn, 68, has overseen the railroad since April 2020 and steered it through the COVID-19 crisis and a massive falloff in demand. Amtrak President Stephen Gardner will succeed him effective Jan. 17, becoming the company's fifth CEO since 2016.
Congress has approved $66 billion for rail as part of a massive infrastructure bill, with Amtrak receiving $22 billion and setting aside $36 billion for competitive grants.
Amtrak is adding service, upgrading key stations and has a contract with Siemens Mobility Inc to manufacture a new fleet of up to 83 multi-powered trains and options for up to 130 additional trains. 
Flynn will continue as a senior adviser to Gardner and the company through Sept. 30, 2022.
Amtrak said on Tuesday it would suspend a vaccine mandate for employees and no longer expects to be forced to cut some service in January. It said 95.7% of its 17,000 employees were either fully vaccinated or had an accommodation, and cited a U.S. District Court decision halting enforcement of President Joe Biden's executive order mandating vaccines for federal contractors by January.
Amtrak wants to expand dramatically across the United States and add up to 39 corridor routes and up to 166 cities by 2035. It hopes to serve 20 million additional people annually and has a plan to remake much of its major infrastructure, like tunnels and bridges in the New York City area.
The railroad, which received about $2 billion from Congress in the year before the pandemic, has been awarded $3.7 billion in emergency funding since March 2020 to address the COVID-19 demand collapse.
It is working to add 2,500 to 3,500 employees by late 2022. 
Amtrak saw demand fall off substantially during COVID-19 and is now seeing about 70% of pre-pandemic volumes, Gardner said last week.

It had 12.2 million customer trips in the year ended Sept. 30, down from 16.8 million passengers in the prior budget year and 32.5 million in 2019, the last full year before the pandemic.
Gardner, 45, is a former senior staff member to the U.S Senate Commerce Committee.

Puneet Dikshit, 40, pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud. He was charged last month for allegedly generating about $450,000 said of profit from 2,500 GreenSky call options that he bought in the two days before the merger was announced on Sept. 15. 
Dikshit now awaits sentencing, Damian Williams, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement.
Authorities said Dikshit led McKinsey's unsecured lending practice in North America and had been a lead partner advising Goldman. GreenSky is a specialty lender that arranges consumer loans for large one-time purchases. Its share price rose 53% on the day the merger was announced. 
Prosecutors said Dikshit bought his call options, a bet the stock price would rise, without receiving pre-clearance from McKinsey. The firm said last month it had fired Dikshit for ""a gross violation of our policies."" 
The charges were announced nine years after former McKinsey chief and Goldman director Rajat Gupta was convicted of insider trading. Prosecutors said Dikshit ran Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) searches related to Gupta's conviction about three weeks after Goldman agreed to buy GreenSky.

Dikshit also faces civil charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

1072,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 03:39PM ET</span>","Fed Accelerates Bond Tapering, Sees Earlier Rate Hikes to Curb Inflation","By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com - The Federal Reserve kept interest rates near zero Wednesday, but said it would step up the tapering of bond purchases and signaled up to three rate hikes next year to curb elevated inflation.
The committee said it would increase the taper of its bond purchases by $30 billion a month in January, double the $15 billion monthly pace announced in November.
The Fed flagged ""inflation developments and the further improvement in the labor market,"" as factors that led to the central bank's decision to speed up the pace of bond tapering.
The aggressive tweak on the taper was largely expected after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell recently flagged concern about inflation and conceded that it was “good time to retire that word [transitory].”
The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, was up 0.6% in October, pushing the rate for the 12 months through October to 5%, well above the Fed’s 2% target.
The Fed's pivot on inflation has some worried the central bank could be forced to tighten policy more aggressively just as the economy is expected to slow in 2022.
The Federal Open Market Committee left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 0% to 0.25%.
The faster pace of tapering points to the bond purchasing program ending in March, paving the way for rate hikes to get underway in the spring of 2022.
The Fed is now projecting its benchmark rate to rise to 0.9% in 2022, suggesting two-and-a-half rate hikes next year, the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections showed. That represents a sharp contrast from prior expectations when members were equally split on whether to lift rates once in either late 2022 or early 2023.
For 2023, the Fed sees the Federal funds rate at 1.6%, up from its prior projection of 1.0%, pointing to three hikes.
The Fed will continue to hike until reaching its terminal rate for Fed funds – the rate that is consistent with full employment and stable inflation – of 2.5%.
Some question, however, whether the central bank will be able to reach this rate amid fears about a slowing economic growth.
The economy is expected to grow by 5.5% in 2021, down from previous estimates of 5.9%, while the forecast for 3.8% growth in 2022 was revised higher to 4%. For 2023, the Fed sees growth of 2.2%, down from its prior forecast of 2.5%.
The pace of inflation is forecast to speed up to 5.3% in 2021, and 2.6% in 2022, compared with prior estimates of 4.2% and 2.2%, respectively. Inflation expectations for 2023 were increased to 3.5% from 2.3%, and raised to 3.5% from 2.1% for 2024.
Ahead of the meeting, some questioned whether the Fed was behind the curve on inflation and would have to respond by tightening policy more aggressively than expected. While acknowledging that the risk of persistent inflation had increased, Powell said that the updated policy measures and expectations for inflation to slow in the coming years likely mitigated that risk. 
""I believe that inflation may be more persistent and  the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched has increased,"" Powell said in the press conference that followed the Fed's monetary policy statement.  ""That's part of the reason behind our move today is to put ourselves in a position to be able to deal with that risk [of elevated inflation].""
The labor market, part of Fed's dual mandate, is expected to improve, with the unemployment rate forecast at 4.3% in 2021, down from 4.8% previously.  In 2022, further job gains are pencilled in as the unemployment rate was expected to improve to 3.5%, down from 3.8% previously."
1073,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 03:33PM ET</span>","Adobe, Rivian, FedEx Earnings: 3 Things to Watch","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com -- Stocks steadied on Wednesday and surged in the afternoon after falling in the morning in anticipation of the Federal Reserve’s latest policy announcement.
As expected, the Fed kept interest rates near zero Wednesday, but said it would speed up the wind-down of its bond purchases and its timeline on rate hikes to curb elevated inflation.
The committee said it would increase the taper of its bond purchases by $30 billion a month in January, double the $15 billion monthly pace announced in November.
The Fed flagged ""inflation developments and the further improvement in the labor market,"" as factors that drove its decision to speed up the pace of bond tapering.
Data on Tuesday showed producer prices increased more than expected in November from last year, the biggest increase in 11 years, while the data on consumer prices last week indicated the biggest jump in 40 years.
Retail sales rose a disappointing 0.3% last month, but that may be because shoppers started stocking up on holiday stuff earlier this fall, fearing shortages.
According to Reuters, a rotation in spending from goods back to services also held back retail sales. The Commerce Department reported a drop in receipts at electronics and appliance stores, while online retail sales held up. Discretionary spending might also be hampered by higher food and fuel costs.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Adobe earnings
Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE) will release its fourth-quarter numbers Thursday. The company is expected to report a profit per share of $3.20 on revenue of $4.09 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.
2. Rivian earnings
 Rivian Automotive  Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN)’s third-quarter loss per share is seen at $1.37 on revenue of $921,110.
3. FedEx earnings
FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is expected to report second-quarter revenue of $22.41 billion and profit per share of $4.27.

(Reuters) - A three-year-old criminal case against the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker Huawei is still far from going to trial in New York, despite an agreement in the case that let Huawei's chief financial officer go free.
During a status conference on Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Ann Donnelly, presiding over the case in Brooklyn, asked the lawyers when the case might be ready.
""Are we thinking in terms of a trial date?"" she asked. ""I know that's crazy talk.""
""I think we have a fair distance to go,"" replied attorney Tom Green, who represents Huawei. 
He said COVID restrictions had impaired the preparation of a defense, adding: ""I just don’t know when we’re going to be able to travel to even meet with our clients.""
Huawei Technologies Co Ltd was indicted in 2018, accused of misleading HSBC and other banks about its business in Iran, which is subject to U.S. sanctions.
Last year, other charges were added, including conspiring to steal trade secrets from six U.S. technology companies and helping Iran track protesters during anti-government demonstrations in 2009. The firm has pleaded 'not guilty'. 
Green said the defense was planning a ""myriad of motions"" before trial, including a motion to sever the case.
And he said the government had ""quite a ways to go"" on turning documents over to the defense. 
CFO Meng Wanzhou resolved her part of the case, which was tied to misleading HSBC, with U.S. authorities in September.
As part of a deferred prosecution agreement, Meng was allowed to leave Canada, where she had been detained on a U.S. warrant and was fighting extradition, to fly to China, where she received a hero's welcome.
But the U.S. still has Huawei on a trade blacklist that restricts its purchases of U.S.-origin technology and goods.

Huawei's revenue was down 38% in the third quarter from the same period a year earlier.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday proposed new rules that will affect publicly listed companies and their top executives, banking groups and asset managers. Here is a summary of the proposals.
CORPORATE TRADING PLANS
The agency proposed tightening ""10b5-1"" corporate trading plans that allow insiders to buy and sell the company's stock on a pre-determined future date without falling foul of rules against trading on material non-public information. 
The SEC proposed mandating that executives disclose those plans and any modifications, which is not currently required. 
It also wants a cooling-off period of 120 days between the time an executive adopts a plan and executes the first trade, while companies trading in their own securities would be subject to a 30-day cooling off period. The SEC wants to bar multiple and overlapping plans, which may allow insiders to cherry pick among favorable plans. 
Officers and directors will also have to certify they're not in possession of material, non-public information when adopting or amending plans. 
SHARE BUY-BACK DISCLOSURES
The proposed rules on share buybacks would require an issuer to disclose details of the share buybacks the first business day following the trade, in contrast to the current requirement to provide only quarterly disclosure of aggregated monthly data.
In addition, the SEC wants companies to disclose the objective or rationale for the repurchases and the process or criteria used to determine the amount; policies and procedures relating to purchases and sales of its stock by insiders during a repurchase program; and if the issuer is using a trading plan. 
SECURITY-BASED SWAPS
The SEC rule, outlined here https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-259?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery, would require any person or entity who owns a security-based swap that exceeds a certain threshold to promptly provide a public disclosure with the SEC. 

MONEY MARKET FUNDS
The SEC proposed changes for money market funds aimed at improving funds' liquidity and discouraging redemptions. It said funds should raise the proportion of liquid assets they must have on hand and scrap fees and redemption suspensions which tend to panic investors into making withdrawals.

Shares of Canopy were down 3.4% at C$8.85 in afternoon trading.
The Ontario-based company said it would get an upfront payment of about C$115.5 million ($89.51 million) from German pharmaceutical firm Dermapharm Holding SE once the deal closes in January, and up to C$61.4 million in a milestone-based payment.

Recent COVID-19 lockdown measures in Germany due to soaring virus cases restricted people's ability to visit doctors and pharmacies, and dented C3's revenue in the past few quarters.
Sales in the unit fell 13% to C$11.9 million, according to Canopy's second-quarter earnings report. 
The divesture will help avoid future operational complexities associated with C3 and reduce short-term capital investment, Canopy said, adding that all C3 employees would be retained by Dermapharm.

The Omicron coronavirus variant is swiftly spreading across the globe, with many new cases linked to the mutant and the World Health Organization warning that Omicron poses a ""very high"" risk but data on its severity is limited. 
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said its recommendation to allow J&J booster doses follows data which showed the additional shot led to a rise in antibodies against the COVID-causing SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. 
The EMA said that a J&J booster dose may also be given after two doses of one of the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech or  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), in line with its recommendation on mixing vaccines.
Several EU countries are tightening restrictions after at least one patient died in the United Kingdom after contracting the Omicron variant, which was first detected last month in southern Africa and Hong Kong.

The rolling out of booster doses is being stepped up as longevity of protection offered by standard vaccination has been under scrutiny due to Omicron, whose high number of mutations may enable it to escape protection offered by vaccines.
The EU watchdog has already endorsed vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna as a third booster dose at least six months after a standard two-shot course. It is also considering AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s booster doses.

Then Consider Scooping Up These 2 Stocks Down More Than 70% YTD,"Although many cannabis stocks retreated in the second half of this year, the surge in cannabis sales and increasing legalization efforts may lead these stocks to a strong rebound next year. So, if one believes cannabis will rebound in 2022, one should consider scooping up HEXO (NASDAQ:HEXO) and Neptune Wellness (NEPT), which are down more than 70% in price year-to-date. Read on.Cannabis stocks plunged in price in the second half this year as U.S. regulatory reform extended barriers to broad ownership of cannabis equities by institutional investment managers. However, most Americans support the legalization of cannabis. Also, the U.S. cannabis industry is growing at an unprecedented pace, and cannabis sales are estimated to increase 41% year-over-year to $31 billion at the close of 2021.
San Francisco supervisor Rafael Mandelman said that ""Cannabis businesses create good jobs for San Franciscans and provide safe, regulated products to their customers."" Moreover, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance to suspend the Cannabis Business Tax for the 2021 and 2022 tax years. This should give the legal cannabis businesses a boost.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on cannabis stocks HEXO Corp. (HEXO) and Neptune Wellness Solutions Inc. (NASDAQ:NEPT), which are down more than 70% in price year-to-date but possess a solid rebound potential.

(Reuters) - Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) on Wednesday forecast 2022 profit above Wall Street estimates as it bets on new drug approvals to counter the impact of competition and pricing pressures on its other key treatments, sending its shares up nearly 10%.
The company has plans to launch five more medicines over the next two years, including diabetes drug tirzepatide and Alzheimer's disease treatment donanemab, helping it meets its target of launching 20 new medicines over a 10-year period through 2023, Lilly said. 
""We believe the continued uptake of our key growth products ... coupled with our anticipated upcoming launches will allow Lilly to deliver top-tier, volume-driven revenue growth through at least 2030,"" CFO Anat Ashkenazi said.
Lilly also raised its current-year expectations for profit and sales, helped partly by a recent U.S. government contract for the supply of its COVID-19 antibody treatment. 
Last month, the U.S. government bought 614,000 additional doses of its COVID-19 antibody therapy, a cocktail of bamlanivimab and etesevimab, for $1.29 billion.
The company said it now expected COVID-19 therapies to bring in sales of about $2.1 billion in 2021, up from an earlier forecast of $1.3 billion.
Profit for 2022 is expected to range between $8.50 and $8.65, above estimates of $8.18.
Lilly looks set for an ""exciting future"" with both donanemab and tirzepatide expected to receive approval next year, Third Bridge senior analyst Mikaela Franceschina said in an e-mailed statement. 
""Donanemab has been keenly watched since the controversy around Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s Aduhelm. Our experts say donanemab could theoretically benefit a larger patient population than Aduhelm and pose a substantial threat to Aduhelm's future."" 

Aduhelm, approved in June for treating the memory-robbing disease, is battling slow uptake as experts have questioned the FDA's rationale for clearing the drug without more definitive proof of benefit.
Lilly shares jumped 9.5% to $273.19.

Tilp said it was representing more than 250 institutional investors and a large number of private investors who believed Bayer misled them about the economic risks of the $63 billion acquisition and are demanding damages.
The value of the lawsuits amounts to more than one billion euros ($1.13 billion), the law firm said.
Tilp said it believed Bayer deceived shareholders about the risks of consumer lawsuits pending in the United States linked to the glyphosate-containing weed killer Roundup, which was brought into the company with the 2016 Monsanto acquisition.
Bayer said any complaints were unfounded. 
""Bayer has complied with the law and with its disclosure requirements,"" the group said. ""We will therefore defend ourselves.""

Investing.com — The stock price of steel company  Nucor  Corp (NYSE:NUE) is down 12% Wednesday after it announced its fourth-quarter earnings guidance that lagged consensus estimates. 
The North Carolina-based firm said it expects Q4 earnings to be between $7.65 to $7.75 per share. This means the company's fourth quarter earnings will be the highest quarterly earnings in Nucor history, surpassing its previous record of $7.28 per share, set in Q3 2021.
However, analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $7.92, hence the fall in Nucor's share price. Meanwhile, as widely reported, the FactSet consensus is for EPS of $8.18. 
""Steel mills segment earnings in the fourth quarter of 2021 remain robust and are expected to be comparable to the third quarter of 2021 despite lower volumes caused by year-end seasonality,"" stated Nucor.
""We expect the steel products segment to generate increased earnings in the fourth quarter of 2021 as demand in nonresidential construction markets remains strong."" 
The company said its raw materials segment earnings are expected to decrease in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter this year, primarily due to margin compression at its direct reduced iron facilities.
""As we approach the end of the most profitable year in Nucor's history, demand continues to be strong in most of the end markets we serve. We are confident that 2022 will be another year of strong profitability for Nucor,"" the company said.

Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) said it expects same-store sales to fall as much as 3% next year, as the easing of coronavirus restrictions encourages Americans to leave behind some pandemic shopping habits such as spending on paint, tools and gardening equipment for DIY projects.
""Looking ahead to 2022, the home improvement sector is likely to contract modestly given that the industry benefited from both higher inflation and government stimulus this year,"" Lowe's Chief Financial Officer David Denton said in a conference call.
Denton said he expects demand to decline in mid-single digits in 2022, adding that rising distribution costs due to global supply chain hurdles and higher wage expenses are also expected to hurt Lowe's profit next year. 
The company expects 2022 total sales to be between $94 billion and $97 billion, below analysts' estimates of $97.6 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. It also forecast earnings per share of $12.25 to $13, largely below estimates of $12.93 per share.

(Reuters) - Cineworld shares plunged by 40% on Wednesday after the British cinema operator was ordered to pay C$1.23 billion ($957 million) in damages to rival Cineplex for abandoning a planned takeover, a decision it said it would appeal.
Cineworld, the world's second largest cinema operator, said it disagrees with the Ontario Superior Court's judgement and does not expect damages to be payable to the Canadian company while any appeal is pending.
The Canadian court ruling denied Cineworld's counter-claim and included C$5.5 million for lost transaction costs.
Cineworld might win the appeal, negotiate a resolution with Cineplex, or be obliged to raise more capital on unfavourable terms, Peel Hunt analyst Ivor Jones wrote in a note.
""We believe the damages are in excess of Cineworld's available resources,"" Jones wrote.
Shares of Cineworld fell as much as 40% on the London Stock Exchange to hit one-year lows before recouping some losses to trade down 25% at 33.8 pence at 0858 GMT.
However, the Toronto-listed Cineplex's shares surged as much as 23% to a one-month high of C$14.48. Interestingly, Cineplex's market capitalisation of C$916.6 million at the stock's highest intraday level was still lower than the damages Cineworld was asked to cough up.
Cineworld has been struggling with debt of about $8.3 billion and has mooted listing itself or a part of its business in the United States, where it generates the bulk of its revenue from its Regal Cinemas. 
Cinema operators have been battered by the pandemic, with lockdowns shutting cinemas for much of the year and delaying movie releases at a time when the industry has been trying to stave off increased competition from streaming services.
Cineplex on Tuesday said its board was pleased with the judgement and would have no further comment in the 30-day period during which either party can appeal the decision.
Cineworld's takeover of Cineplex, announced in December 2019, would have seen it become North America's biggest cinema operator, but the British firm walked away from the $1.65 billion deal in mid-2020 citing breaches in the merger agreement by Cineplex. 

Cineplex rejected those claims and accused the British company of avoiding its obligations under the agreement in light of the pandemic's impact on the industry.

""We do not expect a major hike cycle to start next year, as inflation peaks then, which should give the Fed more time to act and then see what the impacts are before being too aggressive,"" said Jeremy Gatto, a multi-asset portfolio manager at Unigestion.
""With Omicron uncertainty, and the big central bank meetings, it's going to mean more choppiness going into the weeks ahead.""
The STOXX 600 is up about 1.7% so far in December, in what is typically a strong month for global equity markets. 
London's FTSE 100 dropped 0.7%, a sixth consecutive decline and the worst losing streak since the pandemic hit in March 2020, on weakness in retail, oil and travel stocks.
Data showed British consumer price inflation soared to a more than 10-year high of 5.1% year-on-year in November ahead of the Bank of England's meeting on Thursday.
The European Central Bank is also meeting on Thursday, with policymakers expected to decide how to adapt the bank's regular asset purchase programme (APP) once the much larger pandemic-fighting PEPP scheme ends in March.
Sweden's H&M fell 2.8% after the company's quarterly sales matched expectations but analysts flagged sales in China as a concern. Sales at Inditex and H&M are back at pre-pandemic levels or better.

Slower loan growth, declining margins, and growing debt delinquencies have weighed on banks’ short-term earnings projections. Given this backdrop, is it worth betting on Brazilian banking stocks Itau Unibanco (ITUB) and Banco Bradesco (BBD) now? Read on to learn our view.Shares of Brazilian banks have suffered major sell-offs this year, owing to a fast growth in debt levels and consumer leverage, as well as rising inflationary pressures and weak job growth. The Extended National Consumer Price Index 15 (IPCA-15) reached 10.1% in September. As a result, the Brazilian central bank has raised interest rates to 6.25%—a 425bps increase—since March, and the highest since July 2019. 
However, because its last crisis prepared the country’s banks by de-risking their balance sheets and creating high loss reserves and better underwriting standards, the current challenges should be manageable. In addition, according to Fitch Ratings, the performance of Brazil's banking sector has stabilized, with better capitalization and earnings supporting near-term profitability. The banking system's R$62 billion (USD11.2 billion) in aggregate net income in 1H21 increased by 53% year-over-year and was 3% higher than in 1H19. In 1H21, the median return on equity was 14.5%, up from 13.5% in 2020.
Furthermore, loan moratoria, government assistance, and regulatory forbearance should continue to cap the pandemic's overall impact on asset-quality deterioration. Given this backdrop, we think two fundamentally sound Brazilian banking stocks, Itau Unibanco Holdings S.A. (ITUB) and Banco Bradesco S.A. (BBD), could be worth adding to one’s watchlist.

The industry funded group said the Bronco's head restraints failed to provide good protection against whiplash injuries and its headlights provide inadequate illumination on curves.
Vehicles must earn good ratings in six IIHS crashworthiness tests. The Bronco received good ratings for five out of six tests but in the head restraint test the neck of the test dummy was subject to moderate force in a simulated rear-end crash and it received an acceptable rating.
Automakers often tout IIHS ""Top Safety Pick"" ratings. To get a ""Top Safety Pick+"" vehicles must have acceptable- or good-rated headlights that come standard across all trim levels.

Ford noted in a statement ""all of Bronco’s safety features meet or exceed federal safety standards.""
Ford has sold 25,855 Bronco SUVs in the United States through Nov. 30.

By Jamie Freed and Tim Hepher
SINGAPORE/PARIS (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) (SIA) has thrown its weight behind efforts by Airbus to penetrate the booming air cargo market, signing a provisional deal to buy seven A350 freighters and become the first major airline operator of the plane.
The backing from a blue-chip Asian carrier is a fillip for the European planemaker's efforts to break into a lucrative niche long dominated by its U.S. archrival Boeing (NYSE:BA).
Deliveries will begin in the fourth quarter of 2025, the airline said on Wednesday. It did not provide a value for the order.
A letter of intent includes a quid pro quo, however, allowing the airline to swap part of the order for 15 A320neo jetliners and two A350-900 passenger versions that it had previously ordered from Airbus and remain to be delivered.
Those 17 planes had a list value of $2.3 billion when Airbus last published prices in 2018, roughly the same price as the estimated value of the freighters. 
While order prices typically fall well below catalogue ones, this is a possible indication that the planemaker is not making major extra revenue from the deal, analysts said.
Until now, Airbus has been reluctant to let many airlines cancel planes, preferring to delay delivery and keep orders on its books. But a big-name endorsement for its latest assault on the cargo market might have tipped the balance, several industry sources said.
Airbus will also easily find homes for the in-demand A320neos and is anxious to prop up weak wide-body A350 production, making it a net winner from the deal, they added.
QATAR DISPUTE 
The deal also represents the first key order for the A350 since Airbus was plunged into a dispute with the plane's launch customer, Qatar Airways, over erosion to the surface of existing jets. 
Reuters reported in November that Airbus was aiming to land an A350 freighter deal with Singapore as Qatar Airways looked likely to back rival Boeing's 777X freighters..
Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker appeared to confirm a major upcoming 777X order on Tuesday, days after Airbus took the increasingly bitter dispute to lawyers.
""I was looking very positively at (Airbus) freighters. But they have destroyed that relationship,"" Al Baker told the South China Morning Post in an interview. ""I don't think that they will ever get a single size of order that we would have placed for the freighter.""
Industry sources say Qatar Airways is expected to order at least 34-35 777X freighters to renew its current fleet.
FLEET OVERLAP
Singapore Airlines said its seven new A350 freighters, along with options for another five, would replace its own fleet of seven ageing Boeing 747 freighters and reduce carbon emissions.
It is the third customer for the A350F freighter after lessor Air Lease (NYSE:AL) Corp and French cargo company CMA CGM.
""The selection of the A350F to replace the 747F is sensible as SIA already has the world's largest A350 passenger fleet, creating attractive synergies for its future cargo operation,"" said Singapore-based aviation analyst Brendan Sobie.
He said the conversion of 15 A320neos made sense because the airline had too many such planes on order for the post-pandemic world. Others have been buying such jets, however.
Cargo accounted for two thirds of SIA's revenue in the six months to Sept. 30. The airline, which lacks a domestic market, has been hit hard by pandemic-related border closures.

SIA on Wednesday said it should reach 45% of pre-pandemic passenger capacity in December, up from an earlier estimate of 43% as Singapore gradually opens its borders. In November, it filled about a third of its passenger seats.

With sports betting legalized in several states, DKNG has been gaining traction. “We’ve seen just massive, massive levels of engagement,” boasted Bill Miller, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association. But the booming online sports gambling sector is becoming increasingly competitive.
In November, DKNG reported a 60% year-over-year increase in revenues to $213 million for its fiscal third quarter. The company reported solid growth in its monthly unique players also. However, its revenues missed consensus estimates by $24.90 million. Jason Park, DraftKings’ Chief Financial Officer, explained the lower-than-expected results as primarily due to unexpected NFL game outcomes.

MILAN (Reuters) -Generali said it would stick to bold earnings goals for 2024, hike dividends and launch its first buyback in 15 years as Philippe Donnet's bid to stay on as CEO of Italy's biggest insurer faces opposition from two billionaire investors. Donnet's reappointment next year is opposed by construction magnate Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and Leonardo Del Vecchio, founder of eyewear giant Luxottica, who want the insurer to be more ambitious in expanding via acquisitions.
The new strategy outlined on Wednesday earmarks up to 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in insurance and asset management.
That compares with a 4 billion euro M&A budget under the previous plan, of which Generali (MI:GASI) spent 85%. 
Donnet, 61, said the latest figure was ""a good number"".
""We want to achieve the right balance between the capital which is returned to shareholders and the capital which is invested in growth,"" he told a news briefing.
""M&A remains a tool to accelerate value creation for shareholders,"" he said, adding Europe and Asia would be targets for insurance and asset management, and the United States and Britain just for asset management.
When the plan was put to a board vote, Caltagirone opposed it. A representative for Del Vecchio did not attend the meeting after saying they received details too late to study them properly, two sources close to the matter said.
Overall, the plan won 11 out of 13 votes, the sources said. Donnet is backed by Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), Generali's biggest shareholder. Caltagirone and Del Vecchio are the second and third largest.
Analysts gave Donnet's plan a thumbs up, but market reaction was muted. Shares rose 0.35% by 1602 GMT.
""Strategically, it looks like more of the same from Generali(which we think is a good thing),"" BofA Securities said.
In addition to the buyback over the next 12 months, Generali aims to pay up to 5.6 billion euros in dividends in the next three years, up from 4.5 billion euros in the previous plan.
It said it aimed for average earnings per share (EPS) growth of 6-8% a year, which Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said was a ""positive surprise"" versus Allianz (DE:ALVG)'s 5-7%.
EXECUTION
""New targets for EPS growth, cash and dividends ... are all more ambitious than we had expected,"" Kepler Cheuvreux said.
Caltagirone, who could not immediately be reached for comment, and Del Vecchio have agreed to consult over a combined 15.6% voting stake. They are set to propose a new CEO candidate at a board meeting in April, sources close to the matter said.
Mediobanca, which has a 13% holding, has borrowed shares to reach a 17% voting stake.
Under the new strategy, the Trieste-based insurer will increase digital investments by 60% versus 2021 to a cumulative 1.1 billion euros by 2024.
It also aims to boost premiums in non-motor property and casualty by more than 4% a year on average in 2021-2024, targeting small businesses and senior care in Europe and travel insurance in the United States.

""Execution on such a plan will be key as Generali attempts to convince on its digital transformation and develop new revenue streams,"" Citi said.

MADRID/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Sales at Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) and rival H&M are back at pre-pandemic levels or better, as the world's top two fashion retailers ride a recovery in demand despite supply chain challenges. 
Spain's Inditex, the world's largest fashion retailer, said on Wednesday sales at constant currencies were up 10% on 2019 levels in the quarter to the end of October, and had continued at that rate up to Dec. 10, helped by strong online demand.
Smaller Swedish rival Hennes and Mauritz (H&M) said sales in local currencies matched pre-pandemic levels from September through November.
""The recovery continues to gain momentum,"" Inditex's Capital Markets director Marcos Lopez said in a statement.
Shares in both Inditex and H&M were down around 3% in early trading, with the resurgence of coronavirus cases linked to the Omicron variant clouding the picture for Christmas trading.
""The main short term risk we see for Inditex is further restrictions on stores and travel flows due to the Omicron variant, especially in southern Europe,"" said RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain.
He estimated Inditex makes about 15% of sales from stores in major city centre locations that are heavily dependent on tourism.
Companies are battling to source products and raw materials in a robust global economic recovery as the pandemic continues to disrupt everyday life in parts of the world. 
Inditex, whose brands also include Massimo Dutti, Bershka and Pull & Bear, produces more than half of its products near its base in Spain and delivers them to consumers faster than rivals, sparing it the worst of the supply chain crisis.
Inditex is embarking on a change in senior management, with Marta Ortega, a daughter of the company billionaire' s founder Amancio Ortega, taking over as chair next April. 
ONLINE FLOURISHES
The Spanish company reported sales of 7.3 billion euros and net profit of 1.2 billion euros from August-October, the third quarter of its financial year, in line with analysts' expectations. 
It said online sales for the first nine months of its fiscal year were up 124% on the same period of 2019, and that it expected them to account for more than 25% of the total over the full year.
""We can say that it is a very healthy evolution of the business globally,"" said Pablo Isla, who will serve as Inditex executive president until March 31. 
""We have total confidence in our unique business model,"" he added in a online call with analysts.
H&M said its net sales totalled 56.8 billion Swedish crowns ($6.22 billion) in September-November, its fiscal fourth quarter. 
""Customers are showing that they appreciate the collections and being able to shop where, when and how they choose,"" it said.
However, the Swedish group said its business continued to be affected by the pandemic. 
At the end of November, around 115 H&M stores were temporarily closed due to restrictions, mainly in Austria and Slovakia. At the start of the quarter, about 100 had been closed, mainly in southeast Asia.
Inditex said all of its 1,975 stores are now open.

H&M warned on Sept. 30 that sales growth in September was held back by global supply chain disruptions but did not mention the issue in Wednesday's statement. The company is due to publish its full fourth-quarter earnings report on Jan. 28.

Graphite, in both natural and synthetic forms, is used for the negative end of a lithium-ion battery, known as the anode. Around 70% of all graphite comes from China, and there are few viable alternatives for batteries. (Graphic: China key EV material prices, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/jnvweakjevw/ChinaEVMaterials.png) 
Chinese producers have their work cut out keeping up with global demand for graphite, which has surged along with rapid growth in the battery market in recent years.
Consultancy Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI) sees a roughly 20,000 tonne graphite deficit in 2022, versus a similar-sized surplus last year. About 20,000 tonnes of graphite is enough to make batteries for roughly 250,000 EVs, an industrial source said.
Top global EV battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) is ""desperate"" to secure supply of key ingredients such as graphite to keep up with rising orders, said a person with knowledge of the matter.
""There's not enough graphite in the market for domestic players to grab,"" said the source, who asked not to be identified because the person was not authorised to speak to the media. 
""Demand from clients such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is growing rapidly while supply of raw materials has been extremely tight,"" the source said, adding that the recent power rationing on industry had exacerbated the situation.
CATL did not respond to Reuters' request for a comment. (Graphic: Synthetic Graphite Demand Forecast, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/jnvweabdwvw/BMI1.JPG) 
""SEVERE SHORTAGE""
The upcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing is set to make supply of the dark grey form of carbon even tighter as authorities look to ensure a blue-sky backdrop to the showpiece event by ordering energy-intensive and high emitting industries like graphite to slash output, said a source with Chinese EV maker NIO Inc, with knowledge of the graphite market.
""Graphite is in severe shortage and all companies are snapping up purchases,"" said the source, who also declined to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media.
George Miller, an analyst with BMI said Northeast China's graphite mines tend to close during the winter months due to extreme cold temperatures, leaving graphite processors no option but to try and fulfil orders from inventory. 
""Graphite consumers, whether within China or outside, are fighting over a limited stock of material,"" he said. 
BMI forecasts that global demand for battery anodes will grow by an average of around 27% per year over the next decade, driven by the lithium-ion sector. 
Anode-grade graphite flake prices on the Chinese domestic market are up almost 40% year-to-date at 4,500 yuan ($707) per tonne, testing the record highs seen in 2018, according to BMI.
Reflecting the rapid growth in the EV market, China's auto sector sold 2.99 million EVs and plug-in hybrids in the first 11 months of 2021, a 170% rise on the same period in 2020. (Graphic: Historical graphite pricing, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/zdpxoxkzyvx/Bmi2.JPG) 
Tesla, the world's most valuable EV maker, registered its support for U.S. Section 301 tariff waivers on imports of both artificial and natural graphite from China to be reinstated as many tariff exclusions expired.
""Tesla has concluded that no company in the United States is currently capable of producing ... graphite to the required specifications and capacity needed for Tesla's production,"" the company said in a public comment lodged with the U.S. Trade Representative recently. (Graphic: China new energy vehicle sales jump to new highs in November, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/lbvgnlmjlpq/ChinaEVSalesNov2021.png) 
CATL is studying using the natural form of graphite in battery anodes as an alternative to artificial graphite because of greater availability, said the first source, even though it may not give the same level of performance.

""We have heard indications that Chinese anode producers are shifting their anode blends towards a higher percentage of natural feedstock,"" Miller said.

(Reuters) - Video-conferencing platform Zoom has joined a counterterrorism organization formed by major U.S. tech companies including Meta Platforms Inc, formerly known as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), the group said on Wednesday.
The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT) is an independent group through which member companies share information to combat terrorism and violent extremism on their sites.
 Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc, which saw usage explode during the COVID-19 pandemic but has faced slowing growth in recent months, has come under scrutiny over how to police content and abuses on its platform. 
GIFCT's founding members were Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube.
Its membership has risen to 18 companies with five new platforms joining this year including home-rental firm Airbnb, social network Tumblr and online publishing platform WordPress. It said it plans for more in 2022.
Tech companies have long been criticized for failing to curb violent extremist activity on their platforms, though they also face concerns over free expression.
GIFCT was created in 2017 under pressure from U.S. and European governments after a series of deadly attacks in Paris and Brussels. 
It manages a hash-sharing database, where member companies can share ""hashes"", unique numerical representations of original pieces of content that have been removed from their services. Other companies can use these hashes to identify the same content on their sites and review or remove the material.
""It is our responsibility to support our users and protect them against online threats,"" Josh Parecki, Zoom's associate general counsel for trust and safety, said in a statement. 
""By collaborating with other leaders across the industry, sharing key learnings and advancing research, we aspire to make the digital world a safer place for all.""
As individuals and companies turned to video-conferencing apps during COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, Zoom faced high-profile content moderation issues. 
These ranged from abuses like ""zoombombing"", where uninvited users crashed others' calls to share hate speech and racist, violent or pornographic content, to decisions like its cancellation of a virtual event featuring Leila Khaled, a member of a Palestinian group on the U.S. State Department's list of terrorist organizations. 
GIFCT Executive Director Nicholas Rasmussen said in a statement it was delighted to add Zoom as its mission ""requires we work with a diverse range of companies ...to develop cross-platform solutions that render terrorists and violent extremists ineffective across the internet"".
GIFCT has faced criticism from some human and digital rights advocates over centralized or over-broad censorship, and calls for greater transparency. 
In July, the organization expanded the scope of its hash-sharing database to include attacker manifestos and other publications and URLs flagged by the United Nations initiative Tech Against Terrorism. It also said it would continue to broaden the database to include hashes of audio files or certain symbols. 

GIFCT also said on Wednesday it has designed a new membership structure based on company revenue, with suggested annual contributions ranging from $0 to $1 million. It said membership was not contingent on a company's revenue.
Other members include Meta's Instagram and WhatsApp, Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), chat platform Discord and file-sharing service Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX). Other companies such as Reddit and Snapchat-owner Snap (NYSE:SNAP) can also access the hash-sharing database.

In the letter, the investors said freedom to unionise was enshrined in global and regional conventions and laws but said their research suggested a pattern of behaviour at the company to block employees doing so.
The letter highlighted six examples dating back to 2014, when a Romanian court fined the company after 19 employees were dismissed shortly after starting a union.
The letter quoted an interview in June 2020 with Chief Executive Jozsef Varadi in which he said the firm was ""keeping out unions everywhere"" as they were ""killing the business"".
In April 2021, Wizz Air rejected calls from unions in Italy to agree a labour contract with them and told Italy's labour ministry it planned to operate without engaging with unions. https://www.reuters.com/article/wizz-air-italy-idUSL8N2MJ4NZ
""There is a growing body of evidence of workers being blocked to join unions or sacked when they do so. This is completely unacceptable,"" said Jens Munch Holst, chief executive of AkademikerPension, a $23 billion Danish pension fund.
""Our message is clear to the company. We will wait until 20 December and if our meeting requests are not met, expect exclusion,"" he said, adding that respecting workers' rights was also about caring for passenger safety.
In the letter, investors acknowledged the company had sought to manage labour relations through an internal body known as the Wizz People Council but were concerned about its effectiveness.
Wizz Air said the council provided a forum for employees to discuss important issues, held frequent employee engagement surveys and had a programme for ""regular two-way dialogue"" with the chief executive.

The investors' letter pointed to a whistleblower report flagging concerns about pilot fatigue and flight safety, adding that recognising workers' freedom to form and join unions was ""also an important risk mitigation strategy.""
""To remedy our concerns, we therefore encourage Wizz Air to publicly and formally recognise employees' rights to form and join unions; and commit to non-discrimination on the basis of union membership,"" it said.

So, we think popular WallStreetBets stocks Lucid (LCID), Carnival (NYSE:CUK) (CCL), Peloton (PTON), and C3.ai (AI) are best avoided now because they look overvalued and have bleak growth prospects. Read on, let’s discuss.The Reddit community, aka the WallStreetBets (WSB), is known for taking bets on heavily shorted companies and squeezing out short-selling institutional investors. The way  GameStop Corp . (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings, Inc.’s (AMC) share prices have skyrocketed this year fits perfectly with Redditors’ motto: “To the moon.” According to Ortex data, short-sellers have gained $1.10 billion on their bets against AMC since December, and GME short-sellers have made $330 million since the start of the month.
But several stocks discussed on the forum do not have high growth prospects or strong fundamentals. Rather, WSBs usually make bets on heavily shorted companies, and their share prices surge based on investors’ optimism. However, betting on stocks whose companies lack solid fundamentals or good growth prospects can be highly risky, especially when the euphoria around them ceases. Stocks or “stonks” (as they are referred to on the WSB platform) have often fallen massively intraday, spelling significant losses by retail investors.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to avoid WSBs stocks Lucid Group, Inc. (LCID), Carnival Corporation & plc (CCL), Peloton Interactive, Inc. (NASDAQ:PTON) and C3.ai, Inc. (AI). Their valuations look stretched at their current price levels.

Investing.com –  Roku  stock (NASDAQ:ROKU) plunged 8% Wednesday after Universal Electronics claimed victory in a patent infringement case it was pursuing against the maker of remotes and streaming devices.
Universal Electronics shares (NASDAQ:UEIC) rose 5%.
According to Universal, the United States International Trade Commission has banned Roku from importing infringing “televisions, set top boxes, remote control devices, streaming devices and sound bars.”
Roku is allowed to import items provided they don’t infringe on Universal’s patents, according to the order. Universal makes remotes compatible with a range of electronics.
The order, issued Dec. 3, will become final on Jan. 9. Until then, President Joe Biden has time to review the order and even overturn it.
The ITC hears disputes about imported goods that infringe on U.S. patents or imports that hurt the domestic industry because of unfair trade practices in the exporting country.
Universal filed the complaint last year against Roku and TV-makers TCL and Hisense at the ITC for infringing several patents. The case was later narrowed to include only Roku.
Universal is also pursuing cases against Roku in the district court in central California.
A Roku representative said there have been no new developments in the case. ""On November 10, 2021, the ITC’s Final Determination fully absolved Roku from liability in this proceeding by confirming the Administrative Law Judge’s Initial Determination findings that two of the three patents asserted by UEI are invalid and that Roku has already successfully implemented technical design changes that eliminate any infringement of the one remaining UEI patent. Based on the ITC’s ruling, we do not anticipate any disruption in Roku’s ability to continue to import products,” Joe Hollinger, Roku vice president, litigation and intellectual property, said in a mail to Investing.com."

(Reuters) - Global hedge funds are poised to achieve positive inflows in 2021, for the first time in three years, data from Preqin shows, thanks to strong returns and an investor shift to alternative assets during a period of volatility and rising inflation. 
Alternative assets data and analytics firm Preqin's data shows hedge funds have attracted flows totalling $40.9 billion in the first three quarters of the year, after outflows of $97.2 billion and $44.5 billion in 2019 and 2020 respectively.
(Graphic: Quarterly flows into hedge funds, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jnvweabzavw/Quarterly%20flows%20into%20hedge%20funds.jpg) 
""Investors are looking to hedge funds to achieve a measure of diversification, particularly considering that the specter of inflation has recently entered the fray,"" Benjamin Crawford, vice president and head of research at alternate investment data firm BarclayHedge, said.
""Several sectors of the hedge fund industry have a well-earned reputation for shielding assets from inflation.""
(Graphic: Hedge funds' total asset under management, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/akvezoxrnpr/Hedge%20funds%20total%20asset%20under%20management.jpg) 
Analysts said the inflows are likely to rise further next year due to increased market volatility and uncertainty over the Omicron variant of COVID-19.
Data from Preqin showed global hedge funds gained 13.9% on average between January and November this year, marking their third successive year of returns above 10%. That compares with the MSCI global stock index's gain of 12.4% in the same period. 
(Graphic: Yearly performance of hedge funds, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/byvrjqedeve/Yearly%20performance%20of%20hedge%20funds.jpg) 
Event-driven strategies, which bet on corporate changes such as mergers and restructurings, led with a 15.1% gain, while equity strategies delivered a 12.3% gain.
On the other hand, macro strategy funds provided just 7% return in the first eleven months of 2021, compared with more than 14% in 2020.

""Global macro hedge funds have been challenged, as some common themes at the start of the year have not played out as planned, such as the steepening yield curve theme and weakness in the US dollar,"" Robert Christian, co-chief investment officer at K2 Advisors, said. 
According to eVestment data, multi-strategy funds and managed futures funds were the biggest recipients of cash into hedge funds between January and October this year, taking in $24.7 billion and $13.1 billion respectively.
Long/short equity funds, on the other hand, witnessed the highest outflow of $12.6 billion this year.

On the other hand, emerging market funds saw outflows totalling $4.86 billion, the data showed. 
""Seemingly, everyone is finding a reason to put their assets into hedge funds, regardless of whether they think the current moment portends doom, the coming of a halcyon age, or have absolutely no idea what's ahead but don't want to be caught off guard either way,"" BarclayHedge's Crawford said.

Investing.com — Roblox Corp (NYSE:RBLX) shares are down 11.6% despite the online game platform's metrics in November, showing a rise year on year.
Roblox shares are currently trading around $95.17.
Daily active users rose to 49.4 million during the month, up 35% year over year, while the number of hours engaged came in at 3.6 billion, up 32% from the previous year.
Estimated bookings were between $208 million and $211 million, a rise of 22% to 24% year over year. However, estimated average bookings per daily active user were between $4.21 and $4.27, down 8% to 9%. As a result, Roblox expects revenue to be between $184 million and $187 million, a potential rise of between 84% and 87%.
With most of the data up from last year, some may have expected a muted, if not slightly positive, reaction. However, the numbers reported were below expectations. Stifel's Drew Crum forecasted November bookings at around $220 million.
""Results came in slightly below our expectations and appeared to trail the historical trend line whereby November typically experiences a modest sequential uptick vs. October,"" said Crum in a note to investors.
""We think shares will be down on this update. With that said, December is seasonally the most important month of CY4Q, and thus we are not making any adjustments to estimates at this point,"" he added."

The DPA's initial plan last January was to fine Grindr 100 million crowns, but it said on Wednesday that it had reduced the amount because of new information on the company's finances and changes Grindr has made ""to remedy the deficiencies in their previous consent-management platform"".
U.S.-based Grindr, which describes itself as the world's largest social networking app for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people (LGBTQ+), said it still strongly disagreed with the decision.
""Our conclusion is that Grindr has disclosed user data to third parties for behavioural advertisement without a legal basis,"" Tobias Judin, head of the DPA's international department, said in a statement.
He said the agency, also known as Datatilsynet, concluded that user consent collected by Grindr between July 2018 and April 2020 for the use of private data was not valid.
""We strongly disagree with Datatilsynet's reasoning, which concerns historical consent practices from years ago, not our current consent practices or Privacy Policy,"" Grindr Chief Privacy Officer Shane Wiley said in a statement.
Grindr said it was considering lodging an appeal of the decision.
Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets guidelines for the collection, processing and sharing of personal information in the European Union as well as in non-EU Norway.
The Norwegian Consumer Council (NCC) watchdog said in a January 2020 report that Grindr shared detailed user data with third parties involved in advertising and profiling. The data included details such as users' IP addresses, GPS locations, age and gender.

In some cases, widespread sharing of personal data can become a matter of physical safety if users are located and targeted in countries where homosexuality is illegal, the NCC said at the time.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened little changed on Wednesday with few willing to take any action ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy statement and press conference later in the day. 
The Fed is overwhelmingly expected to announce a shorter phase-out of its pandemic-era bond purchases, cutting them from $120 billion a month to zero in as little as three or four months.  That would clear the way for a first interest rate rise by the middle of the year, if inflation - currently running at its highest in nearly 40 years - fails to abate.
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 55 points, or 0.2% at 35,489 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both essentially unchanged. All three indices had fallen on Tuesday after stronger-than-expected producer price inflation data had reinforced expectations of a faster withdrawal of support by the Fed. 
Earlier, there were indications that the effects of the fiscal stimulus that sustained household consumption through the pandemic are also starting to fade. Retail sales rose by a disappointing 0.3% in November, well below the 0.8% expected, and core retail sales were similarly weak, also rising only 0.3%. 
""Persistent supply shortages and elevated prices tempered consumers’ willingness and ability to spend on goods,"" said Oxford Economics' Greg Daco in a note to clients, adding that ""renewed health concerns limited spending at restaurants and bars.""
Social media companies suffered as the retail sales figures were taken as an omen for the strength of the advertising market.  Pinterest Inc  (NYSE:PINS) stock fell 3.9% to a 15-month low while Snap (NYSE:SNAP) stock fell 5.7% to its lowest in 13 months.  The more profitable Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), owner of Facebook, and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) suffered smaller declines.
Among the few big movers was  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock, which fell 7.4% after the International Trade Commission banned the import of its devices into the U.S. in response to an intellectual property lawsuit from Universal Electronics (NASDAQ:UEIC). That put the maker of streaming devices on course to test a 13-month low. An early winner from a pandemic that accelerated the secular trend toward streaming, Roku is now down some 60% from its peak in July. Universal Electronics stock, meanwhile, rose over 7% on the prospects for a favorable settlement with Roku.
Also falling sharply was Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) stock. The videogame hosting company fell another 8.7% to its lowest in over a month, despite posting a respectable 35% gain in active users in November. The stock has been a favorite play of those betting on the development of the so-called metaverse since it listed earlier in the year. It's now down over 30% from its peak but still up handily from when it went public through a direct listing in March.
Elsewhere,  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT) stock fell 6.1% after the Food and Drug Administration warned it about concerns surrounding its diabetes business, while Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock rose 6.8% to its highest in over a month after raising its full-year earnings guidance.

PARIS (Reuters) -Leading Paris taxi company G7 has suspended the use of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3 cars in its fleet after a fatal accident involving one of the vehicles over the weekend.
G7 Deputy Chief Executive Yann Ricordel said an off-duty taxi driver was taking his family to a restaurant when the accident happened on Saturday evening. 
The accident killed one person, two sources said on Tuesday. Twenty others were wounded, one of the persons close to the investigation said, adding that three were in serious condition. 
According to French media reports, the car hit a cyclist and three pedestrians before crashing into a van, and seven people were seriously injured. 
G7 said it would suspend the use of 37 Tesla Model 3 cars in its fleet until a police investigation into the case is completed.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Ricordel cited Tesla as saying on Monday that an initial inquiry had ruled out a technical dysfunction of the vehicle. The G7 executive said the driver had tried to brake but the car instead accelerated. It was unclear if the car was operating in Autopilot mode. 
Jerome Coumet, mayor of Paris' 13th arrondissement, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), ""The first elements of the investigation indicated that the accelerator would have gotten stuck."" 
Ricordel said: ""Today, we have two divergent views on the subject. We will maintain the suspension of the Tesla Model 3 while the investigation is ongoing, as a safety measure for our drivers, customers and other road users."" 
Tesla collects detailed data from the sensors and cameras on its vehicles and has used such data in the past to challenge claims that accidents were caused by malfunctioning technology.
Ricordel said the Tesla Model 3 owners in its fleet would be fully compensated for lost earnings during the suspension and that the company was looking for alternatives so the drivers could resume driving for G7 as soon as possible. 

He said that G7 was in contact with the government as it awaited the outcome of the police investigation. 
G7 is one of Paris' biggest taxi companies, with 9,000 affiliated drivers, who are independent operators who own their vehicles. Half of the G7 fleet are electric or hybrid vehicles and the company aims to have a 100% green fleet by 2027.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish bank SEB said on Wednesday it had been hit with a 511 million euros ($575 million) tax demand from Germany and its head office in the country had been raided this week, both related to so-called cum-ex transactions.
The bank denied any wrongdoing and said it would appeal the demand. 
""The review relates to transactions that were carried out before a change in Germany's tax legislation came into force in 2016. SEB is of the opinion that these were carried out in accordance with then prevailing rules,"" it said in a statement.
SEB said in a separate statement that Germany's public prosecutor had on Dec. 14 and 15 visited the bank's office in Frankfurt and requested information on alleged cum-ex transactions. The bank said it was cooperating with authorities.
""To the best of our knowledge, SEB in Germany has not offered or conducted transactions where the purpose is to recover tax that was not paid. We distance ourselves from that type of arrangement,"" it said, describing the cum-ex scandal. 
The scandal is potentially Germany's biggest post-war fraud involving a share-trading scheme, which authorities say cost taxpayers billions of euros.
It is the subject of multiple investigations involving numerous financial institutions across Germany as the government tries to claw back money it says was stolen from the state.
German prosecutors in Cologne said in a statement a raid was conducted in Frankfurt, but declined to name the bank involved.
SEB said it had, in accordance with current accounting rules, made no provisions at a group level related to the matter. It also said further demands could not be ruled out and that this could have a negative financial impact on the bank.
SEB said that, including the latest order, Germany's tax authority had demanded a total of 936 million euros relating to alleged ex-cum transactions, and that legal proceedings were expected to take several years.

SEB said last year the tax authority had requested its German subsidiary DSK Hyp AG to retroactively repay ""transparently reported withholding tax"" from more than five years ago, adding it strongly opposed the decision.

British Airways and Iberia owner IAG's proposed acquisition from privately held Spanish company Globalia was designed to help the group's Madrid hub to compete more effectively against its European rivals. Air Europa provides connections to Latin America as well as serving destinations in Europe.
After IAG finance chief Stephen Gunning announced that the group was in advanced negotiations to cancel the acquisition, Chief Executive Luis Gallego said the COVID-19 pandemic meant the deal no longer worked but that IAG was assessing whether there were other options for a tie-up.
""Air Europa, let's see if finally we can find a way to do it,"" he told the online Capa Live conference. 
""We are not going to continue with the current structure, we are trying to have a new structure that (will) allow this deal to happen.""
While most observers expected IAG to pull the deal once the pandemic struck, it instead agreed to cut the price in half to 500 million euros ($563.6 million) and negotiated to defer payments for six years.
COMPETITION CONCERNS
European competition regulators, however, were concerned that the takeover would reduce competition in the Spanish domestic market and on international routes to the country.
The remedies offered by IAG - to give up 13 short and medium-haul routes and two long-haul routes at Madrid and Barcelona airports - were not enough to assuage the concerns and a veto was likely, sources have said.
As well as BA and Iberia, which is the market leader between Europe and South America, IAG also owns Irish carrier Aer Lingus and Barcelona-based Vueling and Level.
Shares in IAG fell 1.6% in early trading, with Citi analysts saying they believed the decision to cancel the deal was widely expected, given the regulatory hurdles thrown in its path by the European Commission and the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).

By walking away before the deal is vetoed by regulators, IAG will be better positioned to make another attempt in the future, sources said.

Since early last year, Chinese authorities have introduced a raft of measures to support small businesses, which are vital for growth and jobs but have been hit harder by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The government will shift the current loan repayment relief scheme for small firms, set to expire by the end of this year, to a new scheme. Under it, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) will provide capital to local banking institutions to encourage them to lend to small businesses, according to the State Council, the country's cabinet. 
The new scheme will run from the start of 2022 through June 2023. 
Authorities will also roll over a 400-billion-yuan relending quota that supports inclusive financing to small businesses, and boost relending quotas if necessary, and local banking institutions can apply for cheaper funds from the PBOC as an incentive, according to the State Council.
""At present, small, medium-sized and micro firms and individual businesses are facing great difficulties,"" it said. 

""It is necessary to focus on the survival of market entities to respond to the new downward pressure on the economy and use market-based measures to step up the support for small business.""
The government will also ramp up support for manufacturing firms, which will have priority with the government's tax and fee cuts policy and get more long-term loans, it added.

Investing.com – Eli Lilly stock (NYSE:LLY) rose 5% in Wednesday’s premarket trading after the company raised its guidance for the current financial year.  
Also helping the stock’s gains was the company’s forecast for the next financial year that is largely unchanged even though the company anticipates significantly lower revenue from its Covid-19 antibody therapy.
Adjusted operating margins are also seen improving by 2 percentage points to 32% in 2022.
The company expects its key products to drive volume growth in 2022.
At the midpoint of its guidance range, 2021 revenue is now seen at $28.15 billion, compared with a previous forecast of $27.4 billion.
The revised guidance comes on the back of an additional order of $1.29 billion the company won last month from the U.S. government for its Covid-19 antibody cocktail therapy. The company had won a smaller order for the same in September when the Delta variant raged.
The company now expects Covid-19 therapies to bring in about $2.1 billion in sales in 2021, up from an earlier forecast of $1.3 billion.
For 2022, the drug giant has pegged the top end of the revenue guidance at the same level as this year’s forecast of $28.3 billion. The lower end of the 2022 revenue guidance is set at $27.8 billion.

1141,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 07:45AM ET</span>",U.S. says it is ready to move forward with fighter jet sale to UAE,"By Ghaida Ghantous and Humeyra Pamuk
(Reuters) -The United States said on Wednesday it was ready to move forward with the sale of F-35 fighter jets and drones to the United Arab Emirates after Abu Dhabi told Washington it would suspend talks on the $23-billion deal that also includes munitions.
The deal was signed under then-President Donald Trump after the UAE forged ties with Israel last year but progress on the sale had slowed https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-intends-move-forward-f-35-sale-uae-us-official-says-2021-11-16 amid concerns in Washington, including over the Gulf Arab state's ties with China, a main trade partner.
""The UAE has informed the U.S. that it will suspend discussions to acquire the F-35,"" a UAE official told Reuters on Tuesday, citing ""technical requirements, sovereign operational restrictions, and cost/benefit analysis"".
The official said talks may be re-opened in the future and that there were discussions to ""address mutual defense security conditions for the acquisition"".
In Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was prepared to move forward with the sale.
""We've wanted to make sure, for example, that our commitment to Israel's qualitative military edge is assured, so we wanted to make sure that we could do a thorough review of any technologies that are sold or transferred to other partners in the region, including the UAE,"" Blinken said.
The UAE had signed a deal to purchase 50 F-35 stealthy jets made by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), up to 18 MQ-9B drones and advanced munitions, sources told Reuters https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-emirates-f35-int/uae-signs-deal-with-u-s-to-buy-50-f-35-jets-and-up-to-18-drones-sources-idUSKBN29P2C0 in January.
The UAE hosted https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-pm-discuss-iran-bilateral-issues-with-crown-prince-uae-2021-12-13 Israel's prime minister this week. Asked if the F-35 deal and Israeli qualitative military edge had come up, his spokeswoman said only that Israel had received no requests from Abu Dhabi on these matters.
RESTRICTIONS
A person briefed on the negotiations said sticking points between the United States and the UAE revolved around how the jets can be deployed and how much of the sophisticated F-35 technology the Emiratis will be allowed to take advantage of.
""The Americans want to sell the Emiratis the planes but they want to tie their hands,"" another person, a Gulf source, said following the talks.
The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said defence deals include requirements for purchasing nations, but that the restrictions in this deal made it unfeasible.
In 1998, the UAE selected Lockheed's F-16 Block 60 fighter jet but the deal dragged over access to software source codes and other technology release issues until the sale went through in 2000.
Earlier this month, the Gulf state ordered 80 French-made Rafale https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/frances-macron-nears-uae-rafale-fighter-jet-deal-2021-12-03 warplanes after on-off negotiations for more than a decade. A UAE defence official had said the Rafale deal was complementary to, and not a substitute, for the F-35s.

The Emirati official said the United States, on whose security umbrella Gulf Arab states rely heavily, ""remains the UAE's preferred provider for advanced defense requirements"". 
Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) has said Washington is committed to working with Abu Dhabi to address its questions, anticipating the weapons sale would come up at a meeting of U.S. and UAE officials at the Pentagon this week.

1142,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 07:36AM ET</span>",LG Energy Solution's IPO likely to be priced at $11 billion top end - sources,"By Heekyong Yang and Seunggyu Lim
SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution (LGES) will likely price its IPO at the top of its indicative range at around $11 billion, two sources told Reuters, as institutional investors bet on booming demand for electric vehicles.
That pricing would make LGES, a wholly-owned unit of LG Chem Ltd that supplies to firms including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Hyundai Motor, the biggest listing ever in South Korea. 
LGES said last week it expected to offer 34 million https://www.reuters.com/business/lg-energy-solution-expects-ipo-price-range-257000-won-300000-won-per-share-2021-12-07 new shares in an indicative range of 257,000 to 300,000 won per share, which would raise around 12.8 trillion won ($10.9 billion) at the top end when the IPO is scheduled to be priced on Jan. 14.
""LGES' IPO is drawing the hottest demand from institutional investors compared to any other South Korean IPOs this year,"" said an investment banker with direct knowledge.
With just 14.5% of shares being offered to institutional and retail investors, prospective buyers would need to bid big to get an allocation, the banker added. 
An official at a brokerage firm involved in the deal also said the feedback so far from, mainly domestic, institutional investors indicated the IPO would easily come in at the top end.
Both sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
LGES said it was proceeding with IPO plans but did not comment on the prospective pricing in a statement to Reuters in response to questions about the reception from investors.
A successful debut by LGES, which is scheduled to list on South Korea's main stock exchange KOSPI on Jan. 27, would kick off what is expected to be another strong year in the country's IPO market after a record result this year. 
More than 20 companies have gone public on KOSPI this year, raising about 17 trillion won, easily beating the 8.8 trillion won raised in 2010, the previous biggest year on record, according to the Korea Exchange.
At top of the price range, LGES would have a market value of 70.2 trillion won ($59.39 billion). That would make it South Korea's third most valuable company after Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd. and SK Hynix Inc, with valuations of 460 trillion won ($389.15 billion) and 89 billion won ($75.23 million), respectively. 
Parent LG Chem's ownership in the company will reduce to 81.8% after the offering. 
ELECTRIC VEHICLE DEMAND
Analysts said the booming demand for lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), combined with LGES' rare position as a top-tier battery maker with established customers, makes it particularly attractive to investors.
Global EV sales, estimated at 2.5 million vehicles in 2020, are forecast to grow more than 12-fold to 31.1 million by 2030 and account for nearly a third of new vehicle sales, according to consulting firm Deloitte.
""It's not like you're betting on an emerging battery manufacturer with limited customers and market presence,"" said Cho Hyun-ryul, an analyst with brokerage Samsung (KS:005930) Securities.

Some analysts, however, warn that LGES' profitability and stock performance could be vulnerable to any future EV industry hiccups like Hyundai Motor's $900 million recall https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/hyundai-motor-replace-battery-systems-900-mln-electric-car-recall-2021-02-24, involving the Kona EV, and GM's $2 billion Bolt EV recall https://www.reuters.com/business/lg-units-say-results-accounted-918-mln-costs-gms-bolt-recall-2021-10-12.

Investing.com – Ocugen stock (NASDAQ:OCGN) climbed 7% in Wednesday’s premarket trading after the company said it has data suggesting its Covid-19 vaccine could provide protection against both current and future variants of the virus.
The company said it is currently evaluating the vaccine, Covaxin, against the Omicron variant and plans to share the data as soon as they are available.
Labelled ""of concern"" by the World Health Organization, Omicron has been reported in more than 60 countries, including China, and now dominates the Delta variant in many nations. Said to be spreading faster than Delta, Omicron has forced countries in Europe and Australia to bring back restrictions on movement of people and business activities.   
Ocugen said the vaccine generated a robust immune memory against the virus and that the protection persisted for at least 6 months.
Covaxin has been developed by India’s Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology. Ocugen is co-developing Covaxin with Bharat Biotech for U.S. and Canadian markets and has the rights to market the vaccine in the two countries once the regulators approve. 
Covaxin is the second-most administered vaccine in India, one of the countries worst affected by the pandemic in the first half of this year. "

France's Competition Authority said in a statement it would put these proposals to a public consultation and the parties involved must respond by Jan. 31, 2022.
News organizations, which have been losing ad revenue to online aggregators such as Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), have complained for years about tech companies using stories in search results or other features without copyright payment.
As part of its proposals, Google commits to negotiate ""in good faith"" with news agencies and publishers the amount it would pay for using their protected content.
It also commits to making a payment offer within three months from the start of the negotiation. 
If a deal cannot be reached, it would be possible to go to an arbitration court that would decide on the amount to pay.

Google said on its Google France blog its proposals highlighted its willingness to open a new chapter in the copyright dispute. 
In November, Google began paying Agence France-Presse for its news content in a deal that follows France enacting a copyright law that creates ""neighboring rights,"" requiring big tech companies to open talks with news publishers that want a licensing payment.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening in muted fashion Wednesday, with investors cautious ahead of a highly-anticipated Federal Reserve meeting that could adopt a more hawkish policy stance.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 10 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 15 points, or 0.1%.
The major averages edged lower Tuesday, handing back some recent gains with growth stocks, in particular, underperforming as more strong inflation data begged a robust response from the Fed.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped just over 100 points, or 0.3%, on Tuesday, the S&P 500 fell 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite closed 1.1% lower.
Producer prices soared 9.6% on the year in November. 
Fed officials are expected to announce they will accelerate the cuts to their bond-buying program that they announced in November, potentially clearing the path for interest rate hikes in the second quarter of next year.
The Fed makes its announcement at 2 PM ET (1900 GMT), followed 30 minutes later by Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference. Ahead of that, U.S. retail sales are seen rising by only 0.8% month-on-month in November, less than half of October’s 1.7% growth.
Away from the Fed, investors will continue to study news surrounding the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus, particularly after the World Health Organization said Wednesday that preliminary evidence indicates that the current vaccines may be less effective against infection and transmission linked to the new variant, which also carries a higher risk of reinfection.
In the corporate sector, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is likely to be in the spotlight after the U.S. tech giant announced it has opened cloud regions in Stockholm and Milan, while  Digital World Acquisition  Corp (NASDAQ:DWAC), the SPAC which is merging with Donald Trump’s new media company, could see extra attention after Trump Media signed a partnership agreement with Canadian-based Rumble.
 Lennar  (NYSE:LEN), REV Group (NYSE:REVG) and ABM Industries (NYSE:ABM) are all due to report earnings before the open.
Oil prices fell Wednesday, for the third day in a row, on concerns the Omicron-driven rise in coronavirus cases will see demand growth weaken next year. 
The International Energy Agency said on Tuesday a surge in Covid-19 cases will dent global demand for oil at the same time that crude output is set to increase, especially in the United States.
Adding to the bearish tone, data from the industry body, American Petroleum Institute, showed that U.S. crude inventories fell by 815,000 barrels last week, a smaller decline than expected, if corroborated by U.S. Energy Information Administration later Wednesday.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $69.86 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.1% to $72.88. Both contracts have fallen more than 3% this week.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,770.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1272.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major U.S. airlines Wednesday will defend a $54 billion COVID-19 government lifeline even as they face operational challenges and work to speed hiring to address rising demand.
The Senate Commerce Committee will hear from the chief executives of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and United Airlines, as well as the chief of operations for Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and the head of a large flight attendants unions. Others like JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) and  Alaska Air  (NYSE:ALK) Group are submitting written statements.
""It's not an exaggeration to say the program saved the airline industry,"" American CEO Doug Parker will say.
Senator Maria Cantwell, the committee chair, pressed airline CEOs to take part in the oversight hearing after she sent major carriers letters about reports of workforce shortages, significant flight cancellations, and delays.
Lawmakers are expected to quiz executives about how carriers used pandemic-related federal bailout funds, staffing issues and other matters.
Congress approved $54 billion in three rounds covering much of U.S. airline payroll costs for 18 months.
Cantwell will call the payroll support program (PSP) a ""historic investment to sustain a critical sector of the U.S. economy by ensuring airlines had funding to continue paying their employees,"" her office said, adding ""PSP saved the jobs and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of workers across the U.S. airline industry.""
Airlines, in written testimony first reported by, say they are aggressively hiring and defended the assistance. They warn COVID-19 remains a drag on demand and below 2019 levels.
""The Omicron variant has created further uncertainty, and there is no clear consensus on when business and international travel will return,"" Delta's John Laughter will say.
Many other countries' aviation COVID-19 assistance required a higher percentage of funds repayment, while other U.S. industries did not get the same government financial support. U.S. airlines spurned conditions some lawmakers sought to add like cutting carbon emissions.
Out of $54 billion, airlines must repay $14 billion, or 26.2%, and Treasury holds warrants currently worth approximately $200 million, a Commerce Committee memo says. Treasury also extended $25 billion in low-cost government loans to carriers.
The memo said payroll assistance ""enabled the United States to outperform Europe and Asia in terms of an air travel recovery following the pandemic.""
Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, said in written testimony airline ""staffing is above pre-pandemic levels if compared to the number of flight hours airlines are flying. But aviation workers are not as willing to pick up overtime due to the combative passengers and concerns around COVID.""
Airlines for America, an industry trade group, told the committee that without the assistance ""airlines undoubtedly would have reduced capacity commensurate with the drop in passenger traffic to avoid a steep drop in load factor.""

The group estimates ""that approximately 50,000 airline employees opted for early retirement or voluntary separation.""
Airlines accepting government assistance that funded payroll costs through Sept. 30 were prohibited from furloughs or firing workers and faced limits on executive compensation and bans on stock buybacks and dividends.

BeiGene, which is already listed in Hong Kong and the United States, launched the biggest STAR Market float this year, taking advantage of rules by the Nasdaq-style board which welcomes loss-making firms.
Shares in BeiGene, which plans to use the majority of the proceeds to fund clinical trials and has posted at least three consecutive annual losses, closed 16.4% lower than its offer price of 192.6 yuan ($30.26) in Shanghai. 
BeiGene's Hong Kong-traded shares fell 7.6%.
""The money was raised at a very high valuation compared to Nasdaq and Hong Kong,"" Brad Loncar, whose Loncar Investments runs an ETF for Chinese drug firms, said. 
The offering, the 10th biggest public float globally this year according to data from accountancy group EY and the biggest of a healthcare firm in China in at least two decades according to Refinitiv data, comes amid growing concerns that some Chinese companies could face increased pressure and scrutiny in the U.S.
BeiGene's Nasdaq-listed shares have tumbled nearly 20% so far this month as U.S. securities regulators finalised rules to kick non-compliant Chinese firms off U.S. exchanges in three years, a risk BeiGene flagged in its Shanghai prospectus.
The falls also came as the Financial Times reported that the U.S. Commerce Department is set to place more than two dozen Chinese companies, including some in biotech, on an ""entity list"" restricting exports to them by U.S. firms.
This accelerated a sell-off in Chinese health-care shares in afternoon trade, knocking 3.2% off a mainland index tracking the sector against a 0.87% drop in the broader index.
BeiGene's poor debut show in Shanghai means its underwriters will likely start buying shares in the secondary market to help stabilise prices under a so-called greenshoe option. 

Investors that have subscribed to BeiGene's Shanghai share sale include China's national social security fund and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. Backed by existing shareholders such as Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Hillhouse-linked HHLR Fund, BeiGene is among China's most active innovative biotech firms whose self-developed products obtained out-license deals from global pharmaceutical giants.

1151,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 06:18AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Brazil bribery probe expands to four JPMorgan fuel deals -documents and sources,"By Gram Slattery
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A Brazilian police investigation of alleged bribery of Petrobras employees to fix the price of fuel sold to JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) by the state-run oil firm has expanded from one deal to at least four over the course of 2011, according to documents and two law enforcement officials.
Previously unreported invoices related to fuel sale agreements between the two companies show one of the alleged intermediaries in the bribery scheme, known as Oil & Gas Venture Capital Corp (OGVC), received approximately $150,000 that year from another alleged intermediary named EGR Consultants to facilitate the purchase of roughly 826,000 barrels of fuel oil by JPMorgan, worth more than $80 million at the time. 
The additional invoices are significant as Brazilian police have been working to determine if a 305,000-barrel JPMorgan deal facilitated by OGVC and EGR was a one-time arrangement or part of a pattern, which would raise the stakes of the investigation, according to two law enforcement sources in Brazil, who requested anonymity to discuss an ongoing probe. 
Reuters reported in September that Brazil's federal police are investigating whether JPMorgan routed bribes via intermediaries to employees on Petrobras' trading desk in order to secure shipments of fuel at artificially low prices. If true, this would likely violate Brazilian anti-bribery law. 
Police were focusing on one shipment of 305,000 barrels of Petrobras fuel oil that JPMorgan purchased in 2011, Reuters reported at the time, citing court documents and two federal law enforcement officials familiar with the matter.
Petrobras, formally known as Petroleo Brasileiro SA, said in an email it has ""zero tolerance in relation to fraud and corruption."" The company added that it has aided Brazilian authorities with various corruption-related probes. 
JPMorgan declined to comment on the alleged bribery scheme.
No charges have been brought in the probe and it remains unclear if any will be. Reuters has no independent evidence establishing that JPMorgan knew about the payments by EGR to OGVC or the alleged bribes to Petrobras employees. 
The statute of limitations for paying or receiving bribes in Brazil depends on the severity of the crime, but can be up to 20 years and is commonly greater than 15 years, according to the nation’s federal legal code.
In one court filing that police submitted in February to the federal judge overseeing the probe, investigators attached an invoice from OGVC, which was addressed to EGR, a Miami-area consultancy. The invoice shows OGVC, based in the British Virgin Islands, receiving roughly $64,000 in July 2011 from EGR for facilitating the 305,000-barrel transaction between JPMorgan and Petrobras. The invoice describes the services rendered as: “Oil products sell to JPMorgan VEC.”
In court documents filed over the course of 2021, Brazil's federal police described EGR as part of a complex web of intermediaries that helped funnel bribe payments to Petrobras employees from fuel purchasers including JPMorgan over the course of 2011. 
In those documents, police allege EGR passed some of those payments to OGVC. Police believe OGVC then took a cut of those payments, while passing part of the payments along to Petrobras traders, the documents show. 
A lawyer for OGVC, Rafael de Piro, denied that the company ever had any dealings with JPMorgan. 
A representative for EGR did not respond to multiple text messages and an email sent by Reuters. The representative had previously declined to comment on the matter when asked about authorities' allegations regarding the company’s conduct in September.
Police alleged in the court documents, which include witness testimony and dozens of pages of correspondence over 18 months in 2011 and 2012 between alleged co-conspirators, that OGVC passed part of that payment to Petrobras employees who helped facilitate the allegedly illegal deal. It is not clear if OGVC allegedly made those payments to Petrobras traders directly or via additional intermediaries.
Reuters has reviewed three additional invoices from OGVC's account at Swiss private bank Landolt & Cie, showing that the firm received three additional payments from EGR for facilitating fuel purchases by JPMorgan over the course of 2011.
The Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) shared the invoices with Reuters as part of a trove of documents it provided, after the news agency asked the ICIJ if it held any documents relating to OGVC’s Landolt account in Switzerland. The first invoice was dated June 8, 2011. The last was dated Sept. 14 that year. 
Swiss authorities have turned over the documents seen by Reuters to Brazilian investigators, according to the two federal law enforcement officials in Brazil. Brazil's federal police did not respond to a request for comment.
The Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland confirmed by email that it handed over documents pertaining to OGVC to law enforcement officials in Brazil, but declined to comment on the content of those documents.
JPMorgan declined to comment on the specific deals. Petrobras declined to comment on the deals, but said that alleged criminals in its trading unit had taken elaborate steps to disguise wrongdoing, making it difficult for the firm to weed them out without the help of law enforcement. 
“It’s important to highlight that the authorities investigating the case have shown that the criminal organization responsible for the illicit acts in question used methods that kept them from being detected. These methods could only be brought to light with investigative resources that only the authorities possess,” the company wrote in an e-mail.

De Piro, OGVC’s lawyer, did not comment on the content of the invoices. 
Financial services company ODDO BHF, which earlier this year purchased Landolt & Cie - the bank where the records seen by Reuters were kept - did not respond to a request for comment.

1152,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 05:54AM ET</span>","Automakers to Battle Chip Crisis for Years, Consultancy Says","(Bloomberg) -- Carmakers like Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). should brace for the global semiconductor shortage to last beyond next year and redesign cars so they need fewer of the high-tech components, consultancy Roland Berger said.
Severe bottlenecks will persist through 2022, analysts at the Munich-based firm said, in a departure from many automakers hoping that the crisis would ease in the second half of next year. Capacity will remain constrained in the long term as chipmakers aren’t investing in additional supply to make the older semiconductors typically used in today’s models. 
Manufacturers should put even more effort into monitoring the chip industry to keep up with looming production snarls, the analysts said in a report.
“Most importantly, carmakers need to speed up the transition to centralized electronic architectures and thereby move to advanced and leading-edge nodes,” they said. 
Since late last year, the chip shortage hasn’t let up, prompting vehicle production to plummet even below levels of last year when the pandemic kept buyers away from showrooms. After a third-quarter low in supplies, manufacturers including VW and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) have said they expect the situation to ease over coming months while others like Stellantis NV are digging in for longer disruptions. 
A shift to a central design with one onboard computer controlling a range of functions could drastically cut the number of chips needed in a vehicle, Roland Berger said. Swapping out older platforms for new ones would also mean cars contain the latest generations of chips for which production capacity is increasing. 
Current models typically have a decentralized system with separate semiconductors controlling individual functions. Vehicles on average contain 1,400 of the high-tech components. 
The crisis around the components could indicate more trouble ahead, according to AlixPartners, a consultancy that has put the cost of the crunch for the industry at $210 billion in lost sales this year. Resins, metals and rubber shortages are starting to take hold along with tight labor markets in some regions, Alexandre Marian, a managing director at AlixPartners in Paris said during an event this week. 
“The supply of semiconductors should improve by the middle of next year,” Marian said. “But it’s the tree that’s hiding the forest and we’ll see other shortages emerging.”

1153,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 05:47AM ET</span>","Exclusive: China audits Evergrande, chairman's assets, no fire sale for now -sources","BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese authorities are scrutinising the assets of China Evergrande Group and its wealthy chairman Hui Ka Yan but expect no fire sale for now at the world's most indebted property developer, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. 
The audit, previously unreported, highlights how Beijing is taking charge at Evergrande after the real estate giant missed payments on two overseas bonds, triggering a restructuring to address Evergrande's more than $300 billion in liabilities.
Assessing the value of the assets, and determining if there are any hidden ones, will also allow the authorities to decide whether a bailout involving state-owned entities is necessary, the sources said.
The fate of Evergrande and other indebted Chinese property companies has gripped financial markets in recent months amid fears of knock-on effects around the world.
Beijing has repeatedly sought to reassure investors, but it has not yet indicated how it plans to stabilise Evergrande in particular, which last week was deemed to be in ""restricted default"" by Fitch Ratings after it missed coupon payments worth $82.5 million.
Representatives from state-owned entities are now steering a newly set-up risk management committee at Evergrande and the authorities' previous findings show Evergrande's liquidity crunch is more complicated than expected, one of the sources said.
""Currently, there's no rush to introduce any disposal plans,"" said a source close to the regulators, referring to possible divestment of businesses, ranging from a property management unit to an electric vehicle manufacturing arm.
Evergrande declined to comment, while Hui and the Guangdong provincial government could not be reached for comment.
Hui, 63, who is the property developer's founder and currently holds around a 60% stake, has been freeing up funds by selling luxury assets including three high-end homes, art and calligraphy.
Forbes magazine in September estimated Hui had earned $8 billion in cash dividends since Evergrande's market debut in 2009, although the current value of his personal fortune is not known.
ASSET SALES
Evergrande's missed payments on some of its offshore bonds threaten to trigger cross-default on its roughly $19 billion of international bonds.
Evergrande has yet to make any comment on the missed payments, but it has said it plans to forge ahead with a restructuring of its offshore debt, which will be the biggest in China.
The second source said even if local governments were to step in, they would only buy part of Evergrande's assets. The authorities will not allow Evergrande to default on its loans intentionally, the source added.

Beijing has prodded government-owned firms and state-backed property developers to purchase some of Evergrande's assets, Reuters previously reported. 
China's Central Economic Work Conference said last week enterprises must make self-rescue provisions, while regulators and local governments should draw up plans to manage and mitigate financial risks.

The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio of property loans at Chinese banks may rise to 5.5% by the year-end from 2.5% in mid-2021 and 2% at the end of 2020, S&P said in a research note on Wednesday.
The stresses in the property sector, in which about one-third of developers are estimated to be in financial trouble, will also contribute about 20 basis points to the overall 1.75% NPL ratio for 2021, S&P said, potentially diluting the profitability of lenders.
Banks with aggressive risk appetites or high geographic concentration could be left with thinner collateral buffers, and thus likely to experience greater strain, S&P said. 
China's banking and insurance regulator has repeatedly warned of lingering pressure on banks from non-performing assets, with an outstanding non-performing loans in the banking sector at 3.6 trillion yuan by end of September.

Some lenders have recently adjusted their lending practices to reflect the latest central bank guidance of ""meeting the normal financing needs"" of the sector while the authorities have yet to publicly give any signal that they will relax the ""three red lines"" - financial requirements introduced by the central bank last year that developers must meet to get new bank loans.
""The key policy direction remains unchanged,"" said S&P, which expected nil growth in property development loans in 2022 and modest growth over 2023 and 2024.

Investing.com -- H&M (ST:HMb) stock fell 2.9% on Wednesday as the market gave a cool reaction to the Swedish fast fashion giant's sales figures for the three months through November.
The company said sales in local currencies rose 11% from a year earlier to be back at their pre-pandemic level, despite sporadic store closures due to the pandemic. That's a slowdown from sales growth of 14% in the third quarter. 
The company said 115 of its stores were closed at the end of the quarter, mainly in Austria and Slovakia where governments have recently enacted fresh restrictions to stop the winter wave of Covid-19 infections. At the start of the quarter, it had had 100 stores closed, mainly in southeast Asia. 
At the height of the pandemic, over 1,800 of H&M's stores had been closed due to public health measures, causing a sharp contraction in sales at a group that has always been heavily dependent on its network of physical stores, which accounted for two-thirds of total sales in the first nine months of the year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The head of Japanese beverage group Suntory Holdings said a quick deployment of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots will be key if the country's service sector is to continue to recover from the impact of the pandemic.
Sales at Suntory, which makes Premium Malts beer and the Yamazaki brand whisky, have rebounded to about 70% to 80% of pre-pandemic levels as consumers gained more confidence to go out to eat and drink, said Suntory CEO Takeshi Niinami.
""The sooner we get booster shots out and the chances of breakthrough infections and serious cases go down, then pent-up demand will come out in earnest,"" he told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.
Japan has made a slow start to its booster programme. It initially stipulated an eight-month window before booster shots can be given but municipalities have been given some leeway to shorten that time period if they have sufficient supplies. 
Asked about Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's urging of companies to raise wages by 3% or more at their labour talks next spring, Niinami said he wanted to consider raising wages at Suntory but wasn't thinking of a particular percentage.
""We would like to raise wages because our business performance is better than last year,"" he said. ""Motivation is important.""
But Niinami, who was an advisor to previous Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, also said that demand remained depressed and noted that the yen has weakened and supply chain problems are causing operating costs to rise.

The recovery needs to start from the demand side, he said, adding that if some 20 trillion yen ($175 billion) in pent-up demand were to ripple through the economy, it would make wage increases easier to realise.

Investing.com –  Inditex  (MC:ITX) stock fell 3.6% on Wednesday, pushing the Zara owner to the bottom of the Euro Stoxx 50 index, after the company's latest figures failed to dispel fears of a fresh hit to sales from the pandemic.
The company is still dependent on its physical stores for revenue, and expects online channels to account for only 25% of total revenue in the current fiscal year. 
Zara said revenue was up 10% from pre-pandemic levels, both in the three months through October and in the subsequent six weeks. 
The company added that revenue, EBITDA and net profit all hit record highs in the third quarter, as the reopening of its stores around North America and Europe unblocked a key sales channel in its biggest markets. However, over the first nine months of the year, profit is still lagging the 2.7 billion euro ($3.0 billion) reported in the same period in 2019, although it was more than triple last year's figure.
Anxiety over top level changes at the fashion brand has weighed on the stock in recent days. Founder Amancio Ortega will pass the chairman's baton to his daughter Marta in April. Óscar García Maceiras, general counsel and secretary of the Board, will take over as CEO with effect from 29th of this month.
Gross margins in the nine-month period were 59% and the company expects to close the year with 57.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. One basis point is one hundredth of a percent.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A group of offshore bondholders of Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd have agreed to amass up to $1 billion in order to buy bad loans from the Chinese developer's onshore creditors, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Kaisa, which has offshore debt of $12 billion, did not repay $400 million of bonds that matured last week, triggering cross-default provision on all its offshore bonds and prompting a downgrade to ""restricted default"" by Fitch Ratings.
The company is China's largest issuer of offshore debt among property developers after China Evergrande Group, which has more than $300 billion in liabilities including both onshore and offshore debt.
The fate of Kaisa, Evergrande and other indebted Chinese property companies has gripped financial markets in recent months amid fears of knock-on effects, with Beijing repeatedly seeking to reassure investors.
Owning onshore debt, which is usually more senior than offshore debt, giving holders stronger influence with the company in any restructuring talks, would help Kaisa's offshore bondholders better understand its finances, the people said, declining to be identified because the talks were confidential.
Kaisa is working to restructure its offshore debt after the cross-default, a source has told Reuters.
The bondholder group, which has an aggregated $5.5 billion of Kaisa's total offshore notes, had last month proposed other options including $2 billion in fresh debt to the developer, but the talks have not yielded material results.
The acquisition of Kaisa's non-performing loans will also help the recovery of offshore bondholders because it would prevent current onshore creditors from liquidating assets, the people with knowledge of the matter said. 
Representatives of the bondholder group declined to comment.
Kaisa did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Kaisa was last week expected to soon sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with Lazard (NYSE:LAZ), the adviser of a group of offshore bondholders, laying the groundwork for further discussions on forbearance and financing solutions.
But the NDA has yet to be signed as of Wednesday and some of the ""core noteholders"" in the bondholder group sent a letter to Kaisa's chairman and some of its board directors on Tuesday, urging them to expedite this, the sources said.

Cineworld, the owner of the Regal chain of movie theaters in the U.S., said it would appeal the decision and that it did not expect the damages to be payable while appeal proceedings were ongoing.

A fortnight ago, Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell offered a glimpse of what was to come at the December Fed meeting by suggesting a tapering of asset purchases would be speeded up. Now it's time for Powell to reveal his full hand.
With inflation running at almost four-decade highs, the Fed is expected to end its two-day meeting on Wednesday by accelerating its taper of asset purchases from the current $15 billion monthly pace. Some reckon that pace will be doubled.
That would mean the taper could possibly end earlier, which in turn would mean interest rates start rising sooner than anticipated.
The spotlight falls now on the Fed's 'dot plot' of where policymakers see rates headed.
A minimum of two hikes in the dots for next year seems a given. Anything more than that would be considered a hawkish surprise, and would possibly upend the calm in world markets, just before Thursday's central bank meetings in the euro area, Britain, Switzerland and Turkey.
For the Bank of England at least, the dilemma is heating up -- money market have virtually priced out a rate hike this week after the Omicron outbreak, yet Tuesday's jobs data and inflation figures just out will make for uncomfortable reading for the bank, with the November price print at a 10-year high of 5.1%.
The Fed's policy statement and updated economic projections are out at 1900 GMT, followed by a news conference 30 minutes later. With that on the horizon, stock markets are virtually flat. European and U.S. equity futures are little moved, while the dollar is holding firm.
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields are at 1.43%, well below a recent 1.693% top. The yield curve continued its flattening trend, as investors wager an earlier start to Fed tightening will lead to slower inflation in the long run.

The checks followed a local newspaper report on Monday that the two outlets in Wuxi had used expired ingredients in their drinks.
Starbucks issued a statement after the report apologising for the violations and saying it would conduct inspections and staff training at its more than 5,000 stores across China. 
On Tuesday, the Suzhou market supervision bureau said on its official WeChat account that it had inspected the city's 226 Starbucks outlets and found issues at 18 of them, including irregular sales and purchase records, uncovered trash bins and employees working without masks.
City authorities also carried out urgent checks on Starbucks outlets in Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Wuxi, Hefei and Yinchuan, according to local media reports published on Wednesday.
The Shanghai and Hefei regulators said they had not found any problems. The others either did not indicate the results of the inspections or did not find any food safety-related issues. 
A Starbucks spokesperson referred Reuters to the company's Monday statement when asked about the inspections.

Chinese consumers and media have become more aggressive about protecting customer rights and monitoring the behaviour of big brands, especially from overseas. 
China is the largest market for Starbucks outside the United States, with 5,360 stores as of Oct. 3, the firm's latest earnings report showed.

1169,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 02:10AM ET</span>",Company climate disclosures jump in 2021 as board pressure builds,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - The number of companies sharing climate data with CDP, the world's leading disclosure platform, jumped by nearly 40% over the last year as investors and policymakers pressured boards, data seen by Reuters showed.
Most of the world's asset managers focus on climate change disclosures in their efforts to pick the winners of the transition to a low-carbon economy and to assess the risks for their portfolios. 
While some countries have begun to make such disclosures mandatory, the standardised data required by the non-profit CDP platform has long provided investors with data that allows them to compare corporate performance.
Since the Paris Agreement of 2015, when countries agreed to try to limit global warming, the number of companies filing to CDP has more than doubled to 13,132 from 5,532. The CDP was founded in 2000.
""If you look at those numbers, you see this rate of change increase, and I think that's really important. Each year is a much bigger leap than we expected from the previous year,"" Nicolette Bartlett, executive director at CDP, said. (Graphic: Number of corporate climate disclosers , https://graphics.reuters.com/CLIMATE-CHANGE/lgpdwojwxvo/chart.png) 
The pace of disclosures has also risen consistently, bar a COVID-19 induced slow-down last year. In 2020-2021, it grew by 38%.
Despite the increase in companies reporting to CDP, the quality of disclosures remains patchy and nearly 17,000 companies received the lowest possible 'F' grade in the NGO's annual assessment for not reporting any data.
After disclosing data, companies are encouraged to set targets to reduce emissions, and specifically targets in line with the science of climate change and the goal to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial average.
Yet just 1,054 companies have had their targets signed off by the Science-based Targets Initiative, a collaboration between CDP and other NGOs, and less than a thousand of the CDP disclosers report the emissions tied to the goods and services they buy and the use of their sold products.
""We're clear that for the companies coming into our system, disclosure is the first step of the journey and measurement obviously means that you end up managing and, ultimately, hopefully transforming your business model,"" Bartlett said.
The drivers of disclosure continue to be investors and companies pushing their suppliers to act, with further impetus coming from fresh pledges to rein in emissions at U.N. climate talks in Scotland last month.
A regional breakdown, shows the biggest jump in disclosures since Paris was from Latin America, up 332% to 1,614 from 374. Asia climated 201% to 3,774 from 1,256 and Europe, increased 140% to 4,187 from 1,745.
By country, China stood out with a 416% rise in disclosures to 1,408 from 273.

While the number of corporate disclosers jumped, a breakdown by sector shows some of the heaviest-emitting lagged in sharing data. (Graphic: Increase in corporate climate change disclosers by region, https://graphics.reuters.com/CLIMATE-CHANGE/gkplglqrqvb/chart.png) 
Just 11 coal mining companies and 63 oil and gas producers globally reported data, despite fossil fuels being the chief driver of human-driven emissions.

1170,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 01:58AM ET</span>",European Stocks Edge Lower; Caution Ahead of Fed Announcement,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open cautiously Wednesday ahead of the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy decision, with U.K. markets seen underperforming amid political turmoil. 
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 1.2%.
Central banks are front and center in terms of investors’ focus this week, with the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank all holding gatherings to discuss future policy decisions.
The Fed leads the way, announcing its decisions at 2 PM ET (1900 GMT), with Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference starting half an hour later. He's expected to announce an accelerated end to the Fed's bond-buying program, taking a step toward interest-rate increases to bring down consumer prices that are rising at the fastest rate in almost 40 years. 
Returning to Europe, U.K. equity markets are expected to underperform, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson suffered a severe blow to his authority that raised more questions about his leadership.  Almost 100 of his party's lawmakers voted against new coronavirus restrictions, in a vote late on Tuesday.
Additionally, U.K. consumer prices soared 5.1% on the year in November, a new 10-year high and more than double the Bank of England’s target, according to data released Wednesday.
The U.K. central bank is expected to keep its rates on hold on Thursday despite this rise in inflation, as it reacts with caution to the spread of Omicron-variant Covid-19 in the country.
Data released earlier Wednesday showed that China's industrial production grew faster than expected in November, but growth in retail sales slowed as fresh Covid-19 outbreaks led to tighter restrictive measures in the country.
In corporate news, Generali (MI:GASI) will be in the spotlight after the Italian insurer announced plans to return up to 6.1 billion euros ($7 billion) in dividends and buybacks to shareholders.
Earnings from clothing giants  Inditex  (MC:ITX) and H & M  Hennes & Mauritz  (ST:HMb) will also be studied Wednesday. Zara owner Inditex's profits more than tripled in the period as its stores reopened across the world.
Oil prices fell Wednesday, for the third day in a row, on concerns the Omicron-driven rise in coronavirus cases will see demand growth slip below rises in supply next year. 
The International Energy Agency said on Tuesday a surge in Covid-19 cases will dent global demand for oil at the same time that crude output is set to increase, especially in the United States.
Adding to the bearish tone, data from the industry body, American Petroleum Institute, showed that U.S. crude inventories fell by 815,000 barrels last week, a smaller decline than expected, if corroborated by U.S. Energy Information Administration later Wednesday.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% lower at $69.64 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.3% to $72.77. Both contracts have fallen more than 3% this week.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,767.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1273.

1171,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 01:07AM ET</span>",Pfizer set to oust AstraZeneca as top supplier of COVID-19 shots to poor nations,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNtech are set to displace AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) as the main suppliers of COVID-19 vaccines to the global COVAX programme at the start of 2022, a shift that shows the increasing importance of their shot for poorer states.
The expected change comes with headaches for receiving countries that lack sufficient cold storage capacity to handle the Pfizer vaccine, and amid risks of a shortage of syringes needed to administer that shot.
AstraZeneca is currently the most distributed vaccine by COVAX, according to data from Gavi, the vaccine alliance that co-manages the programme with the World Health Organization (WHO).
The programme has so far delivered more than 600 million shots to nearly 150 countries, of which more than 220 million are AstraZeneca's and about 160 million Pfizer's.
But in the first quarter of next year Pfizer is set to take over, according to Gavi and WHO figures on doses assigned by the COVAX programme for future supplies.
By the end of March, another 150 million Pfizer doses are to be distributed by COVAX, a WHO document shows.
A spokesperson for Gavi confirmed that Pfizer is far ahead in terms of ""allocated"" jabs, with about 470 million doses delivered or readied for delivery, against 350 million from AstraZeneca.
Pfizer is the first provider of COVID-19 vaccines to the European Union, the United States and Japan. 
It has bilateral agreements for more than 6 billion doses, making it by far the largest supplier of COVID-19 vaccines, according to data from UNICEF, a U.N. agency.
But AstraZeneca has been seen as a crucial supplier to less developed countries, because its shot is cheaper and easier to deliver.
COVAX bet heavily on AstraZeneca at the beginning of the pandemic, but supply problems and export restrictions from top producer India gradually reduced its reliance on the Anglo-Swedish shot.
As the programme faced problems in securing doses directly from vaccine makers amid a global scramble for shots, donations from rich nations became more important, turning Pfizer into the main supplier to COVAX. The United States is donating mostly Pfizer shots to the programme.
COLD CHAIN AND SYRINGES
The change forced Gavi to rush to invest more in cold chain capacity in receiving countries that do not have enough refrigerators and cold transport equipment to handle the Pfizer shot, which requires lower storage temperatures than the AstraZeneca vaccine.
The organization warned about insufficient cold chain capacity in some countries, according to an internal report submitted to Gavi's board at the beginning of December and seen by Reuters.
The problem is compounded by a risk of shortages of special syringes needed to administer the Pfizer vaccine, Gavi warned in the document.
The Pfizer jab is ""the hardest to deliver given ultra-cold chain and special syringe requirements"", Gavi says in its internal document.
It is also ""the hardest to plan for as these (donated vaccines) often come with earmarking and little notice or in a staggered manner and in small volumes and with short shelf lives"", the document says.
Wealthy countries donating COVID-19 vaccines with a relatively short shelf life has been a ""major problem"" for COVAX, a WHO official said last week, as many doses were wasted.
An EU official told a news briefing last week that EU donations of Pfizer vaccines to COVAX were slowed by a lack of syringes. A second official familiar with the issue told Reuters that Gavi had to postpone the delivery of some Pfizer doses from Europe because of the lack of syringes.
Pfizer declined to comment on syringes because it said it does not produce or buy them directly.

As more doses are made available to poorer nations, UNICEF and the WHO have long been warning of the insufficient supply of the auto-disable syringes, which are crucial for inoculations in poorer nations.
Auto-disable syringes lock automatically to prevent re-use, which is otherwise common in poorer nations and could spread of diseases. To make things more complicated, auto-disable syringes needed for the Pfizer vaccine are different from standard syringes, UNICEF said.

1172,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 12:16AM ET</span>",Safe travels: Hilton CEO Nassetta on managing through crisis,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The COVID-19 crisis affected virtually every industry on Earth, but perhaps none quite so much as travel and hospitality.
With everyone fearful and taking shelter at home, leaders had to strategize about surviving to the next day. Among them: Chris Nassetta, president and chief executive of hotel giant Hilton. 
Nassetta spoke to Reuters about the ways C-suite executives cope with such existential threats – and come out on the other side.
Q: Few industries turned upside-down as much as yours, so what did you learn about getting through this moment of history?
A: It reinforced what we knew from living through other crises, like 9/11 and the Great Recession. Over time, we developed a playbook about how to deal with crisis, and this year probably added a few new chapters.
The basics of the playbook are essentially the same. I call them the Three Ps: The first is to protect people, since we have hundreds of thousands of team members and almost 200 million customers. 
The second is to protect the core business, to make sure we have the staying power to get through anything. 
And the third is preparing for recovery, because what goes down comes back up. The deeper the crisis, the larger the opportunity.
Q: As a leader, people look to you for direction – how do you handle that when you do not really know what is ahead?
A: When there are significant unknowns, what people want to have confidence in is that you have a plan to address it. Create visibility into your plan by communicating constantly; break your plan into parts, so people can see progress; and then celebrate the successes you are having with the plan.
If you do that, then people will believe the sun will come up tomorrow. That’s the job of a leader, in good times and bad: to paint a picture for people in the organization and to inspire and motivate them to be a part of something bigger than themselves.
Q: Did this era cause you to rethink any ways of doing business?
A: Yes and no. If you woke up in a year or two, while there will be some changes, I think more will look the same than different. My philosophical view is to be a steady hand at the wheel.
But on a micro level, it is an opportunity to change a bunch of things. Issues like contactless entry, or controlling the environment in your room from your own device, or how we deliver the basics like housekeeping or food and beverage. 
It’s an opportunity to take a step back, and ask: ""What is it customers want - and what might we be able to do differently?""
Q: The labor equation is changing rapidly with the Great Resignation. How are you coping?
A: That’s probably the biggest challenge we have had. It is easing a bit, but this is going to take some time. 
For six years running we have been named a ""World’s Best Workplace,"" so we have been focused for a long time on building an incredible culture. In today’s world we are also paying more, and continuing to look at benefits, and accessing different pools of labor like temporary workers who want gigs for more limited periods of time.
Q: You mentioned crisis as containing opportunity. What opportunities do you see ahead for the industry?
A: People have long been shifting how they spend their disposable income, away from things and more towards experiences. That has been going on for the last 10 or 20 years.
Now people are realizing, after being locked in their basements for so long, that life is very short. They want to get out and travel, see the world, meet family and friends and loved ones -- and experience cultures. 
It’s the human condition to want to interact with people, and once we are fully through COVID, that is going to propel us forward.
Q: What advice do you have to survive dark times?

A: Before COVID, this was one of the fastest-growing industries on Earth, and I’m confident that when we get to the other side, we are going to pick up where we left off.
It's a dynamic business, and there are a lot of opportunities for young people to move up. Look at me: I started out plunging toilets at a Holiday Inn in Washington, D.C., and now I’m running one of the biggest companies on Earth.

1173,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 11:36PM ET</span>","Uber looking to sell Didi, China market has little transparency, CEO says","By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc is looking to sell stakes in non-strategic assets including its holding in Beijing-based Didi Global Inc, its CEO said on Tuesday, who also described the China market as a tough one with little transparency. 
The U.S. firm pulled out of China in 2016 after burning through more than a billion dollars a year due to a price war with Didi. It eventually sold its China operations to Didi in exchange for a stake.
Uber owns 12.8% of Didi, according to a filing in June by Didi.
""Our Didi stake we don't believe is strategic. They're a competitor, China is a pretty difficult environment with very little transparency,"" Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said at a virtual fireside chat with a UBS analyst.
Khosrowshahi said the company was in no rush to sell the shares. ""Those kinds of stakes we look to monetize smartly over time.""
He said many of the companies in which Uber has a stake have recently gone public and are still subject to a lockup period - when investors at the time of listing cannot sell stock - adding Uber would continue to hold some stakes for strategic reasons.
Didi did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.
Uber shares rose 4.3% to close at $37.26 after Khosrowshahi's remarks on Tuesday. He also said Uber last week had its best week ever in terms of company-wide gross bookings at its ride-hail and food delivery operations.
But overall, ride-hail trips remained around 10% below pre-pandemic levels, the CEO said.
Uber had roughly $13.1 billion tied up in investments in other companies as of the end of the third quarter, including $4.1 billion in Didi. 
Some investors have grown concerned that Uber holding on to these investments sends a signal to the market that stakes in other companies are more attractive than putting freed-up capital into Uber's own operations.
Uber's operational business last quarter for the first time achieved profitability on an adjusted earnings basis, but its Didi stake drove a $2.4 billion net loss in the third quarter.
Shares of Didi, which has been rattled by a probe by Chinese regulators into its data practices, are down around 53% from their June 30 initial public offering price.

Under pressure from Chinese regulators, Didi earlier this month said it would withdraw from the U.S. stock exchange and pursue a Hong Kong listing.
Uber also holds stakes in Indian food delivery company Zomato Ltd, Southeast Asian rival Grab Holdings Ltd, self-driving company Aurora Innovation Inc and others. Grab and Aurora are also backed by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp was hit with a so-called ""first strike"" vote against executive pay plans at its annual general meeting and Chairman John McFarlane apologised ""unreservedly"" for a sharp decline in its share price.
McFarlane, nicknamed ""Mack the knife"" in Britain for removing CEOs during his chairmanship at  Aviva  (LON:AV) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC), also said Westpac would begin making succession plans for its chief executive.
Close to 30% of shareholders voted against the bank's pay plans. Under Australian company law, another vote of more than 25% next year would trigger a vote on whether to fire the entire board.
""The protest vote is perfectly respectable and it relates to the fall of the share price,"" McFarlane said.
Westpac shares have tumbled some 20% since Nov. 1 when it reported big drops in margins and high expenses that triggered cuts to earnings forecasts by analysts. 
The price slide also forced the lender to offer more attractive terms than planned for a A$3.5 billion share buyback.
""Overall, the result was disappointing, leading to a drop in our market value for which I apologise unreservedly on behalf of the board,"" McFarlane said, adding that the bank was making efforts to reduce costs materially.
Westpac's performance has led to speculation in domestic media that Chief Executive Peter King, formerly the bank's CFO before taking the helm in April 2020, might not last much longer in his job.
Responding to a question from a shareholder, McFarlane said Westpac would begin making CEO succession plans, but added King had only been recently appointed and the planning was ""probably a little premature"". 
""We were going to consider it this calendar year, but we decided it wasn't the time and definitely something will begin next year,"" he said. 

Westpac has become the smallest of Australia's Big Four lenders by market value, losing its long-held No.2 ranking, also hit by declines in market share. 
""This hurts okay,"" McFarlane said. ""It's not the right position for Westpac. Traditionally with our business mix, we've always expected Westpac to sit around the number two position. And so it is true that in a number of ways the company hasn't been performing.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Wednesday morning, with investors on tenterhooks as they await the latest U.S. Federal Reserve policy decision.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.01% by 9:14 PM ET (2:14 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component inched down 0.02%. Chinese data released earlier in the day showed that industrial production grew 3.8% year-on-year, while fixed asset investment grew 5.2% year-on-year, in November. Retail sales grew 3.9% year-on-year.
With authorities signaling upcoming support for the economy in 2022, all eyes are now on the People’s Bank of China’s loan operations for clues about the broader policy stance.
U.S.-China tensions are also up, with the U.S. considering tougher sanctions on Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SS:688981), China’s largest chipmaker.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.19%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched down 0.02% and South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.21%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.63%.
The Fed hands down its policy decision later in the day, where it is expected to quicken the pace of asset tapering and open the door to potential interest rate hikes in 2022.
""At its heart, there is an implied assumption that all the Fed has to do is tap the fed funds brake a mere 150bps, and the economy will slow sufficiently to break the inflation cycle. Yet we have never had a cycle peak where real rates have not been above zero, which means the market's expected terminal rate is too low and possibly far too low,""  Deutsche Bank macro strategist Alan Ruskin told Reuters.
The European Central Bank and the Bank of England hand down their policy decisions on Thursday, followed by the Bank of Japan a day later.
Concerns about the omicron COVID-19 variant are also rising, with the global death toll topping 5 million, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
High inflation also remains a concern, with the flattening in the U.S. Treasury yield curve in 2021 indicative of a challenging economic period up ahead for some investors.
“We expect the markets to be volatile primarily because of the back and forth on the COVID-19 news” and “worries again about inflation,” RiverFront Investment Group senior market strategist Rebecca Felton told Bloomberg.
“High valuations and uneven data are probably what we are going to see for the next couple of months.”
On the data front, Tuesday’s data showed that the producer price index (PPI) grew 0.8% month-on-month and a record 9.2% year-on-year in November. The core PPI grew 0.7% month-on-month and 7.7% year-on-year."

TOKYO (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp on Tuesday committed 8 trillion yen ($70 billion) to electrify its automobiles by 2030, half of it to develop a battery electric vehicle (BEV) line-up, as it looks to tap a growing market for zero-emission cars.
But the world's biggest carmaker, which is a relative latecomer to full electric cars, said it expected annual BEVs sales to reach only 3.5 million vehicles by the end of the decade, or around a third of its current vehicle sales. 
That is less than bigger rivals such as Europe's No. 1 carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), which in July predicted that half of its global vehicle sales will be battery-powered cars by that date.
Even so, shares in Toyota and group companies Toyota Tsusho and Denso rallied on Wednesday, leading gains on the benchmark Nikkei 225 index. Toyota advanced 4.06% while Toyota Tsusho and Denso jumped 4.81% and 4.44%, respectively.
Toyota's announcement comes as traditional automobile firms increasingly take on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, which has become the most valuable carmaker this year. Tesla's market value reached over $1 trillion in October, surpassing the combined value of Toyota, VW,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).
Speaking at a press conference in Tokyo surrounded by more than a dozen planned BEV models, Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda said his company was still pursuing a multi-pronged, carbon-reduction strategy that also includes hybrid cars and hydrogen-powered vehicles.
""We want to leave all people with a choice, and rather than where or what we will focus on, we will wait a little longer until we understand where the market is going,"" Toyoda said. 
His company's plan to introduce a full line-up of 30 BEV's by 2030 goes beyond the 15 models Toyota earlier said it would have available by 2025. The Japanese carmaker on Tuesday also said it planned to invest 2 trillion yen in battery production by 2030, up from the 1.5 trillion yen it announced earlier.
That investment includes $1.29 billion for a new battery plant in North Carolina that will begin production in 2025. 
EVs still only account for a small portion of car sales, but the market is growing rapidly, with new registrations up 41% in 2020 even as the global car market contracted by a sixth that year.
In November, Toyota declined to join a pledge signed by six major carmakers, including GM and Ford to phase out fossil fuel cars by 2040. It argued that not all parts of the world would be ready to transition to green cars by then.

In addition to electrified cars, Toyota is also developing internal combustion engines that run on hydrogen fuel. Toyoda said the technology could help to save some of Japan's 5.5 million auto jobs by allowing the car company to keep supply chains that would disappear with a full shift to electric cars.

1178,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 08:25PM ET</span>",What is short-selling and why does the DoJ care?,"(Reuters) - Short-selling, a bearish investing practice, has become a target of an expansive U.S. Department of Justice criminal investigation. 
The DoJ has issued subpoenas as it examines short-selling by hedge funds and their relationships with research firms that publish negative reports on certain companies, according to three people familiar with the matter.
Short-selling entered the spotlight in 2021 as a deluge of retail investors took to social media to criticize the lack of regulation of short-sellers and the havoc they can wreak on company valuations. They also used social media to urge other investors to buy heavily shorted stocks in a crusade to teach short-sellers a lesson. 
SO WHAT IS SHORT SELLING? 
Investors who 'short' a stock make a bet that the stock's price will fall. They borrow shares to sell immediately and then wait until the price falls before buying the shares back at a lower price. They pocket the difference when they return the shares to the lender.
WHO LENDS OUT SHARES AND WHY DO THEY DO IT?
Borrowed shares can come from brokers' inventories, or from customers that allow brokers to lend their shares. Until the shares are returned, the short seller pays the lender interest. If the price goes up instead of down, then the lender will end up with a more valuable stock. 
WHAT IS SHORT-COVERING?
An investor who has sold borrowed shares must at some point buy back the shares to return them to the lender. The act of buying back shares to cover, or close the trade, is called short-covering.
WHAT IS A SHORT SQUEEZE? 
To make a profit, an investor who has sold shares short must be able to buy them back at a lower price. Occasionally, a jump in the price of shorted shares can force the short seller to buy back shares at a higher price to limit losses. When there is a rush of demand from short sellers looking to exit bets and this pushes rising stock prices even higher, the result is what is known as a short squeeze. 
Some short-sellers, such as Melvin Capital, had to rush to cover GameStop (NYSE:GME) shares they had sold short when in late January the price soared as retail investors piled in. In the GameStop example, the ""short squeeze"" was thought to have exacerbated the stock's gains. [USN]
SHARE PRICE IMPACT OF SHORTING?
It is hard to know how much of a day's trading is the result of short-covering or long-buying - when investors buy a share in the hope its price increases. However, if trading volume in a session far exceeds the number of shares shorted, the price action that day cannot be fully explained by short-covering. 
SHORT-SELLING RISKS
A short-seller could face large losses, as there is no limit to how high a stock price can rise. They would have pay the market price to cover their bet. Another risk for short-sellers is stock availability, as the short-seller must return the same number of shares they borrowed, even if there are fewer on sale.
MIXED REPUTATION 
Some short-sellers have been able to predict price declines by examining company operations and financials for flaws. But they are often criticized when they issue negative reports on stocks they have shorted. 
Quinton Mathews, who published research online under the pseudonym Rota Fortunae, reached a legal settlement in June to pay Farmland (NYSE:FPI) Partners Inc ""a multiple"" of his profits from a bet against its shares after admitting to inaccuracies in an article that helped wipe $115 million off Farmland's market value in 2018.
Long-time short-seller Jim Chanos, at Kynikos Associates, however, was vindicated for shorting now-defunct Enron Corp shares before accounting irregularities started to raise red flags on Wall Street in late 2001.
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT SHORT-SELLING

While long investors file quarterly reports with U.S. regulators disclosing a detailed snapshot of their stock holdings, short-sellers have far less-stringent regulatory oversight. In a review of this year's meme-stock frenzy, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff said ""Improved reporting of short sales would allow regulators to better track these dynamics."" Disclosure reform is now on the agenda at the SEC.

1179,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 06:45PM ET</span>",Former Boeing pilot says FAA official called him 'scapegoat' for crashes,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A former chief technical pilot for Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co charged with fraud for deceiving federal regulators evaluating the company's 737 MAX jet says a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) official called him a ""scapegoat"" for two fatal crashes.
Lawyers for Mark Forkner said the FAA official with personal knowledge of the 737-MAX contacted the government and said Forkner ""is a 'scapegoat' and should 'not be charged.'"" The court filing on Monday did not disclose the official's name.
Boeing did not respond to a request for comment. The FAA did not immediately comment. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Northern Texas, where the case is being heard, declined to comment.
The filing also included parts of a PowerPoint from an unnamed FAA employee that defense lawyers said contain new disclosures about a key system known as MCAS that should have been disclosed by Boeing’s engineering team.
The Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) is a software feature designed to automatically push the airplane’s nose down in certain conditions. It was tied to two crashes of the 737 MAX in Indonesia and Ethiopia over a five-month period in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people and led to the FAA's grounding the plane for 20 months, an action lifted in November 2020.
The filing said Boeing engineers did not disclose key details of MCAS to Forkner or the FAA - including that MCAS could activate when it was not intended after a single faulty sensor.
The PowerPoint said the 737 MAX crashes ""were caused by a failure of the engineering processes"" and argued the focus on training and the Forkner criminal charges ""is not only incorrect and misguided, it is detracting from the real lessons."" 
Excerpts of the presentation made public said it was to address a ""potential miscarriage of justice.""
Lawyers asked a U.S. judge to allow current or former FAA officials permission to talk with Forkner's defense team ahead of a trial set to begin in February. A redacted filing appears to show Forkner's team wants to talk to two current officials and a former FAA employee.
Forkner was indicted in October on six counts of scheming to defraud Boeing's U.S.-based airline customers to obtain tens of millions of dollars for Boeing. His lawyers said they have not been allowed to speak to the PowerPoint author.

According to the indictment, Forkner, largely in the run-up to the FAA's decision to approve the 737 MAX in 2017, provided the FAA Aircraft Evaluation Group with ""materially false, inaccurate, and incomplete information"" about MCAS. He has pleaded not guilty.
In January, Boeing agreed to a $2.5 billion deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department over the MAX crashes, which cost Boeing more than $20 billion.

(Reuters) -Former U.S. President Donald Trump's social media venture said on Tuesday it has entered into a technology and cloud-services agreement with Canadian video platform Rumble Inc.
As part of the agreement, Rumble will deliver video and streaming for TRUTH Social, the proposed social media app from Trump.
Rumble was launched in 2013 by tech entrepreneur Chris Pavlovski as an alternative YouTube-style site, and is popular among U.S. conservatives seeking an alternative to Big Tech. Its top trending videos include those from conservative commentators Dan Bongino and Dinesh D’Souza, as well as former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon. It is backed by venture capitalist Peter Thiel and author-turned-U.S. Senate candidate J.D. Vance through Narya Capital. 
On Dec. 1 Rumble said it would go public by merging with blank-check firm CF Acquisition Corp VI at an initial enterprise value of $2.1 billion. The combined company will be called Rumble and is expected to list on the Nasdaq.
Former Trump administration lawyer Michael Ellis joined Rumble in November as its first-ever general counsel and corporate secretary.
The announcement from Trump Media and Technology Group came hours after Rumble said it had severed business ties https://prn.to/3dNKzaC with Tremor International and Unruly Group, companies which Rumble said had attempted to censor conservative personality Dan Bongino.
TMTG has provided few details for how it plans to create a social media platform, streaming service, news division and alternative cloud provider to compete against entrenched players in those categories. 

The company said on Dec. 6 that U.S. Representative Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, will leave Congress to become chief executive officer of the new venture, and will assume the role in January.
Nunes has been an ardent Trump supporter, voting against certifying Democrat Joe Biden's 2020 election victory following Trump's false claims of election fraud.

1182,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 06:21PM ET</span>","Wall Street ends down, investors eye inflation and Omicron","By Shreyashi Sanyal and Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower on Tuesday after data showed producer prices increased more than expected in November, solidifying expectations the Federal Reserve this week will announce a faster wind-down of asset purchases.
The fast-spreading Omicron coronavirus variant also dampened investor sentiment after the S&P 500 index hit an all-time closing high late last week.
Declines were led by megacap tech-related stocks, with Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc pulling down the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ended down 0.8%, but off its session lows, after the iPhone maker said it would require customers and employees to wear masks at its U.S. retail stores as COVID-19 cases surge.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% to end at 35,544.18 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.75% to 4,634.09. 
The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.14% to 15,237.64.
Data from the Labor Department showed the producer price index (PPI) for final demand in the 12 months through November shot up 9.6%, clocking its largest gain since November 2010. That followed an 8.8% increase in October.
About two-thirds of Nasdaq stocks traded below their 200-day moving average, according to Refinitiv data, suggesting many stocks within the index are struggling, even as the overall index remains only about 6% below its November record high close.
""COVID plus inflation is the Grinch that stole Christmas,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer at Longbow Asset Management. ""I don’t underestimate the fact that there are some big Nasdaq names giving up some of their big gains. When the leaders sell off, it's not a good sign.""
Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 sector indexes fell, with tech putting on the worst performance, down 1.6%. Financials gained 0.6% as investors bet on a hawkish tone from the Fed at the end of its two-day meeting on Wednesday.
Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) both gained more than 1% and helped keep the S&P 500 from falling further.
Many investors expect the U.S. central bank to signal a faster wind-down of asset purchases, and thus, a quicker start to interest rate hikes in order to contain the rapid rise in prices.
""I would say this meeting is when we start to get some clarity on how they're (the Fed) going to address this idea of inflation that has remained elevated and most likely will remain an issue going into next year,"" said David Keller, chief market strategist at StockCharts.com.
A Reuters poll of economists sees the central bank hiking interest rates from near zero to 0.25%-0.50% in the third quarter of next year, followed by another in the fourth quarter.
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc rallied 9.3% after Piper Sandler upgraded the plant-based meat maker's stock to ""neutral"" from ""underweight.""
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) gained 0.6% after saying its antiviral COVID-19 pill showed near 90% efficacy in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients, and that lab data suggests the drug retains its effectiveness against the Omicron variant.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.70-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.59-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 18 new highs and 408 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.8 billion shares, compared with the 11.5 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

(Reuters) - Shares of AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) closed higher on Tuesday after a sharp decline this month helped short sellers gain more than $1 billion on their bearish bets against the stock.
The theater chain's shares closed up 5.4% at $24.50 after falling as much as 10.5% to a new seven-month low earlier in the session. Shares of video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME), which have also tumbled in recent days, were up about 7.9% at $147.69.
Both companies were at the heart of a meme stock phenomenon earlier this year, when individual investors coordinating on online message boards helped fuel stunning rallies that cost short sellers billions of dollars.
More recently, those stocks have tumbled, with AMC down around 28% in the month-to-date and GameStop off nearly 25%.
Short-sellers have gained $1.1 billion on their bets against AMC since the beginning of December, data from analytics firm Ortex showed on Tuesday morning, nearly halving their year-to-date losses.
GameStop short-sellers have made $330 million since the start of the month but are still down a net $11.78 billion year to date, Ortex data showed. AMC and GameStop are up around 1,000% and 600% year-to-date, respectively.
The estimated short interest at AMC increased to 19% of its free float from 16% at the end of November, per Ortex data. GameStop short interest has shot up to 14% from 11% in the same period.
The losses in the two stocks come as some investors have grown more cautious over some comparatively risky assets amid worries over a new wave of COVID-19 and a more hawkish Federal Reserve.
After several years of strong stock market returns, some investors are ""getting a little worried about 2022 and thinking we're not going to have as great a year,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. 
(GRAPHIC: Retail favorites drop in December - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lbpgnlyrnvq/retail%20favs.PNG) 
GameStop posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss last week, while top executives at AMC reported large stake sales, shaking some investors' faith in the stocks.
Worries that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus could hit theater attendance may also be weighing on AMC's stock, Stovall said.
Investor interest in the options on the two stocks has also dropped.

The one-month moving average of open options contracts on GameStop is down about 66% from a record high in March, according to Trade Alert data.
Similarly, open contracts on AMC have shrunk about 40% from their late June high.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - All three U.S.-authorized COVID-19 vaccines appear to be significantly less protective against the newly-detected Omicron variant of the coronavirus in laboratory testing, but a booster dose likely restores most of the protection, according to a study released on Tuesday.
The study from researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Harvard and MIT that has not yet been peer reviewed tested blood from people who received the  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines against a pseudovirus engineered to resemble the Omicron variant.
The researchers found ""low to absent"" antibody neutralization of the variant from the regular regimens of all three vaccines - two shots of the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines or one of J&J's single-dose vaccine.
But the blood from recent recipients of an additional booster dose exhibited potent neutralization of the variant, the study found. 
The scientists also suggested that Omicron is more infectious than previous variants of concern, including about twice as transmissible as the currently dominant Delta variant, which may soon be overtaken by Omicron.
The results are in line with other studies recently published. Researchers at the University of Oxford said on Monday that they found the two-dose  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) COVID-19 vaccine regimens do not induce enough neutralizing antibodies against the new variant. 

BioNTech and Pfizer said last week that a three-shot course of their COVID-19 vaccine was able to neutralize the new Omicron variant in a laboratory test, but two doses resulted in significantly lower neutralizing antibodies. 
Moderna and J&J have yet to release any of their own data about how the vaccines perform against the new variant. J&J declined to comment on the new study and Moderna did not respond to request for comment.

The Federal Reserve https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/will-an-inflation-fighting-fed-break-its-vow-jobs-2021-12-14 is expected on Wednesday to announce that it is speeding up the end of its pandemic-era bond purchases and signal a turn to interest rate increases next year as a guard against surging inflation. 
Several central banks meet this week, starting on Tuesday when the Federal Reserve convenes for its two-day event, followed by the European Central Bank on Wednesday, the Bank of England on Thursday, and the Bank of Japan on Friday.
While some investors are sitting on the sidelines, reluctant to take on new positions before year-end, others continue to be happy to ""buy the dip,"" a strategy that has been successful throughout 2021's strong rally, said Benjamin Bowler, equity analyst at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
""Markets can continue to run while they think there is solid ground beneath them, and only when they look down does gravity kick in,"" Bowler wrote in a note Tuesday. ""(They) may convince themselves for some time that a less supportive Fed won't derail the rally.""
Bowler said this market rally, which is largely fueled by the Fed's stimulative bond-buying policy, is in real risk, especially because current inflation levels could limit what the Fed can do.

1191,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 05:21PM ET</span>",U.S. FTC focuses on deal with Japanese company in Shkreli trial,"By Luc Cohen and Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday kicked off the trial of its civil case against Vyera Pharmaceuticals founder Martin Shkreli, grilling company executives about a deal with a Japanese supplier that the FTC said helped Vyera maintain its monopoly on the life-saving drug Daraprim.
The FTC and several U.S. states have accused Shkreli of using illegal tactics to keep competitors out of the market for Daraprim after hiking its price to $750 per tablet, from $17.50, a move that made him infamous as ""Pharma Bro"" in 2015. The non-jury trial, before U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan federal court, is expected to last about six days.
The FTC's first witness, Vyera head of research and development Nicholas Pelliccione, testified that Vyera's 2017 exclusivity agreement with Japan's Fukuzyu Pharmaceutical Co, the sole U.S. supplier of Daraprim's active ingredient, blocked other manufacturers from buying the ingredient.
However, Pelliccione said he did not believe that was the ""main reason"" for the deal.
The agency's next witness, former Vyera chief Eliseo Salinas, said Shkreli tried to remain involved in the company after stepping down following his 2015 arrest for securities fraud. Salinas said Shkreli became ""hostile"" when Salinas tried to keep him away, once calling him a ""cockroach that needed to be stomped or crushed"" in an email.
Under cross-examination by Shkreli's attorney Andrew Rudowitz, Salinas said Vyera entered into the agreement with Fukuzyu because it was worried about constraints on the ingredient's supply, and that such agreements were ""very common"" in the drug industry.
Salinas acknowledged that Shkreli was no longer Vyera's chief executive when the deal with Fukuzyu was signed, though he said Shkreli placed allies on the company's board of directors.
Shkreli, who is serving a seven-year prison sentence for securities fraud, is not attending the trial. Vyera last week settled with the FTC and the states for $40 million.
Shkreli's lawyers said in a court filing last year that the claims about Shkreli's personal role in the alleged scheme were vague and unsupported.

Vyera, founded in 2014 as Turing Pharmaceuticals, acquired Daraprim from Impax Laboratories Inc in 2015. The drug treats toxoplasmosis, a parasitic infection that threatens people with weakened immune systems.
In addition to the Fukuzyu deal, the FTC and states say Vyera blocked generic drugmakers from obtaining samples to develop their own versions of Daraprim. The first generic version was approved last year.

This year, KFC Holdings Japan, the domestic licensor of the  Yum! Brands Inc  (NYSE:YUM) franchise, is nudging customers to order online and then pick up their chicken at a certain time, rather than forming up in the traditional queues.
The run-up to Christmas is the company's biggest sales week and it hopes the move will help maintain those revenues, which fell last year from a record, and let customers keep a tradition that stretches back to the 1970s. 
While only around 1% of Japan's population is Christian, the holiday's commercial aspects have been embraced.
Company lore says the Christmas campaign was inspired by foreign customers in Japan who lamented that they could not find turkey during the holidays. The first ""Kentucky for Christmas"" promotion started in 1974, marketed towards couples and including a bucket of chicken along with a bottle of wine.
KFC Japan has moved up the start of the campaign this year and offered price incentives for early birds to comply with the COVID-19 rules.
""As an infection countermeasure, we're spacing out reservations to try to limit as much as possible the times when people are bunched together,"" said company spokesman Tetsuya Noguchi.
Customers have seemingly embraced the change, even seeing making the reservations as a sign of maturity. 
""I made a reservation for Kentucky yesterday, so I don't think I'll have to run around looking for chicken this Christmas,"" Rise Ito, a 24-year old musician from Tokyo wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""I've grown up since last year!""
KFC Japan's Christmas sales in 2019 reached a record 7.1 billion yen ($62.5 million), according to research house Shared Research, but revenue dipped in 2020 to 6.9 billon yen, amid the imposition of social distancing measures and a wave of COVID-19 cases.
Since the promotion began, the company has given out commemorative plates and statues of KFC founder Colonel Harland Sanders dressed as Santa Claus. 
Other companies have gotten in on the chicken tradition, with convenience stores chains Seven & I Holdings and FamilyMart Co offering their own holiday platters. 
KFC's market entry in Japan in the early 1970s and its Christmas push were neatly timed to a shift in the nation's dining culture, said Eric C. Rath, a University of Kansas professor who researches the topic.

""Dining out was becoming much more frequent for families and young people, especially young women,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) instructed unvaccinated staff in Manhattan to work from home starting Tuesday, a further sign that banks and other financial firms are tightening protocols as COVID-19 infections rise and the Omicron variant spreads.
The U.S. bank, one of the most aggressive in bringing employees back to the office, previously allowed unvaccinated staff to work in its Manhattan offices provided they were tested twice a week.
In a memo to staff on Monday announcing the policy change, the bank urged unvaccinated staff to get vaccinated and for eligible employees to get booster shots. It also relaxed mask requirements for vaccinated staff working in its Manhattan offices.
""We continue to agree with health authorities that being vaccinated against COVID-19 is the best way to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe - especially as we face the winter months and a new variant - so please consider getting vaccinated if you aren't already, and getting your booster if you are,"" the memo said.
Most other banks already required staff to be vaccinated to enter their facilities.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has around 60% to 70% of staff back in the office, Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said in an interview with CNBC Tuesday.
""We focused on getting our teammates safe and vaccinated and back to work when they were ready,"" he said. ""We didn't want people to operate in a hamstrung environment.""
U.S. financial firms have been more proactive than other industries in encouraging employees to return to offices. But the recent surge in cases has caused some to rethink their strategies.
Many companies are struggling with COVID precautions, given they can often prove divisive. Some are reluctant to ask staff to return to offices when measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing – which undermine the benefits of congregating in person – are still in place, consultants say.
""Having everybody vaccinated works — it prevents tragedies,"" said Andy Challenger, a senior vice president at outplacement and executive-coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. 
New York State's Department of Health issued a mask mandate effective Monday requiring any individual entering an office that does not require vaccination to wear a mask at all times.
""It seems unfair to require our vaccinated employees to wear masks all day at their desks, and would be a step that would slow the progress we've already made toward business normalcy,"" JPMorgan said in the memo.
More than 90% of JPMorgan staff based in Manhattan are vaccinated, according to the memo. 
Vaccinated staff will now have to wear face coverings only when walking through lobbies, riding in elevators and in cafes when not eating. 
The bank added that the memo does not apply to branch staff, who ""will continue to follow their established procedures and protocols.""
Other banks and financial firms have been taking steps to protect staff as infection and hospitalization rates increase in New York and other states.

Last week, investment bank Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Financial Group asked staff to work from home again due to a spate of COVID-19 cases. 
Asset management firm Fidelity Investments on Monday said it had paused some voluntary return-to-office plans.

Investing.com -- Tech stocks weighed on the broader market on Tuesday after more data on inflation fanned the flames of fear about the Federal Reserve’s response.
Investors reined in on growth stocks, which lose their luster when interest rates are rising because the dollar loses value in the future.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell for another day, falling short of breaching the $3 trillion in market value threshold. There’s still time, of course, with holiday sales of new iPhones expected to be strong, according to some analysts, and the anticipated introduction of an augmented reality headphone next year.
Producer prices rose 0.8% in November, which was more than the 0.5% gain expected. For the year, producer prices rose 9.6%, more fodder for those who believe inflation is becoming a long-term problem.
The Fed’s policy-setting meeting concludes on Wednesday, with officials expected to announce they will hasten their effort to cut bond buying by doubling the cuts they announced in November. Tapering by $30 billion a month could end the program completely by the spring, clearing the Fed’s path to raise rates.
Aside from the Fed announcement at 2:00 PM ET on Wednesday, it is an otherwise quiet period on the calendar. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Homebuilder earnings
 Lennar  Corporation (NYSE:LEN) will report its fourth-quarter numbers Wednesday. The company is expected to report a profit per share of $4.15 on revenue of $8.51 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.
2. Retail sales
Black Friday sales notwithstanding, retail sales are seen rising by only 0.8% month-on-month in November, less than half of October’s 1.7% growth. The data are released at 8:30 AM ET.
3. Oil inventories
Oil prices have fallen on global growth concerns sparked by the lightning fast spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19. Analysts are looking to inventory reports to gauge supply versus demand. 
Crude inventories are seen falling by 2.6 million barrels in the week to December 10. The inventories had fallen 240,000 barrels in the week prior. The Energy Information Administration will release the data on Wednesday at 10:30 AM ET."

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed above session lows Tuesday, following a stumble in tech as the Federal Reserve got its two-day monetary policy meeting underway. 
The S&P 500 fell 0.7%, but had been about 1.4% lower intraday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.30%, or 105 points, the NASDAQ Composite lost 1.1%.  
Tech helped the sector move off intraday lows even as worries about higher rates and inflation weighed on high-valued growth corners of the market, which are less attractive in periods of rising rates and inflation because a dollar today is more worth more than a dollar in the future.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) led the selloff in big tech, down about 3%, while Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) were also in the red.
The US Producer Price Index surged 0.8% in November following a 0.6% increase in October, above the 0.5% gain expected in a Bloomberg survey. Year-over-year, producer prices jumped 9.6% in November, the largest rise on record.
The Federal Open Market Committee gets its two-day meeting underway, and is expected to announce Wednesday a plan to double its pace of bond purchases tapering to $30 billion per month to provide it with room to hike rates earlier to curb the threat of inflation.
""The pressure is on the Fed to act but after waiting on the sidelines for so long and falling behind the curve, the aggressive action arguably needed to stem the backup in costs will likely come with a significant consequence for growth,"" Stifel said in a note.

Financials bucked the trend lower, underpinned by a rise in Lincoln National (NYSE:LNC), The Travelers (NYSE:TRV), and Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) as insurers tend to benefit from a rising environment.
Energy gave up gains, paced by a decline in oil prices fell amid concerns that the impact of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 on travel will dent energy demand.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 0.8% to close above session lows. Chief Executive Elon Musk sold another $906 million of his shares on Monday, taking his total sales to 11.9 million.

The company will no longer provide paid COVID-19 leave for unvaccinated employees and will apply a $50 monthly health insurance surcharge to salaried non-union workers who are unvaccinated and enrolled in a company healthcare plan, a Kroger (NYSE:KR) spokesperson said on Tuesday.
Companies have tried other means to get their employees vaccinated, such as educational campaigns and incentive programs, but they did not see the desired results, Wade Symons, regulatory resources group leader at benefits company Mercer told Reuters.
""I think employers sort of see hitting employees in the wallet as a true motivator that ... should increase vaccination levels.""
Kroger, among the biggest private employers in the United States, had about 465,000 full and part-time workers as of Jan. 31, according to a regulatory filing.
Concerns over the new Omicron variant could cause a jump in crowds at Kroger stores in the coming weeks as consumers look to stock up on goods and household essentials, analysts have said. Kroger is encouraging shoppers ""to only buy what they need,"" the company said earlier this month.
The push to get more employees vaccinated comes as U.S. President Joe Biden faces setbacks in implementing his vaccine-or-test mandate for private businesses.

Employees that are unvaccinated potentially can cost the employer more in health insurance costs, Symons said.
""So if I'm an employer that is self insured and pays the claims for my health insurance, and I have employees that are unvaccinated and have the potential, not only to get COVID-19 themselves, but also potentially to affect others ... I want to have them pay more to try to offset some of those costs.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Star stock picker Cathie Wood of Ark Invest struck a defiant tone in a webinar Tuesday in which she repeated her warning that deflation, rather than inflation, will be the largest risk for financial markets and the economy in the year ahead. 
Concerns about rising prices and expectations of rising interest rates have hammered Wood's flagship $16.1 billion ARK Innovation Fund this year, which is down 24% for the year to date despite a 24% gain in the broad-based S&P 500 index over the same time. The fund, which was the top-performing U.S. equity fund in 2020 due to its bets on so-called stay-at-home stocks, has outsized positions in companies such as Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) Health Inc and  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc which are down 40% or more since the start of 2021. 
""We feel like we’re experiencing the same kind of naysaying right now” as when Ark previously made large bets on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and bitcoin before both rallied more than 1,000%, Wood said. ""Our confidence in our strategy has increased"" despite the stock losses for the year to date, Wood added. 
Wood sees companies that profit from stay-at-home trends as part of an innovation category that includes Tesla and biotech shares. Among the arguments for innovation stocks are signs from the bond market that inflation expectations are moderating and a broad decline in commodity prices, Wood said.

At the same time, Wood said that she expects the U.S. economy will grow less than many economists expect in the year ahead, prompting a shift back into the sort of innovative companies that can grow regardless of the economic backdrop. 
Overall, the ARK Innovation fund has posted investor outflows over six of the last 10 weeks, according to Lipper data. The fund fell 2.4% in afternoon trading Tuesday, more than double the 1% decline in the S&P 500.

Any move by McDonald's to sell a plant-based burger widely across its more than 13,500 U.S. locations could be a boon to plant-based meat makers generally and Beyond specifically. 
Rivals have been vying for partnerships with restaurant chains as they add vegan and vegetarian menu options. Beyond is working with Taco Bell owner Yum Brands Inc, while Impossible Foods partnered with Burger King, a unit of Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) Inc.
BTIG analyst Peter Saleh said in a research note on Monday that he expects the product to be in about 700 restaurants across several regions as a limited-time offer in February and March, with a national rollout possible in 2023.
Unlike the current test, the expansion would come with local and regional advertising funded by McDonald's franchisees and possibly Beyond, Saleh said.

Separately, Piper Sandler analyst Michael Lavery said in a note that McDonald's could launch McPlant burgers nationwide late in the first quarter of 2022, earlier than previously anticipated.
That could pressure margins for Beyond. While it will sell more patties, it may do so at a lower price - closer to $4.00 per pound than the $5.25 Lavery initially forecast - as it seeks to undercut the price of animal protein by 2024, he said.

(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) may raise their bonus pools for investment bankers by as much as 40% and 50% respectively this year, sources familiar with initial discussions said on Tuesday.
Investment bankers at both firms are anticipating bumper windfalls following recent meetings to set pay for the year, the sources said.
Both, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment. 
Record levels of deal-making and trading activities have driven profits at investment banks this year as economic stimulus measures helped propel stock markets globally to all-time highs.

Compensation firm Johnson Associates Inc said last month that bonuses for Wall Street staffers were expected to be at their highest this year since 2009, with investment bankers and equities traders in line for the biggest payouts. 
Overall, incentives at the end of this year, including cash bonuses and equity awards, will be significantly higher compared with last year, when most professionals saw a decline in awards, the study showed.

1208,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 02:20PM ET</span>","Exclusive-Amazon says India revoking Future deal would boost Reliance, hurt competition","By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has warned India's antitrust body that revoking its 2019 deal with Future Group would send a negative signal to foreign investors and allow local retail behemoth Reliance to ""further restrict competition"", a legal document seen by Reuters showed.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is reviewing its prior approval of the $200 million investment the U.S. company made in a Future unit in 2019, amid allegations that Amazon concealed facts when it sought approval for the transaction. 
The CCI's review was triggered after a complaint from Amazon's now estranged partner Future. The two sides have been at loggerheads since last year with the U.S. company successfully using the terms of its toehold investment in 2019 to block debt-laden Future's attempt to sell retail assets to Reliance Industries for $3.4 billion. 
While Future is staring at liquidation, the legitimacy of the small $200 million deal could have far-reaching consequences for India's retail sector. 
If Amazon prevails, it will slow Reliance's plan to acquire Future at a time when it is already rapidly expanding into e-commerce. 
And if the 2019 deal is voided, it could make it easier for Reliance to close the Future deal, hurting Amazon's retail ambitions, people familiar with the dispute say. 
Amazon in a confidential filing on Dec. 12 said CCI's approval revocation is ""bound to send a message to foreign investors that the economy and regulatory landscape of India are still not developed enough to provide stability and certainty to foreign investments"".
Amazon in its 60-page submission went on to say Future's aim ""to unwind the investment"" to allow Reliance to consolidate its position ""will further restrict competition in the Indian retail market"".
The bruising public battle https://www.reuters.com/article/amazon-india-future-reliance-idUSKBN2871AM over Future Retail pits Jeff Bezos' Amazon against Reliance, run by one of India's richest men, Mukesh Ambani, in a bid for retail dominance in India.
Reliance is India's No. 1 retailer with more than 13,000 outlets, and rapidly expanding into e-commerce.
Future Retail ranks second with more than 1,500 outlets.
Amazon, Reliance and Future did not respond to a request for comment. The CCI also did not respond.
NO INFO CONCEALED, CCI HAS 'NO POWER' 
The Future-Reliance deal has been on hold as Amazon got favourable interim rulings from a Singapore arbitrator and Indian courts. Future denies any wrongdoing, and the dispute continues to be heard in multiple forums.
Amazon has argued that terms agreed upon in its 2019 deal to pay $200 million for a 49% stake in Future's gift voucher unit prevent its parent, Future Group, from selling its Future Retail Ltd business to certain rivals, including Reliance.
In June, the CCI sought explanation from Amazon saying it hid factual aspects of the transaction by not revealing its strategic interest in Future Retail while seeking approvals.
In its Dec. 12 response to the CCI - being reported here for the first time - Amazon argues no information was concealed from the CCI and lawyers representing the Future Group ""had vetted and approved"" all submissions.
""There was no concealment of any material information,"" Amazon's filing states. 
The CCI's 2019 approval order states its decision ""shall stand revoked if, at any time, the information provided"" is found to be incorrect. 

But Amazon in its submission argues the CCI has no power to do so, saying its approval order as per Indian laws is a final one, not conditional.
""The power to revoke an approval is a drastic power and is not available to a statutory authority unless expressly provided"" in Indian law, Amazon argued.

1209,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 02:19PM ET</span>",BlackRock adds diversity target for U.S. boardrooms,"By Ross Kerber and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) -Top asset manager BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) on Tuesday said it wants U.S. companies to aim for a board that is 30% diverse and, for the first time, contains at least one member from an under-represented group.
In new guidelines explaining its priorities for 2022 at portfolio companies, posted on its website, the $9.5 trillion asset manager also gave companies new guidance for reporting on climate change. But it said some continued investment in fossil fuels will be needed.
Together, the updates showed the influential New York-based firm taking steps similar to other big asset managers pressing portfolio companies on environmental, social and governance considerations. 
Earlier this month  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) said it wants big companies to have at least one director from an under-represented group, citing the growing availability of corporate disclosures showing personal diversity data.
Boards have been bolstering their diversity by adding new members in recent years, in line with growing attention to the subject from investors, employees and customers.
Among S&P 500 companies, 21% of directors are either Black, Asian or Hispanic, according to executive recruiting firm Spencer Stuart. Women now make up 30% of all S&P 500 directors, Spencer Stuart said.
The number of U.S. companies disclosing the data likely will keep growing, a BlackRock spokesperson said. According to language sent by the spokesperson, directors from under-represented groups can include racial or ethnic minorities, people who identify as LGBTQ+, people with disabilities and veterans.
BlackRock's guidelines did not specify when it would vote against directors at companies that did not meet its new standards, but they indicated the focus would be on large companies first. A lack of diversity was a major reason the firm voted against more directors in 2021 than in prior years. 
MORE REPORTING ACCEPTED
On climate matters, BlackRock previously had pressed companies to report their emissions and other factors under the SASB standards of the Value Reporting Foundation. BlackRock said on Tuesday that companies may use other standards, noting the work of a new international board announced at the United Nations climate summit in Scotland last month.
BlackRock also said it would encourage companies to show how their business plans would be resilient amid efforts to limit global warming, and noted the opportunities offered by new energy sources.

But it added: ""We also recognize that some continued investment is required to maintain a reliable, affordable supply of fossil fuels during the transition."" Companies should disclose how their capital allocation matches emissions reduction targets, BlackRock said.
On corporate structures, BlackRock said companies looking to convert to new forms should put the issue to a shareholder vote. Some companies are shifting to structures like ""public benefit corporations"" to take account of the interests of employees and other stakeholders, a move backed by a growing number of advocates.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -French waste and water management companies Veolia and Suez won EU antitrust approval on Tuesday for their 13 billion euro ($14.7 billion) tie-up to create a global group better able to compete against Chinese rivals.
The deal struck in April was marked by a bitter months-long dispute including legal action and a move by Suez to ring-fence its French water business from Veolia, though that was later abandoned after the companies reached an agreement.
Veolia said after the announcement that France's financial watchdog AMF set a Jan. 7 deadline to close the transaction.
Reuters exclusively reported last week that the deal would receive EU approval.
The European Commission said an extensive package of asset sales addressed all its concerns about the deal.
""The Commission ensures that this transaction will not adversely affect competition in the water and waste markets, two sectors that are key to the European Green Deal and the circular economy,"" EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
Remedies proposed by the companies include hiving off Suez's French water and waste activities and some international assets into a new entity called New Suez, shareholders of which are Meridiam and Global Infrastructure Partners, state-backed Caisse des Depots and CNP Assurances.
Veolia will also sell the bulk of its industrial water treatment assets in France and mobile water services businesses in Europe. Suez, meanwhile, will divest all its assets in industrial hazardous waste treatment.

Both companies will also sell part of their hazardous waste landfill activities.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Top executives of major U.S. airlines will tell a Senate committee Wednesday they are ramping up hiring even as some raise concerns about a COVID-19 variant on demand, according to testimony seen by Reuters.
Executives at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing will defend the $54 billion in COVID-19 government payroll assistance airlines received, and will say in total they plan to hire more than 30,000 workers in 2022.
Lawmakers are expected to quiz executives about how carriers used pandemic-related federal aid, staffing issues and other matters.
JetBlue Chief Executive Robin Hayes will say in written testimony the airline is on track to hire 4,550 new 
crew members in 2021 and in 2022 plans to hire an additional 5,400 crew.  Alaska Air  (NYSE:ALK) Group Chief Executive Ben Minicucci said in testimony it plans to hire more than 3,000 people.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) Chief of Operations John Laughter's testimony says the airline is hiring more than 6,100 Airport customer service agents and more than 600 pilots. He added the airline is ""prepared for, an uneven, choppy recovery even as the virus is being contained.. The Omicron variant has created further uncertainty, and there is no clear consensus on when 
business and international travel will return.""
Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly will say ""if the current demand environment holds, we should be able to pay off most of the debt we incurred during the pandemic within the next five years.""
United Airlines Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) will tell the Senate panel ""it is important to remember the shocking scale of this pandemic on the globe and its deep effect on our 
industry. We are not completely out of the woods, and the emergence of the Omicron variant in recent 
weeks is a stark reminder of that.""
Kirby's testimony says the government payroll assistance ""saved the industry while giving us the flexibility to not only think about how best to chart our recovery, but also to make meaningful, fundamental changes within our company.""

On Monday, Reuters reported that American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Chief Executive Doug Parker will tell the committee the airline plans to hire 18,000 employees in 2022 after hiring more than 16,000 employees in 2021.
""No airline has ever attempted to expand at the pace we did after a demand shock of the magnitude we experienced during the pandemic,"" Parker's testimony says.

1214,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 01:33PM ET</span>",Pfizer shot less effective in South Africa after Omicron emerges - study,"By Alexander Winning and Wendell Roelf
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine has been less effective in South Africa at keeping people infected with the virus out of hospital since the Omicron variant emerged last month, a real-world study published on Tuesday showed.
Between Nov. 15 and Dec. 7, people who had received two doses of the shot had a 70% chance of avoiding hospitalisation, down from 93% during the previous wave of Delta infections, the study showed.
When it came to avoiding infection altogether, the study by South Africa's largest private health insurance administrator, Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Health, showed that protection against catching COVID-19 had slumped to 33% from 80% previously.
The findings from the real-world analysis are some of the first about the protection vaccines offer against Omicron outside of laboratory studies, which have so far shown a reduced ability to neutralise the virus.
The study results were based on an analysis by Discovery's clinical research and actuarial teams in collaboration with the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC).
South Africa alerted the world to Omicron in November, triggering alarm that it could cause another surge in global infections and leading to travel curbs on southern Africa. South Africa's daily infections have since risen to more than 20,000, with 35% of tests coming back positive in figures reported on Tuesday, and a further 600 hospital admissions and 24 deaths.
The South African study was based on more than 211,000 COVID-19 test results of which 78,000 were attributed to Omicron, the variant labelled ""of concern"" by the World Health Organization and reported in more than 60 countries.
The 78,000 cases were attributed to Omicron based on the relative prevalence of the variant within the country over the study period, but because they have not been confirmed as being the new variant the study cannot offer conclusive findings. 
South African scientists sent 630 positive COVID-19 tests for genome sequencing in November to see if they were Omicron and another 61 so far in December. Last month, 78% were confirmed as Omicron and all 61 this month were the new variant.
'CONFOUNDING FACTOR'
Discovery cautioned that the study's findings should be considered preliminary. Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, also said there was a large degree of uncertainty for now about Omicron.
""It is important to avoid inferring too much right now from any national scenario. For example, the narrative around South Africa is that Omicron may be much milder, whereas reports out of Denmark broadly suggests the opposite,"" he said.
South Africa is using the Pfizer-BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) vaccines in its immunisation campaign, with more than 20 million  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) doses administered so far.
J&J and the SAMRC are conducting a large real-world study of J&J's vaccine and recent analysis has shown no deaths from Omicron, SAMRC President Glenda Gray said.
""So that's the good news, it shows again that the vaccine is effective against severe disease and death,"" she said.
With at least 70% of the South African population estimated to have been exposed to COVID-19 over the past 18 months, high estimated levels of existing antibodies might skew the data.
""This could be a confounding factor for these hospital admission and severity indicators during this Omicron wave,"" Ryan Noach, chief executive of Discovery Health, said in a briefing on the study.
The analysis showed protection against hospital admission was maintained across all ages, from 18 to 79 years, with slightly lower levels of protection for the elderly.
Protection against admission was also consistent across a range of chronic illnesses including diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and other cardiovascular diseases.
REINFECTION RISK
The study concluded there was a higher risk of reinfection during the fourth wave than during previous waves and the risk of hospitalisation among adults diagnosed with COVID-19 was still 29% lower than during the country's first wave last year.
Children appeared to have a 20% higher risk of hospital admission with complications during the fourth wave than during the first, despite a very low absolute incidence, it said.
""This is early data and requires careful follow up,"" said Shirley Collie, chief health analytics actuary at Discovery Health.
However, this trend aligns with a warning in recent days from South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) that during the country's third wave from June to September they had seen an increase in paediatric admissions and now, in the fourth wave, they are seeing a similar increase in admissions for children under five, she said.
South African scientists have said they cannot confirm a link between Omicron and the high admissions of infants, which could be due to other factors.
Many unknowns still surround Omicron.

The WHO has said there were early signs that vaccinated and previously infected people would not build enough antibodies to ward off an Omicron infection, resulting in high transmission rates, but was unclear whether Omicron was inherently more contagious than the globally dominant Delta variant.
Pfizer and BioNTech said last week that two shots of their vaccine may still protect against severe disease, because its mutations were unlikely to evade the T-cells' response.

LONDON (Reuters) -Sharp falls in Shimao Group's shares and debt, triggered by worries over an asset sale and cancelled apartment deals, renewed concerns on Tuesday over China's property sector.
Shares in Shimao, which was one of China's top-10 developers last year and investment grade-rated until a month ago, fell a record 20% and the price of its bonds fell heavily, while other firms' stocks also dropped.. 
Its Shanghai Shimoa subsidiary fell 32%, prompting an after-hours statement from the firm saying that it was operating normally, without any significant issues that would affect its ability to make bond payments.
The concerns were triggered by a weekend report that homebuyers who had bought some of its apartments in Shanghai had not been able to register for an ownership transfer, as they had already been pledged to a trust.
State Chinese media CCTV reported on Tuesday that those original sales would now be ""terminated"".
""We think this could affect Shimao's image and future contract sales, particularly in a weak property market,"" UBS said in a research note.
Shimao did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment from Reuters.
""The company's bond maturity in January will be key to watch. In the event that Shimao misses a payment, we believe this would have a negative implication for the sector,"" UBS added, referring to a 2.5 billion yuan ($392.64 million) bond payment due on Jan 15. 
Shares in Evergrande, which has been at the heart of China's property meltdown this year, fell 7% to a record low. 
R&F Properties, whose bonds have been tumbling in recent weeks, also slumped 7.5%. China's biggest developer by sales Country Garden dropped 4.5%, while Sunac Services plunged 17% as J.P. Morgan downgraded it, along with Shimao.
RED FLAG 
Shanghai Shimao had caused further worries on Monday when it said it had sold its property management business to sister company Shimao Services, for 1.7 billion yuan ($267 million). 
The sale price is 16 times the unit's expected price-to-earnings ratio this year, far higher than the average 10-14 times seen in recent M&A deals in the Chinese property sector, analysts at J.P. Morgan said.
""We think this connected party transaction not only implies tight liquidity conditions for Shimao, but is also a corporate governance red flag as it is essentially transferring the cash from property manager to developer level,"" the investment bank's analysts said, giving both Shimao Group and Shimao Services an 'underweight' rating, effectively a sell recommendation.
The Shanghai stock exchange issued a statement questioning the sale of its property management assets. 
UBS estimates Shimao has a combined $4.4 billion worth of local market bonds, international bonds and syndicated loan payments due next year and around $10 billion in total.
Analysts said that these will be difficult to refinance if it does not get support or regain access to international borrowing, which are effectively closed for junk-rated Chinese developers following this year's troubles.

Home sales have also plunged amid the sector's woes and down around 30% year-on-year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Pfizer Inc on Tuesday said its antiviral COVID-19 pill showed near 90% efficacy in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients, and recent lab data suggests the drug retains its effectiveness against the fast spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
The U.S. drugmaker last month said the oral medicine was around 89% effective in preventing hospitalizations or deaths when compared to placebo, based on interim results in around 1,200 people. Data from its final analysis of the trial disclosed on Tuesday includes an additional 1,000 people.
Nobody in the trial who received the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) treatment died, compared with 12 deaths among placebo recipients.
The Pfizer pills are taken with the older antiviral ritonavir every 12 hours for five days beginning shortly after onset of symptoms. If authorized, the treatment will be sold as Paxlovid.
""It's a stunning outcome,"" Pfizer Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten said in an interview. 
""We're talking about a staggering number of lives saved and hospitalizations prevented. And of course, if you deploy this quickly after infection, we are likely to reduce transmission dramatically,"" Dolsten said.
Pfizer also released early data from a second study suggesting that the treatment reduced hospitalizations by around 70% in a smaller trial of standard-risk adults, including some higher-risk vaccinated people. 
Pfizer said those results showed a positive trend, but were not statistically significant. They are following the results and plan to release data from the final 20% of participants in the 1,100-patient trial.The trial did not show that the drug alleviated symptoms of COVID-19 in that population.
Dolsten said he expects authorization for use in high-risk individuals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies soon. He does not believe an FDA advisory panel meeting will be needed.
""We're in very advanced regulatory dialogues with both Europe and the UK, and we have dialogues with most of the major regulatory agencies globally,"" Dolsten said.
'VERY EXCITING RESULTS'
Pfizer submitted data to the FDA last month, asking for emergency use authorization (EUA) of the drug.
""These are very exciting results,"" said Dr. Paul Sax, a professor at Harvard Medical School. 
Sax said the FDA should try to accelerate the authorization process as much as possible, noting there are very limited treatment options for high-risk people outside of the hospital.
There are currently no oral antiviral treatments for COVID-9 authorized in the United States. 
Analysts on average forecast 2022 revenue of more than $24 billion from the pill, which would more than make up for any decline in vaccine sales after 2021.
Rival Merck & Co has asked for an EUA for its antiviral pill molnupiravir. But that drug only reduced hospitalizations and deaths in its clinical trial of high-risk patients by around 30%.
Some scientists have also raised safety concerns about the potential for birth defects from the Merck drug, as well as worries that it could cause the virus to mutate.
Pfizer's treatment works differently. It is part of a class of drugs called protease inhibitors currently used to treat HIV, hepatitis C and other viruses.
Recent laboratory testing showed that activity against the protease of the Omicron variant is as ""good as basically any SARS-COV-2 variant of concern,"" Dolsten said.
The company has said it can have 180,000 treatment courses ready to ship this year and plans to produce at least 80 million more in 2022.
Dolsten said Pfizer is looking to expand that output further as new variants, like the newly-discovered Omicron, could push the need for antivirals substantially higher. Current vaccines appear to be less effective at preventing infection with Omicron.
Pfizer, which makes one of the leading COVID-19 vaccines with German partner BioNTech, has agreed to allow generic manufacturers to supply versions of the drug to 95 low- and middle-income countries through a licensing agreement with international public health group Medicines Patent Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) (MPP). However, Dolsten said that for next year he expects the drug will be mainly produced by Pfizer.

The MPP told Reuters in a statement, that it will be ""well into next year"" before pills produced by generic manufacturers under its licenses will be ready for use.
The U.S. government has already secured 10 million courses of the Pfizer treatment for $5.29 billion.

MILAN (Reuters) - U.S. fund KKR said it was keen to engage with  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) over its $37 billion takeover proposal for the phone group and expected to conduct a due diligence analysis, but had set no deadline for it.
A boardroom crisis at TIM, which lost its fourth chief executive in six years a week after KKR submitted its proposal, is complicating the group's response to KKR's approach. 
TIM's board meets on Friday on the KKR bid among other issues, but diverging views on the proposal could prevent it from giving a green light to the due diligence KKR has requested before formalising the offer it submitted on Nov. 19, a person familiar with the matter said.
A second person ruled out altogether that the board would give KKR access to TIM's data on Friday.
KKR said market regulator Consob had asked it to clarify whether there was a deadline to waive the due diligence request and proceed with the bid, given that the offer was not conditional on it.
""KKR has not set forth any deadline for access to due diligence and it awaits the determination of the board of directors of TIM,"" the New York-based fund said.
It added: ""KKR is looking forward to engaging with the board of directors on the merits of the offer and the related process.""
The fund has made its offer conditional on backing from TIM's board and Italy's government.
However, it said it would not await a favourable response by TIM's board before launching it, but stick to takeover rules according to which a target company's board gives an opinion only once the investor prospectus is published.
Before relinquishing his CEO powers on Nov. 26, former TIM boss Luigi Gubitosi had urged the board to set up a data room for KKR, which he said could be readied in 48 hours.
But the U.S. fund's approach has met resistance from TIM's top shareholder Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY), which said it does not adequately value Italy's former phone monopoly. 
Vivendi is trying to win support from state investor CDP, TIM's second-largest shareholder, for an alternative plan to revive the indebted phone group's fortunes, sources have said.
KKR, which consulted the Rome government before making its offer and already holds 37.5% of TIM's last-mile grid, plans to carve out the company's fixed network assets and give CDP a leading role in overseeing them, sources have said.
""KKR can always change its mind relative to the offer level and the attitude towards the board; while in our view a negative position of the government would be the only real deal-breaker,"" Banca Akros analyst Andrea De Vita said.
Splitting services from infrastructure assets is increasingly emerging as the best route for TIM to tackle issues that include shrinking revenues and a debt burden hindering the investments needed to upgrade its fixed line.

Reversing a longstanding stance on the matter, Vivendi this month said it was open to handing the Italian state control of TIM's network in a break-up of the group.

Investing.com — Shares of Fluor Corporation (NYSE:FLR) rose 9% Tuesday after NuScale Power agreed to go public through a merger with the special purpose acquisition company  Spring Valley Acquisition Corp  (NASDAQ:SV).
A SPAC, also known as a blank check company, is a listed shell company that aims to merge with an unlisted company to take it public. The news is relevant to engineering and construction giant Fluor as it is a majority shareholder in NuScale. Spring Valley Acquisition shares are up around 1% following the announcement. 
The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2022, with the combined company expected to be known as NuScale Power Corporation, with an enterprise value of $1.9 billion.
NuScale will gain proceeds of up to $413 million to bolster and speed up the commercialization of its SMR technology. The proceeds include a $181 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) anchored by Samsung (KS:005930) C&T Corporation, DS Private Equity, Segra Capital Management and Pearl Energy.
Meanwhile, Fluor expects to control approximately 60% of the combined company, which is a positive for Fluor shareholders. In addition, NuScale said Fluor will remain a partner providing engineering services, project management, administrative and supply chain support."
1226,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 12:36PM ET</span>",Deadly U.S. tornadoes to cost insurers up to $5 billion,"(Reuters) - Insured losses from the swarm of tornadoes and severe convective storms that caused destruction in parts of the United States this month could amount up to $5 billion, industry experts said on Tuesday. 
Catastrophe modeling firm Karen Clark & Company said it expects insured losses of about $3 billion from tornadoes that tore a 200-mile path through the six states in the U.S. Midwest and South, demolishing homes, leveling businesses and setting off a scramble to find survivors beneath the rubble.
The barrage of tornadoes killed at least 74 people in Kentucky, officials said on Monday.
Credit rating agency Fitch said insured losses could rise to $5 billion, rivaling the U.S. Midwest derecho event in August last year, but less than Winter Storm Uri and Hurricane Ida, both of which saw losses of $15 billion and $40 billion respectively. 
Fitch said it was unusual to have this type of weather-driven event in December, which is historically the least costly month of the year for U.S. convective storm insured losses, citing climate change as a potential factor.
""The tornadoes will likely drive insurance industry natural catastrophe losses to the largest annual total in the U.S. since the 2017 record year (approximately $130 billion),"" it added. 

This will add to reinsurers' push for rate hikes at the January 2022 pricing renewals and beyond as they absorb losses from another unusual weather event and react to concerns about the negative impact from climate change, Fitch said.
The powerful twisters, which weather forecasters say are unusual in cooler months, also destroyed a candle factory and the fire and police stations in a small town in Kentucky, ripped through a nursing home in neighboring Missouri, and killed at least six workers at an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse in Illinois.

1231,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 11:56AM ET</span>",Analysis-Cheap and unloved UK Plc still can't shake risk discount,"By Danilo Masoni and Joice Alves
(Reuters) - The ""Buy UK"" equity trade that many viewed as a no-brainer at the start of 2021 looks like it has backfired, with British equities suffering record outflows this year despite being at their cheapest in more than three decades.
The MSCI UK Index's valuation discount to world stocks, which emerged after the Brexit referendum in 2016, has further widened throughout 2021 and is now at its broadest since 1990, at 35% on a price-to-earnings metric.
While a partial bounceback from Covid has helped the index rise a solid 13.6% year-to-date, putting it on track for its best year since 2016, it has still lagged both U.S. and euro zone indices in local currency terms. 
It wasn't supposed to go this way. A year ago, investors expected UK stocks to race ahead of their peers in 2021, thanks to their cheap price tag and Britain's headstart in vaccinating its population.
But concerns about interest rate hikes, a supply chain crisis in the Brexit-hit economy, and potential political instability next year have been blamed for the relatively poor showing of its equity market.
""The UK got off to a good start, but it didn't last. Some UK stocks were a classic play on the recovery with an exposure to inflation too, but that narrative has fallen away,"" said Stephen Payne, a fund manager at Janus Henderson Investors. 
In 2021 British equity funds saw record outflows of 14 billion pounds ($18.6 billion), according to Refinitiv Lipper, outstripping even the 12 billion pounds shed in 2016, when Britain voted to leave the European Union.
More capital has left UK equity funds this year than all other countries in Europe combined, which saw outflows of around 9 billion pounds. 
BofA Global Research's monthly fund manager survey showed that UK equities are the biggest underweight going into 2022 across markets, while euro zone stocks are the top overweight. 
(Graphic on, UK valuation discount: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dwpkrzlmnvm/UK%20stocks%20valuation.PNG ) 
FORGET ABOUT THE PRICE TAG
As the new year looms, persistently cheap prices aren't doing much to persuade investors to part with their money this time around either. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, is neutral and prefers European equities. 
""The problem with UK equities is that the situation of high inflation and supply difficulties is exacerbated by Brexit,"" said Anthilia fund manager Giuseppe Sersale.
""This will hamper margins going forward, and will induce the BoE into a tighter monetary policy compared to the ECB and maybe even the Fed.""
Investors expect nearly 90 basis points (bps) of rate hikes from the Bank of England until end-2022, compared to 72 bps from the U.S. Federal Reserve and less than 10 bps from the European Central Bank. 
Sersale cut his UK allocations to neutral in October when markets ramped up BoE rate hike bets. 
(Graphic on, Outflows from UK funds: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zgvomnymbvd/Outflows%20from%20UK%20funds%20in%202021.png ) 
HSBC Private Banking and Wealth Management also cut UK stocks to neutral this month, even though valuations are ""very attractive"".
""The market is worried that the combination of rate hikes by the BoE, increased national insurance contributions and rising taxes on dividends could slow the recovery,"" said Willem Sels, HSBC's global chief investment officer for Private Banking and Wealth. 
Sector composition has also penalised UK equities, with nearly half of London-listed blue chips operating in the mining, energy and financial spaces - all of which tend to be cyclical - and few in faster-growing tech. 
""The UK stock market is made up of a lot of energy and mining companies, which we are not currently invested in,"" said Jeremy Leung, portfolio manager at UBS Asset Management.
He says he sees more opportunities in smaller information technology companies.
While UK Plc's cheapness drew an unprecedented wave of takeover interest, chiefly from cash-rich private equity funds, that has failed to translate into sizeable stock market returns.
London's efforts to attract fast-growing technology companies have also stumbled, with some high-profile initial public offerings trading well below their listing prices. 
Despite the broad gloom, some remain optimistic.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said cheap valuations and ""an improving dividend stream"" make them bullish, while Jupiter fund manager Richard Watts is upbeat about UK mid-cap stocks, which he expects to benefit from high disposable income and job market strength.

Winnebago Industries (NYSE:WGO) Inc reported record fiscal 2020 revenues in October - up over 50% from the previous year. On Friday it is expected to post its second straight quarter of sales over $1 billion and a 33% increase in earnings per share, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
 Thor Industries  (NYSE:THO) Inc, the largest producer, last week reported record results for its fiscal first quarter while noting its backlog as of the end of October was over $18 billion - a 100% increase over a year ago.
Michael Happe, chief executive of the Forest City, Iowa-based Winnebago, said in an interview that his company's retailers have ""been able to optimize retail pricing in a way they have not been able to do in a long, long time.""
The RV industry is a prime example of how many U.S. producers have been able to thrive despite COVID-related shortages - and the related price increases in raw materials, from steel and plastic to electronics and foam. The surge in RV sales began early in the pandemic, as worried Americans looked for ways to travel without the risks of staying in motels or riding in airplanes.

All types of outdoor-oriented industries have boomed during the pandemic. Sales of swimming pools, boats and all-terrain vehicles all surged after initial lockdowns. 
Labor shortages also are bedeviling the industry, which has struggled to fill jobs in production hubs like northern Indiana, where Thor is based.
Despite all these barriers, the industry is producing and shipping more than ever. Wholesale shipments of RVs in North America are expected to hit a record 602,200 units this year - a 40% increase over 2020 and 19% higher than the last record high set in 2017, according to an analysis prepared for the RV Industry Association. The analysis, by ITR Economics, is projecting a smaller increase of 2% in 2022, to 613,700 units.
Jon Ferrando, CEO of RV Retailer LLC - a Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based retailer with 90 stores in 26 states as of the end of this year - said pricier raw materials, together with higher labor and transportation costs to move motor homes and trailers across the country from factories to his stores - has meant multiple price increases passed along to consumers, rather than the normal once-a-year adjustments.
(Graphic: Staying ahead of inflation in the RV business, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/RVS/zdvxoxjmwpx/chart.png) 
""Certainly, this year, there's more frequent price adjustments,"" he said. But he added that the increases have not curbed the appetite of buyers.
""To the extent we have pressure to raise prices, consumers have great ability to trade down and get the price point they want,"" he said. 
To be sure, the price tags on RVs range widely. RV Retailer sells everything from $10,000 teardrop shaped tow-along campers to $1 million diesel motorhomes.
Jason Lippert, chief executive of LCI Industries (NYSE:LCII), the largest parts supplier to the RV industry, said he expects supply chain problems to continue. But he does not see rising prices softening consumer demand any time soon.
""If you're a first-time buyer, you're not looking at what you could have bought in 2018 or 2017,"" he said. ""People buying their second or third RV will likely think about the price a little more.""

One aspect of rising prices could ultimately add headwinds for the industry: gas prices, which have soared this year. 
But James Boyle, a spokesman for the RV Industry Association, said the industry does not expect current prices at the pump to curb business anytime soon, noting that many RVs are used for short trips and tailgating, rather than long road trips.

Investing.com —  Adagio Therapeutics  Inc (NASDAQ:ADGI) shares fell 78% Tuesday after the company reported that its antibody treatment for Covid-19 showed a reduced effectiveness to the Omicron variant.
The company said external analyses showed a more than 300-fold reduction in neutralizing activity of its antibody treatment against Omicron.
Adagio stock traded around $7.54 per share.
Additional analysis is being conducted and the company said it will speak with regulatory and government agencies to consider the role the therapy, ADG20, can play in preventing and treating Covid-19.
The news surprised Morgan Stanley after previous in vitro studies showed ADG20 retained activity against prior variants, including Alpha, Beta, Delta and Gamma. As a result, the analysts downgraded the stock to equal weight from overweight with a price target of $11, down from $49. 
Analyst Matthew Harrison said in a research note that while ADG20 has broad activity against other variants, he expects Omicron to become ""dominant quickly"" and ""the uncertainty will limit the drugs utility."""
1234,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 11:40AM ET</span>",U.S. appeals court declines to block United Airlines vaccine mandate,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A divided U.S. appeals court has rebuffed a request by six employees to block United Airlines from enforcing a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for workers that imposes unpaid leave on those who are granted religious or medical exceptions.
A panel of the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 2-1 on Monday night to reject the emergency request for an injunction blocking the mandate while the employees appeal a November ruling by a federal judge in favor of the airline.
The case is one of many legal battles over vaccine requirements imposed by companies and governments.
United Airlines was the first major air carrier to issue a vaccine requirement and others followed. United has granted around 2,000 religious and medical exemptions to employees in roles including pilots, flight attendants and customer service agents. 
A United spokesperson declined to comment on the 5th Circuit decision.
The dissenting member of the three-judge panel, Judge James Ho, sharply criticized the decision, writing that ""vaccine mandates like the one United is attempting to impose here present a crisis of conscience for many people of faith.""
""To hypothesize that the earthly reward of monetary damages could compensate for these profound challenges of faith is to misunderstand the entire nature of religious conviction at its most foundational level. And that is so whether the mandate comes from D.C. or the C-Suite,"" added Ho, who was appointed to the bench by Republican former President Donald Trump.
The 5th Circuit panel's majority issued a two-sentence order rebuffing the plaintiffs, citing the rationale made by U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman in Texas last month.
Pittman rejected arguments by the employees that United improperly put them in an ""impossible position"" by forcing them to choose to receive a vaccine or face unpaid leave. Pittman was critical of United's approach toward employees seeking religious exemptions, but said in the end that human resources policy is up to a company and no employee was forced to be vaccinated.
The plaintiffs in the case asserted religious objections to the vaccine. The six employees accused the company of employment discrimination and retaliation, saying the airline violated a section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by failing to provide reasonable religious accommodations. 
Vaccine mandates have become a flashpoint in the United States, with many conservatives opposed. These mandates have generally been upheld by courts, but White House efforts to require large employers or federal contractors to set vaccine or testing requirements have been blocked by courts.

United said allowing unvaccinated employees in the workplace would undermine the safety of its flights amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Pittman noted that the company acknowledged there was almost no chance of COVID-19 outbreaks on its planes.
The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected challenges brought by a group of Christian doctors and nurses and an organization that promotes vaccine skepticism to New York's refusal to allow religious exemptions to the state's mandate that healthcare workers be vaccinated against COVID-19.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc chief Elon Musk said on Tuesday the electric carmaker will accept dogecoin as payment for merchandise on a test basis, sending the meme-based cryptocurrency up over 20%.
""Tesla will make some merch buyable with Doge & see how it goes,"" Musk said in a tweet. The carmaker's shares were down 3% in early trading, amid broader market declines. [.N]
Dogecoin, popular among retail investors, raced up to $0.20 after the tweet. Musk's tweets on the cryptocurrency, including the one where he called it the ""people's crypto"", have helped the meme coin soar 5,859% over the past year, according to data from Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) website.
""Elon Musk has been an advocate for the crypto community for many years. His latest announcement will usher in a new era of commerce and trailblaze a path for altcoins to expand their use case,"" said Chris Kline, co-founder of Bitcoin IRA.
Musk did not specify what merchandise, whose prices start from $50 and go as high as $1,900, could be bought with dogecoin. 
Tesla sells apparel, 'Giga Texas' belt buckles and mini models of its vehicles as well as quirky limited-edition items such as the 'Cyberwhistle', which is modeled after its much-awaited Cybertruck. It recently launched a quad bike 'Cyberquad' for kids, also modeled after the truck.
Musk, a cryptocurrency supporter, has often endorsed dogecoin and said it is better for transactions, most recently in an interview to the Time magazine, which named him ""Person of the Year"" for 2021 on Monday.
He had asked users in May if they wanted Tesla to accept dogecoin in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) poll. He had called dogecoin a 'hustle' during his guest-host spot on the ""Saturday Night Live"" comedy sketch TV show in May.
Musk, who has over 66 million followers on Twitter, has been highly engaged in this year's retail trading frenzy, tweeting about cryptocurrencies and helping send their prices soaring.

The EV maker stopped accepting bitcoin for car purchases, less than two months after the company began to accept the world's biggest digital currency for payment.
""This is more or less noise at Tesla,"" Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investment said. ""I view it as being mercurial or just making fun.""

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Tuesday that it handed over 34 airplanes to carriers in November, while adding 109 jets to its 737 MAX order tally.
The delivery tally - closely scrutinized by investors as deliveries generate much-needed cash during the coronavirus crisis - compares with 27 planes in October, and seven in the year ago period when Boeing was in the throes of the 737 MAX safety crises. 
Again in November, Boeing failed to deliver its advanced carbon-composite 787 Dreamliner, which remains mired in inspections and retrofits likely to keep the jets sidelined until April 2022. 
Of the 34 aircraft delivered last month, 28 were 737 MAXplanes - 10 of which were for European low-cost carrier Ryanair. Boeing also turned over one P-8 maritime patrol aircraft to Norway, Boeing said.
The remaining jets were larger widebodies: one 767 apiece for FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) and  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS), one 747-8 for the Egyptian defense ministry, and two 767 tankers for the U.S. Air Force, Boeing said.
During the pandemic, many airlines have been forced to idle unused passenger jets, driving up demand for cargo space on dedicated freighters at a time when e-commerce has been a lifeline for many.
This year through November, Boeing has delivered 302 aircraft, more than twice the 118 aircraft it delivered in the first 11 months of 2020.
Boeing had 91 orders for aircraft in November, after cancellations and instances where a buyer converted an order for one type of aircraft to another.
It had 109 gross orders, all of which were for its 737 MAX jetliner, which returned to service in late 2020 after a near two-year safety ban.
That includes an order for 72 MAX jets from India's Akasa Air, a deal valued at nearly $9 billion at list prices that could help the U.S. planemaker regain lost ground in one of the world's most promising markets.
It also included an order for 30 737 MAX jets for Miami-based 777 Partners, which owns Canadian low-cost carrier Flair Airlines, and a previously undisclosed order for seven 737 MAXs for Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).

At the same time, buyers canceled orders for 18 737 MAX jets.
Gross orders for the year increased from 720 to 829, or from 373 to 457 after cancellations, conversions and stricter accounting standards were applied, Boeing said.

Investing.com – Beyond Meat stock (NASDAQ:BYND) surged 7% Tuesday after Piper Sandler upgraded it after finding out the faux meat-maker’s McPlant will be available at all of McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD)’s U.S. outlets earlier than expected.
The expected launch by end of March is earlier and broader than Piper Sandler had estimated in its model. McDonald’s has around 14,000 outlets in the U.S.
The brokerage upgraded the stock to $64 from its previous target of $61. It touched a high of $68.96 in the session still underway.
Piper’s Michael Lavery now rates the stock neutral. He had rated it underweight.

In comparison, Vroom, Inc. (VRM) in New York City operates an e-commerce platform to buy and sell new and used cars. It also offers financing solutions.
As governments worldwide reinstate lockdown and social distancing measures to limit the spread of the highly transmissible COVID-19 omicron variant, people are again starting to shy away from public transportation. Therefore, the demand for new and used cars is expected to increase despite high prices due to the impact of the global semiconductor shortage on production. This should drive sales by car dealership companies. Furthermore, as semiconductor chip shipments improve and plants return to full working capacity, the high demand for electric cars due to rising oil prices and climate change concerns should drive the industry’s growth.

1246,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 10:31AM ET</span>",Generali CEO to fight shareholder pressure with new plan,"By Gianluca Semeraro and Claudia Cristoferi
MILAN (Reuters) - Philippe Donnet, chief executive of Italy's largest insurer Generali (MI:GASI), will on Wednesday outline a new company strategy to try to fend off a leadership challenge brought by two billionaire investors.
Construction magnate Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and Leonardo Del Vecchio, founder of eyewear giant Luxottica, have opposed the reappointment of Donnet, 61, whose mandate ends in April. 
Donnet is set to meet his previous plan's targets, but is caught in a clash between the two tycoons, respectively Generali's no. 2 and no.3 shareholders, and Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), the biggest Generali investor with a 13% stake.
A good market reception on Wednesday for Donnet's strategy would make it harder for Caltagirone, 78, and Del Vecchio, 86, to unseat the French manager who has led Generali since 2016.
The pair are set to propose their own CEO candidate early next year ahead of a general meeting in April to appoint a new board.
""It looks like we're headed for a proxy fight at the April meeting,"" said Massimo Belcredi, a finance professor at Milan's Cattolica University and head of its FIN-GOV corporate governance research centre.
""The list supported by the board is set to clash with the list backed by two shareholders with a storied past as entrepreneurs who are still firmly at the helm of the companies they founded.""
Belcredi said Generali was one of only a dozen Italian companies that had embraced what is standard practice abroad, whereby directors pick their replacements for shareholders to vote on. In Italy leading shareholders normally submit board lists.
""The Generali case makes it clear that shareholders want to have a say,"" he said.
SNUB
Caltagirone began his offensive in April when he snubbed a meeting to approve Generali's results. In September, he struck a consultation pact with Del Vecchio over a combined 15.6% Generali stake including also smaller investor CRT.
To reduce their influence, Mediobanca borrowed shares to reach a 17% voting stake.
Caltagirone and Del Vecchio have criticised Generali for failing to expand boldly through acquisitions, which they blame on Mediobanca.
In response, Generali pointed to returns exceeding that of its peers under Donnet. Refinitiv data put Generali's total shareholder return at 118% since late 2016, compared with 69% for Allianz (DE:ALVG) and 48% for AXA.
Piling pressure on Mediobanca CEO Alberto Nagel, Caltagirone has built a 3% stake in the Milanese bank, while Del Vecchio became its biggest shareholder since 2019 with nearly 20%. 
The new plan will target further ""disciplined acquisitions"" in Asia and Europe, a person close to the matter said on condition of anonymity.
Asia is a high-growth market but also Europe has significant potential in segments like health and non-motor property and casualty, including cyber risks, the person said.
The plan will also bet on asset management, possibly through acquisitions, and digital investments.
Under the 2019-2021 plan, Donnet has spent three quarters of a 4 billion euro ($4.52 billion) M&A warchest. The largest deal was a 1 billion euro purchase of domestic rival Cattolica.

AMC’s was last trading 1.3% higher after falling as much as 10% at the open. It declined 15% on Monday together with other retail favorites such as  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (NASDAQ:BBBY). and  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME). GameStop and AMC were some of the earliest names chased by amateur retail earlier this year, giving them multifold gains in a short span of time and kicking off the famous meme-stock rally. Gamestop rose 4% on Tuesday, while Bed Bath and Beyond slid 0.3%.
Risky assets and high-flying tech companies have been under pressure recently as the Federal Reserve is seen rolling back some of its pandemic-era stimulus. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., another retail favorite, fell as much as 3.7% taking its overall losses from November 4 peak to $288 billion.
The trend has bigger implications as these investors make up 20% to 30% of trading volume in the U.S., according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). That’s a marked change from 2020 when these so-called retail traders were seen as small-time players dabbling in stock markets.

Investing.com – Neogen Corporation stock (NASDAQ:NEOG) surged 6% Tuesday as the company agreed to merge with 3M's (NYSE:MMM) food safety business.
The combined entity is likely to be worth $9.3 billion, including debt, and have annual revenue of around $1 billion. 3M will receive $1 billion from the deal. The company’s stock was up 1%.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the deal.
3M shareholders will own 50.1% of the new entity while Neogen’s will have 49.9% of it. The transaction is expected to close by the end of September.
Cost-savings from the deal, expected to kick in by the end of year three following the close of transaction, are expected to improve the new company’s margins. Neogen is also expected to benefit from its exposure to highly profitable food safety categories that 3M will hand it over.
The deal is structured as a Reverse Morris Trust, a tax-efficient way for companies to spin off a division. 3M's food safety business will be spun-off or split-off to its shareholders and simultaneously merged with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Neogen.
Neogen’s management team will run the combined company."

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss wealth and asset manager Vontobel plans to open a new wealth management office in Miami as it looks to grab a greater share of the North American market, its chief executive told Reuters.
""Within the U.S., there is a migration of wealth from the North to the South,"" Chief Executive Zeno Staub said in an interview. ""More and more local wealth is going to Florida. We therefore plan to establish a presence in Miami in the coming months.""
The Zurich-based lender, which manages just under 300 billion Swiss francs ($326 billion) for private and institutional investors, is looking to expand in the United States, while also breaking into new markets and using digitalisation to offer its funds to a broader client pool, he said.
Vontobel now manages roughly 4 billion Swiss francs for wealthy U.S. clients in accounts in Zurich and Geneva, as well as through its office in New York.
In Miami, it plans to employ client advisers while booking wealthy individuals' money out of Switzerland, as it does for clients in its New York office.
Within asset management, banks such as Citi, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Santander (MC:SAN) count amongst its key customers.
It is extending its products and funds offering in the United States accordingly, Staub said.
""We've made substantial investments in order to be able to provide a broader product range in the United States,"" he said. ""And we have the ambition to move the needle there in the next few years.""
Vontobel does not see the need to grow the size of its business through M&A, he said.
""Our appetite to make acquisitions just for the sake of increasing volumes is even lower now than it was in the past,"" Staub said, adding the bank would be open to deals in asset management that provide new capabilities.

""In wealth management, we are more interested in access to markets than in pure volume,"" he said.

""We expect double-digit growth in sales in 2021, which is one of the highest growth rates since we went public in 1985,"" he said, adding that the rate has surpassed pre-pandemic levels.
""We are an in even better position in 2021 in regards to revenue and EBITDA than we had expected in 2019, when KKR entered,"" he added, referring to the U.S. fund.
Axel Springer's revenue fell by almost 5%, to 2.97 billion euros, and its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation fell by 13%, to 653.8 million euros, in the first year of the pandemic, according to the company's 2020 financial report, which was seen by Reuters.
The U.S. market has been especially important in powering growth over the past 18 months, he said, and Axel Springer's investments in job application technology firm AppCast and newsletter provider Morning Brew had surpassed expectations.

1252,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 10:15AM ET</span>",Fashion house Chanel hires Unilever consumer goods veteran as CEO,"By Silvia Aloisi and Mimosa Spencer
PARIS (Reuters) -French fashion house Chanel named Leena Nair, an executive from Unilever (NYSE:UL), as its new global CEO on Tuesday, picking a consumer goods veteran to run one of the world's biggest luxury goods groups. 
Nair's career at Unilever spanned 30 years, most recently as the chief of human resources and a member of the company's executive committee. 
A British national, born in India, Nair is a rare outsider at the helm of the tightly controlled family fashion house, known for its tweed suits, quilted handbags and No. 5 perfume. 
The 52-year-old follows U.S. businesswoman Maureen Chiquet, who came from a fashion background and was CEO of Chanel for nine years until early 2016. 
French billionaire Alain Wertheimer, a 73-year-old who owns Chanel with his brother Gerard Wertheimer and had originally taken on the CEO job on a temporary basis, will move to the role of global executive chairman.
Chanel was founded in 1910 by fashion legend Gabrielle ""Coco"" Chanel as a hat boutique on rue Cambon in Paris
and grew to become a byword for French chic.
The group said Nair, who at Unilever oversaw 150,000 people, would join at the end of January and be based in London. It added that the new appointments would ensure its ""long-term success as a private company.""
The recruitment of Nair, who rose through the ranks of Unilever having started out as a trainee on the factory floor, comes as the fashion industry is under pressure to show a more inclusive approach. 
Under her watch Unilever achieved gender parity across global management, according to a Harper's Bazaar profile published last month, which also highlighted her commitment to pay the living wage across the supply chain.
Nair serves as a non-executive board member at BT and has previously served as non-executive director of the British government's business, energy and industrial strategy department.
Chanel has fiercely defended its independence and only began publishing financial results in 2018. It said in July it expects to increase sales by double digits this year compared with their 2019, pre-pandemic level of $12.3 billion.

Bernstein luxury goods analyst Luca Solca said Chanel was following a trend of attracting top executives from the consumer packaged goods industry.
""Unilever and P&G stand tall as management reservoirs for the relatively young luxury goods industry,"" he said, pointing to Antonio Belloni, general manager of LVMH and a former president of Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) in Europe, and  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) head Fabrizio Freda, also a P&G veteran.

The British clothing retailer anticipates that profit for the half-year period will be between 2 million and 2.5 million pounds ($2.65 million to $3.31 million).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Six former chairs of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Monday urged the Biden administration to quickly resolve a dispute over the planned use of 5G wireless spectrum that the aviation industry says poses an air safety risk.
Former FCC chairs Ajit Pai, Tom Wheeler, Julius Genachowski, Michael Copps, Michael Powell and Mignon Clyburn said in a joint letter they were ""concerned"" about the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) recent efforts to revisit the FCC’s 2020 decision to allow use of the C-Band spectrum for wireless use.
The former officials said the agencies should work to ""resolve the FAA’s concerns expeditiously, but this debate should not be fought publicly in a way that undermines consumer confidence in the process.""
Last week, the FAA warned that interference from 5G wireless spectrum could result in flight diversions.
Asked about the former FCC chairs' letter, the FAA said Monday it continues ""to work with federal agencies and the wireless companies so 5G C-band and aviation can safely co-exist.""
The aviation industry and the FAA have raised concerns about potential interference of 5G with sensitive aircraft electronics like radio altimeters. AT&T (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) in November agreed to delay the commercial launch of C-band wireless service until Jan. 5 after the FAA raised concerns.
The FAA issued a pair of airworthiness directives ordering the revision of airplane and helicopter flight manuals to prohibit some operations requiring radio altimeter data when in the presence of 5G C-Band wireless broadband signals.
The FAA remains in discussions with the FCC, White House and industry officials about the precise contours of any limitations, which are expected to be outlined in the coming weeks in a series of notices.

AT&T and Verizon on Nov. 24 said they would adopt precautionary measures for six months to limit interference. But aviation industry groups said they were insufficient to address air safety concerns.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower on Tuesday after another higher-than-expected producer price inflation print reinforced fears that the Federal Reserve will speed up the tightening of monetary policy at its meeting this week.
U.S. producer prices rose 9.6% in the year through November, with a thumping 0.7% monthly rise underlining the fact that this is not just down to base effects from a pandemic-distorted year. Core prices rose 0.7% on the month and by 7.7% on the year. That comes hot on the heels of data last week showing consumer inflation running at a near-40% high.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 44 points, or 0.1% at 35,695 points, but the S&P 500 was down 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.9%, both extending Monday's losses. 
Analysts expect the Fed will accelerate the phase out of its bond purchases, meaning that financial markets could go from seeing $120 billion in liquidity creation a month to zero in as little as three or four months. That tightening of liquidity conditions is likely to push up money market rates even before the Fed starts to raise official ones. 
""For some time now the data has been pointing to a strong and increasingly broad economic recovery in the U.S., and yet the Fed will enter 2022 with rock-bottom rates and asset purchases still in the tens of billions,"" said David Norris, head of U.S. credit at Twenty Four Asset Management. ""The sense that the Fed is behind the curve will be a difficult one to shift.""
Among major movers, Tesla slid further below the $1,000 mark as CEO Elon Musk continued to reduce his holdings. Musk sold another $906 million worth of stock on Monday, according to an SEC filing. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was down 1.4% at $952.52.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock meanwhile inched closer to the $3 trillion valuation mark, rising 0.1% after price target upgrades from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Evercore. 
Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock fell 6.2% after it announced it will the launch of a cut-price version of its key suite of software tools, in what was seen as an admission of weakening pricing power.
GameStop  (NYSE:GME) stock and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock both saw choppy trade, with the former gaining 4.6% a day after it slumped to a 10-month low, and the latter rising 1.6% after being down as much as 13% in premarket. 
Elsewhere,  Oscar Health  (NYSE:OSCR) fell 12% to under $10 a share after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), the lead underwriter at its IPO at $39 only a few months ago, put out a sell note on the company with a price target of $6.50. Another small heathcare stock feeling the strain was Generation Bio (NASDAQ:GBIO) which fell 54% after publishing pre-clinical trial results showing its experimental hemophilia drug still needed extensive ""optimization""."

At least 10 Russian firms could hold IPOs in 2022, extending a listing spree that started a year ago, if their plans are not thwarted by geopolitics, including Ukraine tensions, or other risks, according to bankers and advisers.
Delimobil put its IPO plans on hold in early November, citing market conditions. The company had been planning to raise as much as $240 million in a New York Stock Exchange listing, with a valuation of more than $900 million.
""The company continues to eye a public market listing,"" Delimobil said in a statement shared with Reuters.
Adjusted gross profit was more than five times higher in the third quarter at 1.3 billion roubles compared with the same period of 2020 and Delimobil's adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) had leapt almost 14 times.
CEO Elena Bekhtina put the revenue and EBITDA growth down to its expanded fleet of cars and increased revenue per vehicle.
Founded in 2015, Delimobil is one of Russia's biggest car-sharing providers with a fleet of over 19,000 vehicles and around 7.4 million registered users in 11 cities. It first announced IPO plans in 2019.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Centene Corp reached a deal with activist investment firm Politan Capital Management in which five new directors will join the managed care company's board and its chief executive will retire in 2022 after serving for a quarter of a century.
Six board members will be leaving and Michael Neidorff, 77, who has led  Centene  (NYSE:CNC) since 1996, will retire as CEO next year, the company said. He will become executive chairman but will not keep that position beyond 2022.
Centene in July laid the groundwork for a succession plan when it established its office of the president and Neidorff said recently in public that he would not expect to be renewing his contract as CEO, the company said.
Two of the incoming directors were proposed by Politan, a new firm founded by veteran investor Quentin Koffey. Politan will also have a say in appointing the fifth director who has yet to be named.
Centene's stock price climbed 0.83% in early trading on Tuesday. 
The company said its stock price has outperformed over the last decade, posting a total share return of 774% while the S&P 500 gained 365% and the S&P 500 Health Care Sector Index rose 390%.
At last week's investor day, the company said it expects to add $10 billion in revenue to reach $135 billion for full year 2022, and it said it is on the path to double-digit earnings growth for the next three years. 
The new board will look at internal and external candidates to replace Neidorff, the company said.
As part of a sweeping set of changes, the company will also require board members to retire at age 75. 
Politan owns a roughly $900 million stake in Centene, which is valued at $46 billion. Politan had held discussions with the St. Louis-headquartered company to push for new board members to be added. Koffey, who previously worked at hedge funds Senator Investment Group and DE Shaw, has a reputation for operating behind the scenes and has been credited with helping push Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) Cos to replace executives and board members. 

Centene has previously attracted interest from activist hedge funds when Corvex Management, Sachem Head Capital Management and Third Point all pushed for it to consider selling itself.
Among the incoming directors are Kenneth Burdick, a former chief executive at WellCare Health Plans Inc, which Centene bought last year, and Wayne DeVeydt, a former chief financial officer at health insurer Anthem Inc. Christopher Coughlin and Theodore Samuels will also join the board.

Most fintech companies rose to the challenge amid the pandemic by delivering secure, seamless, and fully digital financial services to consumers at a negligible cost.
Although the Fintech space has benefited dramatically since the onset of the pandemic, it faces intense competition from traditional banks. According to BankDirector’s 2021 Technology Survey, banks have increased their technology spending by a median of 10%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) has bought a minority stake in Nautic Partners, a middle-market private equity firm that invests mainly in healthcare, industrials and services companies, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
One of the world's biggest private equity firms, Blackstone bought the stake through its second GP stakes fund which specializes in buying minority stakes in other funds to cash in both on the target's fees and their profits on investments.
Terms of the deal could not be learned.
Nautic, based in Providence, Rhode Island, was founded in 1986 and has delivered strong returns over time. The firm manages $7.7 billion. 
According to industry research firm Preqin's 2021 ranking, Nautic ranked eighth most consistent top performing buyout fund manager in the world. Three of its funds were ranked in the top quartile, a critical measurement in the private equity industry.
Nautic recently finished raising $3 billion for its tenth private equity fund. Its investment size tends to be between $50 million and $250 million. 
The firm, which had been approached by a number of potential suitors before it came to an agreement with Blackstone, plans to use the liquidity from Blackstone to invest in deals, one of the sources said.
Blackstone recently finished raising a new fund and its Strategic Capital Holdings II fund closed last month with $5.6 billion in investor capital.
Blackstone is among a small number of companies that have built a booming business in taking minority stakes in other private equity firms.

While the trend began a few years ago as a number of senior partners wanted to exit the businesses they founded, the trend has picked up speed as the new leaders want to expand into different businesses or they need money to hire new employees.
Blue Owl, which runs Dyal, Blackstone and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' Petershill Partners are the three largest players in the so-called GP stakes business and all recently raised billions of dollars for new funds.

However, the stock has slumped in price over the past year and recently hit its 52-week low after the company posted a disappointing quarterly report. So, is the stock an ideal addition now to one’s portfolio? Let’s discuss.Artificial intelligence-focused software company C3.ai, Inc. (AI) offers software-as-a-service applications for enterprises. The Redwood (NYSE:RWT) City, Calif.-based company recently announced a new five-year Production-Other Transaction Agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). “We are thrilled to have been selected for these important initiatives and look forward to expanding our work and finding new ways to better serve the U.S. federal government,” said Thomas M. Siebel, CEO of C3 AI. Furthermore, in its most recent quarter, AI also diversified its enterprise AI production footprint across several industries and continued to innovate with C3 AI Data Vision delivery.
Shares of AI have declined 74.1% in price over the past year and 75.8% year-to-date. Over the past month, the stock has slumped 27% to close yesterday’s trading session at $32.35. In November, a large insider sale amid other factors helped trigger the broader sell-off. CEO Thomas Siebel sold 615,488 shares at prices ranging from $46.96 to $51.20, with his total transaction amounting to $29,762,880.
Despite beating consensus estimates in its last reported quarter and raising its guidance, the stock sold off 17% on the release. And the company’s bottom line remains bleak. Its non-GAAP net loss per share came in at $0.23, versus analysts’ expectations of $0.28. The stock hit its 52-week low of $27.52 on December 2 after the company posted its earnings report. Following that, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) downgraded the company to Underperform, citing disappointing subscription revenues and a sequential decline in Remaining Performance Obligations. Wedbush lowered its price target to $45 from $70, while J.P. Morgan analyst Mark Murphy slashed his target price to $43 from $53, keeping an Underweight rating. According to some U.S. software analysts, the company’s losses could widen further, and it might take some time for the company to hit its breakeven point and improve margins.

1265,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 08:21AM ET</span>",UK regulator says Google and Apple hold 'vice-like' grip on consumers,"LONDON (Reuters) -Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) hold a ""vice-like"" grip over how people use mobile phones, stripping any meaningful choice from the system and potentially hiking costs, Britain's competition regulator said on Tuesday. 
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had provisionally found that the two groups were able to leverage their market power to create largely self-contained ecosystems. 
The statement is a fresh warning to tech groups after the regulator, with British government backing, stepped up scrutiny of the power they wield in a world increasingly lived online. 
It recently told Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta it had to sell Giphy, the popular animated images platform it bought in 2020.
The regulator said on Tuesday it would consult on its initial Apple and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) findings and would welcome responses by Feb. 7. It expects to issue a final report by June.
""Apple and Google have developed a vice-like grip over how we use mobile phones and we're concerned that it's causing millions of people across the UK to lose out,"" CMA Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli said.
Chris Philp, the tech and digital economy minister, said Britain's ""new pro-competition regime"" would level the playing field between tech giants and smaller businesses. 
Apple says its ecosystems provide security and privacy, enabling businesses to sell goods and create jobs. ""Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish,"" it said.
Google said Android provided people with more choice than any other mobile platform in deciding which apps and app stores they use. 
It said its ecosystem supported almost a quarter of a million jobs in Britain, and as a result of recent changes, 99% of developers qualified for a service fee of 15% or less. 
""We're committed to building thriving, open platforms that empower consumers and help developers succeed,"" it said.

The CMA's report set out a range of options , including making it easier for users to switch between Apple's iOS and Google's Android phones without losing functionality or data. 
It is also looking at whether users could install apps through methods other than Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store.

The deal gives the unit, which makes products for pathogen testing and allergen detection, an enterprise value of about $5.3 billion, including $1 billion in new debt.
3M, the biggest U.S. producer of N95 masks, will receive about $1 billion.
""This transaction further evolves our strategy, focuses our health care business and benefits our stakeholders,"" 3M Chief Executive Officer Mike Roman said in a statement. 
The industrial conglomerate, which also makes Post-It notes and industrial sandpaper, had tapped advisors last year for a potential sale of the unit, Bloomberg reported.
Shares of Neogen climbed 6% premarket, while those of 3M rose 1.29%.
Neogen boss John Adent will lead the combined company, which will be 50.1% owned by 3M and is expected to have an enterprise value of about $9.3 billion.
The deal is being structured as a Reverse Morris Trust, a strategic way to divest a division tax-free.

1267,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 08:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive-HSBC says clients must have plan to exit coal by end-2023,"By Lawrence White and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) -HSBC, Europe's leading banker to corporate Asia, laid out its long-awaited policy on financing thermal coal on Tuesday, and said it expected all its clients to have a plan in place to exit the fossil fuel by the end of 2023.
Coal is contentious for governments across Asia as they look to move away from the cheap and widely used, but carbon-intensive energy source to help meet a global commitment to cut emissions in the fight against climate change.
Under its plan, HSBC will cut exposure to thermal coal financing by at least 25% by 2025 and 50% by 2030, although non-EU or non-OECD-based clients could be funded until a global phase-out by 2040, its sustainability chief told Reuters.
However, groups which had campaigned for HSBC to issue an explicit policy on thermal coal said the bank's plan did not go far enough and still lacked sufficient ""urgency"".
Building on an existing pledge not to finance new coal-fired power plants or thermal coal mines, HSBC said its policy would help phase out existing coal use in line with the science of climate change and be reviewed annually.
""We need to tackle some of the hard issues head on. Coal is one of the big issues. It contributes 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions,"" HSBC Group Chief Sustainability Officer Celine Herweijer said.
""It's not good enough to have a policy on no new coal. We need to turn our attention to the urgent phase-out of coal alongside the scientific timelines.""
As one of Europe's largest banks and with exposure to the industry in emerging markets in Asia and elsewhere, HSBC has faced pressure from investors and activists to cut funding to those using coal, the dirtiest of fossil fuels.
Jeanne Martin, senior campaign manager at ShareAction, a group that aims to improve corporate action on environmental, social and governance issues, said the fact HSBC had introduced a coal phase-out policy was in itself a victory for shareholder engagement with banks on climate, but more was needed.
""Whilst an important step forward, the policy lacks the urgency and rigour required to avert the climate crisis,"" she said.
MAIN DRIVER OF GLOBAL WARMING
At the most-recent round of global climate talks https://www.reuters.com/article/climate-un-idCNL1N2S405F in Scotland last month, governments for the first time acknowledged that fossil fuels were the main driver of global warming, although coal-dependent countries, including India and China, would only agree to ""phase down"" coal-fired power. 
While HSBC, in common with peers, had previously set out a high-level commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions across its customer base by 2050, activists had criticised the strength and detail of its policies.
That prompted some investors to back a planned shareholder vote on the issue at the company's annual meeting this year, although they withdrew the threat after the company pledged to release details on coal by the end of this year.
In a victory for campaigners, HSBC said its new policy would apply to all parts of its business, including its $621 billion asset management arm, and cover all aspects of financing, including refinancing and advisory services.
The bank said it would next year announce a science-based target for coal-fired power in line with capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial averages, with progress on cutting thermal coal financing to be published annually.
The bank said it would withdraw services from any client that seeks to expand thermal coal production after Jan. 1, 2021, and would no longer finance clients in EU/OECD markets for which thermal coal makes up more than 40% of revenues, or 30% from 2025, unless the money is explicitly used for clean technology or infrastructure.
While peers including Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) and Natwest have set tougher targets, HSBC is more exposed to energy clients with a heavy reliance on coal and says it needs to work with them to help them shift to greener energy.
""What will make or break the world's ability to get to this 1.5 degree target is... (for) the energy transition in Asia to happen at the speed and scale it needs to happen, and we need to be at the heart of influencing that."" 
For clients outside the EU and OECD, HSBC said it would evaluate their transition plans before deciding whether to offer finance, acknowledging the infrastructure, policy and resource obstacles many face compared to developed market peers.
HSBC said it expects clients to publish their own transition plans, although campaigners, including ShareAction, have previously said such language would leave HSBC too much wiggle room.

The ""spirit of the policy"" would also cover intermediaries and the parent group of any client that falls outside the policy, and HSBC would ask for a commitment that no finance flowed to that entity, Herweijer said.
""We are not expecting every client to have a credible transition plan... in those cases, we will have to move away from those relationships,"" Herweijer said.

Investing.com – Apple stock (NASDAQ:AAPL) traded 0.7% higher at $176.90 in premarket Tuesday, a sign the $3-trillion market-cap tag may elude the company for one more day amid broader weakness in the indices.
The stock touched a lifetime high of $182.09 Monday to reach a market cap of $2.98 trillion, before closing 2% lower at a valuation of $2.88 trillion.
The stock, already the most valued in the world, needs to touch $182.86 to hit the coveted mark. It's only four years since the company became the world's first trillion-dollar enterprise.
Today’s strength in the stock follows a raft of upgrades by brokerages.
BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan has upgraded it to ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’ with a target of $210, up from $160. The analyst expects Apple to introduce an augmented reality/virtual reality headset, by early 2023.
The analyst also expects a stronger iPhone upgrade cycle in financial year 2023 driven by the need for higher connectivity where ""AR becomes the killer app for 5G."" Mohan sees higher growth coming in from services. He expects the company to charge more for more immersive AR/VR-enabled apps.
In another upgrade, Evercore’s Amit Daryanani raised the firm's target on Apple to $200 from $180, maintaining his ‘outperform’ on the shares.

LONDON (Reuters) -Pepco Group, owner of European discount retailer brands PEPCO, Poundland and Dealz, said on Tuesday it would enter the German market in 2022 as it reported a 46% jump in annual core profit, after it opened new stores.
Pepco, which listed on the Warsaw stock market in May with a valuation of 5 billion euros ($5.7 billion), now trades from more than 3,500 stores in 17 countries, employing 40,000 people.
Chief Executive Andy Bond said the group planned to accelerate growth in Spain, Italy and Austria in the 2021-22 financial year that began on Oct. 1 and would also open a small number of stores in Germany, probably in the spring.
He said Italy and Spain had a market size the same as eastern Europe, where the group has a major presence, while the German market was the same size as Spain and Italy put together.
""By having confidence in Spain and Italy we've doubled the size of our market opportunity. If we make Germany work we'll have tripled the size of our market opportunity,"" Bond told Reuters, adding that he saw potential across the whole of Europe. 
Pepco said its underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) came in at 647 million euros ($730 million) in the year ended Sept. 30, in line with guidance. Revenue rose 19.3% on a constant currency basis to 4.12 billion euros as it opened 483 new stores.
The group said it continued to face commodity inflation and higher shipping costs alongside supply chain disruption at the start of its new financial year. But it said it could mitigate the impact.
It said it was monitoring the emerging new wave of COVID cases across Europe that had resulted in new government-mandated restrictions in some of its operating territories.
""Based on our understanding of the current level of COVID impact on revenue and costs we are confident in delivering full-year profit growth in line with historic levels,"" it said.
The group's shares, priced at 40 zlotys ($9.77) at the IPO, were trading at 48.2 zlotys at 1128 GMT, down 1.4%.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -A key European Parliament committee agreed on Tuesday to a ban on ""dark patterns"" that trick web users and advertising targeting minors as part of new rules aimed at U.S. tech giants, taking a tougher stand that could spell trouble in forthcoming negotiations with EU countries.
The Digital Services Act (DSA), a proposal from EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, forces Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta to do more to tackle illegal content on their platforms or risk fines up to 6% of global turnover.
Vestager's proposal needs to be ironed out with EU countries and lawmakers next year before it can become law, the first of its kind in the world. 
The Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee's position, which needs the green light from Parliament next month, includes a ban on dark patterns, which mislead people into giving personal data to companies online.
The committee also agreed to a ban on targeted advertising for minors, extensive rules that requires online platforms to be more transparent on their algorithms and identification requirements for porn platforms.
""We are moving in the direction where we get the algorithms to play by the democratic rulebook, they haven't done so today but they will do in future,"" Christel Schaldemose, a lawmaker who is steering the DSA through Parliament, told Reuters. 
""We are doing lots of things to reduce the risks on democracy, we have done a lot of things in order to make it easier, more safe for consumers, we have created a level playing field for companies using the platforms,"" she said.
EU lawmaker Dita Charanzova said the draft rules addressed issues raised by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen.
""Not only will they (online platforms) have to remove illegal content, but will have to assess the real harms that come from their services for minors and general civil discourse,"" she told Reuters.

Tech lobbying group CCIA, whose members include Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, called for a compromise during the January vote on the committee's position.
""We caution that further work is needed on marketplace obligations, user redress, and data disclosure to law enforcement and researchers,"" it said in a statement.

1272,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 07:23AM ET</span>","Pfizer Weaker Amid Mixed News on Vaccine, Covid Pill","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com –  Pfizer  stock (NYSE:PFE) traded 0.7% lower in premarket Tuesday amid conflicting news surrounding its Covid-19 vaccine and its yet-to-be-launched antiviral pill for the same disease.
The stock was volatile, and after being down around 2% at one time in premarket, recouped some losses.
Depressing the stock were the findings of a real-world study in South Africa that said the two doses of the vaccine appear to give only 70% protection against hospitalization in South Africa, suggesting weaker efficacy against the new Omicron variant.
Labelled ""of concern"" by the World Health Organization, Omicron has been reported in more than 60 countries, including China, and now dominates the Delta variant in many nations.
The study released by South Africa's largest private health insurance administrator, Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Health, was based on more than 211,000 positive Covid test results. Around 78,000 of those results between November 15 and December 7 were attributed to Omicron.
According to Reuters, the 78,000 results are not confirmed Omicron cases, meaning the findings are not conclusive.
Partly balancing the findings was the company’s claim that its pill against the infection has near 90% efficacy in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients. The company is expecting its pill to be another blockbuster after the success of its vaccine.  
The company said recent lab data suggests the antiviral retains its effectiveness against Omicron.
The pill awaits the FDA’s authorization. If approved, it would be the most effective pill in the market, easily surpassing Merck's (NYSE:MRK) 30% efficacy, which is also awaiting approval from the FDA."
1273,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 07:18AM ET</span>","Goldman, JPMorgan Plan Bumper Bonuses to Get Edge in Deal Boom","(Bloomberg) -- The two Wall Street investment-banking titans dominating this year’s dealmaking frenzy are opening up their wallets to try to keep their bankers happy -- and ratcheting up pressure on rivals to follow suit. 
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). may boost its bonus pool for investment banking by about 50%, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) may reach for a 40% increase, according to people with knowledge of their initial deliberations. The business, which covers merger-and-acquisition advisory as well as underwriting groups, is poised for the biggest windfalls after recent meetings to set pay for the year, the people said, asking not to be named discussing internal talks.
Across Wall Street, bosses are under mounting pressure to be more generous after tempering raises at the end of 2020 amid concerns that a surge in business set off by the pandemic might not last. Now, with signs pointing to yet another robust year ahead, senior executives are facing workers who, in many cases, feel that they’re owed and ready to jump to competitors if their employers skimp.
“You are paying for retention and not just paying for performance,” said Eric Dobkin, the veteran banker who spent almost half a century at Goldman Sachs before retiring in 2016. “This year, the firms may well have to overpay to keep the people they most want.”
Dobkin helped shape the modern IPO market and espoused the value of a firm’s brand in winning deals over the singular skill of individuals, a view embraced by a number of current Wall Street leaders. One former underling recalls Dobkin’s colorful repartees to bankers that included stingers like: “My dog in a Goldman Sachs T-shirt would win that business.”
At Goldman, the banking group led by Dan Dees and Jim Esposito posted a 63% jump in revenue in 2021’s first nine months from the same period last year. That helped push the company’s total revenue and profit beyond any level it’s ever achieved in a full year.
At JPMorgan’s investment bank, the jump in fees was 42% for the first nine months. In the fourth quarter, investment-banking fees will probably surge 35% from a year earlier, JPMorgan’s Daniel Pinto said at a conference last week. That would make the period one of the best ever for the firm’s bankers, and still the pipeline “looks quite strong into next year across M&A, debt and equity,” Pinto said. Executives have been discussing increasing the bonus pool by 30% or even 40%, one of the people said.
Representatives for the two banks declined to comment.
Both firms have surged ahead of third-place  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in pocketing fees from clients this year. Goldman racked up more than $11 billion and JPMorgan almost $10 billion by the end of September, when Morgan Stanley stood shy of $8 billion.
The frenzy for those mandates has set off a surge in poaching among investment banks and driven up employee turnover, as firms picked off each other’s talent with promises of better paychecks, more prominent titles or at least more flexible lifestyles. By October, banks including JPMorgan and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). were warning shareholders that compensation costs may rise in the months ahead.
At Goldman Sachs, this year marks something of a reversal from 2009, when the firm last posted record revenue. That year, as investment bankers struggled to find mandates, some members of the fixed-income group reaped double or triple their previous paydays as they capitalized on a market rebound from 2008. 
This year, fixed-income traders, seen as one of the last remaining bastions of risk-taking at U.S. banks, will probably see bonuses stagnate as their business slumps from last year’s lucrative trading environment.

LONDON (Reuters) -JPMorgan's British retail bank Chase is planning to hire hundreds more staff next year to take staff numbers above 1,000 to help it roll out investment, savings and consumer lending products, the boss of the venture told Reuters.
The fledgling bank – U.S. giant JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s first overseas consumer bank – has already handled hundreds of millions of pounds of purchases across more than a million transactions, lifted by a spending splurge in the run up to Christmas, the bank said. 
The venture is a test case for the lender as CEO Jamie Dimon considers expanding its huge U.S. retail banking franchise globally through a digital platform. 
Sanoke Viswanathan, head of JPMorgan's international consumer business, said the venture had hired 200 staff since launching in September to take its headcount to 800, and planned to hire hundreds more next year as it expands its product range.
JPMorgan plans to replicate the Chase model in other markets across continental Europe in the next few years, he said.
""We had a plan, and we are definitely ahead of it,"" Viswanathan said. ""We want to be in all the major European markets over time, all being well. The idea is to be pan-European.""
In Britain, the bank plans to expand into investment and savings services by integrating its acquired digital wealth manager Nutmeg, before a push into consumer lending. 
Building out new services will help it make a profit over time, but Chase is expected to be loss-making for several years in the meantime, Viswanathan said.
New hires will be across the business, including in its London headquarters and customer support centres in Edinburgh and Manila in the Philippines.
Viswanathan declined to disclose Chase's customer numbers but said sign-ups had exceeded internal expectations and reaffirmed its expansion plans.

JPMorgan was prepared to launch a ring-fenced UK retail bank if required rather than slow its growth, Viswanathan added. Banks currently have to run any retail bank with 25 billion pounds or more of deposits on a standalone basis, although this rule is under review.
""We'll deal with the consequences if we have to,"" Viswanathan said. ""The UK bank wasn't set up to help fund the investment bank. This is a genuine foray into retail banking for the long term.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening slightly lower Tuesday, continuing the fragile start to the week as Omicron fears hit sentiment ahead of the start of the latest Federal Reserve meeting.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was flat, while S&P 500 Futures traded 12 points, or 0.3%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 100 points, or 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 320 points, or 0.9%, on Monday, the S&P 500 fell 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite closed 1.4% lower as investors rotated out of dumped technology stocks with high valuations.
The major averages posted strong gains last week, but some of the optimism generated by studies suggesting the new variant will not be as dangerous as previous versions dissipated Monday with the news from the U.K. of an Omicron-related death. In addition, China confirmed its first case of the new strain. Omicron's high transmissibility promises to be a stiff challenge to the country's zero-tolerance policy of Covid-19. While Europe and the U.S. appear unlikely to close their factories due to its spread, China's policy to date suggests it will be more open to the idea.
Elsewhere, a study out of the University of Oxford indicated that two doses of the currency Covid vaccines are substantially less effective at warding off the Omicron variant than previous versions, and a booster shot was needed to improve immunity.
That said, investors’ focus Tuesday will be on the start of the Fed’s two-day policy-setting meeting, with the central bank policymakers expected to discuss speeding up the phase-out of their bond-buying and possibly signal an earlier start to a new cycle of rate hikes. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said as much last month in Congressional hearings, and since then data has emerged showing consumer prices rising 6.8% year on year in November, the largest jump in 30 years.
Market expectations now foresee an end to quantitative easing by March and a first 25 basis point rate hike by June. 
Ahead of the meeting, November U.S. producer prices are due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), and are expected to have risen by 0.5% on the month, a surge of 9.2% on the year.
In the corporate sector, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is likely to be in the spotlight after the iPhone maker’s stock climbed to a lifetime high of $182.09 on Monday, resulting in a market cap of $2.98 trillion. The company is already the most valuable in the world and could be the first company to hit the $3 trillion mark in market value.
Elsewhere, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop (NYSE:GME), two of the most prominent 'meme stocks' of 2021, look set to extend Monday’s sharp losses as retail investors appear to desert them.
Oil prices drifted after the International Energy Agency cut its forecast for oil demand in the first quarter of next year by 600,000 barrels a day, saying crude markets have returned to surplus and face an even bigger oversupply issue early next year as the Omicron variant impedes international travel. 
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures edged higher to $71.31 a barrel, while the Brent contract gained slightly to $74.43.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,785.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1319.

Russian car dealer Keyauto on Dec. 13 became the latest firm to confirm its intention to float shares, shortly after banking sources told Reuters that fertiliser producer EuroChem could raise more than $1 billion in a 2022 IPO.
Several others are expected to follow in a continued flurry of activity set in motion by the IPO of state shipping company Sovcomflot last October.
But Russia is not immune to market fluctuations. Gold miners GV Gold and Nordgold, car-sharing firm Delimobil and convenience store chain Mercury Retail Group all postponed IPOs this year. 
Below is an overview of major market debuts by Russian companies: 
2021
* Four companies listed in the autumn of 2021. In November, SPB Exchange, Russia's second-largest bourse raised around $175 million in an IPO on its own platform. Real estate database Cian raised more than $290 million in a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.
* IT company Softline raised $400 million in a London listing in October, shortly after Renaissance Insurance raised $250 million in Moscow. 
* In the first half of 2021, three companies staged market debuts. Cut-price retailer Fix Price's dual listing in London and Moscow raised almost $2 billion in March, making it the biggest Russian IPO since Western sanctions were introduced in 2014. 
* Forestry group Segezha (Moscow Exchange; equivalent of $402 million), and healthcare provider EMC (NYSE:EMC) (Moscow Exchange; $500 million) followed suit in April and July.
* Kismet Acquisition One Corp, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), completed a deal with video game developer Nexters to start trading Nexters Inc. shares on the Nasdaq in August. It was the first deal involving a company from Russia and a Russian SPAC to list shares in the United States.
2019-2020
* The two major listings in 2020 were online retailer Ozon (Nasdaq; $990 million) in November and Sovcomflot (Moscow Exchange; $550 million) in October. Sovcomflot's IPO marked the first major stock exchange flotation in Moscow in three years.
* Other IPOs in 2019-2020 were Samolet (Moscow Exchange; $38.2 million), Headhunter (Nasdaq; $220 million), Kismet Acquisition One Corp (Nasdaq; $250 million), Don Agro (Singapore; $3.6 million) and Gemabank (Moscow Exchange; $2.4 million).

1277,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 06:46AM ET</span>","At least 10 Russian companies considering IPOs in 2022, advisers say","By Andrey Ostroukh and Alexander Marrow
MOSCOW (Reuters) - At least 10 Russian companies could hold an initial public offering (IPO) in 2022, extending the listing spree that started a year ago if geopolitics, including Ukraine tensions, and other risks do not thwart their plans, bankers and advisors said.
After a barren few years, IPO activity gained pace in Russia thanks to a post-pandemic economic recovery, a global stock market surge and the growing number of retail investors.
Russian companies raised around $7 billion in IPO and secondary listings in 2021 versus more than $6 billion in 2020, according to Reuters calculations, and this figure could rise in 2022, although COVID-19 lockdowns and military escalation in Ukraine are among the potential hazards.
About 25 Russian companies are actively preparing for an IPO but the number of actual listings could be smaller, said Tom Blackwell, chairman of PR and consultancy firm EM that took part in all but one Russian listing in 2021.
Investment bankers are taking a more conservative view, without disclosing names of IPO candidates.
""More than 10 companies are now considering potential IPO in 2022,"" said Boris Kvasov, co-head of equity capital markets at VTB Capital, the investment arm of Russia's No. 2 lender VTB.
Evgeny Sokolsky, head of investment at BCS Global Markets, said companies from the agriculture, home building, and pharmaceutical sectors, as well as spin-offs of large companies could be IPO candidates. He also sees at least 10 candidates for a 2022 IPO.
""A couple of them will definitely do an international listing,"" said Arthur Valiullin, partner at Da Vinci Capital equity management.
Tech and consumer-focused companies are among likely candidates for IPOs as they seek extra capital and ride the wave of booming demand from retail investors that became ""a very real source of liquidity,"" Blackwell said.
The Russian market is still young and small compared with major global peers. But it ""offers a good hedge against accelerated global inflation and an attractive valuation, with most of the blue-chips trading at 30-40% discounts to global peers,"" Aton brokerage said.
Still, the market is volatile and vulnerable to global risks, such as the new coronavirus strain Omicron. Russia's benchmark MOEX index has shed over 15% since hitting a record high of 4,292.68 in mid-October. 
""Many clients are hoping to come out with listings on the back of the full-year numbers but we are all waiting to see whether there are globally coordinated actions by central banks on inflation as well as to address Omicron,"" said Alina Sychova, head of capital markets at Sova Capital.

Russia specific risk is its stand-off with the West. Fears about Russia's military buildup near Ukraine caused a sell-off in Russian bonds and stocks in November.
""A serious geopolitical escalation like a massive development in war is the kind of thing that makes the IPO market go away... But I don't think we'll see this going ahead in a way that some people seem to be concerned about in the Western world,"" Blackwell said.

1278,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 06:42AM ET</span>",COVID-19 rattles major Chinese manufacturing province,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Multiple companies have suspended operations in one of China's biggest and busiest manufacturing hubs as authorities double down to contain a COVID-19 outbreak, halting some production of goods from batteries and clothing to textile dyes and plastics. 
Zhejiang has reported 217 locally transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms in just eight days since the first case on Dec. 6. Prior to the current outbreak, it had reported just one local case this year. 
Tens of thousands are in quarantine and some domestic flights have been suspended as a national health official said the outbreak in three cities - Ningbo, Shaoxing and Hangzhou - was developing at a ""relatively rapid"" speed.
The three cities accounted for more than 50% of the province's economic output of around 6.46 trillion yuan ($1.02 trillion) last year. Many of Zhejiang's goods are for export.
At least 20 listed companies including Zhejiang Mustang Battery Co, Guobang Pharma Ltd and textile dyes maker Zhejiang Runtu Co have shut operations in virus-hit areas in Zhejiang, which accounts for around 6% of China's GDP. 
The companies said they halted operations in line with local government orders in Zhenhai district in Ningbo and Shangyu district in Shaoxing, which curtailed all production bar essential manufacturing. 
The orders cover all companies in the affected areas, but only listed firms are required to disclose any impact on their business. 
Ningbo Mengheng Costume Accessories Ltd, an unlisted maker of garment materials, has shut all of its factories in Zhenhai, said a staffer at the company's logistics department. 
""[The firm] could not sign new contracts as [it is] worried that they not be delivered on time,"" the staffer told Reuters, citing the outbreak's impact on the firm's supply chain. 
FACTORIES SHUT
Ningbo-based Mustang Battery said the production suspension was a temporary measure that ""will not have a long-term negative impact on the company's growth"".
Zhejiang Runtu said all its units in the Zhejiang Shangyu Economic Development Zone (SEDZ), which accounts for 95% of its revenue, had been halted since Dec. 9 and it expected a negative impact on its fourth-quarter results. 
There are more than 350 industrial enterprises in the zone, which is located near the cities of Ningbo, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Suzhou and Wenzhou.
Ningbo Homelink Eco-Itech Co, Zhejiang Zhongxin Fluoride Materials Co, Zhejiang Jingsheng Mechanical & Electrical Co and Zhejiang Fenglong Electric Co have also suspended work in affected areas. 
Major industries in Zhenhai, which has a port, include manufacturing of precision machinery and chemicals. The district also hosts factories with investments by over 700 foreign companies including LG Electronics Inc and Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp, according to the Zhenhai government's website. 
Sinopec (NYSE:SHI)'s Zhenhai Refining and Chemicals, the biggest oil refinery in China, said on Tuesday it was maintaining a high operational rate despite tightened COVID measures.
PROVINCE ON ALERT
While the factory closures are limited to certain districts, the general public in Zhejiang face broader restrictions. 
Cities such as Huzhou and Jiaxing, which have not reported cases from the outbreak, have shut various indoor entertainment venues and pledged to avoid unnecessary conferences and events. 
Wenzhou, so far without cases, has been conducting outbreak prevention drills in recent weeks so that the government is ready to seal up affected areas and launch a testing scheme once infection is detected, a local government official told Reuters.

""After all, Wenzhou is not a big city and COVID-19 prevention work remains a top priority,"" the official said on condition of anonymity.
More than 50,000 people have been quarantined at centralised facilities across the coastal province of 64.4 million, while about another half a million people were being monitored.

1279,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 06:36AM ET</span>",Analysis: Murdoch emails loom large in billion-dollar election lawsuits against Fox News,"By Helen Coster and Jan Wolfe
(Reuters) - Did Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch influence Fox News’ coverage of claims about two voting technology companies — knowing that those claims were false?
That has become a significant question in defamation lawsuits filed by Smartmatic and Dominion Voting Systems Corp against Fox News and its parent company Fox Corp. The plaintiffs are asking for more than $4 billion in damages from the media giant, on-air talent such as Maria Bartiromo and guests including Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, lawyers aligned with former U.S. President Donald Trump. 
Smartmatic and Dominion are seeking communications from Fox Corp Chairman Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, the company's executive chairman and chief executive, to help prove that Fox News either knew statements it aired were false, or acted with reckless disregard for whether they were true or false. 
That is the standard of “actual malice,” which public figures must prove in order to prevail in defamation cases. 
It is just one component of Dominion and Smartmatic’s efforts to show that Fox News, hosts and guests either knew or should have known they were amplifying bogus claims. The voting firms have also alleged that individuals who made the claims on-air knew they were false or recklessly ignored easily available evidence that they were false. 
Fox News has moved to dismiss the lawsuits, saying it reported on matters of paramount public concern, and that this coverage is protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 
A representative for Fox News declined to comment on behalf of the company and Bartiromo. A representative for Fox Corp and lawyers representing Giuliani and Bartiromo did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement a lawyer for Powell described the lawsuits as ""without merit."" 
Bartiromo, Powell and Giuliani, like other defendants, have argued in court filings that they engaged in free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
In the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, Trump allies like Giuliani, a Republican, appeared on Fox News and falsely claimed Dominion and Smartmatic software may have manipulated vote counts in favor of Democratic opponent Joe Biden. 
Other Fox News coverage after the election refuted those claims, as did two Murdoch-controlled newspapers — the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post. 
According to Dominion and Smartmatic, that Wall Street Journal and New York Post coverage is evidence that Fox News was amplifying election conspiracy theories its leaders knew, or should have known, were false.
“It demonstrates the availability of accurate information that the defendants chose to ignore,” said Erik Connolly, a lawyer for Smartmatic, in an interview. “It wasn't that hard for them to figure out that what they were saying was inaccurate.”
In a Nov. 8 court filing, Dominion alleged that the Murdochs “intentionally disregarded the facts in their own newspaper and did nothing to stop Fox’s dissemination of lies about Dominion.” 
Legal experts say that there does not appear to be precedent for Dominion and Smartmatic’s strategy of showing actual malice in part by seeking communication from top executives, and that their efforts to hold guests and hosts accountable is a more traditional strategy.
In legal filings and court hearings, Fox News has asserted that actual malice hinges on the state of mind of the individuals who made the claims about the election. In its motion to dismiss Dominion’s lawsuit, Fox News lawyers cited a 2013 case from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In that case, the court ruled that when there are multiple people involved in an organization's publication of an allegedly defamatory statement, the plaintiff must prove that the person responsible for publishing that statement acted with actual malice. 
Lyrissa Lidsky, a media law scholar and the dean of the University of Missouri School of Law, said the plaintiffs’ strategy of seeking the Murdochs’ communication is unusual because the owner of a newspaper, for example, does not typically make the day-to-day decisions about what to publish and therefore would not know if a statement was false or was made with reckless disregard for its falsity. 
If the cases survive the motions to dismiss, as four legal experts have said is likely, Dominion and Smartmatic would then start seeking emails and other communications and testimony. 
Dominion said in a September court filing that it has requested internal Fox News documents, including emails, text messages, and notes exchanged between employees who produced segments about Dominion. An unnamed Fox representative testified on Dec. 8 about the company's internal communications systems. 

It is possible that Fox executives may have put in writing communication that could be used against them in these cases, says William & Mary Law School professor Timothy Zick. 
“This strikes me as relevant evidence — something the plaintiffs will likely be entitled to,” Zick said.

Investing.com --  BT Group (LON:BT) shares plunged on Tuesday as the market reacted sourly to news of Patrick Drahi raising his stake in the U.K. telecoms group.
The Franco-Israeli billionaire’s Altice U.K. increased its stake in BT to 18% from 12.1% to become its largest shareholder. But Drahi has refused to make a takeover offer for the company, disappointing the hopes of some investors who had expected a formal bid.
In a statement, the company said, “Altice U.K. has restated its position to the board of BT that it does not intend to make an offer for BT.”
Drahi insisted that he had engaged constructively with BT’s board and management and looked forward to continuing a dialogue with them.
BT said in a statement that it will “continue to operate the business in the interest of all shareholders and remains focused on the successful execution of its strategy and building on recent performance momentum.”
BT shares are currently trading roughly where they were at the start of the pandemic, but have lost nearly two-thirds of their value since peaking in 2015, due to the heavy cost of rolling out 5G infrastructure, and a widening deficit in its company pension plan."
1282,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 05:55AM ET</span>",Chinese smartphone maker Oppo unveils self-developed chip for phones,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese smartphone maker Oppo unveiled on Tuesday a new self-developed chip, as the hardware company moves further into the semiconductor sector.
The chip, called the MariSilicon X, is a neural processing unit (NPU) that improves images for video and photography taken on smartphones.
It will be manufactured using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 6-nanometre process technology and will be placed in the company's upcoming Find X series of smartphones, set to hit the market in early 2022.
Oppo is one of China's top phone brands, occupying 21% of the domestic market as of the third quarter of 2021, according to research firm Canalys.
The company is owned by BBK Electronics, which also owns Vivo, another top-selling Chinese smartphone brand. The two companies compete for customers, but have an overlapping supply chain.
Both firms are investing heavily in the chip sector. In addition to MariSilicon X, Oppo has also developed a power management chip that it uses for some of its chargers.
In September, Vivo announced it had developed an image signal processor chip (ISP) it will use in its phones.
The chip efforts dovetail with a government push for Chinese companies to boost the country's domestic chip sector, which for decades has lagged behind that of the United States and other East Asian economies.
The need for a self-sufficient chip industry came to light last year when U.S. sanctions against Shenzhen-based Huawei Technologies Co Ltd prevented the company from sourcing key components.

The measures crippled the company's smartphone division as well as its in-house chip division HiSilicon, once the only Chinese unit developing smartphone processors that could rival those of Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc.
Governments and companies around the world have been scrambling to boost semiconductor production after a global shortage hit manufacturing in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - German supplier of chemicals and materials used in making semiconductors, Merck KGaA, announced on Tuesday it is to invest 500 million euros in Taiwan over the next five to seven years, primarily in semiconductor technologies.
Merck said it would be its largest investment in Taiwan since it established operations there in 1989.
""In the past year, the industry experienced a lot of supply chain challenges. Our investment project will help to resolve these issues,"" Kai Beckmann, chief executive of the German firm's electronics unit, told a news conference in Taipei via video link.
""We strengthen our local production and new capabilities to support fast-growing semiconductor demand in Taiwan but also to cater to an increasing demand in the rest of the world,"" Beckmann said, adding that the investment would expand Merck's footprint in the island's southern city of Kaohsiung.
Merck's announcement follows that of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) last month, when the world's largest contract chip maker said it will set up a new chip factory in Kaohsiung to boost production amid a global chip shortage. 
""We are very grateful for Merck's confidence in Taiwan, investing in Taiwan, investing in Taiwan's democracy, investing in Taiwan's freedom, investing in Taiwan's technological development,"" Deputy Economy Minister Chen Chern-Chyi told the news conference.

(Reuters) - Asian bonds received their smallest foreign inflows this year in November, amid rising prospects of quicker unwinding of stimulus measures by the U.S. Federal Reserve and caution about economic uncertainties from the Omicron coronavirus variant. 
Overseas investors purchased a combined net total of $1.22 billion in South Korean, Thai, Indian, Indonesian and Malaysian bonds last month, which was their smallest net buying since December 2020, data from regulatory authorities and bond market associations showed. 
(Graphic on, Foreign flows into Asian bonds: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klvyknbrlvg/Foreign%20flows%20into%20Asian%20bonds.jpg) 
""There is a trend of caution amid the mix of Fed tightening and Omicron risks, which flared up in late November,"" said Eugene Leow a strategist at DBS Bank
""Previous Fed tightening episodes did place pressure on EM and investors are probably similarly cautious this round"" DBS's Leow added.
South Korean bonds received $2.79 billion, marking the 11th successive month of foreign inflow in November.
South Korean bonds have so far pulled in a net $52.26 billion in foreign money this year, that lifted cross-border investors' cumulative holdings in the country's bonds to 9.3% at end-November, the biggest since at least 2014.
Thai bonds secured $1.3 billion, a big jump from $480 million worth of inflows in the previous month.
Indian bonds attracted $131 million after facing a outflow in the previous month.
Meanwhile, overseas investors sold Indonesian bonds – for a third straight month – worth $2.15 billion, trimming their holdings in Indonesian bonds to 20.55%, the lowest since at least 2014.
Malaysian bonds also saw cross-border outflows of $848 million, marking the first net selling in four months by outsiders.
The Fed on Wednesday is expected to signal a faster wind-down of its $120 billion a month bond buying programme in a move to fight a high rate of inflation, which could move it one step closer to raising interest rates.
""The outlook for portfolio flows remains mixed. Increasing vaccination rates and rising mobility levels will support the rebound in economic activity,"" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia Research at ANZ Bank.

""However, potentially faster tapering and earlier-than-expected U.S. rate hikes, and uncertainty caused by the Omicron variant, pose key downside risks.""

EDWARDSVILLE, Ill. (Reuters) - The U.S. workplace safety watchdog is investigating the circumstances around the collapse during Friday night's storm of an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) building in Illinois in which six workers died, an official at the U.S. Department of Labor said on Monday.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has six months to complete its investigation, issue citations, and propose monetary penalties if violations of workplace safety and/or health regulations are found, Scott Allen, a U.S. Department of Labor regional director for public affairs, said via email. He added that compliance officers have been on site since Saturday.
Six workers were killed when the Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, Illinois, buckled under the force of a devastating storm, police said. A barrage of tornadoes ripped through six U.S. states, leaving a trail of death and destruction at homes and businesses stretching more than 200 miles (322 km). 
Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said the company would cooperate with the investigation. ""OSHA investigates all workplace fatalities and we are supporting them,"" she said.
Responding to a reporter, Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker said officials are investigating the condition of the warehouse before it gave way.
""Already there has been an effort to determine some of the challenges ... if there were any structural issues, what exactly the storm's trajectory was coming in and affecting the various pieces of the building,"" Pritzker said. 
TORNADO TIMELINE
The National Weather Service said a tornado hit the area around 8:30 p.m. CST on Friday, intensifying rapidly as it struck the Amazon warehouse. Peak winds were estimated at 150 miles per hour (241 kph), causing severe damage.
The site received tornado warnings between 8:06 p.m. and 8:16 p.m. before the tornado struck the building at 8:27 p.m., Amazon said. 
Several employees told Reuters over the weekend that workers had been directed by Amazon managers to shelter in bathrooms after receiving emergency alerts on mobile phones from authorities. At least one worker died there, according to his co-worker.
Amazon said employees were directed to shelter in place at a designated assembly area at the front of the building, which was near a restroom.
Some of the workers told Reuters they had mobile phones with them despite what they believed was an Amazon policy preventing them from having the phones in their possession while at work. Amazon said there was no policy preventing employees or contractors from having phones at work. 
Edwardsville, a city of 27,000, is about 18 miles northeast of St. Louis, Missouri. 
The company has three facilities in Edwardsville: the delivery station hit by the storm, as well as a fulfillment center and a sorting station. The delivery station opened in July 2020 to prepare orders for last-mile delivery to customers.
The site, a compound comprised of a few buildings, has been under heavy private and police security through the weekend, accessible only to relief teams and some Amazon and government officials. The remains of the destroyed warehouse were mostly dismantled, reduced to rubble.
“It was crazy – I was on my way into the warehouse from Pontoon Beach (Illinois) when it happened. I saw the storm and was trying to get in as quickly as possible,"" said Brady Robison, 22, an Amazon van driver who works at the facility. 

""I just saw the roof completely tilted up ... it’s messed up that people had to lose their lives while they were at work.”
At least 45 Amazon employees made it out safely.

Investing.com – Shares in Ocado (LON:OCDO) rose on Tuesday after the  online grocery company reported strong underlying demand in the past three months for its U.K. delivery service, despite a fading tailwind from the pandemic.
Ocado Retail, a 50:50 joint venture between  Ocado Group  and Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY), recorded a 3.9% drop in revenue from a year earlier in the three months through November, as customers bought less for home consumption as a result of returning to the office.
However, average orders.were up 8.5% as the company continued to gain customers and market share. The number of active customers increased by 22% to 832,000 during the period.
Revenue was still up 32% from the same period in 2019 at 548 million pounds ($724 million). 
The group, which had been a pandemic winner in 2020, has seen shares decline by around 28% year-to-date.
The joint venture said sales growth was hurt by labor shortages, with headcount falling early in the quarter at Ocado Logistics. However, following the end of the U.K. government’s furlough scheme, it said vacancies are returning to ""more normal levels.""
It added that it is suffering cost inflation due to higher gas and power prices and shortages of dry ice. Dry ice, essential for much fresh food storage, is produced mainly as a byproduct of ammonia production, but the U.K.'s biggest factories shut temporarily in October as the sirge in prices for natural gas - the biggest input in ammonia production - made them uneconomic. 
“We are very encouraged by the underlying trends which are driving growth in our business,” said Ocado Retail Chairman Tim Steiner. “Hundreds of thousands of U.K. consumers have tried online grocery over the last eighteen months and the vast majority are continuing to shop online and are not going back to physical stores.”
Ocado Retail said it expects to return to revenue growth of around 15% in 2022, at the top of the historic pre-Covid range of 10%-15%.
Despite the positive outlook for the Ocado Retail business, much of the focus for investors is on the company’s Solutions business which is not covered in this trading update. Ocado Solutions currently partners with grocery retailers around the world including Kroger (NYSE:KR) in the US, Coles in Australia, and Casino in France."

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Tuesday, rebounding from a weak start to the week as investors digested the spread of the Omicron Covid variant ahead of three key central bank meetings in Europe and the U.S. 
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.6% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.6%. 
Investors are firmly focusing on policy-setting meetings from a number of high profile central banks, including the Bank of England and the European Central Bank in Europe, but probably more importantly the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The Fed starts its two-day meeting later Tuesday, and is widely expected to discuss a faster taper of its massive bond-buying program, which could move it one step closer to raising interest rates. 
This follows consumer prices climbing 6.8% in annual terms in November, the largest rise since 1982.
European equities weakened Monday as investors fretted about developments surrounding the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus, including the confirmation of the first U.K. death.
Additionally, a study released late Monday from the University of Oxford showed that two doses of established Covid-19 vaccines are substantially less effective at combating Omicron compared with previous variants of the coronavirus, emphasizing the need for a booster shot.
On Tuesday, U.K. unemployment fell almost 50,000 in November and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.2% in October, good news ahead of Thursday’s Bank of England meeting. Growth in employment over the last quarter slowed below expectations, however.
The BoE surprised the market by not raising interest rates last month despite high inflation, but policymakers opted for caution and are expected to do so again, given the arrival of Omicron and the imposition of new restrictions. The U.K. health agency estimates that Omicron infections are currently running at around 200,000 a day, far in excess of official statistics.
In corporate news, Ocado (LON:OCDO) stock rose 3.7% after the online grocer stated that fourth-quarter trends reflect strong momentum in underlying demand, with its best-ever Christmas ahead. Things could have been even better for the company as customers stick with online shopping, with growth held back by labor shortages. The group also said it won a patent infringement lawsuit filed by the Norwegian robotics firm AutoStore last year.
ArcelorMittal (AS:MT) stock climbed 4.2% after the world's largest steelmaker said it had intended to repurchase some convertible notes as part of a $395 million buyback program.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, helped by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries raising its world oil demand forecast for the first quarter of 2022 on Monday, expecting the Omicron variant to have a mild and temporary impact. 
Gas prices continued to climb, hitting a new record high amid rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine, which threaten to explode into violence.Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock ruled out the approval of the Nord Stream II pipeline, which would transport gas from Russia to western Europe across the Baltic Sea, in the near term, saying the legal conditions for its approval for regulators still haven't been met.
By 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $71.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.8% to $75.00.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,783.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1277.

TOKYO (Reuters) -The Bank of Japan offered to pump a combined $97 billion into markets through temporary government bond purchases in a two-day effort to counter a rise in short-term interest rates.
The central bank on Tuesday made two offers, including one to buy bonds worth 2 trillion yen ($17.6 billion) for immediate fund provision. Under another offer, it would buy 7 trillion yen to inject funds for a period between Dec. 15-16.
Both offers have arrangements to sell the bonds back.
Including an offer to inject 2 trillion yen made on Monday, the central bank offered to inject a combined 11 trillion yen in the first such operation conducted in nearly two years.
""The call rate has been creeping up near zero, a sign upward pressure on money market rates has not eased despite Monday's offer,"" said Naomi Muguruma, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""The BOJ likely tried to keep further rate rises in check by making offers to buy bonds for two straight days,"" she said.
Money market rates have crept up in recent days on rising fund demand toward the year-end.

A BOJ scheme introduced to support smaller lenders hurt by ultra-low rates has also perversely pushed up short-term borrowing costs, highlighting the central bank's tricky balancing act in keeping rates low - without squeezing bank profits too much.

1295,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 03:10AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Big Apple,"A look at the day ahead from Sujata Rao.
A marked flattening in the U.S yield curve -- with longer-dated borrowing costs taking a tumble -- failed to lift tech shares on Monday. Instead, as the Omicron COVID variant gathered steam, consumer staples, pharmas and other defensives benefited, balking Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) of a $3 trillion market capitalisation.
With Wall Street futures pointing higher, and Apple's Frankfurt-listed shares up almost 1%, Tuesday may well be the day the milestone is hit.
But in a week heavy with central bank meetings, data and expectations of hawkish policy turns, it's anyone's guess how market moves pan out.
Meanwhile, the Bank of England's dilemma -- to hike or not to hike -- hasn't gone away. November's payrolls increase was the biggest since tax office records began in 2014, showing labour markets have withstood the end of a furlough scheme.
Online supermarket Ocado (LON:OCDO) also provided a snapshot of the UK jobs market with a 3.9% fall in quarterly sales, due to labour shortages.
But with the spread of Omicron triggering work-from-home advice and other restrictions, the BoE may well choose to hold fire on Thursday.
Watch too for U.S. factory gate prices -- a reliable forward indicator for CPI -- out later on. Having started the year below 2%, November PPI will be above 9%, polls predict.
That data is unlikely to shake conviction the Federal Reserve, starting its two-day meeting on Tuesday, will accelerate its stimulus tapering and that the dot-plot chart of rate-setters voting intentions will show a more hawkish turn compared to the last meeting.
That's keeping the dollar index at one week-highs and equity futures are higher. For now, let's focus on emerging markets, where the rate hiking campaign continues unabated -- Hungary is expected to raise rates by 30 basis points and Chile by as much as 125 bps.

ATA was charged with four violations of laws relating to minimum standards for worker accommodation, the labour department said last week. 
ATA is currently in the spotlight following a decision by British home appliance maker Dyson last month to end its ATA contract within six months after an independent audit of the company's labour practices and accusations by a whistleblower.
ATA said in a statement the charges stem from inspections conducted in May by the labour department under the Ministry of Human Resources. 
The accommodation facilities that were inspected had housed employees who had decided to return to their home countries and whose work permits had expired but whose departure had been delayed due to travel restrictions.
The company had provided accommodation for the workers ""which unfortunately conflicted with normal regulations"", it said.
ATA added it was ""confident that with the range of improvement actions taken, it is compliant with all regulations and standards"" and that the charges are unrelated to allegations that have been reported in the media in connection with its Dyson contract.
Malaysia's labour department and attorney general's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Reuters reported on Nov. 25 and Dec. 5 that ATA's mostly migrant workforce did overtime in excess of the monthly legal limit of 104 hours, and worked on Sundays.

ATA, which makes parts for Dyson vacuum cleaners and air purifiers, has said all overtime was voluntary, and that it paid double for work on Sundays and triple on public holidays.
The company has said it has taken steps to ensure no recurrence, adding it had begun a policy of zero overtime on Sunday that led to the resignations of nearly 300 workers in the first week of December.

Investors have long criticised Japanese firms for hoarding cash rather than investing it or returning it to shareholders, hurting their returns on equity. 
After Kishida's comments, the benchmark Nikkei and the broader Topix index both ended in the red, slipping deeper into negative territory after the lunch break.
""We should be careful about uniformly regulating this as there are various circumstances and judgements by companies,"" Kishida said in response to a question about his view on corporate share buybacks.
""I wonder if it's possible to consider some kind of response, for example such as guidelines, in a way that takes the situation at individual companies into account.""
Kishida, who has made wealth redistribution his main policy agenda, found himself in hot water this year after raising the possibility of increasing Japan's taxes on capital gains and dividends.
But he walked back the pledge in October, following criticism for risking a stock market decline.

It also said Beijing's local cyberspace regulator had imposed 44 penalties on Weibo totalling 14.3 million yuan for the year to November.

Investing.com – Shares in Shimao Group Holdings Ltd. and its property services were down on Tuesday, with a deal between two of its units continuing to have a ripple effect.
Shimao shares slid 11.86% to HK$6.24 ($0.80) by 11:37 PM ET (4:37 AM GMT), while shares in Shimao Services Holdings Ltd (HK:0873) plunged 23.88% to HK$5.42. Shimao Group bonds dropped by about 3 cents on the dollar, reportedly leading to falls among Chinese high-yield debt.
Although less systemically important to China’s economy than China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333), the company has been on investors’ radars recently. After the company attributed a selloff in its stocks and bonds on Monday to “rumors”, Shimao Services announced after the market close that it conditionally agreed to acquire Shanghai Shimao Co. Ltd., a fellow Shimao Group unit, for CNY1.65 billion yuan ($259.14 million).
Shimao Group told Bloomberg that it hired Cushman & Wakefield to advise on the valuation and that the price took into consideration factors including liquidity and a control premium. However, the connected-party acquisition “not only implies tight liquidity conditions for Shimao but is also a corporate governance red flag.” said JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts.
The deal’s valuation was higher than usual, suggesting Shimao Group “is essentially transferring the cash from property manager to developer level,” the analysts added, with equity investors increasingly concerned that publicly listed property managers are being used as a “financial tool” by developers that share the same owners.
The Shimao deal also increases scrutiny on a sector struggling with a liquidity crunch. It also deflated the previous week’s optimism, when the government’s shift toward pro-economic growth policies helped drive yields on Chinese junk dollar bonds down the most in seven years. The optimism had also helped to counter last week’s defaults by China Evergrande and  Kaisa Group  Holdings Ltd. (HK:1638)"

On Oct. 28, a Pony.ai vehicle operating in autonomous mode hit a road center divider and a traffic sign in Fremont after turning right, showed the technology firm's accident report filed with the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).
""There were no injuries and no other vehicles involved,"" the company, backed by Japan's  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, said in the report.
Accidents during driverless testing are not uncommon. It was unclear what aspect of this incident prompted the suspension.
""On Nov. 19, the DMV notified Pony.ai that the department is suspending its driverless testing permit, effective immediately, following a reported solo collision in Fremont, California, on Oct. 28,"" the DMV said in a statement.
The regulator said Pony.ai has 10 Hyundai Motor Co Kona electric vehicles registered under its driverless testing permit, and that the suspension does not impact Pony.ai's permit for testing with a safety driver.
The suspension comes only six months after Pony.ai became the eighth company to receive a driverless testing permit in California, joining the likes of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc unit Waymo as well as Cruise, backed by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).
""We immediately launched an investigation, and are in contact with the California DMV about the incident,"" a Pony.ai spokesman said. Safety is the ""foundation"" of the company's autonomous vehicle technology, the spokesman said.
The company said the majority of its autonomous driving testing has involved safety drivers, and that will continue to be the case in the near-term.
Pony.ai, which operates in the United States and China, earlier this year suspended plans for a New York stock listing, sources told Reuters.

It halted the plans because it could not gain assurances from Chinese authorities that it would not become a target of increased regulatory action against Chinese technology companies over management and use of user data, the sources said.
The Pony.ai spokesman on Monday declined to comment on listing.

The lawsuit is set to go to trial in late September 2022.
The government argued the ""Northeast Alliance will cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars"" and the ""promised benefits do not justify these harms."" The government said ""at a minimum, however, their promises should be tested through discovery and trial."" 
American did not immediately comment, while JetBlue did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The airlines argue the Justice Department and states should allow the alliance to continue to prove itself. They note their commitments to expansion, oversight and measures to address possible anticompetitive effects.
The agreement allows American and JetBlue to sell each other's flights in their New York-area and Boston networks and link frequent-flyer programs in a move aimed at giving them more muscle to compete with United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) in the Northeast.

The partnership was announced in July 2020 and approved by the U.S. Transportation Department shortly before the end of the Trump administration.
The lawsuit signals the Biden administration's interest in greater competition where American and three other airlines control 80% of the domestic air market.

1306,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 09:18PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Down; Omicron, Reduced Central Bank Support Risks Remain","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Tuesday morning, with caution lingering about the economic risks posed by potentially reduced central bank support and the omicron COVID-19 variant.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.46% by 9:07 PM ET (2:07 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.36%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.24%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index Index slid 1.04%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.56% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.39% after a plunge in developer Shimao Group Holdings Ltd.’s bonds and shares.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve will hand down its policy decision on Wednesday. Other key central banks, including the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of England (BOE), and the Bank of Japan, will hand down their policy decisions during the week.
Some investors were cautious ahead of the policy decisions.
“Volatility will remain elevated throughout all of this week’s rate decisions from the Fed, ECB, and the BOE,” Oanda Corp. senior market analyst Edward Moya said in a note.
“2022 is still expected to be a strong global growth story, but accelerated central bank hawkishness could be the one thing that helps deliver the first major pullback with U.S. equities.”
Other investors agreed.
“It has been a strong year, we expect it to end strong, but investors have to be careful with bubble assets,” ERShares chief investment strategist Eva Ados, told Bloomberg.
“The worst when it comes to inflation is behind us. Asset tapering has been somehow baked in. We are cautiously optimistic, but there are many risks on the horizon too.”
Omicron concerns were on the rise again after the World Health Organization warned that the variant poses a ""very high"" global risk, with some evidence that it evades vaccine protection. However, it added that clinical data on its severity is limited.
China reported its first omicron case, while the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. topped 50 million.
On the data front, the U.S. producer price index is due later in the day, with Chinese data, including industrial production and retail sales, due on Wednesday.
Investors are also bracing for Friday’s “quadruple witching” day in U.S. markets, when options and futures on indexes and equities expire. S&P Dow Jones Indices quarterly rebalance will also come into effect after markets close on the same day."

Economic activity in China likely slowed in November due to the worsening downturn in the property sector and still subdued consumption. Growth in fixed-asset investment probably weakened last month, according to the median estimate in a survey of economists.
Shimao’s shares dropped 12% to the lowest in almost a decade, while its bonds dropped, with one yuan note tumbling more than 50% before being suspended. The firm is looking into market rumors that caused the selloff, according to an emailed response to queries. A gauge of property developer stocks fell for a second day.
 
Key Developments:
China Economic Activity Likely Slowed (8:23 a.m. HK)
Economic activity in China likely decelerated in November due to the worsening downturn in the property sector and still subdued consumption.
Growth in fixed-asset investment probably weakened last month, dragged down by sluggish property investment, according to the median estimate in a survey of economists ahead of data due to be released Wednesday morning. 
Amundi Says Crackdown May Boost Funds (7:59 a.m. HK) 
China’s crackdown on the property sector, which has sparked defaults at China Evergrande Group and others, should provide a lift to stocks and bonds as investors shift away from real estate, a top executive at Amundi SA said.

1309,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 08:51PM ET</span>",Apple closes in on $3 trillion market value,"By Nivedita Balu, Anisha Sircar and David Randall
(Reuters) - Apple Inc's market value hovered just shy of the $3 trillion mark on Monday, following a stunning run over the past decade that has turned it into the world's most valuable company. 
The company’s shares fell just over 2% on Monday to close at $175.74, reversing earlier gains that saw them approach the $182.86 price needed to record a $3 trillion market value.
Apple’s stock rose about 11% last week, extending its more than 30% year-to-date gain as investors remain confident that flush consumers will continue to pay top dollar for iPhones, MacBooks and services such as Apple TV and Apple Music.
The iPhone maker's march from $2 trillion to near $3 trillion in market value took 16 months, as it led a group of megacap tech companies such as Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) that benefited from people and businesses relying heavily on technology during the pandemic.
By comparison, Apple's move from $1 trillion to $2 trillion took two years.
""It's now one of the more richly valued companies in the market, which shows the dominance of U.S. technology in the world and how confident investors are that it will remain in Apple’s hands,"" said Brian Frank, a portfolio manager at Frank Capital who sold his long-standing position in Apple in 2019 as the stock's valuation rose. ""It seems like the stock has priced in every possible good outcome."" 
Among new revenue lines that investors expect are a possible Apple Car, alongside growth in service categories such as apps and TV that still remain well below the 65% of the company's revenues generated by sales of iPhones, said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus (NYSE:SNV) Trust Company.
Eclipsing the $3 trillion milestone would add another feather in the cap for Chief Executive Tim Cook, who took over after Steve Jobs resigned in 2011, and oversaw the company's expansion into new products and markets.
""Tim Cook has done an amazing job over the past decade, taking Apple's share price up over 1,400%,"" OANDA analyst Edward Moya said.
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) have returned 22% per year since the 1990s, while the S&P 500 has returned less than 9% annually in the same period.
If Apple hits the $3 trillion milestone,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) will be the only company in the $2 trillion club, while Alphabet, Amazon and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc have crossed $1 trillion. 
Microsoft, which has a market value of roughly $2.6 trillion, was the world's most valuable company as recently as late October when Apple reported that supply chain constraints could weigh on its growth for the remainder of the year. 
Large technology stocks have rallied this year with investors tapping increasing demand for cloud-based products as companies shifted to a hybrid work model and consumers upgraded their devices. The Nasdaq 100, which is top-weighted by large companies such as Apple, is up nearly 26% this year, while the broader S&P 500 index is up roughly 24%. 

The emergence of technologies such as 5G, augmented reality/virtual reality, and artificial intelligence may also help Apple and other cash-rich large technology stocks remain in favor with investors as the global economy puts the coronavirus pandemic behind it and supply chain pressures ease. 
""I am in the camp that are experiencing another 'Super Cycle' with the iPhone12/iPhone 13 franchise,"" wrote Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager Synovus Trust Company, in a note. ""And that AAPL is lifting off to another string of quarters with strong revenue and profit growth.""

(Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower on Monday, with shares of Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp and several airlines tumbling as investors worried about the Omicron coronavirus variant ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting later this week.
Travel-related stocks fell, with the fast-spreading variant accounting for around 40% of COVID-19 infections in London and at least one death in the United Kingdom.
Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings, Carnival Corp and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises all slumped more than 4%, while the S&P 1500 airlines index shed about 3%.
""It's transportation, restaurants, all the things that if it got bad enough that we started putting new restrictions on people, it would not be good for them,"" said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta. ""They have all been bid over the past several months by the idea that we were going to get back to business as usual.""
Most of the 11 major S&P 500 sector indexes fell, with only defensive sectors, including consumer staples, utilities and real estate gaining.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.89% to end at 35,651.61 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.91% to 4,669.15. 
The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.39% to 15,413.28.
Following Monday's dip, the S&P 500 remains up about 24% year to date.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) dipped 2.1%, even after J.P. Morgan raised its price target on the iPhone maker to the highest on Wall Street. The company is close to becoming the first in the world to hit $3 trillion in market value.
Investors expect an increasingly hawkish tone out of the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting that wraps up on Wednesday. The U.S. central bank is expected to signal a faster wind-down of asset purchases, which could also usher closer a start to interest rate hikes.
""Everyone is focused on the Fed this week and what guidance we get in terms of bond purchases and interest rates. There's an expectation that there will be an acceleration of tapering, and there's a little anxiety leading up to that,"" said Ryan Jacob, chief portfolio manager at Jacob Internet Fund.
A Reuters poll of economists sees the central bank hiking interest rates from near zero to 0.25%-0.50% in the third quarter of next year, followed by another in the fourth quarter.
Positive updates about vaccines and antibody cocktails to combat the new COVID-19 variant, along with a recent reading on inflation that was in line with consensus, pushed the S&P 500 index to a record closing high on Friday.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) rose 4.6% after it agreed to acquire Arena Pharmaceuticals in a $6.7 billion all-cash deal. Arena's shares surged 80%.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.4 billion shares, compared with the 11.4 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.30-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.53-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 52 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 33 new highs and 302 new lows.

(Reuters) - One of the Boy Scouts of America's primary insurers, Chubb (NYSE:CB) Ltd unit Century Indemnity Company, said on Monday it will contribute $800 million to a deal proposed by the youth organization to settle around 82,500 claims from people who say they were sexually abused as children by troop leaders.
That move brings the total pot of money available to resolve claims to more than $2.7 billion. Under the Boy Scouts' proposal, those who filed claims in the organization's ongoing bankruptcy proceeding will receive settlements according to the severity of their cases and when the alleged abuse occurred.
Century's contribution comes after more than a year of back-and-forth between the insurer and the Boy Scouts. During the bankruptcy proceedings, Century questioned the legitimacy of some of the claims. 
A group representing tens of thousands of claimants has thrown its support behind the settlement. However, a separate committee representing the interests of claimants has long opposed the deal, saying it compromises too much in exchange for a quick exit from Chapter 11. Lawyers for the committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""This is an extremely important step forward in the BSA's efforts to equitably compensate survivors, and our hope is that this will lead to further settlement agreements from other parties,"" the Boy Scouts said in a statement on Monday.

The deal, which is subject to court approval, is also backed by the Boy Scouts' other primary insurer, The Hartford Financial (NYSE:HIG) Group, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which previously chartered Scouting groups and activities.
They Boy Scouts filed for bankruptcy in February 2020 to resolve hundreds of lawsuits relating to accusations of sex abuse over several decades. Abuse claimants have until Dec. 28 to vote on the organization's proposed reorganization plan, which rests on the underlying settlement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker will tell a U.S. Senate committee that $54 billion in COVID-19 U.S. government assistance ""saved the airline industry,"" according to testimony seen by Reuters.
Parker is set to testify alongside the chief executives of Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and United Airlines on Wednesday. Delta's chief of operations will also testify.
Parker will tell the panel that had Congress structured the entire assistance as government loans most airlines ""would have survived by shutting down flying in April 2020, furloughing almost all of our teams, and waiting for demand to return to levels strong enough to justify restoring flying. As it turns out, that would have been some time in 2021.""
Lawmakers are expected to quiz executives about how carriers used pandemic-related federal aid, staffing issues and other matters.
Parker will also say the airline has ""set a target of hiring an additional 18,000 team members in 2022.""
Lawmakers want to know if voluntary employee buyouts offered by airlines, despite receiving payroll assistance, caused operational problems at some carriers that have resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights in recent months. 
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) canceled more than 1,400 flights over a weekend in October citing staffing issues and unfavorable weather.
Parker will note the airline has ""developed incentive pay programs for peak travel periods to fortify our efforts to operate every flight on our schedule.""
In total, Congress awarded three rounds of government assistance to the airlines that lasted through Sept. 30.
Airlines receiving government assistance were not allowed to issue involuntary layoffs or cut worker pay. They also had to limit executive compensation and halt share buybacks and dividend payments.

U.S. air passenger travel fell by 60% in 2020 to the lowest level since 1984, down more than 550 million passengers.
The U.S. government also extended $25 billion in low-cost loans to airlines. Of the $54 billion in payroll grants, U.S. Treasury required larger airlines to repay 30% and award the government warrants.

(Reuters) -Australia's biggest supermarket chain Woolworths Group on Tuesday forecast lower first-half operating income from its domestic food business as easing COVID-19 curbs brought an end to pandemic stockpiling.
Shares of the grocer tumbled as much as 10.6% to A$36.26, hitting their lowest level in nearly six months, while the broader market fell 0.4%.
Woolworths and smaller rival  Coles Group  (OTC:CLEGF) benefited last year from nationwide pandemic-induced lockdowns, as shoppers stocked up on rice, pasta and toilet paper.
Sales in the Australian food business have slowed since restrictions began easing in October and customers returned to ""more normal shopping habits"", while unusually wet weather in New South Wales also dented performance, Woolworths said.
The downgrade is a one-off, however, and should not affect the company's long-term outlook, said Mathan Somasundaram, chief executive of DeepData analytics. 
""It was inevitable that all retail stocks return to a normal cycle after years of government handout-boosted spending ... WOW is still the dominant supermarket chain and the inflation cycle works in their favour,"" he said. 
Shares of Coles were trading 5.3% lower at A$16.92 by 1148 GMT. 
""The first half of FY22 has been one of the most challenging halves we have experienced in recent memory due to the far-reaching impacts of the COVID Delta strain,"" Group Chief Executive Brad Banducci said.
But the company said there was good sales momentum going into the key Christmas trading period, and expects improved performance in the second half. 
Woolworths estimated pandemic-related expenses of about A$150 million for the half and said supply chain disruptions due to the crisis would cost it another A$60 million to A$70 million.

It expects earnings before income tax (EBIT) of between A$1.19 billion and A$1.22 billion ($870.4 million-$849 million) from the Australian food business, down from A$1.31 billion last year.

By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - A federal jury on Friday awarded $22.5 million to a U.S. Army veteran who alleged that combat earplugs sold by 3M Co caused him to suffer hearing loss and tinnitus, the biggest verdict yet in massive litigation over the product.
Jurors in Tallahassee, Florida, sided with former U.S. Army soldier Theodore Finley in the latest trial to result from more than 272,000 lawsuits by servicemembers and veterans who say defective earplugs made by 3M caused their hearing damage.
Finley, who used the earplugs while serving in the Army from 2006 to 2014, was awarded $7.5 million in compensatory damages and $15 million in punitive damages. The verdict surpassed the $13 million jurors awarded a U.S. Army sergeant last month.
The trial was the eighth so far to reach a verdict, with plaintiffs in four other cases winning more than $29 million combined. Juries sided with 3M in three others, and two more trials are underway, with more to come.
""We will ensure that 3M is held fully accountable for putting profits over the safety of those who served our nation,"" the lead lawyers for the plaintiffs - Bryan Aylstock, Shelley Hutson and Christopher Seeger - said in a joint statement.

3M called the verdict disappointing. It said it will continue defending itself and that 3M remained confident the Combat Arms Earplugs Version 2 was safe and effective.
Aearo Technologies LLC, which 3M bought in 2008, developed the product. Plaintiffs allege the company hid design flaws, fudged test results and failed to provide instruction in the proper use of the earplugs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock markets fell and the dollar gained ground on Monday as investors waited for news from a host of central bank meetings this week and mulled a future without the Fed's safety net.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to signal a faster wind-down of asset purchases, which could move it one step closer to raising interest rates. The Fed's policy-setting committee will also update its members' rate expectations over the next couple of years.
The dollar edged higher ahead of the upcoming meetings, with investors eyeing the possibility that the Fed will start to raise rates in 2022.
""(The) central bank rate decisions this week will likely show stocks have to move higher without the help of central bankers,"" said Edward Moya, senior analyst at OANDA.
""Volatility will remain elevated throughout all of (these) decisions from the Fed, ECB, and BOE.""
The European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan are also meeting this week, and are each heading toward normalizing their own monetary policies. 
Fears over the Omicron variant of COVID-19 weighed on U.S. and European markets after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned of a ""tidal wave"" of new cases, and the World Health Organization said it poses a ""very high"" global risk, with some evidence that it evades vaccine protection.
The FTSE index fell 0.83%.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.43% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.80%.

The dollar index rose 0.27%, with the euro down 0.01% to $1.1282, as it is seen as vulnerable to a U.S. rate hike given expectations that the Fed will tighten policy more quickly than the ECB.
The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield fell on Monday and the yield curve flattened as traders prepared for a hawkish tone out of the Federal Reserve at their meeting.

The ECB, meeting on Thursday, is likely to confirm that its 1.85 trillion-euro ($2.09 trillion) pandemic emergency stimulus scheme will end next March.
Expectations for a rate hike at Thursday's Bank of England meeting have been pulled back as Omicron raises concern about the near-term economic outlook. 

Oil futures eased as new doubts emerged about the effectiveness of vaccines against the Omicron coronavirus variant, though OPEC predicted in its monthly report that the variant's impact on fuel demand would be mild.

This could be a good opportunity for long-term investors to scoop up shares. But which stock is the better buy?.The renewable energy industry is expected to see accelerating growth in the coming years, primarily due to government incentives and tax rebates to install solar panels and concerns for climate change. According to Allied Market Research, the global solar energy market is expected to reach $223.3 billion, growing at a CAGR of 20.5% over the next five years. 
However, the renewable energy industry presently faces supply chain issues, which significantly increase the cost of solar panels. This cost increase is driven by skyrocketing shipping prices and increasing prices of solar panel components. As a result, Invesco Solar Portfolio ETF (TAN) has tumbled 18.6% year-to-date, underperforming the whole market. Consequently, long-term investors can scoop up shares of solar stocks at a solid discount.

Most major U.S. banks have had staff working in offices since the summer, but some are now choosing not to host holiday parties and others strongly recommending staff get booster shots. The following are the pandemic-related rules among Wall Street's biggest banks.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)
The bank since late summer has been encouraging employees to get fully vaccinated and now to get their booster shots when eligible and offers onsite clinics in several locations.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)
The bank is requiring employees in the United States to be vaccinated but is not mandating boosters. It is providing rapid test kits and encouraging testing for employees going into the office, a source told Reuters.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)
The German lender has made COVID-19 boosters available to staff at its new midtown headquarters in New York City since early November, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)
As infections flared up in August due to the spreading of the Delta variant, the Wall Street bank mandated vaccines for all staff and visitors entering its offices in the United States
Staff in the United States must be tested onsite on a weekly basis. The bank is also providing access to boosters for those who are eligible, although boosters are not mandatory.
Jefferies 
The investment bank requires all staff who want to enter its offices to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and has said it will require boosters by Jan. 31, unless the person concerned is not yet eligible for the additional shot. The bank does not perform onsite testing.
Last week, following a spate of cases, the bank asked staff to work from home where possible and canceled all but essential travel.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)
The biggest U.S. bank, and one of the most aggressive in bringing employees back to the office, mandated face covering for its U.S. employees in August, saying they would be required to wear masks in public indoor settings and in common areas regardless of their vaccination status.
In October, the bank said it would restrict business travel for employees who are unvaccinated or have not disclosed their vaccination status. Such employees are required to get tested twice a week and contribute more of their pay toward medical insurance. 
The bank also mandated vaccines for new recruits in client-facing roles or those required to travel for business.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)
Morgan Stanley is asking employees, contractors and visitors to show proof of vaccination before entering its New York headquarters. The bank does not require additional COVID-19 testing for staff or visitors, a spokeswoman said.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co
The lender has said it strongly encourages employees to consider getting the COVID-19 vaccine, but does not require it. The bank was providing all employees with four hours of paid leave to get the booster shot if eligible.
The bank also required employees to either document that they are fully vaccinated or get tested regularly.
Fidelity Investments

The company said it has paused voluntary return to office plans in New England, citing a rising risk from the COVID-19 pandemic.

1325,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 05:22PM ET</span>","Fidelity, Morgan Stanley prepare for continued COVID-19 concerns","By Ross Kerber, Elizabeth Dilts Marshall and Matt Scuffham
BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Asset management firm Fidelity Investments on Monday said it had paused some voluntary return-to-office plans while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s CEO said he expects COVID-19 to be an issue through the next year, in a further sign that America's financial industry is rethinking its return to ""business as usual.""
U.S. financial firms have been more proactive than other industries in encouraging employees to return to offices.
Those plans have come under renewed scrutiny with COVID-19 cases again on the rise and as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus spreads swiftly. Some financial firms are now choosing to pull back on holiday parties, recommend booster shots, or even advise returning to work from home.
""The private acknowledgement is that return to work plans set for January need another look,"" said Neal Mills, chief medical officer for professional services firm Aon (NYSE:AON), who advises corporations on their return-to-work plans.
Mills said he received calls every day last week from companies experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks seeking advice on whether to delay bringing employees back or reinstate mitigation measures, like social distancing. Cases surged after Thanksgiving, and are expected to continue rising and peak in January, he said.
Family-controlled Fidelity, headquartered in Boston, paused pilot return-to-office programs at its offices in Boston, Smithfield, Rhode Island, and Merrimack, New Hampshire ""due to rising COVID risk scores,"" spokesman Michael Aalto said. 
COVID-19 hospitalizations in Massachusetts rose by 58% in the two weeks to Dec. 9, according to data from state authorities, their highest level since February.
Several hundred people had been going in to those New England locations, Aalto said, adding that voluntary programs representing thousands of employees are still underway at other locations around the United States. 
Last week, Wall Street investment bank Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) sent staff home and canceled client parties and all but essential travel after the firm experienced nearly 40 new COVID-19 cases. 
Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman said in a CNBC interview on Monday that while the bank had about 65% of its 95% vaccinated staff in New York in the office, and the trading floors had hundreds of staff on them, the pandemic's impact was taking longer to recover from than he anticipated.
""We are in transition period still,"" Gorman said. ""I thought we would be out of it by Labor day, past Labor day. We're not. I think we will still be in it through most of next year. Everyone is still finding their way."" 
Gorman has been vocal in support of getting staff back to the office. At the firm's U.S. financials, payments and commercial real estate conference in June he said, if ""you want to get paid New York rates, you work in New York"".
He told CNBC that if staff wanted to move en masse to a low cost part of the country ""that creates issues"" but that his employees had not reacted that way. 
Daily cases in New York City have surged this month and hospitalizations are at their highest level since April, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
While the Delta variant is still dominant in the United States, Omicron has been detected in many U.S. states, including New York.
LONDON STALLS
In London, major investment banks have advised most staff to work from home as of Monday, in line with Britain's tighter restrictions, but said their offices will remain open. At least one person has died in the United Kingdom after contracting Omicron. 
The shift represented a switch for many firms in Europe's largest financial capital as, until last week, most were encouraging staff back into the office.
""We expect a reduction in the amount of people coming into our offices, but our buildings will continue to be accessible to all employees,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said in a memo to UK staff late last week.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) International Chief Executive Richard Gnodde said in a memo on Friday that all UK staff who could work from home ""effectively"" should do so, but added its offices in London and Birmingham also would remain open. 
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) has said that staff numbers in London will be significantly reduced from Monday, though employees with certain roles such as traders or those with personal reasons can still go in. It also discouraged staff from taking part in social gatherings.

Virgin last year stopped flying from Australia to Los Angeles but had maintained a relationship with Delta in competition with a rival partnership between Qantas Airways and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL).
United has a much larger market share than Delta on routes between Australia and the United States and Virgin said the new partnership would triple its reach into the Americas, including on flights to Mexico, the Caribbean and South America.

United customers will also gain access to Virgin's extensive domestic network in Australia under the arrangement. 
Delta said in a separate statement that its operations to Australia would not be affected by Virgin's decision and it would continue to operate flights between Sydney and Los Angeles after their partnership ends in June 2022.

Musk is also the founder and CEO of SpaceX, and leads brain-chip startup Neuralink and infrastructure firm The Boring Company. Tesla's market value soared to more than $1 trillion this year, making it more valuable than Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) combined.
Tesla produces hundreds of thousand of cars every year and has managed to avert supply chain issues better than many of its rivals, while pushing many young consumers to switch to electric cars and legacy automakers to shift focus to EV vehicles.
""For creating solutions to an existential crisis, for embodying the possibilities and the perils of the age of tech titans, for driving society's most daring and disruptive transformations, Elon Musk is TIME's 2021 Person of the Year,"" the magazine's editor-in-chief, Edward Felsenthal, said.
""Even Elon Musk's spacefaring adventures are a direct line from the very first Person of the Year, Charles Lindbergh, whom the editors selected in 1927 to commemorate his historic first solo transatlantic airplane flight over the Atlantic.""
From hosting Saturday Night Live to dropping tweets on cryptocurrencies and meme stocks that have triggered massive movements in their value, Musk has dominated the headlines and amassed over 66 million followers on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Some of his tweets have also attracted regulatory scrutiny in the past.
According to the magazine, ""The Person of the Year"" signifies somebody ""who affected the news or our lives the most, for better, or worse.""

Time magazine named the teenage pop singer Olivia Rodrigo as its ""Entertainer of the Year"", American gymnast Simone Biles ""Athlete of the Year"" and vaccine scientists were named ""Heroes of the Year"".
Last year, U.S. President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris were jointly given the ""Person of the Year"" title. Time began this tradition in 1927. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos have also received the title in the past.

1328,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 04:51PM ET</span>",U.S. Senate committee faults FAA oversight of Boeing,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate report released on Monday said the Federal Aviation Administration must do a better job overseeing Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and the certification of new airplanes, as well as review allegations raised by seven industry whistleblowers.
The 97-page Commerce Committee report from Senator Maria Cantwell includes concerns raised in the wake of two fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes in a five-month period that prompted the plane's 20-month grounding. Congress also passed sweeping reforms in December 2020 to how the FAA certifies new airplanes that the agency is still implementing.
""FAA’s oversight of the certification process has eroded,"" the report found, saying the agency ""over time, increasingly delegated away its authority"" to Boeing and others.
The FAA, the report said, ""should take immediate action to address undue pressure at the Boeing"" safety oversight office, adding that it is ""chronically understaffed.""
Boeing said it is reviewing the report. ""Boeing teammates are encouraged to speak up whenever they have safety or quality concerns,"" the planemaker said, adding that many issues in the report ""have been previously publicized, and Boeing has worked to address them with oversight"" by the FAA.
""FAA’s certification process suffers from undue pressure on line engineers and production staff,"" the report said. It said the FAA Boeing oversight office lacks enough safety engineers, and it must improve its safety culture. 
Cantwell wrote FAA Administrator Steve Dickson asking him to review the ""concerns raised by these whistleblowers, and implement necessary changes to improve safety in the aviation industry."" She said she plans more hearings on aviation issues in 2022.
The FAA said Monday it ""takes all whistleblower allegations seriously and does not tolerate retaliation against those who raise safety concerns.""
Cantwell's report also cites whistleblowers who said GE Aviation’s GE9X engine program ""suffered from undue pressure on production staff acting on behalf of the FAA."" A GE spokesman said the company ""thoroughly investigated these claims"" and ""found no undue influence.""
Last month, three U.S. House Democrats asked Dickson to provide more details on the agency's oversight of the Boeing 737 MAX and questioned whether the manufacturer had been held fully accountable.
The Senate report said the 737 MAX crashes and U.S. grounding, lifted in late 2020, ""cost Boeing more than $20 billion and inflicted significant reputational harm to the U.S. aviation safety oversight system.""
Boeing agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department in January, including $2.5 billion in fines and compensation stemming from the 737 MAX crashes.
Dickson said in November ""Boeing is not the same as it was two years ago, but they have more to work to do.""
Last month, the acting head of the FAA office that oversees Boeing told the company that appointees performing work for the agency did not have required expertise and some were not meeting FAA expectations.

He said the FAA was delegating fewer responsibilities to Boeing for aircraft certification and was ""demanding more transparency"" from manufacturers.
The FAA is currently scrutinizing a number of issues involving Boeing airplanes.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -A Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co dealership and a Pilgrim's Pride (NASDAQ:PPC) Corp chicken hatchery were destroyed when deadly tornadoes swept through Kentucky on Friday, while silos holding millions of bushels of corn suffered damage, the companies and the state's agriculture commissioner said on Monday.
At least 64 people, including six children, lost their lives in Kentucky after a raft of tornadoes tore through six states https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/least-64-people-confirmed-dead-kentucky-after-barrage-tornadoes-2021-12-13. 
""We have a 200-mile swath through Kentucky that has pulled-down grain systems, destroyed chicken hatcheries and of course blown-over barns,"" said Ryan Quarles, Kentucky's agriculture commissioner.
The destruction in the Midwest could further raise already high chicken prices and add to supply-chain headaches https://www.reuters.com/world/the-great-reboot/desperate-tires-components-shortage-roils-us-harvest-2021-10-12 that have made it difficult for farmers to replace tractor parts. 
Poultry is Kentucky's top agricultural commodity, and at least a dozen chicken barns collapsed, Quarles said. The state is working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to properly kill and dispose of chickens housed in barns that were destroyed, he said.
President Joe Biden will visit the state on Wednesday to survey the damage.
One Pilgrim's Pride chicken hatchery was a total loss, and another is expected to be offline until spring after suffering significant damage, the company said in a statement. It added that other company hatcheries are supplying chickens to farmers near Mayfield, a town of 10,000 that suffered some of the worst damage from the tornadoes.
Pilgrim's, which is mostly owned by Brazilian meatpacker  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY), is evaluating damage to a local feedmill, while a production plant is expected to be fully operational on Wednesday, the statement said.
The loss of the hatchery in Mayfield ""automatically triggers a multi-month delay in the processing and raising of chickens because the hatchery simply is not there anymore to supply the farmers,"" Quarles said.
Mayfield is in Kentucky's top county for agricultural sales, accounting for 6% of the state's total farm business, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/AgCensus/2017/Online_Resources/County_Profiles/Kentucky/cp21083.pdf, though the state is not a top grain producer. Kentucky held 1.5% of U.S. corn stocks in December 2020, the USDA said. 
""Lots of farmer elevators damaged. Some small feed mills have damage with indefinite timelines,"" said Andrew Jackson, broker at Producers Hedge, in Lancaster, Kentucky.
Mayfield Grain Company, a crop handler, had roofs ripped off of parts of a storage system that holds 6 million bushels of grain in Mayfield, Quarles said. That's enough corn to fill two Panamax vessels -- each ship the length of two football fields.
Photos on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) https://twitter.com/bamwxcom/status/1470395984844922888 showed yellow corn visible from the tops of bins that lost their roofs. The company had no immediate comment. 
""You have millions of bushels of corn, much of which was just freshly harvested, being exposed to the elements, being damaged,"" Quarles said.
""We're looking for ways to recover spilled grain but also divert the storage and movement of grain to other facilities around the state.""
Quarles said the agriculture department will help farmers find buyers for grain amid reduced demand for feed from livestock and poultry producers who suffered losses.
Hutson Inc, a company that sells Deere equipment, said its flagship store in Mayfield was ""destroyed by one of the worst natural disasters to ever hit the state."" 

Workers ""waded through debris and used what equipment they could salvage to assist with rescue efforts at a candle plant located next to us that had mass casualties,"" Chief Executive Josh Waggener said in a statement online.
Deere said it is in touch with Waggener and working with Hutson to provide financial assistance to the community.

Prominent players  Avis Budget  Group (NASDAQ:CAR) and Hertz (HTZ) are expected to benefit from increased pricing power and demand. But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now.Avis Budget Group, Inc. (CAR) and Hertz Global Holdings (OTC:HTZGQ), Inc. (HTZ) are two prominent rental and leasing services companies. CAR provides luxury cars, specialty-use vehicles, light commercial vehicles and truck rentals, car sharing, and ancillary services to businesses and consumers. It also offers optional insurance products and coverages, fuel service options, roadside assistance services, and an online portal for corporate travel. HTZ provides vehicle rental services under the Hertz, Dollar, and Thrifty brands from company-owned, licensee, and franchisee locations internationally. It also sells vehicles and operates the Firefly vehicle rental brand and Hertz 24/7 car sharing business in international markets.
The pandemic-imposed lockdowns and travel restrictions crushed the demand in the car rental market last year, as U.S. car rental industry revenue declined 27.4% year-over-year in 2020. However, the industry rapidly recovered this year, owing to a strong vaccination drive, an increase in new car prices, and a growing interest in sustainability. Rising energy prices and growing interest in electric vehicles are incentivizing car rental companies to add more battery-powered vehicles to their fleets, which, in turn, fosters the industry’s long-term growth prospects. The global car rental market is expected to grow at 4.6% CAGR and reach $141.17 billion by 2028. So, both CAR and HTZ should benefit in the long run.

(NASDAQ:RKLB) announced after the bell Monday that it is to acquire space solar power products and precision aerospace structures supplier SolAero in a cash deal worth $80 million.

The company launched LiveWire earlier this year, hoping to claw back lost market share as its core baby boomer customer base grows older and interest in motorcycling as a recreational activity fades.
A broader awareness about climate change is also paving the way for automakers to lean towards greener vehicles. Valuations have gained as money managers are also increasingly factoring in ESG policies in their investments.
Harley is the latest to cash in on an uptick in valuations of electric-vehicle makers. Last month, Amazon-backed EV maker Rivian shot past $100 billion in valuation in its market debut, surpassing Ford and General Motors (NYSE:GM).
""If anything this underlines what we've been saying for a long time. Detroit, wake up! The train has left the station! EVs are inevitable,"" Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said.
""Many traditional OEMs (Original equipment manufacturers) with emerging EV businesses can obviously do similar spinoff transactions,"" Irwin added.
Harley's shares rose 11.3% in premarket trading, while those of AEA-Bridges were up 3.4%.

Jochen Zeitz, Harley's chief executive, will be the chairman of LiveWire for up to two years following the completion of the deal. In an investor presentation, LiveWire projected units sales volume of 100,961 electric bikes by 2026.
Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) will retain a 74% stake in the company, which is expected to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""LVW"". ABIC's shareholders will own about 17%.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's BMW will add production of its X5 mid-size luxury SUV - which is currently made in the United States - in China to satisfy strong demand globally for the vehicle, a company spokesperson said on Monday.
""We will be adding localized production of the BMW X5 in China, for the Chinese market,"" the spokesperson said, without providing a start date.
China production of the X5 is slated to begin in the second quarter next year at the BMW Brilliance joint venture, according to a U.S. supplier source.
X5 vehicles sold in China have so far been produced at BMW's Spartanburg plant in South Carolina. Added production in China will not affect production volumes at South Carolina plant, the statement said.
The statement followed a report earlier on Monday by Handelsblatt that BMW was planning to begin production of the X5 in China from 2022.
BMW sold just under 700,000 cars in China from January to September this year, up nearly 20% from last year and constituting around a third of all sales in Europe, Asia and the Americas.
Finance chief Nicolas Peter said in September he was confident sales would increase next year.

The move mirrors a decision by BMW in 2018 to produce 10,000 to 20,000 X5 SUVs in Thailand to supply Chinese customers after China instated a 40 percent tariff on imports from the United States.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 retreated Monday, led by a selloff in cyclical stocks including energy amid fresh worries about the economic impact of the Omicron Covid-19 variant ahead of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy update later this week.  
The S&P 500 fell 0.91% to 4,668.97 after closing at a record closing high of 4,712.02 on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 0.89% , or 320 points, the Nasdaq slipped 1.39%.
Energy fell more than 2% weighed down by falling oil prices amid fresh worries about the threat to energy demand from the growing emergence of the omicron variant. The U.K. recorded its first death from the Omicron variant at a time when the country has moved to tougher restriction to curb the spread of the new variant.  
 Chevron  (NYSE:CVX),  Kinder Morgan  (NYSE:KMI) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) were the biggest decliners in the energy sector.
The jitters over the energy demand outlook come even as the OPEC raised its world oil demand forecast for the first quarter of 2022, forecasting a mild and temporary impact from Omicron.
Consumer discretionary stocks were also hit by Omicron-fueled fears with cruise line companies including Carnival (NYSE:CCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) leading to the downside.
In tech, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) gave up gains after failing just shy of recording a $3 trillion valuation.
Semiconductor stocks exacerbated the decline in tech, paced by a decline in  Amkor Technology  (NASDAQ:AMKR), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT).
The risk-off sentiment triggered a flight to safety, supported a move higher in U.S. government bond prices, which trade inversely to yields. The 10-year yield fell below 1.4%.
Against the backdrop of falling yields, banking stocks including Regions Financial (NYSE:RF) ,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and People’s United Financial (NASDAQ:PBCT) fell sharply.
Lower interest rates dent the return on interest that banks earn from their loan products, or net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to depositors.
Utilities and consumer staples - defensive corners of the market - bucked the trend lower, while health care was also supported by a rise in the shares of vaccine makers.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) were sharply higher following further reports confirming that additional booster Covid shots were effective against the Omicron variant.
The sell off on Wall Street comes just a day ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting, which is expected to culminate on Wednesday in an announcement of a faster pace of bond tapering.
""We think the key policy decision at this meeting will be to accelerate the taper to a pace of $30bn/month, beginning in January, and setting the taper on course to conclude in mid-March,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note. 
The widely expected move to a faster pace of bond tapering has many betting that the Fed will move earlier than planned to increase rate hikes. Any indication of an earlier than expected liftoff in rates is unlikely to lead to selloff in equities as markets have been pricing in a move up in rates after Fed chairman Powell flagged the risk of elevated inflation persisting for longer than expected.          
""If we see that [rate hike expectations] change by a month or two, I don't think that the markets are going to sell off dramatically,"" Phillip Toews, CEO & Portfolio Manager of Toews Asset Management said in an interview with Investing.com on Monday. ""We're coming from such a low level of interest rates, there's an expectation already that rates are moving up."""

Investing.com -- Stocks fell on Monday after news out of the U.K. of the first death from the Omicron coronavirus variant, as investors paused for this week’s Federal Reserve policy meeting.
The two-day meeting kicks off Tuesday. The Fed is expected to consider speeding up the wind-down of its bond buying program so it can turn to raising rates amid higher inflation.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said as much last month in Congressional hearings, with expectations rising for two or even three rate increases next year. The Fed has held short-term rates close to zero to support the economy during the pandemic.
Stocks of travel and leisure companies were weighed down by the news of the U.K. death, on uncertainty about a fresh wave of travel restrictions and lockdowns even over the holiday season.
Balancing out the negative news about the fast spread of Omicron, vaccines and antibody treatments continue to show positive developments, especially after a booster shot boosts immunity.
This week is light on data as well as earnings, aside from the Fed’s two-day meeting, after which it is expected to update on its outlook for rates next year.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Producer prices
U.S. producer or wholesale prices, a measure of inflation before goods and services reach the end-consumer, are likely to have risen in November by 0.5%, a tad cooler than October’s 0.6% on a month-on-month basis. The data are released at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
On a year-on-year basis, it’s likely to have surged by 9.2% against 8.6% in the prior month.
2. Core wholesale inflation
The so-called core inflation at the wholesale level, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, gained 0.4% in November, the same increase as October’s. On a year-on-year basis, November’s hike is seen at 7.2%, sharper than October’s 6.8%.
3. Apple’s big number
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock inched higher on Monday and touched a lifetime high in a weak market. The stock touched a lifetime high of $182.09 to reach a market cap of $2.98 trillion on Monday.
The company is already the most valuable in the world and could be the first company to hit the $3 trillion mark in market value.

1340,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 03:37PM ET</span>",Intel's first foray into the metaverse will be software to use others' chips,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - In their first public comments on its strategy for tapping into the ""metaverse,""  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) executives said the firm is working on software that will help laptops tap into computing power from other devices, including chips from its rivals.
While the definition of ""metaverse"" is broad, it generally refers to immersive virtual worlds that will be accessed via the internet and a variety of devices, like virtual reality headsets. 
The trend is expected to require vastly more computing power, and firms like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp, which makes chips and software used to construct the virtual world, and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, which makes chips used in virtual reality headsets, have both gained value in recent months on investor enthusiasm about the metaverse.
At a news conference after a presentation at the RealTime Conference on metaverse technologies on Monday, Raja Koduri, head of Intel's accelerated computing systems and graphics group, said the company's first technology push into the metaverse will be software that helps devices take advantage of computing power that already exists and is unused.
For example, if a gamer is playing a graphics-heavy title on a laptop that would tax the system's chips but has an unused gaming PC in another room, the software could detect the spare power sitting idle on the PC and tap into it over a home network to make the laptop game run better. 

Koduri said the software will work with chips from competitors. The software is designed to solve technical challenges for users, and not just to generate major revenue for Intel. Some of it will be shared, Koduri said.
""The way we are architecting all the layers is that it is going to work with everybody's hardware, as long as they are on industry standard specifications,"" Koduri told reporters. ""There'll be a lot of open sourcing involved with everything that we build.""

Ciena  (NYSE:CIEN) and CommScope (COMM) should benefit from industry tailwinds. But which of these two stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.Ciena Corporation (CIEN) provides network hardware, software, and services that support transport, routing, switching, aggregation, service delivery, and managing video, data, and voice traffic worldwide. It operates through four segments: Networking Platforms; Blue Planet Automation Software and Services; Platform Software and Service; and Global Services. On the other hand, CommScope Holding Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:COMM) provides infrastructure solutions for communications and entertainment networks. It operates through four segments: Broadband Networks; Home Networks; Outdoor Wireless Networks; and Venue and Campus Networks.
With the remote working culture becoming a new norm, the demand for reliable internet connection and high internet bandwidth from businesses and individuals have increased significantly, driving the need for fiber optics network infrastructure. Moreover, with the resurgence of omicron coronavirus cases and companies increasingly adopting technology-based solutions, the demand is expected to rise. Also, the $1 trillion infrastructure bill is expected to boost the fiber optics industry's growth in the upcoming years. According to Valuates Reports, the fiber optics market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.8% between 2021 and 2026. Therefore, both CIEN and COMM should benefit.
CIEN has gained 21.2% over the past month, while COMM has returned 20.4%. Also, CIEN’s 36.1% gains over the past three months are significantly higher than COMM’s negative returns. Moreover, CIEN is the clear winner with 59.1% gains versus COMM’s negative returns in terms of the past year’s performance.

Moreover, the recently enacted infrastructure bill in the U.S. has provisions for improving broadband internet accessibility, which should further boost the communication equipment sector. And the growing demand for 5G networks should also drive the demand for communication equipment. With these factors as a backdrop, the shares of Cisco (CSCO), Motorola (MSI), Zebra Technologies (ZBRA), and Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) have gained significantly in price over the past year and could soar higher. So, let’s pore over these names.
Communication equipment refers to hardware that is used for telecommunication purposes. These products include a vast spread of communication technologies, that include transmission lines, satellites, radios, routers, and even smartphones. The companies in this field are often engaged with telecommunication service providers.
In November, President Biden signed a $1 trillion-plus infrastructure bill into law. The bill allocates $65 billion for improving broadband internet access in rural areas. During the pandemic, the wireless industry has benefitted from user dependence for work and education. In addition, the demand for 5G services has increased, and companies are investing significantly to deploy 5G solutions as soon as possible. The global 5G services market is expected to grow at a 30.3% CAGR from 2022 - 2026, which could increase the need for advanced communication equipment.
Furthermore, the global telecom equipment market is expected to reach $866.8 billion by 2028, surging at a 6% - 8% CAGR. Therefore, we think fundamentally strong communication equipment stocks Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), Motorola Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:MSI), Zebra Technologies Corporation (ZBRA), and Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR) might be solid bets.

(Reuters) - Shares of Gamestop and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) tumbled to multi-month lows on Monday as some investors appeared to sour on the names that had produced eye-watering gains earlier in the year.
Video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) was recently down about 11% at $141.74, briefly touching its lowest level since April, while movie theater operator AMC slumped 14% to $23.64, a level last seen in May.
The sell-offs come amid declines in other buzzy assets, whose prices have in some cases been sliding for weeks as worries over a more hawkish Federal Reserve and a COVID-19 resurgence shake some corners of the market.
The ARK Innovation ETF was recently down 2.4% and has dropped 25% year-to-date as investors ditched the stay-at-home names that thrived during the lockdowns. 
Rallies in GameStop and AMC captivated Wall Street earlier in the year and put a spotlight on the retail investors that helped drive the moves, often coordinating in forums such as Reddit's WallStreetBets. They are still up more than 600% and nearly 1,000% for the year, respectively.
Both companies have also had their share of unwelcome news in recent days. GameStop posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss last week, while top executives at AMC reported large stake sales, accelerating losses in the stocks.
Online brokerage Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) Markets, another favorite among the retail crowd, dropped 5.6% on Monday to $19, a fresh post-IPO low. The company went public in July at $38 per share.
VanEck Social Sentiment ETF, which tracks stocks based on social media traction, has tumbled about 13% in the second half of this year and has dropped about 5% since its debut in March.

Randy Frederick, managing director of trading & derivatives at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, Texas, believes retail investors may be running out of funds to invest in meme stocks and other assets, as government stimulus checks that helped fuel trading earlier in the year are depleted.

Great Wall did not respond to a request for comment. 
Coming just weeks before Nissan's three Barcelona plants are scheduled to close, the decision is a blow to authorities and leaves the fate of around 1,600 direct jobs up in the air, as GWM was the main contender to take over the largest factory.

The Industry Ministry said in a statement the Chinese company had said it would not proceed with the project. Last week, national and regional authorities sent an improved proposal when GWM reportedly cast doubts on its initial interest in the plant.
Another meeting on the plant's future will be held on Dec. 17 to discuss striking a deal by the end of the year with other possible investors, the statement said.

(Reuters) -Meta Platforms Inc, the owner of social media network Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), is behind a $60 million deal to acquire the trademark assets of U.S. regional bank  Meta Financial  Group (NASDAQ:CASH), spokespeople for the companies said on Monday.
The deal underscores how valuable the Meta name has become for the technology giant, which is betting that its focus on the metaverse - shared digital spaces accessed via the internet through an array of devices - will pay off handsomely in the coming years.
Meta Financial had said in regulatory filing on Monday that a Delaware company called Beige Key LLC agreed to acquire the worldwide rights to its company names for $60 million in cash. It did not disclose who the owner of Beige Key was.
""Beige Key is affiliated with us and we have acquired these trademark assets,"" a Meta Platforms spokesperson said. A MetaBank spokesperson also confirmed Meta Platforms' involvement.
As well as offering products through its MetaBank subsidiary including consumer savings, loans and credit cards, and commercial lending, Meta Financial partners with institutions including government agencies and financial technology firms to offer banking services with the aim of bolstering financial inclusion.
Facebook said in October its parent company had changed its name to Meta Platforms. The tech giant, which has invested heavily in virtual reality and augmented reality, sees the metaverse as the successor to the mobile internet.
Last week, Meta Platforms opened up its previously invite-only Horizon Worlds app, where users of its Quest virtual reality headsets can play games and interact as avatars, to over-18 users in the United States and Canada. 
The metaverse concept, which has cropped up on several Silicon Valley companies' earnings calls and which will require cooperation among tech giants, could be more than a decade away from being fully realized.
The Meta Platforms spokesperson said the company engaged in discussions with Meta Financial before Facebook's name change was announced. 

In the filing, Meta Financial said it had embarked on a brand strategy review earlier this year, but the MetaBank spokesperson declined to comment on the negotiations beyond the contents of the filing.
Meta Financial's shares were trading 1.5% lower in mid-afternoon trading, giving it a market capitalization of around $1.74 billion. Meta Platforms was up 1.6%, valuing it at $933 billion.

The stock was last up about 2.5%, partly recovering from a route of over 5% on Friday that was blamed on a scene in the just-released series premiere. In the scene, the fictional Mr. Big suffers a fatal heart attack after taking a Peloton bike class. 
The death of Big, played by actor Chris Noth, leaves a major character, actress Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie Bradshaw, a widow.
On Sunday, Peloton posted on YouTube a tongue-in-cheek commercial responding to the scene, featuring Noth and Jess King, a real-life Peloton instructor who plays one in the HBO Max television comedy-drama, ""And Just Like That."" 
Sitting intimately on a sofa in front of a fireplace, Noth says to King, ""I feel great. Shall we take another ride? Life's too short not to."" 
The ad ends with a voiceover by actor Ryan Reynolds listing the health benefits of regular cycling.

Peloton's stock has lost over half of its value since Nov. 4, when it warned that demand for its exercise bikes and treadmills was slowing faster than expected as people return to pre-pandemic habits.

1348,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 02:10PM ET</span>",Activist Land & Buildings to seek seat on American Campus Communities board,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) -Activist investment firm Land & Buildings Investment Management is seeking a seat on the board of  American Campus  Communities (NYSE:ACC), according to an open letter to shareholders, and believes the company needs to sell assets aggressively and buy back stock.
Land & Buildings, which generally pushes for changes at real-estate companies, previously held discussions with the Austin, Texas-headquartered owner and operator of student housing about strategy and capital allocation. In January it reached an agreement for ACC to overhaul its board of directors.
But Jonathan Litt, Land & Building's founder and chief investment officer, feels the changes made earlier this year did not go far enough to correct persistent problems, the people said. ACC added three new directors, appointed a new chair and formed a capital allocation committee.
To push for changes more forcefully, it was imperative to add an investor, or stakeholder, to the company's board, Litt said in the letter. It was not clear from the letter whether Litt planned to nominate himself as a director candidate.
The company said it has engaged in a constructive dialogue with Land & Buildings and refreshed the board with the hedge fund's support. 
""We have taken significant action to deliver superior performance, and today, ACC shares are trading near all-time highs,"" a spokesman said. ""Based on these actions, the Company is poised to benefit from the positive fundamentals of the student housing industry, and we are confident in our prospects for continued earnings growth and value creation.""
While ACC's stock price has gained 27% this year, it has underperformed its peers by 13% since the cooperation agreement was signed in January, Litt's letter said.
Land & Buildings owned a 1.03% stake in ACC at the end of the third quarter, according to regulatory filings. The company is valued at $7.6 billion.
Litt feels the board needs to show investors that it is moving more aggressively to bring ACC's stock price, which is currently trading at $55.02, toward ""fair value"" closer to $70 a share, the letter said. 
More aggressive sales should be a first step and could be very lucrative at a time when more students are returning to study full time and prices for these types of properties are rising. Share buybacks, which the company has historically avoided, would also be helpful.
Additionally, the company should cut costs, with general and administrative expenses having more than doubled since 2013. The board should also review all strategic alternatives to help boost the share price, the letter said.
Although Litt is not pushing for an immediate sale of the company, he believes boards need always to look at all options to increase value, including a possible sale, the letter said. 
Earlier this month, the hedge fund nominated two candidates, including Litt, for election at Lexington Realty (NYSE:LXP) Trust.
Industry analysts say the pace of investors returning to a company with which they recently reached a settlement or where another activist is already on the board is picking up.

In April 2020, Privatization Secretary Salim Mattar announced plans to sell 17 companies, including state telecommunications operator Telebras, the Casa da Moeda mint, the postal service Correios and federal data processors Dataprev and Serpro. Another 20 companies -- including Eletrobras, Latin America's largest utility; Infraero, the agency that manages Brazil's airports; agricultural research company Embrapa; and crop supply agency Conab -- could be put up for sale, he said.
PRIVATIZATION AGENDA
So far, only major companies that belonged to Petrobras have been privatized. State-owned Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as it is formally known, sold an initial stake in its fuel distribution arm BR Distribuidora, via a share offering in mid-2019. Petrobras divested its remaining 37.5% stake in the company, now called Vibra Energia, in June for more than 11.3 billion reais ($2 billion). Petrobras also sold its liquefied petroleum gas unit Liquigas in December 2020 and natural gas assets Transportadora Associada de Gas(TAG)in July of that year.
Eletrobras is also in line to be privatized. However, the process has been set back by delays at the General Accounting Office, which postponed its analysis on Wednesday of the sale formula to dilute the state's stake by floating shares. This approval now may not happen until next year.
Seven auctions of federal companies were expected in the second semester of this year. Some, however, were postponed until next year, such as the port of Vitoria and Minas Gerais food supply center Ceasaminas.
Last week, the government decided to exclude the Casa da Moeda mint from the privatization list. According to the Economy Ministry, there were ""restrictions"" on going into partnership with the private sector to issue things like money and stamps.
WHAT IS AT STAKE?
Although he came into office promising to be a big advocate for state asset sales, Bolsonaro -- who is up for re-election next year -- himself has emerged as a roadblock to parts of the privatization program. The president has personally vetoed some of the sales, such as those of the mint and Sao Paulo food supply center Ceagesp.
The expected privatization of the postal service will not happen this year, either. O Globo newspaper said the government was unable to find enough support in Congress to proceed with the sale of Correios in 2021.At the same time, Bolsonaro has tried to show some interest in his government's free market agenda. Last April, he celebrated the privatization of Rio de Janeiro’s state sanitation company Cedae, which raised 22.7 billion reais, saying it was a history-making moment for Brazil, its economy and its markets.
The president has also touted the idea of privatizing Petrobras, Brazil's largest company. Last month, he said such a move was an option to control fuel price increases. But on Tuesday, Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said privatizing Petrobras was not in the government's plans, at least not in its ""first mandate.""

The ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

1351,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 01:45PM ET</span>",Peru mining chamber says tax hike proposal risks $50 billion investment,"By Marco Aquino
LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's mining chamber lambasted on Monday a government proposal to raise taxes on the sector by at least 3 percentage points, saying it would put more than $50 billion in future investments at risk in the world's second largest copper producer.
Peru's Finance Minister Pedro Francke said on Sunday that the government wants to increase mining taxes by 3 to 4 percentage points, citing a study from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which gave room to hike levies.
The government of leftist President Pedro Castillo has been at loggerheads with mining firms since he came to office in July, pledging to redistribute the Andean country's mineral wealth and hike taxes to fund social programs.
There have also been a spate of protests against the sector, with mining firms complaining that the government has not done enough to resolve blockades that have at times hit production.
The National Society of Mining, Oil and Energy said Francke's proposal would ""irreparably"" damage competitiveness in Peru's sector mining, the engine of the country's economy.
""We consider that there is ample evidence that the tax burden on mining is currently close to 50% of profits,"" the chamber said. It added the rate in neighboring Chile was just over 40%, while it was 35.5% in Canada and 44.3% in Australia.
""These are mining countries with which Peru competes directly.""
Those numbers clash what the government says. Francke claimed on Sunday, citing the IMF study, that Peru's mining tax rate was 41.7%, lower than Chile's 47.1%.
Castillo's government is pushing the opposition-dominated Congress to approve plans before the end of the year to legislate on tax reforms, mainly in the mining sector currently benefiting from high international metal prices.
The mining chamber said Peru's economy ministry had used a ""a particular interpretation"" of the IMF's preliminary report, which has not yet been publicly released.
""A bad redesign of the tax scheme will discourage investments in expansions of mines already operating and in new mining projects. Future investments of more than $50 billion are at risk,"" it added.

1352,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 01:36PM ET</span>",Bin bags of cash: NatWest fined for dirty money breaches,"By Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) -NatWest has been fined 265 million pounds ($350.9 million) for failing to prevent the laundering of nearly 400 million pounds, in the first criminal money laundering case against a British bank.
A gang deposited hundreds of millions of pounds in cash at around 50 branches of NatWest, prosecutors for Britain's financial regulator said on Monday, with at least one outlet receiving more than 40 million pounds.
Couriers walked through the streets of towns across the country carrying bags of cash they deposited at the bank's branches before the scheme was busted by police, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) told the judge at a London crown court.
One person in Walsall, central England, arrived at a branch with so much cash - 700,000 pounds - that it burst the bin liners it was being carried in. The money had to be repacked in hessian bags, the FCA's lawyer Clare Montgomery said, adding the cash did not fit in the branch's floor-to-ceiling safes.
The state-backed bank pleaded guilty in October to three criminal charges of not monitoring customer accounts adequately between 2012 and 2016. 
Announcing the fine on Monday, the judge said it would have been nearly 400 million pounds, but a deduction was made for the bank's guilty plea. 
NatWest is Britain's biggest business bank and is majority-owned by taxpayers after a 45 billion pound-plus state bailout during the financial crisis.
The bank had largely already provisioned for the fine, NatWest said, and its shares fell only 0.7%, less than the overall FTSE 100, which was 0.8% lower on the day on Monday.
But the court case is a setback to NatWest CEO Alison Rose's attempts to clean up its image, including a rebrand following its near-collapse and run of scandals under its previous group name Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS_old_old).
""We deeply regret that we failed to adequately monitor one of our customers between 2012 and 2016 for the purpose of preventing money laundering,"" Rose said in a statement released after the sentencing.
She added the bank would continue to invest in fighting financial crime.
Regulators in Britain and Europe have been seeking to crack down on money laundering after a series of scandals in recent years, but until the NatWest case, the only cases in Britain had been civil rather than criminal. 
HAIR EXTENSIONS AND MUSTY BANKNOTES
The FCA said NatWest failed to monitor suspect activity by a client - Fowler Oldfield, a gold dealer and jeweller based in Bradford, northern England, liquidated after a police raid in 2016 - that deposited about 365 million pounds, including 264 million in cash.
At its height, as much as 1.8 million pounds was deposited in cash daily, making the customer NatWest's biggest in the area, Montgomery said.
NatWest failed to properly investigate numerous warnings generated by its financial crime systems, miscategorised the customer as lower risk than it was, and staff investigating the warnings lacked sufficient experience and knowledge, the FCA lawyer said.
One rule designed to flag suspicious activity was disabled by NatWest because it created too many alerts, ""so the bank decided it should be deactivated,"" Montgomery said.
Another alert was triggered when Fowler Oldfield paid 387,000 pounds to an account belonging to a supplier of hair extensions and cosmetics, before the funds were transferred to a pub and out to a money transfer company, the judge said.
The National Crime Agency (NCA) at one stage raised concerns at the quantity of Scottish bank notes being deposited many miles away in England, which it said was an indicator of potential crime, the FCA said.
The NCA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
One of the bank's cash centres in Washington, north-east England, voiced concern about the volume of Scottish notes being deposited and said they had a musty smell, potentially due to long storage rather than regular business use. 
A person working at a NatWest cash centre in Basingstoke, southern England, who was close to retirement, said the activity was the most suspicious he had seen in his career, the FCA said.
""How could they possibly have missed all this? That would be a perfectly reasonable question. To which the answer is, they didn't miss it,"" John Kelsey-Fry, lawyer for NatWest, told the court.
""The protections in the bank actually worked to the extent that the relevant activity was identified, it was highlighted. It did not escape the bank's systems, it did not go under the radar. The quality and adequacy of that scrutiny is another matter.""
Apart from the fine, the judge also ordered NatWest pay the FCA 4 million pounds in costs and issued a confiscation order for 460,000 pounds gained by NatWest from Fowler Oldfield.

In a statement, the FCA said a separate investigation by West Yorkshire Police had led to 11 people pleading guilty to charges relating to the cash deposits and three cash couriers being charged. A further 13 people await trial at Leeds Crown Court, northern England, in April 2022.

In addition, rapid digitalization is expected to accelerate the software industry's growth. Therefore, we believe recent price dips offer an excellent opportunity to bet on fundamentally sound mid-cap software technology stocks  Endava  (NYSE:DAVA),  Amdocs  (NASDAQ:DOX), and Datto (MSP). Read on.Due to the emergence of the COVID-19 omicron variant, some states are imposing or re-imposing travel restrictions, leading to delays in some U.S. workers return to offices. The continuing remote lifestyle should reinforce small to large enterprises' reliance on software solutions. In addition, according to a  Gartner  (NYSE:IT) report, the U.S. will lead in terms of remote workers in 2022, accounting for 53% of the U.S. workforce.
A better work-life balance and productivity, higher average annual income, and higher job retention have driven workers and organizations to opt for remote/hybrid work and lifestyles. Businesses are spending billions of dollars on software to upgrade and improve their business processes. As such, the global software market is expected to reach $823.71 billion by 2026, registering a 7.2% CAGR.
These factors have heightened investor optimism about the software industry, which is evident in the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF's (IGV) 19.5% returns over the past year. So, we think it could be wise to bet on quality mid-cap software stocks Endava plc (DAVA), Amdocs Limited (DOX), and Datto Holding Corp. (MSP). They are currently trading below their 52-week highs and could witness significant upside in the coming months.

1355,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 01:22PM ET</span>",U.S. Senate panel to hold hearing on Biden auto-safety agency pick,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee on Thursday is set to hold a confirmation hearing on President Joe Biden's nominee to head the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), an agency without a permanent leader for nearly five years.
The Democratic president's nominee is Steven Cliff, a former California Air Resources Board official who since February has served as NHTSA's deputy administrator. Cliff has been a key figure in the Biden administration's proposed rewrite of vehicle fuel economy standards through 2026 and is overseeing its safety investigation of electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
NHTSA asked Tesla in September why it has not issued a recall to address software updates made to its Autopilot driver-assistance system for its cars. The agency also has held recent discussions with Tesla about why it allows video games to be played on a touch screen mounted in front of the dashboard and its plans to replace cameras in some vehicles.
NHTSA in August opened a formal safety inquiry into Tesla's Autopilot system in 765,000 U.S. vehicles after a series of crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles.
The agency, part of the U.S. Transportation Department, faces a backlog of pending auto safety regulations and has not had a Senate-confirmed administrator since January 2017, the month when Republican former President Donald Trump took office. Prior to Cliff's selection in October, there had not been a nominee for NHTSA's top job since 2019.

NHTSA in August proposed reversing the Trump administration's rollback of Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States has experienced a sustained increase in traffic deaths that NHTSA attributes to impaired driving, speeding, a failure to wear seatbelts and other unsafe behavior.
U.S. traffic deaths soared by 18.4% in the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period a year earlier, representing the most deadly first half of a year on American roads since 2006, NHTSA said. It was the largest six-month increase recorded since the current tracing system has been in use since 1975.

A report in the Alibaba-owned South China Morning Post stated that ""an undercover report on Monday by the state-backed Beijing News showed staff in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi using expired cocoa liquid, matcha liquid and cream.""
Starbucks, which has 5,400 stores in China, closed the two branches pending an investigation, explaining on Chinese microblogging website Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) that they ""immediately launched an in-depth investigation.""
""In the 22 years since entering the Chinese market, we have been committed to implementing strict food safety standards and resolutely adopting a zero tolerance attitude towards food safety issues. The general public and media are welcome to continue to supervise us,"" they added. 
Starbucks shares haven't moved much on the report, down 1%, but Baird believes it could bring a backlash. As a result, the investment firm lowered its price target to $126 from $128, telling investors it would likely be transitory but could weigh on Starbucks shares in the short term when considering the importance of China to the company. "

However, President Biden’s efforts to address the crisis and rising demand from several industries should propel the chip industry’s growth. Therefore, we think dividend-paying chip stocks Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Intel (INTC), and United Microelectronics (UMC) could be ideal bets now. Also, these stocks are rated Strong Buy in our proprietary POWR Ratings system. So, let’s discuss these names.Analysts expect the global semiconductor shortage to persist in 2022 due to increased demand for electronics, electric vehicles (EVs), and other products that require semiconductor chips to operate. However, the CEO of Mubadala, Abu Dhabi’s state investment fund and a major shareholder in chipmaker GlobalFoundries, believes the semiconductor industry is on track to record exponential growth over the next decade. He added that chipmakers are poised to play a “crucial” role in the global economy.
Rising demand from several industries, including consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs), and the Biden administration’s pressure on Congress to pass a $52 billion spending bill before Christmas to tackle the crisis should drive the semiconductor industry’s growth. The global semiconductor chip market is expected to reach $553.6 billion by 2026, registering a 7.8% CAGR.
Given this backdrop, along with rising inflation and expected market volatility due to the effects of the COVID-19 omicron variant, we think it could be wise to bet on dividend-paying chip stocks Broadcom Inc.

1364,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 12:18PM ET</span>","GameStop, AMC Drag Meme Stock Group to 7-Month Low","(Bloomberg) -- Losses for a basket of so-called meme stocks are mounting with traders shifting away from riskier assets in the final weeks of the year. 
The group of 37 retail trading favorites tracked by Bloomberg extended losses to 6% at 11:50 a.m. in New York, as selling pressure for markets around the globe accelerated. The index has shed almost a quarter of its value over the past three weeks as it slides to the lowest level in seven months.
Risky assets and high-flying tech companies have been under pressure since worries surrounding the omicron coronavirus strain began to bubble and as traders attempt to gauge the Federal Reserve’s next moves. The volatility for meme stocks is nothing new as massive rallies and rapid selloffs for the group is the status quo.
“For SPACs and meme stocks, my sense is FOMO was a big driver,” said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners. “Now reality is sinking in and investor sentiment is shifting to fear and downside risk, rather than greed and upside potential.”
The pain has been apparent for blank-check companies and the firms they lead to the public market. The IPOX SPAC Index, a balanced mix of 50 SPACs and De-Spacs, fell 1.7% Monday, bringing losses for the past three weeks to 9.3%.
Dip-Buying
 GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME). and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc., the two most known meme stocks, have been the biggest drags on the group since mid-November. Each is down roughly 40% in the past three weeks while Express Inc., Newegg Commerce Inc., and  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (NASDAQ:BBBY). have shed more than a quarter of their value.|
Grapevine, Texas-based GameStop is down 21% since Wednesday, when it reported a wider-than-expected loss in the third-quarter and as details on its turnaround underwhelmed investors. AMC Entertainment has been caught in a selloff alongside reopening stocks and as key executives sold shares. 
Retail traders on Fidelity’s platform rushed to buy shares of AMC Entertainment’s 18% dip and GameStop’s 14% drop on Monday. The pair were among the five most bought stocks by Fidelity’s customers with buy orders far outpacing sell orders.
To be sure, despite the recent volatility and pain meme stocks have delivered eye-popping gains. AMC Entertainment is up almost 1,000% this year and GameStop shares have rallied 640% -- outperforming the group’s 44% rise.

(Reuters) -European shares ended lower on Monday, led by travel and energy stocks over rising Omicron variant risks, while a wave of central bank policy decisions this week kept investor sentiment subdued. 
The pan-European benchmark STOXX 600 erased early session gains to end 0.4% lower, marking its fourth consecutive day in the red. 
Travel stocks dropped 2.6% on risks of tougher movement restrictions after the United Kingdom reported its first death from the Omicron coronavirus variant.
London's FTSE 100 and FTSE 250, dropped 0.8% and 1.2% respectively, to mark their worst session in two weeks. UK travel stocks dropped 3.5%. 
Oil prices weakened on worries the new variant and related curbs would hit demand. Europe's energy sector lost with Royal Dutch and BP (NYSE:BP) down between 2.2% and 2.7%. [O/R]
""Creeping headlines about the Omicron variant are weighing on traders' minds,"" said David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital. 
Investor focus is on monetary policy decisions expected to be taken by the European Central Bank (ECB), the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan this week.
The ECB is set to halve the amount of assets it buys each month from April, according to a Reuters poll, which judged that a reprieve from high euro zone inflation by late 2022 means a rate hike is years away.
""It's going to be a relatively dovish week due to Omicron,"" said Willem Sels, global chief investment officer at HSBC, adding that the ECB is likely to keep its pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in place due to the emergence of the new variant.
Concerns about the fast-spreading Omicron variant and surging inflation have spurred bouts of selling in the markets recently, keeping the STOXX 600 over 3% below its all-time high hit in mid-November.
On the upside, Vifor Pharma surged 18.5% after the Swiss drugmaker and Australia's CSL (OTC:CSLLY) both confirmed they were talking about a potential merger.

Norwegian aluminium maker Norsk Hydro (OTC:NHYDY) rose 2.7% after raising its cost-cutting targets and announcing plans to pay a bigger dividend for 2021 following a jump in earnings.
Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) Truck rallied almost 11%, extending gains after a strong debut in Friday, with  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) starting coverage with a ""buy"" rating.

LONDON (Reuters) -Virgin Atlantic has raised 400 million pounds ($530 million) in fresh funding from shareholders Virgin Group and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) as a new bout of gloom descends on the aviation sector.
Founded by Richard Branson in 1984, Virgin Atlantic has been particularly hard hit during the COVID-19 crisis after business travel and long-haul flights largely ground to a halt. 
The new funds announced on Monday will help the airline to bolster its balance sheet, cut debt, improve liquidity and withstand any new downturn in flying, it said.
""Virgin Atlantic's business has transformed, allowing them to emerge from the pandemic a stronger airline,"" said Josh Bayliss, CEO of Branson's Virgin Group. 
The agreement for new funding adds to 1.5 billion pounds of recapitalisation completed over the past two years. The split for the fresh funds is 204 million pounds from Virgin Group and the rest from Delta.
The ownership structure remains unchanged, with Virgin Group owning 51%. 
Virgin Atlantic, which flies to the United States, the Caribbean and destinations in Asia, said the full support of shareholders and creditors means it is now ready to recover after the reopening of U.S. borders to European nationals and as it benefits from pent up demand for next year. 
Airlines such as Virgin and British Airways were given a huge boost in early November when the United States reopened its borders to allow normal transatlantic routes to resume. 
Some of that optimism has since dimmed, however, as emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant has forced the reintroduction of some travel restrictions. Shares in British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) are down 16% in a little more than two weeks.

Major British airlines on Monday also called on the government to remove testing rules for vaccinated passengers and provide economic support for the battered sector.

Investing.com —  IGM Biosciences Inc  (NASDAQ:IGMS) shares tumbled 40% Monday after the release of data from a phase 1 trial of a drug for patients with advanced B cell malignancies.
Overall, out of the 38 patients evaluable for efficacy, 11 patients showed a response, eight of which were complete responses.
The news saw RBC Capital downgrade the stock, while analysts at Stifel and Wedbush lowered price targets.
RBC's Brian Abrahams told investors that IGM's lead bispecific antibody, IGM-2323, remains clearly active in NHL but has less robust activity than previous cuts. The analyst added that while more data is needed, its future opportunities will narrow if the drug has to compete in the crowded space primarily on its safety profile. Abrahams set a $51 price target on the stock, down from $90.
Stifel lowered their price target to $65 from $98, keeping a buy rating on the stock. 
Wedbush's Robert Driscoll lowered the IGM price target to $67 from $82, keeping an outperform rating. Driscoll explained that while clinical activity remains highly promising, IGM-2323 appears to show weaker activity in higher dose groups."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two major book publishers told a judge a U.S. Justice Department antitrust lawsuit should be rejected, calling the government's arguments ""legally, factually, and economically wrong.""
In November, the Justice Department sued to block Penguin Random House, the world's biggest book publisher, from buying competitor Simon & Schuster, saying the deal would give the company ""outsized influence"" over what Americans read.
""The merger will neither reduce that leverage nor lessen the incentives of Penguin Random House and its competitors to make aggressive offers for the most coveted books,"" the companies said in a court filing Monday.
German media group Bertelsmann , which owns Penguin Random House, last year agreed to pay $2.175 billion to buy Simon and Schuster from ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) , strengthening its presence in the United States and adding novelist Stephen King, Pulitzer Prize winner Anthony Doerr and veteran journalist Bob  Woodward  (NASDAQ:WWD) to its stable of authors.
In its complaint filed in federal court in Washington, the Justice Department said the deal would give ""outsized influence over who and what is published, and how much authors are paid for their work.""
The complaint stressed the importance of the companies competing for top-selling books as well as the money earned by authors who write them.
The booksellers said the Justice Department ""wants to protect the most successful authors, those with sophisticated agents and the most lucrative book contracts.""

If the merger were completed, the deal would give Penguin Random House nearly half of the market for publishing rights to blockbuster books while its nearest competitors would be less than half its size, the complaint said.
The book publishers added the Justice Department did ""not allege that the merger will reduce competition in the market for book sales or raise prices for consumers.""

The world's biggest asset manager said it had turned ""underweight"" European government bonds, predicting yields would head higher while current market pricing pointed to no substantive change in monetary policy for several years.
""We see inflation settling above pre-Covid trends – we’re going to be living with inflation,"" said Philipp Hildebrand, vice chairman of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) in a note to clients published on Monday.
""We favor equities over fixed income as a result, but have dialed back our risk-taking given the wide range of potential outcomes in 2022.""
BlackRock Global Chief Investment Strategist Wei Li said another up year for equities is expected in 2022, while bonds would have another down year, adding it was rare to have two consecutive years with that happening.
Only modest gains are forecast for stocks in the coming year due to ""decelerating growth, central banks starting to normalize, a likely peak in profit growth, and potential earnings disappointments,"" the outlook said.
On the bond front, BlackRock said it continues to be ""firmly underweight"" U.S. Treasuries.
Climate change was also part of the inflation story, said BlackRock in its 2022 outlook note, and would likely deliver a series of supply shocks playing out over decades.

PARIS (Reuters) - A Paris appeals court on Monday slashed the penalty UBS must pay for allegedly helping wealthy clients in France evade taxes to 1.8 billion euros ($2 billion), but upheld that the Swiss bank was guilty of both promoting illegal banking services and money laundering.
The revised penalty is less than half an overall fine of 4.5 billion euros imposed against the bank after a first trial in 2019 and shares in UBS rose more than 2% after Monday's verdict.
The bank, however, had hoped to see the charges thrown out by the appeals court, particularly the money laundering allegation because of the potential reputational damage.
It said it would decide quickly on whether to lodge an appeal against the ruling with France's Supreme Court.
""The bank takes note of this decision,"" Herve Temime, a lawyer representing UBS said after the verdict.
""Compared to the first instance ruling, there is a financial gain of 2.7 billion euros, but it is a criminal conviction and therefore we will make our decision very quickly."" 
Fines in Europe for tax-related and other offences have historically been lower than in the United States, with the UBS case marking an exception that has been closely watched by other banks. 
Confirming the verdict of the 2019 trial, the appeals court found UBS guilty of soliciting clients illegally at sporting events and parties in France, and of laundering the proceeds of tax evasion. 
UBS has already set aside 450 million euros in provisions in connection with the case.
Citi analysts said that the bank was likely to book another $1.5 billion charge in the fourth quarter of this year, assuming it does not appeal the verdict.
This, it added, would leave the bank with some $4.2 billion of excess capital, placing it ""in a strong position to announce bigger (share) buybacks with the full-year results and strategy update on 1 February."" 
Lawyers for the bank had argued in the appeals trial that despite whistleblowers coming forward, investigators had never found clear evidence of systematic attempts by UBS sales consultants to canvass French customers, including at client events like cocktail parties and hunts.

The bank had also argued that the original fine was disproportionate.

Let’s discuss.The major stock market indexes ended in the green last week despite COVID-19 omicron-related fears and high inflation concerns.

However, U.S. jobless claims recently declined to a 52-year low.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) provided a positive outlook for 2022. JPM Global Research Leader Marko Kolanovic said, “Our view is that 2022 will be the year of a full global recovery, an end of the pandemic, and a return to normal economic and market conditions we had prior to the COVID-19 outbreak.” And according to a Factset report, a record-high net profit margin is expected in 2022.

Read on.The COVID-19 pandemic dealt a severe blow to the demand for air travel and the industry faced an uncertain future. The impact was so intense that many airlines had to lay off staff to reduce costs. Although the economy is recovering gradually, the demand for air travel could remain low as the work-from-home trend continues and people continue doing business from their homes and avoiding business travel.
With the reports of the new coronavirus variant, omicron, surfacing recently, the airline industry is again expected to suffer as nations revise travel entry rules and implement border restrictions. According to a Kyodo news report, the global airline industry is expected to remain unprofitable in 2022 with a combined net loss of $12 billion, because travel demand will remain subdued at below pre-pandemic levels.

SEAT has decided to advance by one week its production break before the Christmas holidays, which was originally planned to start after Dec. 23 but it will now be after Dec. 16.
""The crisis of global semiconductors supply, that affects all the automobile industry, will force us to idle the Martorell plant on 17, 20, 21, 22 and 23 December,"" the company said on Monday in a statement.
The production curbs come as demand for the SEAT and CUPRA brands is back at pre-pandemic levels, the statement said.
The company will also close down the next week on Jan. 3, 4 and 7, as Jan. 5 and 6, are holidays, it added.
SEAT has curbed its production several times all along 2021, including a partial idling of the plant, in late August.
The Martorell plant assembled around 500,000 cars in 2019, before the start of the pandemic.

Carmakers around the world have been forced to make sharp production cuts this year as supply chain disruptions and booming demand for consumer electronics have led to an acute shortage of microchips that takes more time to ease than expected.

(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) said on Monday it would buy drug developer Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc for $6.7 billion in cash, to add a promising treatment candidate that targets diseases affecting the stomach and intestine.
The $100 per share offer is double the last closing price of Arena's stock, which surged 83.7% to $91.92 in early trading. 
This is the latest deal Pfizer has struck this year to expand its treatment pipeline. The company last month acquired immuno-oncology company Trillium Therapeutics (NASDAQ:TRIL) Inc for about $2.22 billion to strengthen its arsenal of blood cancer therapies.
Monday's deal will help Pfizer gain access to Arena's lead candidate, etrasimod, which is being tested in a late-stage trial in ulcerative colitis, as well as in a mid-to-late stage study in Crohn's disease, both types of inflammatory bowel diseases that cause ulcers in the digestive tract.
Inflammatory bowel disease is a $20 billion market globally, making it a lucrative target for drugmakers.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration approved Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY) Squibb's Zeposia for ulcerative colitis. 
Jones Trading analyst Prakhar Agrawal said etrasimod produced strong data in a mid-stage trial which looked better than Zeposia and has other convenience benefits like dose adjustments, early onset of relief that could help differentiate from rivals.
""(Etrasimod) has the potential to be best-in-class drug in these indications...could be a multi-billion blockbuster drug in just Crohn's and ulcerative colitis and we forecast risk adjusted revenue of $3.8 billion.""

Pfizer is also developing a treatment for ulcerative colitis, a chronic and inflammatory bowel disease that affects 3 million people in the United States. The candidate is currently in a mid-stage study, which is expected to be completed by the end of next year.
The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2022.

The company is expected to launch the iPhone SE with 5G capabilities in early 2022, according to media reports and the brokerage, with the analysts adding the model will allow Apple to target the mid-range smartphone market dominated by rivals such as Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and Huawei Technologies.
The upcoming smartphone has the potential to lure nearly 1.4 billion low- to mid-end Android phone and about 300 million older iPhone model users, the brokerage estimated.
""Apple's trade-in program for non-iPhones is admittedly not as attractive as the iPhone trade-in values, it could nonetheless lead to an average starting price range of $269 to $399 for the 5G iPhone SE, which is still very competitive,"" analyst Samik Chatterjee, rated five stars on Refinitiv Eikon for his estimate accuracy, said. 
The iPhone SE currently starts from $399, compared with $799 for the iPhone 13 and $999 for the iPhone 13 Pro.
Since launching the iPhone 13 range and new iPads in September, Apple has scrambled to keep up with the global chip shortage and supply chain disruptions.
Meanwhile, Apple's shares have extended their march, with the company inching closer to the $3 trillion in market capitalization. 
In a separate note, J.P.Morgan said consumer demand for major upgrades like 5G models is expected to remain strong and also a priority for supply, even as it wanes for most hardware products including smartphones, TVs and PCs.

The brokerage raised its estimates for fiscal 2022 iPhone SE unit sales to 30 million units and annual iPhone shipments expectations to 250 million units, 10 million higher than a year earlier. 
JPM raised its target price for Apple to a Street high of $210 from $180, according to Refinitiv Eikon.

The incident became a trending topic on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) social media site after the report was published and Starbucks initially said it had shut the two stores and was carrying out an investigation.
Later on Monday it said it had found that the two stores had indeed committed violations and that the company had not sufficiently paid attention to food safety standards.
""We sincerely apologise to all of Starbucks' customers,"" it said in a statement on its official Weibo account.
The Wuxi's Market Supervision Administration also said in a statement late on Monday that after conducting investigations on the two stores involved in the incident, it also carried out checks on all 82 Starbuck stories in the city, finding 15 issues in total, including employees not wearing work caps and disinfections records not being complete.
Chinese consumers and media have become more aggressive about protecting customer rights and monitoring the behaviour of big brands, especially from overseas.
Some targets, such as Canadian winterwear brand Canada Goose which drew complaints over its refund policies, have been subjected to government reprimands, while Chinese brands such as milk tea chain Nayuki have also drawn public attention.

RCC is a cough lasting more than eight weeks despite appropriate treatment. Around 9 million patients in the U.S. are estimated to be suffering from RCC.
The company expects to meet the Food and Drug Administration between April and June and begin a phase-3 study of the treatment in the second half of the year.
The stock touched a high of $9.39 so far on Monday.
Bellus is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for the treatment of refractory chronic cough and other hypersensitization-related disorders.
The company reported its third-quarter numbers last month, reporting losses that more than tripled to $23 million. Research and development expenses rose 229%, to $19 million.
Currently, there is no specific therapy approved for RCC and treatment options are limited, according to Bellus. The trial enrolled 249 participants with a baseline awake cough frequency of 25 per hour and more."

Here's what Wall Street analysts are saying about the stock.UpStart Holdings (UPST) operates a cloud-based, artificial intelligence (AI) lending platform that uses alternative data to measure credit risk and originate loans. The company is one of the fastest-growing stocks in the market with 234% revenue growth in its last earnings report. 
It’s also one of the most volatile stocks in the market. Since its IPO in December of last year, UPST is 550% higher. However, the stock is also down 60% from its early October highs. One factor in its weakness was the company’s guidance for Q4 which came in below expectations. Another is that growth stocks have been selling off with rising short-term rates. 
UPST’s growth rate and volatility make it one of the most widely-followed stocks on social media. The next major catalyst for the stock is its next earnings report in January, although the stock could continue to see selling pressure if rates continue rising into next week’s FOMC meeting.

1384,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 10:15AM ET</span>",Supreme Court asks U.S. government for views on Bayer weedkiller case,"By Lawrence Hurley and Ludwig Burger
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday asked President Joe Biden's administration for its views on whether the justices should hear  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN)'s bid to dismiss claims by customers who contend its Roundup weedkiller causes cancer, as the company seeks to avoid potentially billions of dollars in damages.
Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) in August filed a petition https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/bayer-takes-legal-battle-over-glyphosate-cancer-claims-us-supreme-court-2021-08-16 with the Supreme Court to reverse a lower court decision that upheld $25 million in damages awarded to California resident Edwin Hardeman, a Roundup user who blamed his cancer on the German pharmaceutical and chemical giant's glyphosate-based weedkillers. 
The Supreme Court's decision on whether to take up the matter is being closely watched as Bayer maneuvers to limit its legal liability in thousands of cases. U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar in the coming months is due to file a brief expressing the administration's views.
Bayer said in a statement that it is encouraged by the court's announcement, which often indicates the justices are interested in hearing a case.
The U.S. government ""has consistently found that glyphosate-based herbicides can be used safely and are not carcinogenic, and has stated that a cancer warning would be false and misleading and misbrand the product,"" Bayer's statement said.
Bayer has lost three appeals https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/bayer-loses-third-appeals-case-over-glyphosate-weedkiller-2021-08-10 against verdicts that sided with users of Roundup, awarding them tens of millions of dollars each. Bayer has pinned hopes for relief on the conservative-majority Supreme Court, which has a reputation for being pro-business. 
Bayer asked the Supreme Court to review the verdict in Hardeman's case, which was upheld https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-appeals-court-upholds-verdict-that-bayers-roundup-caused-cancer-2021-05-14 by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in May. Hardeman had regularly used Roundup for 26 years at his home in northern California before being diagnosed with a form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
There are more than 25,000 related claims that Bayer has not settled yet. 
Bayer, which also makes aspirin, Yasmin birth-control pills and the stroke prevention drug Xarelto among other products, has argued that the cancer claims over Roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate go against sound science and product clearance from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA has upheld guidance that glyphosate is not carcinogenic and not a risk to public health when used as indicated on the label. 
Bayer has said it should not be penalized for marketing a product deemed safe by the EPA and on which the agency would not allow a cancer warning to be printed.
The lawsuits against Bayer have said the company should have warned customers of the alleged cancer risk. Bayer wants the Supreme Court to find that the EPA label approval under a federal law called the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act preempts the ""failure to warn"" claims brought under state law.
Roundup-related lawsuits have dogged Bayer since it acquired the brand as part of its $63 billion purchase of agricultural seeds and pesticides maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2018.
Bayer struck a settlement deal in principle with plaintiffs in June 2020 but failed to win court approval for a separate agreement on how to handle future cases.
In July, Bayer took an additional litigation provision of $4.5 billion in case of an unfavorable ruling by the Supreme Court or in case the justices declined to consider its petition. This leaves ""significant upside"" if the Supreme Court rules in its favor, according to Bayer.
The provision came on top of $11.6 billion it previously set aside for settlements and litigation over the matter.
Bayer plans to replace glyphosate in weedkillers for the U.S. residential market for non-professional gardeners with other active ingredients. It will continue to sell the herbicide to farmers, who rely on it heavily and whose role in the litigation has been described as negligible by Bayer.

As of late October, Bayer had reached settlements in about 98,000 cases out of about 125,000 cases overall.
A California jury last week found that Roundup did not cause https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/bayer-wins-second-straight-verdict-roundup-cancer-case-2021-12-09 a woman's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Investing.com — Foghorn Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:FHTX) jumped 55% to $18.60 in early Monday trading on news of a strategic collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) to create novel oncology medicines by applying Foghorn's proprietary Gene Traffic Control platform.
Lilly will pay Foghorn an upfront consideration of $300 million in cash and make an equity investment of $80 million in Foghorn common shares at $20 per share.
There is also a co-development and co-commercialization agreement for Foghorn's BRM oncology program and an additional undisclosed oncology target. The collaboration includes three other discovery programs using Foghorn's Gene Traffic Control platform.
The BRM-selective program and additional undisclosed target program will see Foghorn direct discovery and early research activities, with Lilly heading up the development and commercialization activities. The companies will share 50/50 in the U.S. economics. In addition, Foghorn is eligible to receive royalties on sales outside of the U.S., beginning in the low double-digit range and rising into the twenties based on revenue.     
Foghorn could receive up to $1.3 billion in potential development and commercial milestones. 
""Oncogenic mutations in BRG1 impact a large population of cancer patients and we believe are best addressed therapeutically with a highly selective BRM inhibitor, though designing such a drug is a difficult chemistry challenge,"" commented Jacob Van Naarden, CEO of Loxo Oncology at Lilly and president of Lilly Oncology.

The justices left in place an April ruling by the Mississippi Supreme Court that let the lawsuit move forward.
In the case being pursued by Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, the state argues that J&J should have included a warning on its label for baby powder and other talc products about the risk of ovarian cancer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in 2014 that no such label was required and the company has said that decision preempts state lawsuits like Mississippi's.
A 2018 Reuters investigation found that J&J knew for decades that asbestos, a carcinogen, was present in its talc products. Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence showed that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, J&J's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos.
The company said in May 2020 it would stop selling its baby powder talc in the United States and Canada, citing changes in consumer habits and what it called ""misinformation"" about the product's safety amid numerous legal challenges.
In October, J&J put into bankruptcy tens of thousands of legal claims alleging its talc-based products caused cancer, offloading the potential liabilities into a newly created subsidiary.
J&J said the talc cases would be halted while the new entity saddled with J&J's talc liabilities navigates bankruptcy proceedings. Mississippi disagreed, telling the justices not to condone the company's ""effort for further delay.""

Justice Samuel Alito did not participate in the Supreme Court's decision not to hear the appeal, likely because he owns J&J stock. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whose father - now retired - was a longtime lobbyist for the toiletries industry, also did not take part. Justices typically do not explain why they step aside in certain cases.
The Supreme Court in June turned down a separate J&J appeal seeking to overturn a $2.12 billion damages award to women who blamed their ovarian cancer on the company's baby powder and other talc products.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks opened lower on Monday as risk appetite dried up ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy-setting meeting that takes place on Tuesday and Wednesday.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 133 points, or 0.4% at 35,937 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was down less than 0.1%. 
The market has had the weekend to digest a set of inflation figures that give the Fed all the justification it needs to accelerate the phase-out of its bond purchases and move up its first rate hike already to a point in the first half of 2022. The only factor likely to stay its hand has seemed to be the emergence of the new Omicron strain of Covid-19, but there is little evidence yet that it will provoke the kind of economic slowdown that would hold the central bank back from tightening. 
Analysts have increasingly voiced concern at the ever-narrower strength of the market. Performance this year has been concentrated in a handful of more defensive, high-quality stocks such as Apple and Amazon, while the majority of S&P 500 stocks are below their 100-day moving average, typically a reliable indication of near-term weakness. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock again was the beneficiary of 'safe haven' flows, rising 0.8%. 
Risk aversion was evident in other asset markets too, with cryptocurrencies falling again at the end of a year when it is all too easy for older investors in particular to take profits. Crude oil futures also fell, despite a forecast from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that it expected any hit to global demand from Omicron to be brief and shallow.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 2.9% as CEO Elon Musk was named as Time's Person of the Year, an accolade that has had the unfortunate reputation of a lagging indicator in the market over the years. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock fell some 94% in the two years after founder Jeff Bezos won the same award in 1999. 
Elsewhere in the electric vehicle space, Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) stock rose 4.0% after the company priced its exchangeable bonds more tightly than feared, reducing the dilution risk to existing shareholders. And in a twist on the EV narrative, Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) stock soared over 15% to its highest in over five months after announcing it will spin off its electric bike unit LiveWire into a SPAC. It will still hold nearly three-quarters of the unit's equity.
In other news, Arena Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ARNA) rose over 80% after agreeing to be bought by  Pfizer  in a deal worth $6.7 billion. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) stock, which hit a new all-time high last week, rose 4.3%, helped by an Israeli study that supported early trial data showing that a third dose of its Covid-19 vaccine protects effectively against the Omicron strain."

Investing.com – Dollar Tree stock (NASDAQ:DLTR) traded 1.2% lower Monday after the company’s battle with activist investor Mantle Ridge became public Sunday, suggesting the distraction may last for a while.
The discount retailer proposed settlement talks with Mantle Ridge, calling the activist's move ""unwarrantedly aggressive"" and offering to hand a board seat to rival Dollar General's (NYSE:DG) former chief executive Richard Dreiling, as desired by the investor. 
"". . .We strongly believe that the breadth and depth of the changes you suggest would be very disruptive and value destructive,"" Dollar Tree wrote in a letter to Mantle Ridge’s Paul Hilal on December 7. Hilal rose into prominence as an activist investor at William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management.
On Friday, Mantle Ridge nominated 11 directors to the company’s board while pushing it to hire Dreiling.
Dollar Tree’s market cap is up by around $7 billion since Mantle Ridge’s 5.7% stake became known around a month back. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the stake on Nov. 11.
The discount chain's margins have been under pressure as inflation took root, challenging its core model of stocking and selling most products under $1. It has had to shift more products to selling above that price.

The New York-based pharmaceutical company’s board of directors also gave the go ahead for a $15 billion stock buyback plan, having exhausted al but $200 million of the current program.   
Giovanni Caforio, chief executive officer, said the company remained committed to a consistent balanced capital allocation strategy.
“With significant free cash flow of $45 billion to $50 billion expected between 2021 and 2023, investment in business development continues to be a key priority for the company in driving innovation and sustained growth as we return capital to shareholders through the dividend increase and expanded share repurchase authorization,” Caforio said.
At the new rate, dividends will account for just under $5 billion a year in payouts, leaving most of the total return to shareholders in the buyback program.

1398,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 08:05AM ET</span>","China carmaker BAIC has 9.98% stake in Daimler, no plans to raise it further","BERLIN (Reuters) -Daimler on Monday said its Chinese shareholder Beijing Automotive Group Co Ltd (BAIC) does not plan to increase its stake in the German luxury carmaker beyond the 9.98% stake it has held since 2019.
The German carmaker said BAIC told  Daimler  (OTC:DDAIF) after the Daimler Truck spinoff on Friday that it has held a 9.98% stake since 2019, and does not plan to increase it further.
The statement was the first public confirmation that BAIC's stake has risen from a previously disclosed 5%.
State-owned BAIC has been Daimler's main partner in China for years and operates Mercedes-Benz factories in Beijing through Beijing Benz Automotive.
The two companies have collaborated in areas such as production, research and development and sales since 2003.
BAIC's increased stake means two Chinese companies hold nearly 20% of Daimler, with Zhejiang Geely Holding, owning 9.69% of the German automaker.
Under German financial regulation, BAIC only has to disclose an increase in a shareholding if it were to rise beyond a 10% threshold.
After Daimler's truck division was spun off on Friday, BAIC's stake in Daimler Truck became public information, which also revealed the size of its Daimler stake.
In the Daimler Truck spin off, Daimler shareholders received one Daimler Truck share for every two Daimler shares.
""BAIC received shares in Daimler Truck Holding AG, in relation to their stake in Daimler AG (DE:DAIGn) as of Friday. BAIC informed us about the size of their current Daimler stake,"" a Daimler spokesperson said. ""BAIC has not been obliged to disclose the full extent of their holding before today.""
Daimler CEO Ola Kaellenius welcomed the information on the size of BAIC's stake, saying in a statement: ""We are happy about the engagement of all long-term oriented shareholders, who support our strategy.""
Daimler said it holds a 9.55% stake in BAIC Motor and a 2.46% stake in BAIC BluePark.

""The partnership between BAIC Group and Daimler Group has always been a model of Sino-German cooperation,"" BAIC said in a statement on Monday, confirming the stake figure. 
It said it was confident in Mercedes-Benz's potential in the future transformation to electro-mobility.

1400,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 07:50AM ET</span>",SoftBank SPAC to take Walmart-backed Symbotic public in $5.5 billion deal,"(Reuters) -Walmart Inc-backed Symbotic said on Monday it would go public through a merger with a SoftBank Group Corp blank-check firm in a deal offering the robotics and automation startup a pro-forma equity value of $5.5 billion.
The deal with SVF Investment Corp 3 is supported by a private investment in public equity of $205 million from a group of investors, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT). 
Gross proceeds from the deal, which values Symbotic at a pro-forma enterprise value of $4.8 billion, are expected to be around $725 million.
The Wilmington, Massachusetts-based company was founded in 2007. It's AI-powered software uses several hundred mobile robots to improve speed and reduce damage at distribution centres.
Supply chain-focused Symbotic offers its services in over 1,400 stores in 16 states and eight Canadian provinces and serves retailers, grocers and wholesalers, including Walmart, Albertsons and C&S Wholesale Grocers.
The deal comes against the backdrop of global supply chain glitches brought on by labour shortages, port logjams, freight costs and chip shortages.
SVF 3, which raised $320 million in an IPO in March, was looking for a new merger partner after talks with location data services provider Mapbox reportedly collapsed.
SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, are publicly listed investment vehicles that have no operations and are raised with the intention of merging with a private company. 
They serve as an alternate route to public markets for companies looking to float their shares by sidestepping an traditional initial public offering. 
Several software and technology companies filed to go public in 2021, either through traditional IPOs or SPACs, making it a record year for deals in the sector.
The combined entity will operate under the name Symbotic Inc and will trade under the symbol ""SYM"" on the Nasdaq after the merger, which is expected to close in the first half of next year.

Investing.com –  U.K. fashion retailers took a pummelling in London on Monday amid fears that Boris Johnson’s government will impose another lockdown on the country to stop the latest wave of Covid-19 infections.
 THG Holdings  (LON:THG) took the biggest hit, falling 5.4%. Upmarket bagmaker Mulberry (LON:MUL) fell 5.2% and Superdry (LON:SDRY) fell 3.1%.
Meanwhile  Ted Baker  (LON:TED) stock was down 2.8% and Quiz (LON:QUIZ) stock fell 2.7%.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that the U.K. is facing a “tidal wave” of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, which has quickly spread to account for around 40% of cases in London, according to reports. Johnson announced an ambitious booster jab campaign on Sunday, in reaction to early data showing that existing vaccines lose much of their effectiveness against the variant unless a third dose is administered.
Johnson's government faces a critical vote in the House of Commons on Tuesday over its “Plan B” to deal with the surging variant, which stopped short of mandatory restrictions on socializing, shopping and office attendance,
Scientists have warned that the plan, which mandates the wearing of face masks in public places, did not go far enough. 
While fears of another lockdown propelled some fashion retailers down, online fashion retailers fared markedly better. ASOS (LON:ASOS) and Joules (LON:JOUL), two disproportionately online fashion names, outperformed the market, with Joules up 2.7% and Asos up 0.9%."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Monday, continuing the recovery from the hefty Omicron-induced selloff ahead of this week’s eagerly-awaited Federal Reserve meeting.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 60 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures traded 12 points, or 0.3%, higher and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 60 points, or 0.4%.
The major averages posted strong gains last week, regaining ground lost after the discovery of the new Covid-19 variant sparked fears of another substantial hit to the global economy. Optimism that the Omicron variant will not be as dangerous and that current vaccines, with boosters, will be effective in treating it has prompted the change in tone.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 4% last week, its best weekly performance since March, and the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 3.8% and 3.6%, respectively, last week, both posting their best weekly performance since early February.
However, Covid-19 remains a threat, with U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warning of a “tidal wave” of cases and the World Health Organization stating that the Omicron coronavirus variant poses a ""very high"" global risk.
Investors’ main focus this week is likely to be the plethora of central bank meetings, and the Federal Reserve’s two-day gathering, ending on Wednesday, in particular.
The Fed is widely expected to discuss accelerating the wind-down of its $120 billion a month asset purchase program, especially after data on Friday showed that consumer prices rose at their fastest rate in almost four decades last month.
“Against the background of a broadening rise in inflation, consumer goods spending that has sky-rocketed, subdued labor supply and rising wage growth, the Fed will likely remove accommodation at a faster rate,” said analysts at ABN Amro, in a note.
In the corporate sector, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is likely to be in the spotlight with the chip manufacturer set to invest over $7 billion in a new state-of-the-art facility in Malaysia, according to local authorities.
Both  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) are likely to gain Monday after an Israeli study showed their Covid-19 vaccine booster provides good protection against severe illness from the Omicron variant. Additionally, Pfizer has agreed to acquire Arena Pharmaceuticals in a $6.7 billion all-cash deal to expand its cancer and inflammatory disease treatment pipeline.
Oil prices dropped Monday, handing back some of the  recent gains on optimism that vaccine boosters will be able to limit the Omicron variant's spread to a degree that doesn't hit global crude demand too badly.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% lower at $71.28 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $74.82. Both benchmarks rose around 8% last week, their first weekly gain in seven.

Investing.com – Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) traded 0.3% higher in Monday’s premarket following news that the chipmaker will invest $7.1 billion in a new facility in Malaysia.
A media invitation sent out by the Malaysian Investment Development Authority said the company has chosen the country to expand manufacturing capabilities for its advanced semiconductor packaging technologies in the northern state of Penang.
This is the latest major capacity extension by Intel to be announced Intel, after its $20-billion commitment to set up two new plants in Arizona. The company is now playing catch-up after ceding ground to the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Samsung (KS:005930) in the last two decades.
TSMC is spending $100 billion over 3 years to expand its capacity, while Samsung is also expected to commit to a big new factory in Texas in the near future.
The race amongst countries to attract the likes of Intel, Samsung and TSMC (NYSE:TSM) for their next semiconductor plant has intensified in the last year as companies look for new locations to cater to the record demand for chips. That hunt has been complicated by a deepening divide between the U.S. and China, forcing U.S. companies to look further afield for low-cost manufacturing sites.
Demand for chips has soared as electronic devices find more uses in a pandemic-struck world and companies and academic institutions adopt hybrid work and study practices. Demand has also come from the auto sector as the new generation of cars becomes more technology intensive.

1406,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 06:31AM ET</span>","VP Harris secures new investment from companies like Pepsico, Cargill for Central America strategy","By Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris will on Monday announce new investment in Central America from companies such as  Pepsico  (NASDAQ:PEP) and Cargill, that boost her efforts to lower migration from the region into the United States.
With the new pledges, Harris has secured private sector investments in the region worth over $1.2 billion, senior White House officials said. This follows a similar round worth $750 million announced by companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) in May. 
In March, President Joe Biden tasked Harris with leading U.S. efforts with Mexico and the so-called Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala to lower migration from the region. 
Harris chose to focus on addressing the root causes such as corruption, poverty, violence that drive people to leave their homes and has since visited Guatemala and Mexico. She has also held talks with leaders from those countries including Xiomara Castro, the newly elected President of Honduras. 
The announcement comes at a time of high-profile departures from her office amid growing concerns over her communication strategy and how well the first woman to hold the job of U.S. vice president is being positioned for future political roles. 
""This has been core to how the vice president has thought about advancing her work in the region since the start, her view that this will not just require a whole of government effort ... but key private sector actors and investors to bring greater economic development to the region,"" a senior White House official said.
Another White House official, describing the work done so far to pursue Harris's goals, said the vice president's efforts have helped realign U.S. foreign aid money, brought key stakeholders together, gathered support from the U.S. Congress, foreign partners and secured more resources from the United Nations. 
The new set of commitments includes consumer goods manufacturer Pepsico's plans to invest at least $190 million in northern Central America through 2025 that includes improvements to existing manufacturing plants and expansion of distribution routes.
Global commodities trader Cargill will invest an additional $150 million over the next five years to help farmers and create jobs in the Northern Triangle countries. Parkdale Mills, which produces spun yarn and cotton products, will build a new spinning facility in Honduras and invest $150 million. 

This month, U.S. officials said the Biden administration will restart a contentious border program put in place by his predecessor, Donald Trump, that forces asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for U.S. immigration hearings, in keeping with a federal court order.
Biden has struggled in his first year in office to reverse many Trump-era hardline immigration policies. Arrests at the U.S. - Mexico border reached a record 1.7 million in the 2021 fiscal year, which ended in September.

The Competition and Markets Authority said it will consider whether the deal would result in lesser competition in the local market. Interested parties have until January10 to comment on the deal.

However, regulators are also taking a tougher line on companies possessing sensitive technologies, particularly those involving concerns surrounding data privacy and national security. 
Another deal undergoing close examination is the takeover of U.K’-based chip designing firm ARM by U.S.-based Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). 
On Friday, Reuters reported that the Microsoft-Nuance combination is set to secure unconditional EU antitrust approval before the Christmas holiday.
U.S. and Australia have already approved the deal.

Investing.com – Lucid stock (NASDAQ:LCID) surged 7% in Monday’s premarket trading as the market repriced the dilution risk from a $1.75-billion convertible debt offering.
The conversion, if any, will happen at a share price of $54.78, a 50% premium to the stock’s December 9 price of $36.52. This is on the basis of just over 18 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes. The paper carries a coupon of 1.5%.
The willingness of the lenders to give loans to the company assuming a 50% premium reflects their optimism in the company’s growth potential. Debtors usually convert their debt into equity when the prevailing market price is above the conversion price. 
The company expects net proceeds from the exercise to be as much as $1.98 billion, if an over-allotment option is exercised.
Lucid has the option to use the funds for expanding manufacturing capabilities, improving retail operations and service network, investing in research and development, and supporting other potential growth opportunities.
Bondholders can convert their notes before September 15, 2026 under specified conditions, Lucid said.  The notes will also be redeemable at Lucid's discretion at any time.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors managing $4.1 trillion in assets are urging the world's biggest chemicals companies to phase out production of hazardous substances which linger in the environment and have been linked to serious health problems.
The move by 23 investors including  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors and Storebrand comes as regulators toughen rules around their use and as analysts warn some companies could face billions of dollars in associated clean-up and compensation costs.
In a letter to the world's 50-biggest chemical producers with combined revenues of $860 billion the investors call for increased transparency around how many ""substances of very high concern"" they produce every year.
Whilst U.S. and European regulators have disclosure requirements on hazardous chemicals, many other countries do not, and information on the volumes produced globally are not publically available.
To help investors, companies should also share the data with the non-profit International Chemical Secretariat (ICS), which advocates for a shift to safer chemicals and tracks the performance of leading producers, the letter seen by Reuters said.
""We believe sustainable management of chemicals is key to financial outperformance,"" Eugenie Mathieu, senior analyst at Aviva Investors, told Reuters, citing the example of litigation tied to PFAS or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, used in applications such as lubrication and industrial coatings.
So-called ""persistent chemicals"" such as PFAS - which degrade slowly and are linked to a range of illnesses after getting into local water supplies - have already led to payouts from companies including 3M, and more cases are pending.
POTENTIAL COSTS
""In recent years the financial implications for (a) company's liability for past and current production of pollution of persistent chemicals, especially PFAS, have been clear,"" she added, citing one analyst's estimate of potential costs in the United States of between $25 billion and $40 billion.
A spokesperson for 3M, one of the companies to receive the letter, said the company was committed to environmental stewardship, adding: ""We welcome the opportunity to engage with investors and other stakeholders regarding this topic"".
Belgian company Umicore said it had engaged with ICS over the group's ChemScore questionnaire in October and complies with relevant legislation where it makes, imports or sells its products, using a ""risk-based"" approach to chemicals management.
Given the growing regulatory and litigation concerns, the investors said they wanted to see all companies make a time-linked commitment to phase out production of the chemicals, focusing first on persistent chemicals.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency earlier this year laid out a plan to toughen rules for persistent chemicals, while the European Union is also looking to tighten legislation and incentivise a transition towards less hazardous materials.

Lastly, the investors said companies should set out plans to develop products that can be reused as part of a ""circular economy"", or which allow customers to design products that can be used in such a way - a key focus of EU lawmakers
""The chemical industry sits at the start of the supply chain so has a role to play in driving the circular economy forward,"" the letter said, citing examples such as using waste or bio-based material as feedstocks.

Investing.com – Rio Tinto ADRs (NYSE:RIO) were trading 1.2% higher in Monday's premarket but underperforming other big miners after agreeing to write off  a $2.3 billion loan to the Mongolian government as part of its plans to accelerate work on the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold project.
Shares across the mining sector were buoyed on Monday by a 7% rise in iron ore futures in China on speculation about an imminent announcement of fiscal stimulus there. BHP Group (LON:BHPB)  stock was up 1.7% in London while  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) stock was up 1.6%.
Oyu Tolgoi is one of the largest deposits of copper in the world. Its proximity to the Chinese market, which accounts for over half of global copper consumption, gives the project a particular appeal, given China's status as the world's largest electric vehicle market.
EVs routinely need between three and four times more copper than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. 
Cancelling the loan would speed up the timeline for when the project can start paying dividends, according to a December 13 letter written by Chief Executive Officer Jakob Stausholm to Mongolian Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai. 
The Mongolian government owns 34% of the project company, with the rest held by Turquoise Hill Resources (NYSE:TRQ). Rio Tinto holds a 51% stake in Turquoise Hill.
The financing agreement for the mine was signed in 2015 but the project has been mired in controversy from its birth. Mongolian politicians have often called for the original investment agreement to be renegotiated.
According to Reuters, Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai said on Monday Rio has committed to completing the much-delayed expanded underground section of the mine by 2023. 
The company will also conduct an independent audit into the financing of the project's underground expansion and improve governance, Reuters quoted Luvsannamsrai as saying.

Caixabank completed its 4.3 billion euro ($5.2 billion) acquisition of state-owned Bankia in March, creating Spain's biggest domestic bank with more than 650 billion euros in assets. The government was left with a 16.12% stake in the merged bank following the acquisition. 
""It is a very well-managed institution and after completing the consolidation process, which has been very good for the Spanish financial sector, we have no plans on the horizon or intention to divest the state's stake,"" Calvino said.

The government bailed out Bankia in a 22.4 billion euro rescue in 2012 at the height of Spain's financial crisis.
Just before the bank's takeover by Caixabank was formally approved, the government gave itself an extra two years, until the end of 2023, to sell its stake in Bankia and recover public money used to shore up the lender's finances.

1417,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 03:46AM ET</span>",China's SenseTime postpones $767 million Hong Kong IPO after U.S. ban,"By Kane Wu and Scott Murdoch
(Reuters) -Chinese artificial intelligence start-up SenseTime Group postponed its $767 million Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) on Monday after being placed on a U.S. investment blacklist.
SenseTime said it remained committed to completing the offering and would publish a supplemental prospectus and an updated listing timetable.
Reuters first reported earlier on Monday the company's plan to withdraw the offering and update its prospectus to include the potential impact of the U.S. investment ban, with the aim of relaunching the IPO process.
SenseTime had planned to sell 1.5 billion shares in a price range of HK$3.85 to HK$3.99, according to its regulatory filings. That would raise up to $767 million, a figure that had already been trimmed earlier this year from a $2 billion target.
However, instead of setting its listing price on Friday, as scheduled, it found itself in urgent talks with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and its lawyers over the future of the deal amid reports about the looming blacklist.
SenseTime did not provide details on the timetable for a revised IPO in its filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Monday. 
""The company remains committed to completing the global offering and the listing soon,"" it said in the filing.
One source said the company was trying to move quickly to avoid the regulatory requirement to completely refile the IPO after Jan. 9 when its financial numbers in the current prospectus would need to be updated. The company had retained around $450 million from cornerstone investors and could expect most of them to stay in the deal, the source added. 
""Even if the company offers an updated prospectus with more risk factors and goes ahead with a public listing, we expect the investor sentiment to be low which will likely impact future pricing of its shares and their performance post-IPO,"" said Shifara Samsudeen, a LightStream Research analyst who publishes on Smartkarma, told Reuters.
FULL REFUND
The company said it would refund all application monies in full, without interest, to all applicants who subscribed its shares in the offering process. 
The U.S. Treasury added SenseTime to a list of ""Chinese military-industrial complex companies,"" accusing the company of having developed facial recognition programmes that can determine a target's ethnicity, with a particular focus on identifying ethnic Uyghurs.
U.N. experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people, mainly Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities, have been detained in recent years in a vast system of camps in China's far-west region of Xinjiang.
Some foreign lawmakers and parliaments, as well as the U.S. Secretaries of State in both the Biden and Trump administrations, have labelled the treatment of Uyghurs as genocide, citing evidence of forced sterilisations and deaths inside the camps. China denies these claims and says Uyghur population growth rates are above the national average.
SenseTime said in a statement on Saturday it ""strongly opposed the designation and accusations that have been made in connection with it,"" calling the accusations ""unfounded"".
""There remains a large number of questions that need to be answered, such as the impact of blacklisting and disruptions to the operations, as well as the impact on SenseTime's plans of pursuing global expansion,"" said LightStream's Samsudeen. 
SenseTime was due to be one of the biggest deals in the third quarter in Hong Kong and its postponement adds to the ongoing weakness in the city's IPO market.
There has been $41.1 billion raised in IPOs and secondary listings so far in 2021, compared with $50.26 billion over the same period last year, according to Refinitiv figures.

China Tourism Group shelved a plan to raise about $5 billion in its secondary listing earlier in December, citing uncertain financial market conditions.
SenseTime's IPO was the most high profile listing for HSBC this year, which was a joint sponsor with China International Capital Corporation (CICC) and Haitong International.

1419,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 03:43AM ET</span>",European Stocks Edge Higher; Caution Ahead of Central Bank Meetings,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded cautiously higher Monday, at the start of a week that includes a host of central bank meetings, including the all-important Federal Reserve.
At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.7% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.2%. 
Global equity markets turned higher last week, boosted by studies suggesting the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus caused less serious damage in patients than previous versions and current vaccines, including boosters, could cope with the variant.
This confidence could be tested this week as a number of high profile central banks hold their monetary policy meetings, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank.
It’s the Fed that investors will pay particular attention to as expectations have been building that the U.S. central bank will announce a quicker phase-out of its bond purchases on Wednesday after Chairman Jerome Powell’s hawkish testimony to Congress. 
Central banks meeting this week will have to account for an uncertain economic outlook, as countries impose restrictive measures to curb the spread of the Omicron Covid-19 variant. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, under pressure from his own staff's flouting of social distancing rules, warned on Sunday that the U.K. faces a “tidal wave” of infections.
Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions are on the rise after the Group of Seven warned Russia on Sunday that it would face “massive consequences” if it invades Ukraine. 
U.S. intelligence has warned that Russia could be planning an offensive on Ukraine as early as next year, involving up to 175,000 troops. The Russian RTS index fell 1.2% to test its lowest in over four months. 
In corporate news, Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) stock traded flat after the airline announced Monday that it has redeemed 500 million euros ($565 million) from an earlier French state loan issued to help it cope with the pandemic, and it could also raise new equity. 
Frasers (LON:FRAS) stock rose 0.8% after the British sportswear and fashion group, formerly known as  Sports Direct  (LON:FRAS), announced plans to start a new share buyback program of up to 70 million pounds ($93 million).
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) stock rose 0.6% after the Swiss banking giant announced a revamp of its executive board, seeking to move on from a difficult year.
Oil prices rose Monday, extending recent gains on optimism that vaccine boosters will be able to combat the Omicron variant to the extent that its spread doesn’t lead to a significant hit to global crude demand.
By 3:40 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $71.97 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.5% to $75.53. Both benchmarks rose around 8% last week, their first weekly gain in seven.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,787.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1280."

After recovering quickly from the Omicron scare, equity markets look set to kick off a busy week for central banks on the front foot. 
With some hawkish signals expected, markets could be in for a bout of volatility in the closing days of 2021 even though some of the policy shifts, particularly by the U.S. Federal Reserve have been well-telegraphed in advance, leaving investors somewhat prepared.
European stock futures are in the black after gains in Asia, and U.S. futures also point north after the S&P 500 clocked its 67th closing record high of the year on Friday and investors started watching for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) becoming the first $3 trillion company. 
But it's not just about U.S. policy this week. Interest rate hikes are in store for a raft of central banks in emerging markets from Russia to Mexico, and then there's also the European Central Bank and the Bank of England. 
So while inflation surprises haven't stopped the equity bull run - as firms have been able to pass on to consumers rising costs and corporate margins have reached record highs - they have stepped up the pace of rate hikes globally. 
There have been 59 rate hikes across investable markets so far this year with a cumulative net increase of 2,570 basis points, according to central bank data collected by financial services firm Black Cuillin. Also, in the U.S., moderate democrats are becoming increasingly worried about the political fallout of high prices and are pushing for more aggressive policy tightening, according to the Financial Times. 
Reflecting bets of early 2022 rate hikes after U.S. inflation rose to the strongest reading since 1982, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields edged up towards the psychological 1.5% mark. 

Elsewhere, the pound was set for a beating after PM Johnson warned of Omicron ""tidal wave"", while oil prices extended their rally, suggesting little worry about the variant.

1421,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 03:07AM ET</span>","U.S. imposes sweeping human rights sanctions on China, Myanmar and North Korea","By Daphne Psaledakis, David Brunnstrom and Simon Lewis
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Friday imposed extensive human rights-related sanctions on dozens of people and entities tied to China, Myanmar, North Korea and Bangladesh, and added Chinese artificial intelligence company SenseTime Group to an investment blacklist.
Canada and the United Kingdom joined the United States in imposing sanctions related to human rights abuses in Myanmar, while Washington also imposed the first new sanctions on North Korea under President Joe Biden's administration and targeted Myanmar military entities, among others, in action marking Human Rights Day.
""Our actions today, particularly those in partnership with the United Kingdom and Canada, send a message that democracies around the world will act against those who abuse the power of the state to inflict suffering and repression,"" Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in a statement.
China's embassy in Washington denounced the U.S. move as ""serious interference in China's internal affairs"" and a ""severe violation of basic norms governing international relations."" 
Embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu said it would do ""grave harm to China-U.S. relations"" and urged Washington to rescind the decision.
""If the U.S. acts recklessly, China will take effective measures to strike back resolutely,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin, at a daily briefing on Monday. 
The North Korean mission at the United Nations and the Washington embassies of Myanmar and Bangladesh did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The measures are the latest in a raft of sanctions timed to coincide with Biden's two-day virtual Summit for Democracy, where he announced initiatives to bolster democracy around the world and support for pro-democracy legislation in the United States.
Biden said on Friday that commitments made by some of the more than 100 world leaders at the summit would push back against rising autocracy around the world, fight corruption and promote human rights.
""This is going to help seed fertile ground for democracy to bloom around the world,"" he said in a speech closing the summit.
The Treasury on Friday added Chinese artificial intelligence company SenseTime to a list of ""Chinese military-industrial complex companies,"" accusing it of having developed facial recognition programs that can determine a target's ethnicity, with a particular focus on identifying ethnic Uyghurs.
As a result, the company will fall under an investment ban for U.S. investors. SenseTime is close to selling 1.5 billion shares in an initial public offering (IPO). After news of the Treasury restrictions earlier this week, the company began discussing the fate of the planned $767 million offering with Hong Kong's stock exchange, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
SenseTime said in a statement on Saturday that it ""strongly opposed the designation and accusations that have been made in connection with it,"" calling the accusations ""unfounded"".
""We have complied with the applicable laws and regulations in relation to our business in all material respects in the jurisdictions where we conduct business,"" the company said.
U.N. experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people, mainly Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities, have been detained in recent years in a vast system of camps in China's far-west region of Xinjiang.
China denies abuses in Xinjiang, but the U.S. government and many rights groups say Beijing is carrying out genocide there.
MYANMAR, NORTH KOREA
The Treasury said it was imposing sanctions on two Myanmar military entities and an organization that provides reserves for the military. The Directorate of Defense Industries, one of the entities targeted, makes weapons for the military and police that have been used in a brutal crackdown on opponents of the military’s Feb. 1 coup. 
The Treasury also targeted four regional chief ministers, including Myo Swe Win, who heads the junta’s administration in the Bago region where the Treasury said at least 82 people were killed in a single day in April. 
Canada imposed sanctions against four entities affiliated with the Myanmar military government, while the United Kingdom imposed fresh sanctions against the military.
Myanmar was plunged into crisis when the military overthrew leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her government on Feb. 1, triggering daily protests in towns and cities and fighting in borderlands between the military and ethnic minority insurgents.
Junta forces seeking to crush opposition have killed more than 1,300 people, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) monitoring group.
Campaign group Global Witness said the measures fell short of targeting Myanmar's natural gas industry, a key source of foreign currency for the junta, and were ""unlikely to materially impact the military junta’s bottom line."" 
The Treasury also blacklisted North Korea’s Central Public Prosecutors Office, along with the former minister of social security and recently assigned Minister of People’s Armed Forces Ri Yong Gil. It also targeted a Russian university for facilitating the export of workers from North Korea.
North Korea has long sought a lifting of punishing U.S. and international sanctions imposed over its weapons programs and has denounced U.S. criticism of its human rights record as evidence of a hostile policy against it.

The Biden administration has repeatedly called on North Korea to engage in dialogue over its nuclear and missile programs, without success.
The U.S. State Department on Friday also barred 12 people from traveling to the United States, including officials in China, Belarus and Sri Lanka.

1422,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 03:06AM ET</span>",New double act reinforces Ortega family grip on Inditex,"By Corina Pons and Jesús Aguado
MADRID (Reuters) - An experienced team of managers should smooth leadership change at  Inditex  (MC:ITX) next year, when the family of billionaire founder Amancio Ortega will tighten its grip on the world's biggest fashion retailer, sources and analysts said.
Investors were rocked last month when the owner of the Zara chain said veteran executive chairman Pablo Isla was stepping down to be replaced by a CEO without retail experience and that Ortega's 37-year-old daughter Marta would become company chair. 
Inditex shares fell 6.1% on the day of the announcement, wiping around 5.6 billion euros ($6.3 billion) off its market value. Investors were worried about Isla's departure in particular, as he has led Inditex for a decade and helped turn it into the envy of the industry.
However, the new leaders will be backed by a committee of managers who have been with the company for anything between 18 and 42 years, providing continuity and strong support, analysts and sources familiar with the matter said. 
Two of the top ten are also family members with decades of involvement in the Zara and Massimo Dutti brands.
""The key to (these) changes is above all the creation of a management committee that will allow the family to retake the reins of Inditex after ceding part of the power to Pablo Isla for over 15 years,"" said one company source.
Marta Ortega will begin her new role as Inditex's non-executive chair in April alongside new chief executive Oscar Garcia Maceiras. Garcia Maceiras, a lawyer who has spent most of his career in banking, comes from the northern Spanish city of La Coruna where Inditex is based.
OVER TO MARTA
Isla, who worked for six years alongside Amancio Ortega before the company founder retired in 2011, has held executive power at Inditex for the decade since. Isla has not said what he plans to do after he leaves.
Marta Ortega's non-executive role raised some eyebrows, but it would be wrong to read too much into her title, said Adam Cochrane, an analyst at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Research.
""The non-executive Chairwoman is a common role across the industry, but given her time in the business and family connections her influence is likely to be greater in strategic and brand decisions than other chairs,"" he said.
Marta, who has been working at Inditex for 15 years, had been focusing on brand image and fashion at Zara, the business which contributes 70% of Inditex's revenues.
The younger daughter of Amancio Ortega had also been overseeing initiatives related to sustainability, and Zara's campaigns with artists and fashion photographers such as Steven Meisel, Fabien Baron, and Karl Templer.
TEAM PLAYER
People who have worked with Garcia Maceiras and sources familiar with Inditex said his ability to delegate and coordinate will bring the best out of a team that managed to navigate COVID restrictions and push sales 7% above pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter, outperforming closest rival H&M.
Four people who knew Maceiras at Spanish lenders Santander (MC:SAN), Popular and Pastor and Spain's bad bank describe him as hard-working, skilled at coordination, and a lover of sports. 
""(Garcia Maceiras) is a team player (...) neither an investment banker nor high profile. No one should expect a major shake-up from him at Inditex,"" said a source who has worked with him at a Spanish bank, asking to remain anonymous.
Adding to the sense of continuity, his predecessor as CEO, Carlos Crespo, shifts to the role of chief operating officer and will be part of the executive committee.
SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY
Inditex's success, according to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), lies in its supply chain which allows it to pivot its fashions to customer whims in a more targeted and timely way than rivals.
The company, which also owns Bershka and Pull & Bear, manufactures over half its clothes in nearby countries such as Morocco, Turkey and Portugal, helping it avoid the worst of the supply chain snags currently hitting the sector.
The Spanish firm also adapted quickly to the pandemic by using its stores as logistics centres to support online demand.
Inditex will on Wednesday report third-quarter results, with sales growth expected to be up to 10% above the same period in 2019, according to notes from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), RBC Capital Markets and Jefferies.
Beyond riding the waves of pandemic restrictions, the new management team will need to show it can improve sales of the company's smaller brands and respond to the threat posed by new online rivals such as China's Shein.

Guido Stein, author and professor at Madrid business school IESE, believes the new double act will face challenges but is starting from a strong base.
""A period of uncertainty is opening up. The big advantage of all this is that Inditex's kingdom is doing great,"" he said.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) announced a raft of appointments to its executive board on Monday as the Swiss bank seeks to move on from a torrid year during which it was battered by a stream of controversies and losses.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank said Francesco De Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) would return to the company as CEO of its wealth-management division and interim CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa. 
De Ferrari, who worked at Credit Suisse between 2002 and 2018, joins after a stint leading Australian wealth management company AMP (OTC:AMLTF). 
His appointment comes after Credit Suisse announced a new strategy to curb its investment bankers and plough money into looking after the fortunes of the world's rich.
The lender's share price has dropped by nearly a quarter this year after the bank suffered heavy losses from the collapse of U.S. family office Archegos. It is also seeing client losses from the collapse of supply-chain finance company Greensill.
At AMP, Ferrari steered the company in a new direction after a banking royal commission revealed widespread misconduct, including charging customers for services it did not provide and misleading regulators.
His earlier career at Credit Suisse included periods as Head of Private Banking in the Asia Pacific region and CEO of South East Asia and Frontier Markets. Between 2008 and 2011, De Ferrari was CEO Private Banking Italy.
Credit Suisse Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio said De Ferrari had a ""a profound knowledge of Credit Suisse and the industry, reinforcing our Executive Board at this critical junction in our journey.""
Christian Meissner, CEO of Credit Suisse's Investment Bank division has been appointed CEO of the Americas, Helman Sitohang and Andre Helfenstein as CEOs of the Asia-Pacific and Switzerland respectively, and Mark Hannam has been named as Head of Internal Audit.
Horta-Osorio, who has made compliance and risk management a top priority, said the appointments completed the bank's new divisional and regional structure, and would help deliver the bank's strategy.

""Risk management will be at the core of all our actions, with the Board of Directors and the Executive Board together driving a culture that reinforces the importance of accountability and responsibility across the entire bank,"" said the chairman, who has come under fire after admitting to violating Switzerland's COVID-19 quarantine regulations.
Credit Suisse has also been reprimanded over allegations that it snooped on former top wealth-management executive Iqbal Khan and been fined over bribery and fraud charges relating to the $2 billion Mozambican corruption scandal.

1428,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 02:00AM ET</span>",Lancia to mimic Mercedes in pursuit of a future inside Stellantis,"By Giulio Piovaccari
MILAN (Reuters) -Italy's Lancia will pursue profitability over volume to secure a long-term home in the 14 brand Stellantis stable and try to emulate German carmaker Mercedes to do so, its boss Luca Napolitano told Reuters. 
Lancia has in recent years retreated from a past littered with world rally titles and iconic cars such as the Delta to a single model, the Ypsilon, in just one market, Italy.
Some analysts have regarded Lancia as one of the least strategic brands within Stellantis, the world's fourth largest carmaker, which was formed this year by the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA.
However, Napolitano has presented a 10-year plan to Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares to relaunch Lancia, based on three new models: the new Ypsilon in 2024, both hybrid and battery electric, and a compact crossover expected in 2026 followed by a compact hatchback in 2028, both fully electric.
""Clearly volumes are important, but our targets are about profitability,"" Napolitano said in an interview on Friday.
Lancia, which alongside Alfa Romeo and DS was grouped in the pool of Stellantis brands cooperating in the premium market, needed to continue on this high-end path, he added.
""We still need to work and need to look at a benchmark... which for us is Mercedes,"" Napolitano said. ""I don't mean we want to fight against Mercedes, that would be naive, but that is an example of what we look at"". 
While Alfa Romeo and DS are global brands, Lancia's target is to move to Europe, initially targeting Germany and France, where electrification is moving faster, then adding countries including Spain, Belgium, Austria and the Nordics, he said.
""We initially target to make 25-30% of our sales abroad, to reach 50-50,"" he said. ""Our aggressive electrification strategy and our focus on market segments which are very strong in Europe will help us"".
'JUST THREE CLICKS'
Napolitano said that Lancia aimed to be the brand within Stellantis with the highest share of recycled materials.
""We would like to build cars with a significant portion of recycled materials,"" he said. 
Lancia's 10-year plan does not include going back to motor races and expanding outside Europe, as it needs credibility in the premium segment and to focus on priorities, Napolitano said.
""However, in the coming year, if things go well, why not trying to bring (Lancia models with) right-hand drive also in Japan, South Africa or Australia?"" he said.
Lancia's expansion plan in Europe will be based on a light network of dealers, only in the largest urban areas, helping it to keep costs down and boost profitability.

Napolitano said the target was to have around 100 Lancia selling points in Europe in around 60 cities, which would be shared with other Stellantis brands, while pushing online to reduce the amount of time potential buyers spend at dealers.
""My target is to make it possible to buy a car with just three clicks,"" Napolitano said.

Air France-KLM said it had redeemed 500 million euros out of a 4 billion euro bank loan guaranteed by France, and had negotiated to extend the maturity on the overall loan from May 6, 2023 to May 6, 2025.
The airline, which like many in its sector has been hit by travel restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the COVID virus, said it was in talks on strengthening its capital.
""As previously disclosed, discussions are ongoing on further capital strengthening measures at Air France-KLM Group level. These measures could include instruments such as the issuance of equity or quasi-equity instruments, depending on market conditions,"" Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) said.

Two sources familiar with Air France KLM's plans had told Reuters earlier this month that Air France KLM was considering delaying a planned capital increase because of tough travel restrictions imposed by governments to mitigate the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.

1430,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 01:31AM ET</span>",Amazon driver died in bathroom sheltering from tornado with colleagues,"By Richa Naidu
EDWARDSVILLE, Ill. (Reuters) -Amazon cargo driver Austin J. McEwen, 26, was an only child who loved to listen to rapper Mac Miller and hunt with his friends. 
He died trying to shelter from a powerful tornado https://www.reuters.com/world/us/injuries-reported-after-roof-collapse-amazon-warehouse-illinois-ap-2021-12-11 in the bathroom at an Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse on Friday night, according to a coworker.
McEwen was one of six workers identified by police on Sunday who were killed when their plant in Edwardsville, Illinois, buckled under the force of the devastating storm. A barrage of tornadoes https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/devastated-kentucky-tornado-survivors-pick-through-debris-shelter-with-relatives-2021-12-12 ripped through six U.S. states, leaving a trail of death and destruction at homes and businesses stretching more than 200 miles (322 km).
""He was my friend and he didn't make it,"" said coworker Brian Erdmann, who was on his way to make a delivery to the warehouse. ""If I would have got back 45 minutes earlier, I probably would have been at the same place. I would have been right there with him.""
The other Amazon workers identified as dead by a coroner were Deandre S. Morrow, 28, of St. Louis, Missouri; Kevin D. Dickey, 62, of Carlyle, Illinois; Clayton Lynn Cope, 29, of Alton, Illinois; Etheria S. Hebb, 24, of St. Louis, Missouri; and Larry E. Virden, 46, of Collinsville, Illinois.
Several employees told Reuters that they had been directed to shelter in bathrooms by Amazon managers after receiving emergency alerts on mobile phones from authorities. 
Amazon said employees were directed to shelter in place at a designated assembly area at the front of the building, which was near a restroom. 
The site received tornado warnings between 8:06 p.m. and 8:16 p.m. before the tornado struck the building at 8:27 p.m., the company said. 
""Our team worked quickly to ensure as many employees and partners could get to the designated Shelter in Place,"" the company said in a statement. ""We thank them for everything they were able to do.""
Some of those workers said they had kept their phones despite what they believed was a violation of an Amazon policy that prevents them from having cellphones at work. 
The company responded by saying that there was no Amazon policy that prevents employees or contractors from having a cell phone at work. 
""I was at the end of my route. I was just getting in the building and they started screaming, 'Shelter in place!'"" said David Kosiak, 26, who has worked at the facility for three months. ""We were in the bathrooms. That's where they sent us.""
""It sounded like a train came through the building. The ceiling tiles came flying down. It very loud. They made us shelter in place til we left - it was at least two and a half hours in there.""
The National Weather Service said the hurricane hit the area between 8:28 and 8:32 p.m. central time, intensifying rapidly as it struck the Amazon warehouse. With estimated peak winds of 150 miles per hour (241 km-per-hour) winds, the force was so severe that the roof was ripped off and 11-inch (28-cm) thick concrete walls longer than football fields fell in on themselves.
At least 45 Amazon employees made it out safely. Authorities had given up hope of finding more survivors as they shifted from rescue to recovery efforts that were expected to last days. 
The company has three facilities in Edwardsville: the delivery station hit by the storm as well as a fulfillment center and a sorting station. The delivery station opened in July 2020 to prepare orders for last-mile delivery to customers.
Amazon said it was donating $1 million to the Edwardsville Community Foundation. The company said it is providing relief supplies as well as transport, food and water.

On Sunday, Amazon workers arrived at the warehouse across the street, heavily guarded by security, to start shifts.
""It's a reminder of the trauma that I just endured but I will be returning to work at Amazon,"" said McEwen's friend and coworker Emily Epperson. ""This is my livelihood.”

1431,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 01:22AM ET</span>",Deepfake anyone? AI synthetic media tech enters perilous phase,"By Shane Raymond
(Reuters) - ""Do you want to see yourself acting in a movie or on TV?"" said the description for one app on online stores, offering users the chance to create AI-generated synthetic media, also known as deepfakes. 
""Do you want to see your best friend, colleague, or boss dancing?"" it added. ""Have you ever wondered how would you look if your face swapped with your friend's or a celebrity's?"" 
The same app was advertised differently on dozens of adult sites: ""Make deepfake porn in a sec,"" the ads said. ""Deepfake anyone.""
How increasingly sophisticated technology is applied is one of the complexities facing synthetic media software, where machine learning is used to digitally model faces from images and then swap them into films as seamlessly as possible. 
The technology, barely four years old, may be at a pivotal point, according to Reuters interviews with companies, researchers, policymakers and campaigners. 
It's now advanced enough that general viewers would struggle to distinguish many fake videos from reality, the experts said, and has proliferated to the extent that it's available to almost anyone who has a smartphone, with no specialism needed.
""Once the entry point is so low that it requires no effort at all, and an unsophisticated person can create a very sophisticated non-consensual deepfake pornographic video - that's the inflection point,"" said Adam Dodge, an attorney and the founder of online safety company EndTab. 
""That's where we start to get into trouble.""
With the tech genie out of the bottle, many online safety campaigners, researchers and software developers say the key is ensuring consent from those being simulated, though this is easier said than done. Some advocate taking a tougher approach when it comes to synthetic pornography, given the risk of abuse.
Non-consensual deepfake pornography accounted for 96% of a sample study of more than 14,000 deepfake videos posted online, according to a 2019 report by Sensity, a company that detects and monitors synthetic media. It added that the number of deepfake videos online was roughly doubling every six months.
""The vast, vast majority of harm caused by deepfakes right now is a form of gendered digital violence,"" said Ajder, one of the study authors and the head of policy and partnerships at AI company Metaphysic, adding that his research indicated that millions of women had been targeted worldwide. 
Consequently, there is a ""big difference"" between whether an app is explicitly marketed as a pornographic tool or not, he said.
AD NETWORK AXES APP
ExoClick, the online advertising network that was used by the ""Make deepfake porn in a sec"" app, told Reuters it was not familiar with this kind of AI face-swapping software. It said it had suspended the app from taking out adverts and would not promote face-swap technology in an irresponsible way.
""This is a product type that is new to us,"" said Bryan McDonald, ad compliance chief at ExoClick, which like other large ad networks offer clients a dashboard of sites they can customise themselves to decide where to place adverts. 
""After a review of the marketing material, we ruled the wording used on the marketing material is not acceptable. We are sure the vast majority of users of such apps use them for entertainment with no bad intentions, but we further acknowledge it could also be used for malicious purposes."" 
Six other big online ad networks approached by Reuters did not respond to requests for comment about whether they had encountered deepfake software or had a policy regarding it.
There is no mention of the app's possible pornographic usage in its description on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store or Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Play Store, where it is available to anyone over 12. 
Apple said it didn't have any specific rules about deepfake apps but that its broader guidelines prohibited apps that include content that was defamatory, discriminatory or likely to humiliate, intimidate or harm anyone.
It added that developers were prohibited from marketing their products in a misleading way, within or outside the App Store, and that it was working with the app's development company to ensure they were compliant with its guidelines.
Google did not respond to requests for comment. After being contacted by Reuters about the ""Deepfake porn"" ads on adult sites, Google temporarily took down the Play Store page for the app, which had been rated E for Everyone. The page was restored after about two weeks, with the app now rated T for Teen due to ""Sexual content"".
FILTERS AND WATERMARKS
While there are bad actors in the growing face-swapping software industry, there are a wide variety of apps available to consumers and many do take steps to try to prevent abuse, said Ajder, who champions the ethical use of synthetic media as part of the Synthetic Futures industry group. 
Some apps only allow users to swap images into pre-selected scenes, for example, or require ID verification from the person being swapped in, or use AI to detect pornographic uploads, though these are not always effective, he added. 
Reface is one of the world's most popular face-swapping apps, having attracted more than 100 million downloads globally since 2019, with users encouraged to switch faces with celebrities, superheroes and meme characters to create fun video clips. 
The U.S.-based company told Reuters it was using automatic and human moderation of content, including a pornography filter, plus had other controls to prevent misuse, including labelling and visual watermarks to flag videos as synthetic.
""From the beginning of the technology and establishment of Reface as a company, there has been a recognition that synthetic media technology could be abused or misused,"" it said. 
'ONLY PERPETRATOR LIABLE'
The widening consumer access to powerful computing via smartphones is being accompanied by advances in deepfake technology and the quality of synthetic media.
For example, EndTab founder Dodge and other experts interviewed by Reuters said that in the early days of these tools in 2017, they required a large amount of data input often totalling thousands of images to achieve the same kind of quality that could be produced today from just one image.
""With the quality of these images becoming so high, protests of 'It's not me!' are not enough, and if it looks like you, then the impact is the same as if it is you,"" said Sophie Mortimer, manager at the UK-based Revenge Porn Helpline. 
Policymakers looking to regulate deepfake technology are making patchy progress, also faced by new technical and ethical snarls. 
Laws specifically aimed at online abuse using deepfake technology have been passed in some jurisdictions, including China, South Korea, and California, where maliciously depicting someone in pornography without their consent, or distributing such material, can carry statutory damages of $150,000.
""Specific legislative intervention or criminalisation of deepfake pornography is still lacking,"" researchers at the European Parliament said in a study presented to a panel of lawmakers in October that suggested legislation should cast a wider net of responsibility to include actors such as developers or distributors, as well as abusers.
""As it stands today, only the perpetrator is liable. However, many perpetrators go to great lengths to initiate such attacks at such an anonymous level that neither law enforcement nor platforms can identify them."" 
Marietje Schaake, international policy director at Stanford University's Cyber Policy Center and a former member of the EU parliament, said broad new digital laws including the proposed AI Act in the United States and GDPR in Europe could regulate elements of deepfake technology, but that there were gaps. 
""While it may sound like there are many legal options to pursue, in practice it is a challenge for a victim to be empowered to do so,"" Schaake said.

""The draft AI Act under consideration foresees that manipulated content should be disclosed,"" she added. 
""But the question is whether being aware does enough to stop the harmful impact. If the virality of conspiracy theories is an indicator, information that is too absurd to be true can still have wide and harmful societal impact.""

The casino, part of a 75-floor tower complex which opened in December last year, had its licence suspended by the Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA) just before opening in late 2020 following media reports of its alleged dealings with organised crime groups.
After an overhaul of its leadership and board, Crown is now ""targeting a gaming floor opening early in the new year"", the company said in notes accompanying an analyst presentation at the A$2.2 billion ($1.6 billion) Sydney waterfront facility.
The New South Wales state Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority, which oversees Crown's Sydney licence, said Crown had made good progress on a series of governance reforms and the two were ""working towards a gaming floor opening early in the new year"".
A series of media reports in 2019 triggered bruising public inquiries which found Crown unfit to hold gambling licences in Sydney and Melbourne, and called for sweeping changes to its board and culture. A third inquiry, into Crown's casino in Perth, is yet to deliver findings.
Crown said it had seen business at its sites pick up in recent weeks, especially over the weekends, as Australia relaxed COVID-19 curbs, but flagged annual corporate costs to be higher than last year at around A$130 million ($93.1 million).
""I firmly believe the business has turned the corner and it's been significantly de-risked,"" new CEO Steve McCann said at the briefing.
Crown recently rebuffed a buyout proposal from Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc but allowed it to conduct due diligence. McCann would not comment on talks with Blackstone but said Crown shareholders have ""been through quite a lot"" and ""deserve to be appropriately rewarded"".

Crown shares were up 0.5% at A$11.51 in afternoon trading, in line with the broader market but below Blackstone's indicative bid price of A$12.50.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Monday morning, with investors digesting Japanese data and looking ahead to a week of central bank meetings that could indicate the end of U.S. policy stimulus.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.98% by 9:01 PM ET (2:01 AM GMT). Data released earlier in the day showed that the Tankan large manufacturers' index was 18 for the fourth quarter of 2021, and the Tankan large non-manufacturers index was 9.
South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.80% and in Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.54%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 1.61%.
China’s Shanghai Composite rose 1.09% and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.51%, with industrial production and retail sales data due on Wednesday.
Investors are also keeping an eye on China’s outlook after top officials said their key goals for 2022 include counteracting growth pressures and stabilizing the economy. This raised expectations of fiscal stimulus in early 2022.
In the U.S., S&P 500 futures closed at a record high Friday following inflation data for November that mostly followed expectations. The consumer price index (CPI) grew 6.8% year on year and 0.8% month on month, while the core CPI grew 4.9% year on year and 0.5% month on month.
Meanwhile, the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was below 1.5% and the yield curve is the flattest at the beginning of a tightening cycle in a generation.
Investors now await the Federal Reserve’s policy decision, due on Wednesday. The Fed is among the 20 central banks due to meet throughout the week, with the group also including the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan.
However, the outlook still remains uncertain as countries impose restrictive measures to curb the spread of the omicron COVID-19 variant and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that the U.K. faces a “tidal wave” of omicron infections.
“Global equities had a solid run last week and we’ll see if the goodwill lasts into what is a behemoth when it comes to event risk,” Pepperstone Financial Pty Ltd. head of research Chris Weston said in a note. However, omicron and the Fed should dictate sentiment, the note added.

VinFast became the country's first fully fledged domestic car manufacturer when its gasoline-powered models built under its own badge hit the streets in 2019.
It is betting on the U.S. market, where its electric SUVs and a battery leasing model are expected to make their debut next year.
The battery plant, Vietnam's first EV battery project is located in central province of Ha Tinh, on a 8-hectare (20 acre) plot.
In October, the Ha Tinh local authorities said plant was expected to be a $387 million investment and on a 12.6 hectare plot.
""This is in the focus of VinFast's localisation strategy of supply,"" said Thai Thi Thanh Hai, vice chair of Vingroup and vice-chair of the board of VinFast. 
""The strategy enables us to own our supply chain of batteries and parts."" 
The company said it is looking to produce 100,000 battery packs per year in a first phase and then upgrade its capacity to one million. 
It did not elaborate on the project's time frame in detail but based on the October's report, the project would run at full capacity from 2025. 

VinFast is working with a variety of partners for batteries, including StoreDot, Gotion High-Tech and ProLogium and is also focusing on internal R&D and is establishing research facilities to develop battery and charging technologies, the company has previously said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Dollar Tree said on Sunday it offered to explore a settlement with Mantle Ridge and hand a board seat to a former chief executive of a rival retailer, saying the activist investment firm's decision to seek control of its board is ""unwarrantedly aggressive.""
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) is reacting publicly to Mantle Ridge's decision late on Friday to nominate 11 directors and replace the entire board as well as push the company to hire Richard Dreiling, a former CEO of  Dollar General Corp  (NYSE:DG).
The company said it reached out to the investment firm, which owns 5.7% of its common stock, with suggestions on how to overhaul the board. It was ready to add Dreiling as a board member and possibly also as a consultant. 
Mantle Ridge would also have been given a say in selecting another board member, Dollar Tree said.
But Mantle Ridge failed to respond to the suggestions, the company said, noting it ""never heard back from Mantle Ridge until it received the letter nominating its slate to replace the entire Board.""
Mantle Ridge, run by Paul Hilal who honed his credentials as an activist investor at William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, said in Friday's filing that the company would benefit from a refreshed board.
Dollar Tree on Sunday countered that Mantle Ridge, which traditionally invests in only one company at a time and has successfully pushed for changes at railroad CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) and food services company Aramark, came with no plan or new ideas. 
Hilal and Mantle Ridge simply proposed changes in the board and executive ranks and wanted Dreiling to be appointed executive chairman, Dollar Tree said. ""The breadth and depth of the changes you suggest would be very disruptive and value destructive,"" Dollar Tree wrote in a letter to Hilal that it made public on Sunday.

A representative for Mantle Ridge did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Dollar Tree said it is still ready to engage constructively with Mantle Ridge but warned that ""handing control of the company"" to Hilal and Mantle Ridge is not in the best interest of Dollar Tree, its shareholders or other stakeholders.

Dahe Daily interviewed the employee, saying she had received notification of termination at the end of November, and published a copy of what she said was her termination letter. 
The letter said the employee had spread false information about being assaulted and about the company not handling the case. It added this ""caused strong social concern and had a bad impact on the company"".
""I have not made any mistakes, and certainly will not accept this result, and in the future will use legal means to protect my rights and interests,"" the newspaper quoted the employee as saying in the interview. 
Alibaba did not respond to a request for comment outside of working hours. A lawyer for the employee did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce firm, was rocked by the sexual assault allegation in August after the female employee published an account on the company's intranet stating that she was assaulted by her co-worker and a client during a business trip.
Alibaba fired the co-worker accused of assault, but also dismissed 10 other employees for publicizing the incident.

Chinese prosecutors later dropped the case against the employee's co-worker, stating that he committed forcible indecency but not a crime, but approved the arrest of the client in early September.
In China, issues of sexual harassment and assault were rarely brought up in the public sphere until the #MeToo movement took off in 2018, when a Beijing college student publicly accused her professor of sexual harassment.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Gulf exchanges are likely to have another busy year of initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2022, possibly surpassing this year's bumper crop, a Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) executive told Reuters.
After a year that featured three major IPOs on both Abu Dhabi's ADX and Saudi Arabia's Tadawul markets, Dubai has announced plans to list as many as 10 state-owned companies.
""We expect ADX and Tadawul to be very busy. The major difference in 2022 is that the Dubai financial market will be busy too,"" said Christian Cabanne, Bank of America's head of equity capital markets for Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa. 
The plans announced by Dubai, which has not had a major IPO since a unit of state-linked developer Emaar Properties in 2017, seek to help the emirate to contend with intensifying competition for capital in the region.
Cabanne said the success of Dubai’s IPOs will depend on factors such whether the size of the offers are digestible for the market, with price ranges that are deemed appealing to both international and local investors.
There is still plenty of capital to deploy in the region, Cabanne said.
""Certainly between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, we expect a similar investor base ... we would expect to see some discipline in terms of not having similar types of issues going on the same timetable,"" he said.
The UAE last week announced it will shift to Saturday-Sunday weekends next year instead of Friday and Saturday, which Cabanne said is a major step to align the UAE with global markets and make it easier for international investors to trade local securities.

The introduction of new products in regional equity capital markets this year, such as a debut exchangeable bond in the UAE or a first secondary marketed equity offering in Saudi Arabia, will also potentially boost the number of new issues in the markets.

EDWARDSVILLE, Ill. (Reuters) -Six Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) workers were confirmed dead on Saturday after a series of tornadoes roared through a warehouse near St. Louis, ripping off its roof and causing 11-inch thick concrete walls longer than football fields to collapse on themselves.
At least 45 Amazon employees made it out safely from the rubble of the 500,000-square-foot Edwardsville, Illinois, facility, fire chief James Whiteford said. Authorities had given up hope of finding more survivors as they shifted from rescue to recovery efforts that were expected to last days.
Tornadoes https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fifty-people-likely-killed-tornadoes-kentucky-governor-2021-12-11 ripped through six U.S. states Friday night, leaving a trail of death and destruction at homes and businesses stretching more than 200 miles.
The Amazon facility was hit about 8:38 p.m. central time, Whiteford said. The force of the winds was so severe the roof was ripped off and the building collapsed on itself.
Witnesses said workers were caught by surprise and forced to take shelter anywhere they could find.
""I had a coworker that was sending me pictures when they were taking shelter in the bathroom, basically anywhere they could hide,"" said Alexander Bird, who works at a warehouse across the street.
""People had to think on their feet quick.""
Amazon said all employees were normally notified and directed to move to a designated, marked shelter-in-place location when a site was made aware of a tornado warning in the area.
Emergency response training is provided to new employees and reinforced throughout the year, the company said.
It was unclear how many workers were still missing, as Amazon did not have an exact count of people working in the sorting and delivery center at the time the tornadoes hit, Whiteford said.
Colleagues and family members desperate for news about loved ones gathered outside the mess of concrete and steel.
Amazon truck driver Emily Epperson, 23, said she was anxiously waiting for information on the whereabouts of her workmate Austin McEwan late Saturday afternoon to relay to his girlfriend and parents.
""We're so worried because we believe that, you know, he would have been found by now,"" she told Reuters.
One mother told a St Louis news station that her son Clayton Cope, a 29-year-old maintenance worker, was dead. Police were yet to officially release the names of the dead.
""Everyone assumes they will be safe at work,"" said Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. ""We don't think that they will never come home.""
Pritzker said he had been in contact with Amazon executives, who pledged financial support for the community.
Earlier, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) https://twitter.com/ajassy/status/1469735669442711552?s=20 that the company was ""heartbroken over the loss"" of its staff members and would continue to work closely with local authorities on the rescue efforts.
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos echoed Jassy in a statement shared on Twitter later on Saturday, in which he pledged the company's support to the community.
""All of Edwardsville should know that the Amazon team is committed to supporting them and will be by their side through this crisis,"" Bezos wrote.

""It gives me shivers,"" said Kathie Burnett, 67, who worked as an Amazon delivery driver until two weeks ago, when she quit because of health reasons.
""I would have been standing right in the middle of that track,"" she said, pointing to what remained of the facility. ""There would have been 100 trucks in there last night and you didn't see one this morning, did you?""

VAN HORN, Texas (Reuters) -The eldest daughter of pioneering U.S. astronaut Alan Shepard took a joyride to the edge of space aboard Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin rocketship on Saturday, 60 years after her late father's famed suborbital NASA flight at the dawn of the Space Age.
Laura Shepard Churchley, 74, who was a schoolgirl when her father first streaked into space, was one of six passengers buckled into the cabin of Blue Origin's fully autonomous New Shepard spacecraft as it lifted off from a launch site outside the west Texas town of Van Horn.
The crew capsule separated from the top of six-story-tall rocket as it soared to an altitude of at least 62 miles (100 km) before falling back to Earth to descend under a canopy of three parachutes to the desert floor for a safe landing.
The entire flight, from liftoff to touchdown, lasted just over 10 minutes, with the crew experiencing a few minutes of weightlessness at the apex of the suborbital flight. 
New Shepard's reusable rocket booster flew itself back to Earth and touched down a short distance from where the capsule landed moments later.
Bezos arrived with members of Blue Origin's recovery team to greet and embrace the newly minted citizen astronauts as they emerged from the capsule, all smiles, in their blue flight suits. He then pinned astronaut wings to each of their collars amid a flurry of applause and cheers.
As she chatted with Bezos, Churchley briefly recounted her wonder at seeing the blackness of space from inside the capsule.
Voices of Churchley and her crewmates exclaiming excitement at the ride could be heard in audio transmissions from the capsule played during a live launch webcast by Blue Origin as the vehicle neared the climax of its flight.
The spacecraft itself is named for Alan Shepard, who in 1961 made history as the second person, and first American, to travel into space - a 15-minute suborbital flight as one of NASA's original ""Mercury Seven"" astronauts. A decade later, Shepard walked on the moon as commander of the Apollo 14 mission, famously hitting two golf galls on the lunar surface.
""I kind of feel a little bit like I'm following in my father's footsteps,"" Churchley said in pre-recorded remarks before the flight. ""I feel like he's right here with me.""
CITIZEN ASTRONAUTS
Churchley was one of two honorary, non-paying guest passengers chosen by Blue Origin for Saturday's flight. The other was Michael Strahan, 50, a retired National Football League star and co-anchor of ABC television's ""Good Morning America"" show. 
They were joined by four wealthy customers who paid undisclosed but presumably hefty sums for their New Shepard seats - space industry executive Dylan Taylor, engineer-investor Evan Dick, venture capitalist Lane Bess and his 23-year-old son, Cameron Bess. The Besses made history as the first parent-child pair to fly in space together, according to Blue Origin.
The flight briefly set a record for the number of humans in space at any one time - 19 total - including seven crew members and three visitors aboard the International Space Station and three Chinese taikonauts aboard their own newly build space station, according to Harvard-Smithsonian astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell. 
The launch was the third space tourism flight for Blue Origin, the company formed two decades ago by Bezos - founder and executive chairman of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). It was the company's first with a crew of six passengers.
No mention was made during the Blue Origin launch webcast of the deadly partial roof collapse https://www.reuters.com/world/us/injuries-reported-after-roof-collapse-amazon-warehouse-illinois-ap-2021-12-11 at an Amazon.com warehouse struck by a tornado late on Friday in the town of Edwardsville, Illinois, or the search for people trapped in the rubble. 
Bezos himself tagged along on Blue Origin's inaugural flight https://www.reuters.com/technology/jeff-bezos-worlds-richest-man-set-inaugural-space-voyage-2021-07-20 in July, joining his brother, Mark Bezos, trailblazing octogenarian female aviator Wally Funk, and 18-year-old Oliver Daeman, a Dutch high school graduate and beneficiary of a $28 million auction sweepstake.
Actor William Shatner, who embodied the promise of space travel in his role as Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise on the 1960s TV series ""Star Trek,"" joined https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/star-trek-actor-shatner-poised-blue-origin-space-jaunt-2021-10-13 the second New Shepard crew in October to become the oldest person in space at age 90.

1445,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2021 04:45PM ET</span>",Intel shows research for packing more computing power into chips beyond 2025,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Research teams at  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) on Saturday unveiled work that the company believes will help it keep speeding up and shrinking computing chips over the next ten years, with several technologies aimed at stacking parts of chips on top of each other.
Intel's Research Components Group introduced the work in papers at an international conference being held in San Francisco. The Silicon Valley company is working to regain a lead in making the smallest, fastest chips that it has lost in recent years to rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd.
While Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has laid out commercial plans aimed at regaining that lead by 2025, the research work unveiled Saturday gives a look into how Intel plans to compete beyond 2025.
One of the ways Intel is packing more computing power into chips by stacking up ""tiles"" or ""chiplets"" in three dimensions rather than making chips all as one two-dimension piece. Intel showed work Saturday that could allow for 10 times as many connections between stacked tiles, meaning that more complex tiles can be stacked on top of one another.
But perhaps the biggest advance showed Saturday was a research paper demonstrating a way to stack transistors - tiny switches that form the most basic building bocks of chips by representing the 1s and 0s of digital logic - on top of one another.

Intel believes the technology will yield a 30% to 50% increase in the number of transistors it can pack into a given area on a chip. Raising the number of transistors is the main reason chips have consistently gotten faster over the past 50 years.
""By stacking the devices directly on top of each other, we're clearly saving area,"" Paul Fischer, director and senior principal engineer of Intel's Components Research Group told Reuters in an interview. ""We're reducing interconnect lengths and really saving energy, making this not only more cost efficient, but also better performing.""

1446,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2021 10:55AM ET</span>",Green groups block roads in Serbia to protest Rio Tinto's mining project,"BELGRADE (Reuters) - Hundreds of people in Serbia braved sleet and cold weather to block roads across the country for the third straight weekend on Saturday to protest government plans to allow Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO)'s open a lithium mine.
To bolster economic growth, Serbia's government has offered mineral resources to foreign investors including China's Zijin copper miner and Rio Tinto.
Green activists say the mining projects will pollute land and water in the Balkan country which is already heavily scarred by industrial pollution.
The protests have become a headache for the ruling coalition ahead of April 3 general elections. 
After the first weeks of protests, conservative President Aleksandar Vucic sent an expropriation law, contested by green groups, which allowed swift acquisition of property by the state, back to parliament for reworking. 
On Friday, parliament also introduced amendments to a referendum law, including the removal of a requirement for payments of fees by civic groups to launch referendum initiatives.
Critics said the two laws were have been pushed through to ease construction of the mine.
But that does not go far enough, said Aleksandar Jovanovic Cuta, head of the Ecological Uprising civic organisation.
""There will be no respite until Rio Tinto is expelled from Serbia and until lithium mining ... is banned permanently,"" he told reporters. 
Protesters brought traffic to a standstill along a highway in the Novi Beograd neighbourhood and scuffled with a driver who attempted to plough his way through.
""We (must) defend ourselves from these crazy projects which are envisioning construction of tens of mines in Serbia,"" said Irena Radovanovic, a student from Belgrade. 

Lithium is in big global demand as a vital ingredient in batteries for electric cars, while another expected mining product, borates, is used in solar panels and wind turbines. 
Rio has promised to adhere to all domestic and EU environmental standards, but environmentalists say the planned $2.4 billion mine in Serbia would irreversibly pollute drinking water in the area.

The sources said on Saturday that the company had not yet made a final decision on whether to go ahead with the listing, while one added that it would consider whether to make additional risk disclosures if it proceeds.
A spokesman for SenseTime declined to comment on possible IPO changes.
SenseTime had missed the pricing date for the IPO on Friday after a media report that a blacklisting was imminent.
The designation was confirmed later on Friday when the U.S. Treasury Department added SenseTime to a list of ""Chinese military-industrial complex companies,"" part of sweeping human-rights-related sanctions on dozens of people and entities tied to China, Myanmar, North Korea and Bangladesh.
The Treasury Department accused SenseTime of having developed facial recognition programmes that can determine a target's ethnicity, with a particular focus on identifying ethnic Uyghurs.
SenseTime said in a statement on Saturday that it ""strongly opposed the designation and accusations that have been made in connection with it,"" calling the accusations unfounded.

SenseTime's addition to the U.S. blacklist would prohibit U.S.-based investors from buying its shares.
SenseTime had planned to sell 1.5 billion shares within a price range of HK$3.85 to HK$3.99 each in the IPO. It was due to set the final price and allocate shares to institutional investors on Friday, according to the firm's filings.

""We have seen considerable interest from private equity firms as well as other companies in the market,"" Narasimhan told Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft. 
""We have to do our work internally first to be able to provide financial data to some of the interested parties. That takes time. Within a year, we want to have clarity,"" the CEO added.
The Swiss pharmaceuticals company raised the prospect of divesting Sandoz in October.
All options remain open, including keeping Sandoz as part of Novartis, spinning it off to shareholders, or selling it to another company, the executive said in the interview published on Saturday.
""It would be premature to favour one option,"" Narasimhan said.
He declined to give a possible price tag for Sandoz, which achieved sales of $9.7 billion last year, about 20% of the group total.
""If we currently read that there are offers for 10 or 20 billion, we should not take this too seriously,"" he said. 
""Such offers are primarily put forward by analysts and then by the media, not by us or by real interested parties. We have to wait for the actual negotiations.""
Novartis was looking to use some of the $21 billion proceeds from selling its 33% stake in Roche for acquisitions, Narasimhan said, although patience was required because of high market valuations.

The company was interested in acquisitions in areas such as cardiovascular diseases, immunology, neurology, hematology or oncology, he said.
But Narasimhan declined to comment on rumours linking Novartis with U.S. biotech company Alnylam or Swiss drugmaker Vifor Pharma.

UniCredit, Italy's No.2 bank by assets, on Thursday unveiled a three-year plan https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/unicredit-targets-2024-net-profit-above-45-bln-euros-2021-12-09, pledging to return to investors 16 billion euros ($18 billion) by 2024, or virtually all of the profits generated during the period.
Provided UniCredit delivers on the plan, the payout goal would leave intact the bank's excess capital reserves, giving it room to consider potential mergers and acquisitions. 
In an interview with Italian daily Il Sole 24 Ore published on Saturday, Orcel reiterated that the group could consider M&A deals that strengthen its franchise and its shareholder return plans.
However, he quashed speculation that UniCredit could be interested in Generali or Mediobanca.
""I don't believe in tie-ups between banks and insurers. They do not work,"" Orcel said.
""Neither we're interested in managing financial holdings,"" he said in reference to Mediobanca's 13% stake in Generali, from which it reaps a sizeable share of its income.
Orcel's track record as one of Europe's most experienced dealmakers has fuelled speculation he could seek a deal involving UniCredit, after predecessor Jean Pierre Mustier unsuccessfully tried to strike a cross-border merger.
In October he walked away from a possible rescue deal for state-owned rival Monte dei Paschi because Italy's Treasury refused to meet his terms. 

While Mustier sought to reduce UniCredit's exposure to its debt-laden home country, Orcel repeated the bank wanted to grow domestically, noting its recent success in gaining market share with the help of new consumer finance products.

Automotive Chips and battery cells have become the two most important components in the age of electric and autonomous vehicles, forcing European carmakers to rely on Asian suppliers as local industry has been slow to build capacity close by.
""Yes, we have become too dependent on other regions, and a change of course is needed,"" Bosch's Supervisory Board Chairman Franz Fehrenbach, who steps down at the end of the year, told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
""However, this is not the fault of politics, but is related to cost optimisation in the supply chain,"" he said. ""The car industry is slowly asking itself how raw material supply will look like, particularly for battery cells.""
German firms have outlined plans to claw back control, including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) which plans to build six large battery cell factories with partners in Europe by 2030.
A global shortage of automotive chips has highlighted the problem, causing the European Union to launch subsidy programmes to attract chipmakers to the continent.

TFI Securities and Futures Ltd told Fantasia it was entitled to enforce the charge of 780 million shares in the unit, Colour Life Services Group, Fantasia said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange late on Friday.
Fantasia shares, suspended since Nov. 29 pending inside information, will resume trading on Monday, it said. 
The developer, which missed payment on $205.7 million in offshore notes that were due on Oct. 4, is one of number of indebted Chinese developers that have failed to make debt payments, sending shudders through global financial markets in recent months with fears of knock-on effects around the world.
Larger peers China Evergrande Group and Kaisa Group, with the two largest piles of offshore debt in the country, missed offshore bond payment deadlines this week, prompting rating agency Fitch to downgrade them to ""restricted default"". 
In the Friday filing, Fantasia said it has sold its interests in a Ninbgo development in eastern China for 200 million yuan ($31 million) in an effort to ease liquidity strains. 
The developer said its major onshore unit reached agreement last month with holders of a 7.8% yuan bond due next year to extend the maturity to 2024, and pay the interest that had become due on Nov. 29 in stages.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia has charged Dyson supplier ATA IMS with four violations of labour law on accommodation for workers as it investigates complaints of forced labour, authorities said on Saturday. 
The step comes after British home appliance maker Dyson said last month it was severing relations with ATA, and ending its contract within six months, after an independent audit of the company's labour practices and accusations by a whistleblower. 
""The complaints were mainly on allegations of appalling working and living conditions and foreign workers being forced to work excessive overtime hours,"" Malaysia's labour department told Reuters in an email response.
""It is too early to make any conclusion on the allegations."" 
The department, which inspected the company in February, May and July, added that the four charges were for violations of minimum standards for worker accommodation.
The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the charges. 
Reuters reported on Nov. 25 and Dec. 5 that ATA's mostly migrant workforce did overtime in excess of the monthly legal limit of 104 hours, and worked on Sundays.
ATA, which makes parts for Dyson vacuum cleaners and air purifiers, has said all overtime was voluntary, and that it paid double for work on Sundays and triple on public holidays.
The company has taken steps to ensure no recurrence, it added, saying it had begun a policy of zero overtime on Sunday that led to the resignations of nearly 300 workers in the first week of December.

Police are also investigating ATA over claims that a former worker was beaten by police after being taken to a police station where he was questioned about sharing information on working conditions with activists.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Railroad and mining company Grupo Mexico has sold almost all of its shares in Mexican airport operator  Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico  (NYSE:PAC) (GAP), a regulatory filing showed on Friday.
The two companies had been locked in a legal battle since 2011 when Grupo Mexico said it planned to launch a tender offer for at least 30% of the airport operator.

GAP has said its bylaws limit shareholders to holding no more than 10% of its outstanding stock and has been trying to force Grupo Mexico to reduce its stake.

(Reuters) -A federal jury on Friday awarded $22.5 million to a U.S. Army veteran who alleged that combat earplugs sold by 3M Co caused him to suffer hearing loss and tinnitus, the biggest verdict yet in massive litigation over the product.
Jurors in Pensacola, Florida, sided with former U.S. Army soldier Theodore Finley in the latest trial to result from more than 272,000 lawsuits by servicemembers and veterans who say defective earplugs made by 3M caused their hearing damage.
Finley, who used the earplugs while serving in the Army from 2006 to 2014, was awarded $7.5 million in compensatory damages and $15 million in punitive damages. The verdict surpassed the $13 million jurors awarded a U.S. Army sergeant last month.
The trial was the eighth so far to reach a verdict, with plaintiffs in four other cases winning more than $29 million combined. Juries sided with 3M in three others, and two more trials are underway, with more to come.
""We will ensure that 3M is held fully accountable for putting profits over the safety of those who served our nation,"" the lead lawyers for the plaintiffs - Bryan Aylstock, Shelley Hutson and Christopher Seeger - said in a joint statement.
3M called the verdict disappointing. It said it will continue defending itself and that 3M remained confident the Combat Arms Earplugs Version 2 was safe and effective.

Aearo Technologies LLC, which 3M bought in 2008, developed the product. Plaintiffs allege the company hid design flaws, fudged test results and failed to provide instruction in the proper use of the earplugs.
For the earplugs to work properly, the flexible cups on the side protruding from the ear sometimes had to be folded back. If not, the plugs would slowly loosen and noise would seep in. Veterans contend 3M failed to convey the need to fold the plugs.

""It's hard to produce Mustang Mach-Es fast enough to meet the incredible demand, but we are sure going to try."" Farley added https:// In a hot electrical vehicle market, Ford is pitting itself against the likes of century-old rival General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and European carmaker Stellantis, while chasing Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and global EV leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.

New York (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice has launched an expansive criminal investigation into short selling by hedge funds and research firms, according to three people familiar with the matter. 
Investigators are probing the relationships among the hedge funds and firms that publish negative reports on certain companies, often with the aim of sending the stock lower, the people said.
The Justice Department, which declined to comment on Friday, issued subpoenas to dozens of companies early this year, which included requests for funds' trading records, and issued a second round of subpoenas in recent months, according to the three sources. 
The Justice Department is scrutinizing trades in dozens of stocks, some of which were the subject of negative reports, the people said. 
Bloomberg News first reported the probe on Friday, adding that authorities are examining whether the funds engaged in insider trading or other abuses.
Anson Funds and Marcus Aurelius Value are among the firms under the scanner of the investigators, according to Bloomberg. 
The companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Among the stocks whose trading activity the Justice Department is examining are  Luckin Coffee  (OTC:LKNCY) Inc and GSX Techedu (NYSE:GOTU) Inc, on which Carson Block's Muddy Waters (NYSE:WAT) Capital and Andrew Left's Citron Research circulated research, Bloomberg said. 
In a statement, Citron Research said it ""knows of no wrongdoing and has cooperated fully with the government's investigation.""
Trading in short targets such as Santa Ana, California-based  Banc of California  (NYSE:BANC) Inc and  Mallinckrodt  (OTC:MNKKQ) Plc is also being examined, Bloomberg reported. 
The Justice Department probe comes after the U.S. securities regulator earlier this year said it is considering measures to require big investors to disclose more about short positions, or bets that stocks will fall and the use of derivatives to bet on other stock moves. 
The regulator also moved to protect small investors from trading apps that use features common to video games in order to boost risky trading activity.

The review of rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission was prompted by January's GameStop (NYSE:GME) saga and the meltdown of Archegos Capital.
Citron, one of the world's best known short-sellers, in January said it would publicly stop detailing companies' shortcomings following backlash against it and others who said retailer GameStop's stock is not worth its price.

1460,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 07:15PM ET</span>",Activist investor Mantle Ridge nominates 11 to Dollar Tree board,"(Reuters) - Activist investment firm Mantle Ridge wants to overhaul Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR)'s board and would like the company to hire the former chief executive of rival  Dollar General Corp  (NYSE:DG) as it pushes for a review of the retailer's business strategy. 
Mantle Ridge, which owns a $1.8 billion stake in the retailer, has nominated 11 people, including its founder Paul Hilal, to Dollar Tree's 11-member board, according to a regulatory filing made late on Friday. The entire board is up for re-election at next year's annual meeting.
The company ""will benefit from a refresh of the membership of the Board,"" the filing said.
The investment firm also said it wants the board to consider hiring Richard Dreiling, who had been a chief executive and chairman at Dollar General, to a leadership role. Dreiling was not nominated as a director candidate by Mantle Ridge.
Dollar Tree did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
J.P. Morgan analysts said last month the involvement of Dreiling at Dollar Tree could be a ""potential game-changer"", adding that he was the architect of Dollar General's turnaround story from 2008 to 2015 that saw its revenue double.
Mantle Ridge and its advisors have met with Dollar Tree's board to discuss the investment firm's concerns about company's lagging stock price and other issues, the filing said. Over the last five years Dollar Tree's stock price has gained 68.11%, lagging rival Dollar General Corp's 188.46% gain.
While Mantle Ridge said it wants to continue talking with Dollar Tree, it was forced to nominate directors now because its discussions likely will not be completed before the four week-long window to nominate directors closes later this month.
Dollar Tree recently reported a 4% rise in net sales, even as its net income declined.
Mantle Ridge has an economic interest of 9.85% in the company, including 5.7% of common stock and 4.19% in cash-settled derivatives.
Chesapeake, Virginia-based Dollar Tree is currently valued at $31.8 billion and bought a rival chain Family Dollar in 2015.
Dollar Tree traditionally sold items for one dollar but said last month that it would raise prices of most goods to $1.25 by the end of April in the wake of spiraling freight costs and other pandemic-driven challenges.
The retailer faced off against another activist investment firm in 2019 when Starboard Value urged the retailer to consider raising its prices.

Mantle Ridge traditionally makes an investment in only one company at a time and has previously targeted railroad CSX Corp (NASDAQ:CSX) and food service company Aramark. Both companies appointed new chief executives soon after Mantle Ridge arrived and began pushing for changes.
Hilal previously worked at Pershing Square Capital Management, an activist hedge fund run by his college roommate, William Ackman.

1462,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 06:05PM ET</span>","Wall Street gains, S&P hits record closing high as CPI meets expectations","By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street advanced on Friday and the S&P 500 notched an all-time closing high, as market participants digested an inflation reading that was in line with consensus, but also marked the largest annual increase in consumer prices in nearly four decades.
All three major U.S. stock indexes advanced, with tech shares doing the heavy lifting.
The indexes all ended the session higher than last Friday's close, and the benchmark S&P 500 posted its biggest weekly percentage advance since the week ended Feb. 5, as waning jitters over the Omicron coronavirus variant helped fuel a broad rally early in the week.
A report from the Labor Department showed consumer prices surged last month to a 6.8% annual growth rate, the highest reading in more than 39 years. 
""It would appear that today’s reaction would indicate the markets were discounting the (CPI) reading,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. ""The markets are always looking forward and perhaps today's reading is indicative of a peak versus a sustained level."" 
Persistent inflation due to ongoing supply-chain challenges suggests the U.S. Federal Reserve could very well start tightening its accommodative monetary policy sooner than many might have hoped. 
""Clearly, it’s being driven primarily by supply-chain issues,"" Said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""But it appears these issues could be easing, and over time we should see them moderate. And that should take the foot off the inflation accelerator.""
A Reuters poll of economists sees the central bank hiking key interest rates from near zero to 0.25-0.50% in the third quarter of next year, followed by another in the fourth quarter.
The Fed is expected to convene next week for its two-day monetary policy meeting, which market participants will be scrutinizing for any clues regarding those rate increases along with the pace at which it will taper its bond purchases.
""The Fed is has telegraphed on tightening sooner rather than later,"" Carlson added. ""The markets are more comfortable with Fed tightening if it reduces inflation expectations.""
The graphic below shows core CPI along with other major U.S. indicators, all of which continue to soar well above the Fed's average annual 2% inflation target: 
(Inflation - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gdvzymnaapw/inflation.png)

All 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 ended the session green, with technology and consumer staples enjoying the largest percentage jumps. 
Shares of software firm  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) jumped 15.6% after it forecast an upbeat third-quarter outlook.
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc gained 8.3% following the chipmaker's announcement of a $10 billion share buyback plan.
Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, tweeted that he is ""thinking of quitting my jobs & becoming an influencer full-time."" The electric car maker's stock advanced 1.3%.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) dropped 3.8% after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) downgraded the commercial air carrier's shares to ""sell"" from ""neutral."" 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.05-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.48-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 38 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 34 new highs and 155 new lows.

Investment Minister Gerry Grimstone made the offer to host a meeting between the sparring groups before the row escalated on Thursday, with Airbus threatening to use a procedure in the English courts to seek an independent legal assessment.
Asked by Reuters about the prior offer of mediation, a UK official on Friday confirmed the proposal and said it reflected ""the importance of Airbus and Qatari investment to the UK"".
Airbus and Qatar Airways both declined to comment. People familiar with the situation said there were few signs that the offer was being taken up as the two sides head towards a legal fight over the impact of paint and other skin flaws on the jets.
Qatar Airways says it has been ordered by its regulator to ground 20 of its 53 A350 jets over damage to a layer of anti-lightning protection, arguing that absence of a root cause has left it unable to determine whether safety is affected.
Airbus says that it does understand the cause and on Thursday accused the Gulf carrier of misrepresenting the problem as a safety issue and of refusing to accept a repair plan. 

Industry experts say the deteriorating dispute between two of aviation's key players is unprecedented in public. A Reuters investigation revealed last week that several other airlines had also reported flaws, though none has grounded the long-haul jet.
Qatar Airways has not so far responded to the Airbus legal statement, which was issued late on Thursday ahead of a weekend in the Gulf.

Jewelry stocks are known to have performed well during inflationary periods, as investors seek to invest in precious metals that act as a hedge against inflation and market fluctuations. So, both SIG and PANDY should benefit from these tailwinds in the coming months.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said he was ""deeply troubled"" by Kellogg (NYSE:K) Co's plans to hire permanent replacements for striking unionized employees after they voted down a proposed contract this week.
Biden, who has put unions at the center of his policymaking, said such actions undermine the critical role collective bargaining plays in giving workers a voice.
""Permanently replacing striking workers is an existential attack on the union and its members' jobs and livelihoods. I have long opposed permanent striker replacements and I strongly support legislation that would ban that practice,"" Biden said in a statement.
Kellogg said earlier this week that a majority of its U.S. cereal plant workers had voted against a new five-year contract, forcing it to hire permanent replacements as employees extend a strike that started more than two months ago.
Kellogg spokesperson Kris Bahner said on Friday the company is ""ready, willing and able to negotiate with the union"" and has made every effort to reach a fair agreement, including making six comprehensive offers to the union throughout negotiations.
""We agree that this needs to be solved at the bargaining table. Our objective has been – and continues to be – to reach a fair agreement for our people,"" Bahner said in a statement.
This is the second time Biden has weighed in on a key labor action to express his support for unions and the organized labor movement. 
In February, he defended workers' rights to form unions as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) employees in Alabama prepared to vote on whether to unionize. Last month, a regional director for the U.S. National Labor Relations Board ordered a rerun of that election, which ended in a defeat for the union effort.
Biden and Democrats have tried to stop the practice of permanently replacing workers who are striking, which is currently legal, via the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act. The legislation was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in March but faces long odds in the Senate.

The percentage of U.S. workers represented by a union fell almost 15 percentage points between 1979 and 2020, according to the White House. That drop, the White House says, has cost workers $200 billion a year in unrealized wages and benefits.
Actions taken by Biden, who is considered one of the most pro-union presidents in the history of the United States, has offered the U.S. labor movement significant momentum, Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, told the Reuters Next Conference last week.

The U.S. consumer price index increased 0.8% last month after surging 0.9% in October, while it accelerated 6.8% on an annualized basis to mark the biggest year-on-year rise since June 1982.
The data failed to unnerve investors who closely watched the Labor Department report. The benchmark for U.S. equities, the S&P 500 index, closed at its 67th record high of the year, according to S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI).
""This data suggests that the Fed will have to tighten monetary policy more aggressively than just a couple of month ago, and the market's acceptance of that is a little surprising to me,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors in Boston.
Brian Pietrangelo, managing director of Investment Strategy at Key Private Bank, said the Fed has raised interest rates four times since the 1990s and each time the market took the hikes well, with equities rising as rates move higher.
""We believe the market can handle rate increases as long as they're transparent and they're at the right pace,"" he said, noting he expects two or three interest rate hikes next year.
""The Fed's been pretty transparent, which is why you're seeing a positive move in the stock market today and not a lot of reaction in the bond market,"" Pietrangelo said.
MSCI's all-country world index rose 0.36%, to post its biggest weekly gain, up 3.05%, since early February. The broad STOXX Europe 600 index fell 0.30% on concerns the Omicron COVID-19 variant could weaken the European recovery.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.60%, the S&P 500 gained 0.95% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.73%. 
Gains in information technology, led by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL), pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher. But consumer staples was the second-biggest percentage gainer, up 2.0%, suggesting investors were carefully assessing the Fed's next move.
The dollar slid as the forex market was positioned for a higher CPI reading, analysts said.
""The FX market has been extremely long U.S. dollars for several months, so with this number coming in benign, we're almost out of events that could push the dollar materially higher before year-end,"" said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets.
The dollar index fell 0.157%, with the euro up 0.19% to $1.1314. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.02% versus the greenback at 113.43 per dollar. 
The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes fell 0.2 basis point to 1.485%. 
Oil prices rose in their biggest weekly gain since late August, with market sentiment buoyed by easing concerns over the Omicron variant's impact on global economic growth and fuel demand.
Brent crude rose 73 cents to settle at $75.15 a barrel. U.S. crude settled up 73 cents at $71.67 a barrel.

U.S. gold futures gained 0.4% at $1,784.30 an ounce.
Bitcoin rose 1.51% to $48,301.91.

1471,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 04:46PM ET</span>","Drugmakers aim big price hikes at U.S. patients, congressional report finds","By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Drugmakers have targeted the U.S. market to earn outsized profits from old medicines, according to a report released on Friday by the House Oversight Committee that highlighted Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co, Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) and  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY), which dominate the market for insulin.
The staff report also noted pricing and marketing tactics by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) that helped it earn billions of dollars from its now off-patent pain drug Lyrica.
The report, put out following a nearly three-year probe, took issue with assertions by the pharmaceutical industry that high drug prices were needed to fund innovation and research and development programs. 
""The Committee's investigation also found that companies dedicated a significant portion of their R&D expenditures to research that was intended to extend market monopolies, support the companies' marketing strategies, and suppress competition,"" the report said. 
The report, which focused on 12 drugs made by 10 companies, said that Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi own some 90% of the market for life-sustaining insulin, which was invented in the 1920s.
A Lilly spokesperson said the company offers discounts to make its insulin affordable. A Sanofi spokesperson said the price of its insulin product Lantus had declined almost 45% since 2012. A Novo Nordisk spokesperson said the report reflected a limited picture of the company's efforts to make drugs accessible.
Medicare, the U.S. government health insurance program for those age 65 and older and the disabled, could have saved more than $16.7 billion from 2011 to 2017 on insulin purchases had it been allowed to negotiate discounts with drug companies, the report found.
""We found that drug companies target American patients for price increases, in large part because Medicare is prohibited from negotiating for lower prices. At the same time, the drug companies maintained or cut prices for the rest of the world,"" Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney said at a news conference on Friday.
The high prices have had human costs. More than 40% of insulin-dependent patients surveyed said they rationed their medicine in the previous year, the Colorado attorney general's office found in a 2020 report.
PRODUCT HOPPING
President Joe Biden's Build Back Better plan, which passed the House and should come before the Senate this year, includes a provision allowing Medicare to negotiate with drugmakers, although only for a small number of medicines.
The report also found that some pharmaceutical companies engage in what it called ""product hopping,"" a practice of making small tweaks to formulations to get a new patent and then switching patients to the newer, more expensive version. There are bills before Congress to ban product hopping.
Among big-selling insulin products, Eli Lilly raised the price of its Humalog 1,219% per vial since it launched, Novo Nordisk raised the price of NovoLog 627% since launch and Sanofi has raised the price of Lantus 715%, the report found.
The report also found that Pfizer targeted the U.S. market for higher prices for its blockbuster Lyrica, as well as using product hopping to prevent patients from shifting to cheaper, generic versions of the medicine.
Lyrica's price had gone up 420% since it was approved in 2004, the report said. It had sales of about $2 billion in 2019.
Pfizer did not have an immediate comment.
The report also listed price hikes of 825% for Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA)' Copaxone, 486% for Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN)'s Enbrel, 395% for Novartis' decades-old Gleevec, more than 100,000% for  Mallinckrodt  (OTC:MNKKQ)'s Acthar, 471% for AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV)'s Humira and 82% for its Imbruvica, and 255% for Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG)'s Revlimid, now owned by Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY) Squibb.

Most of the drugs mentioned in the report are over a decade old.
Novartis said it invested over 18% of its global revenue into R&D. Mallinckrodt and Bristol Myers did not have an immediate comment. Amgen, AbbVie, and Teva did not respond to requests for comment.

So, established auto manufacturers Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) (VWAGY) and Ford (F) should benefit. But which of these two stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.Based in Wolfsburg, Germany, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) manufactures and sells automobiles primarily in Europe, North America, South America, and the Asia-Pacific. The company operates in four segments: Passenger Cars and Light Commercial Vehicles; Commercial Vehicles; Power Engineering; and Financial Services. On the other hand, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) designs, manufactures, markets, and services a range of Ford trucks, cars, sport utility vehicles, electrified vehicles, and Lincoln luxury vehicles worldwide. It operates through three segments: Automotive; Mobility; and Ford Credit.
The global semiconductor shortage, supply chain disruption, and labor issues have negatively impacted the auto manufacturing industry. However, huge government and private investments to boost semiconductor production should address the concern and help auto manufacturers restart operations. This, along with the increasing demand for electric vehicles due to rising oil prices and climate change concerns, should drive the industry’s growth. Moreover, traditional automakers could benefit more because of their broad portfolio of vehicles and market dominance. According to a report by Market Research Future, the automotive industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.5% between 2021 and 2028. Therefore, both VWAGY and F should benefit.
F has gained 56.6% over the past nine months, while VWAGY has returned 13.4%. Also, F’s 114.2% gains over the past year are significantly higher than VWAGY’s 54.4% returns. Moreover, F is the clear winner with 125.4% gains versus VWAGY’s 42.3% returns in terms of year-to-date performance.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four of the biggest meat-processing companies, using their market power in the highly consolidated U.S. market to drive up meat prices and underpay farmers, have tripled their own net profit margins since the pandemic started, White House economics advisers said. 
Financial statements of the meat-processing companies - which control 55%-85% of the market for beef, poultry and pork - contradict claims that rising meat prices were caused by higher labor or transportation costs, advisers led by National Economic Council Director Brian Deese wrote in an analysis published on the White House website Friday. 
Officials studied earnings statements from  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN), the chicken producer and biggest U.S. meat company by sales; Brazil-based  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY), the world's biggest meatpacker; Brazilian beef producer Marfrig Global Foods SA which owns most of National Beef Packing Company; and Seaboard Corp RIC. 
Those statements showed a 120% collective jump in their gross profits since the pandemic and a 500% increase in net income, the analysis shows. These companies recently announced $1 billion in new dividends and stock buybacks, on top of the more than $3 billion they paid to shareholders since the pandemic began.
Trade group the North American Meat Institute accused the White House of ""cherry-picking"" data.
""It is no coincidence this blog post appears on the same day as the Consumer Price Index is released showing gas and energy prices are up nearly 60 percent over the past 12 months which is nearly 10 times the rate of inflation for food,"" President Julie Anna Potts said in a statement.
Profit margins - the spread companies are making over and above their costs - have increased significantly too, belying the argument that companies are just passing along higher labor and supply costs, the analysis said, with gross margins up 50% and net margins up over 300%. 
""If rising input costs were driving rising meat prices, those profit margins would be roughly flat, because higher prices would be offset by the higher costs,"" the analysis said.
Increases in meat prices accounted for 25% of the rise in consumer prices for food consumed at home in November, a big driver in the surge in inflation seen in recent months.
Tyson increased the price of beef ""so much — by more than 35% — that they made record profits while actually selling less beef than before,"" the advisers wrote. 
The companies didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. 

The White House, hammered by Republicans over rising inflation, is scrambling to combat rising prices by clearing supply chain logjams and tackling what it views as uncompetitive practices by big companies, which are reporting big profit gains even as consumers suffer.
Friday's blog - released after November consumer prices showed the largest annual gain since 1982 - reflects growing frustration by White House officials about continued increases in meat prices, an issue it flagged in September.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed at a record Friday, shrugging off the the fastest pace of inflation in 39 years as investors continued to pile into tech stocks as U.S. Treasury yields fell. 
 The S&P 500 rose 0.95% to close at a record of 4,712.02. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.60%, or 216 points, the Nasdaq climbed 0.73%.
CPI rose 0.8% in November, a tenth of a percentage point more than expected, though the year-on-year consumer prices jumped 6.8%, in-line with expectations and the fastest rate since June 1982.
""People were expecting a very high number and they got it […] that's why there's a muted market reaction to this inflation report,"" Chief Strategist at Spouting Rock Asset Management Rhys Williams told Investing.com in an interview on Friday.
The multi-decade fast pace of inflation failed to spook the markets as it was largely priced in and comes at a time when investors are expecting the Federal Reserve to speed up the pace of bond tapering and turn more hawkish at its monetary policy meeting next week.
""Powell said two weeks ago that the Fed will discuss increasing the taper and inflation wasn't transitory … that would suggest that the market is expecting increased hawkishness at the Fed meeting, compared to a month or two ago,” Williams added.
Against the backdrop of in-line inflation, Treasury yields fell sharply, pushing growth sectors of the market - sensitive to rates - tech sharply higher.
As well as falling interest rates, better-than-expected quarterly results from Oracle and Broadcom also supported climb in tech.
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) rise more than 8% after the chipmaker hiked its quarterly dividend and announced a $10 billion share buyback Thursday after reporting fiscal fourth-quarter results that topped expectations, led by a rebound in enterprise cloud and services demand.
“While FY21 experienced a meaningful rebound in Cloud, FY22 is likely to be characterized by sustained momentum in core enterprise and along with still tight supply and ASP [average selling price] tailwinds especially in 1HCY22, should support another double digit year of rev growth,” Credit Suisse said.
Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) reported fiscal fourth quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates, sending its shares more than 15% higher.
Consumer stables, a defensive corner of the market, was also in the ascendency, led by a more than 5% rise in Costco (NASDAQ:COST) following better-than-expected quarterly results.

(Reuters) -Moderna Inc executives called on investors to wait for more data amid a sharp selloff in its shares on Friday, after early data showed its mRNA-based flu vaccine was no better than already approved shots in the market.
The company's shares tumbled 10% after its investor presentation showed antibody levels of its vaccine against all four strains of the influenza virus in an early-stage study were not as robust in older people as  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY)'s Fluzone HD. 
""We can't make a direct comparison. We presented (Fluzone data) only as guidance,"" a company executive said on a conference call, responding to concerns that  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s vaccine was inferior to Fluzone HD.
Moderna's vaccine candidate, mRNA-1010, is based on the messenger RNA technology, which also underpins its COVID-19 shots.
Following the huge success of mRNA-based vaccines in fighting the pandemic globally, drugmakers are rushing to tap the technology and develop shots for other diseases, including influenza.
""On one hand, the antibodies increased to good levels, but on the other hand, the levels aren't necessarily seen as high or necessarily better than some high-efficacy vaccines such as Flublok or Fluzone HD,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Yee said in a client note.
Moderna executives said the antibody response might have been limited by the population's previous exposure to the flu strains, adding that data on the full immune response, including T-cells, would better measure the effectiveness of the flu vaccines. 
""Antibody titers are useful but are not the same as full efficacy,"" senior executive Jacqueline Miller said.

The early-stage study, testing the vaccine in 180 subjects, is ongoing and a mid-stage study testing it against an already approved flu vaccine is fully enrolled with 500 participants, the company said, adding that the interim analysis is expected in early 2022.
U.S.-listed shares of BioNTech, which along with partner  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) is also developing an mRNA-based influenza vaccine, were down nearly 8%.

However, prices rose marginally today, and analysts expect gold prices to rise to $1,900 per ounce in 2022. Furthermore, rising inflation could make holding precious metals more attractive than holding U.S. dollars. Hence, the SPDR Gold (GLD), VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX), iShares Silver (SLV), and Global X Silver Miners (SIL) ETFs might be reasonable bets now. Read on.Precious metals have long been reliable investments in the face of rising prices for consumer goods. However, gold and silver prices have declined this week as the investors anticipated the Fed’s policy decision in response to the latest inflation report. But despite seemingly heading for a fourth straight decline this week, spot gold prices rose 0.1% to $1,776.23 per ounce, while spot silver prices gained 0.2% to $21.97 an ounce on December 10.
Analysts at the investment banking firm Société Générale S.A (SCGLY (OTC:SCGLY)) expect gold prices to trade at around $1,900 per ounce by the second quarter of 2022 because they do not anticipate interest rate hikes before then despite the Fed’s hawkish stance. In addition, inflation has accelerated at its fastest pace since June 1982, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rising 6.8% year-over-year for November, which could make precious metals a better store of value than the greenback.
Hence, we think it may be reasonable now to invest in the gold and silver ETFs of SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV), and Global X Silver Miners ETF (SIL) as a hedge against the rising inflation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday it had found no safety issues after investigating allegations made against Blue Origin’s human spaceflight program.
The FAA said in September it would review safety concerns raised by former Blue Origin employees. The FAA said on Friday it was closing its investigation after finding ""no specific safety issues"" and was taking no action against billionaire Jeff Bezos' space company.
Alexandra Abrams, former head of Blue Origin Employee Communications, and 20 other unnamed Blue Origin employees and former employees, said in an essay they had ""seen a pattern of decision-making that often prioritizes execution speed and cost reduction over the appropriate resourcing to ensure quality.""
A Blue Origin spokesperson did not immediately comment Friday but said in September Abrams ""was dismissed for cause two years ago after repeated warnings for issues involving federal export control regulations.""
Abrams told CBS News, which first reported the allegations, she never received any warnings related to export control issues.
In July, Bezos soared some 66.5 miles (107 km) above the Texas desert aboard a New Shepard launch vehicle in a suborbital flight.

Blue Origin said in September it stood ""by our safety record and believe that New Shepard is the safest space vehicle ever designed or built.""

(Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE:GM) is considering investing more than $4 billion in two Michigan plants to boost its electric vehicle production capacity, according to sources and documents made public on Friday.
GM has proposed building a $2.5 billion battery plant near Lansing with partner LG Energy Solution, the documents show.
The largest U.S. automaker is separately considering a $2 billion overhaul of its Orion Township assembly plant north of Detroit to build next-generation electric vehicles. The total investments could top $4 billion, a source familiar with the plan told Reuters.
Documents posted by the city of Lansing show GM is considering building a battery cell manufacturing plant in nearby Delta Township that could employ 1,700 people by 2028. The Lansing City Council is expected to consider the proposal on Monday. 
The joint venture battery plant would be 2.5 million square feet and is on land currently owned by GM, the documents say, adding that ""the battery cell production facility will generate significant economic activity throughout Michigan.""
Shares in GM were up 4.8% to $62.50 in afternoon trade.
Details of the investment plans were reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.
Michigan state lawmakers are moving for quick approval of the plans to boost the state's ability to win new electric vehicle and battery plant investments.
In September, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co opted for Kentucky and Tennessee rather than its home state of Michigan for new battery and electric vehicle production.
Ford and its Korean battery partner SK Innovation said they would invest $11.4 billion to build an electric F-150 assembly plant and three battery plants in the United States.
If approved, GM's share of the total investment in the two Michigan EV projects would be at least $3 billion.
The Orion plant, which now builds the Chevrolet Bolt, would be converted to build products using GM's Ultium EV platform, the source said.
GM first halted production of the Bolt in August after a major battery recall and recently extended the halt to late January.

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra told reporters on Thursday that a decision on new plants in Michigan and elsewhere could be ""weeks away.""
GM said in a statement on Friday that it was ""developing business cases for potential future investments in Michigan,"" but that ""these projects are not approved and securing all available incentives will be critical for any business case to continue moving forward.""

1485,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 01:40PM ET</span>",UniCredit to cut 950 jobs in Italy under new plan -unions,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's second-biggest bank UniCredit is set to cut 950 full-time positions in the country under its new plan to the end of 2024, unions said in a statement on Friday.
The cuts, mainly concentrated in central offices, will be carried out by retiring people, including by using an industry fund that allows staff to stop working up to seven years before pension age.
The unions said in UniCredit's case the fund could be tapped by employees qualifying for retirement at the latest by April 2028. Individual buyout packages will also be used.
The three-year plan, announced on Thursday, commits UniCredit to returning to investors 16 billion euros, or virtually all of the profits generated over the period. When unveiling the plan, the bank said it would not disclose layoff figures before negotiations with unions.
UniCredit kicked off formal discussions, which under Italian rules can take up to 50 days, by sending a letter to banking unions Fabi, First Cisl, Cgil Fisac, Uilca and Unisin on Thursday.
Italy accounts for 44% of UniCredit's workforce of around 87,000. Sources have previously said the plan envisages a total of around 3,000 job cuts, of which a significant portion would be in Germany.

Italian unions had agreed to 5,200 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-banks-unicredit-idUSKBN21K2WP voluntary layoffs under the bank's previous plan, presented in December 2019 by then CEO Jean Pierre Mustier, which entailed a total 8,000 job cuts. 
Italian banking unions normally aim to replace half of the people leaving with new hires. UniCredit had agreed to hire 2,600 young staff as part of its latest round of cuts.

1486,By StockNews,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 01:30PM ET</span>","Forget Zynga, Buy These 3 Video Game Stocks Instead","The video gaming industry has witnessed a significant surge in its user base owing to the remote lifestyle trend amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The introduction of innovative games should also keep driving the industry’s growth amid the reopening of the economy. But we don’t think Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) is fit enough financially to capitalize on the industry’s growth. Therefore, investors could instead bet on shares of fundamentally sound video game companies Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA), and Playtika (PLTK). So read on. Let’s pore over these names.San Francisco-based social game services provider  Zynga Inc .’s (ZNGA) total revenue increased 40% year-over-year to $704.7 million in its third quarter (ended September 30, 2021). However, its total costs and expenses increased 14.7% year-over-year to $717 million. Its cash and cash equivalents came in at $1.09 billion for the period ended September 30, 2021, compared to $1.36 billion for the period ended December 31, 2020. Along with weak financials, its 0.35% trailing-12-month CAPEX/Sales ratio is 90.8% lower than the 3.77% industry average. And its trailing-12-month net income margin is negative compared to the industry 5.73% average.
The stock has declined 38.5% in price over the past six months to close yesterday’s trading session at $6.34. Furthermore, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts recently reduced ZNGA’s price target to $10 from $12. Also, in terms of forward EV/S ratio, the stock’s 2.59x is higher than the 2.43x industry average. And its 2.63x forward P/S is 50.6% higher than the 1.75x industry average. So, it may not be a wise bet to cash in on the industry’s growth.
However, the demand for video games has skyrocketed due to the COVID-19 pandemic-led remote lifestyle. While easing restrictions this year have been shifting consumers’ focus to outdoor activities, the increasing availability of innovative online, mobile, and cloud gaming should keep driving the industry’s growth. According to a Fortune Business Insights report, the global gaming market is expected to grow at a 13.2% CAGR between 2021 and 2028. Therefore, we think investors seeking to benefit from the industry’s growth could instead bet on quality video game stocks Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI),  Electronic Arts Inc . (NASDAQ:EA), and Playtika Holding Corp. (PLTK) instead.

These stocks also have an overall ‘Strong Buy’ rating in our proprietary rating system. Let’s discuss.After the three major stock market indexes posted three straight days of gains, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite ended lower yesterday ahead of key inflation data and nagging COVID-19 omicron variant fears. Amid this market uncertainty, we think it could be wise to bet on quality pharmaceutical stocks, given the industry’s defensive nature. Companies in this space typically witness steady demand for their products and services irrespective of the economic conditions.
Moreover, the industry is expected to grow going forward as the population ages and chronic diseases rise. According to a LINCHPIN report, the pharmaceutical industry is expected to increase to $1.5 trillion by 2023.
Therefore, we think dividend-paying quality pharmaceutical stocks Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Merck & Co., Inc.

1488,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 01:22PM ET</span>",Analysis-Miners face talent crunch as electric vehicles charge up metals demand,"By Clara Denina , Helen Reid and Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - University of Kentucky undergraduate Jonathan Little is among the legions of students around the world that the mining industry cannot afford to lose, but already has. 
Little, 20, considered a career in mining, but chose instead to study a branch of engineering that will likely have him designing truck engines. That was much more appealing to him than working in a coal mine, like many of his university peers do after graduation.
""That's not a career path I want,"" said Little.
Choices made by Little and other students foreshadow a talent crunch for the mining industry as it braces for a wave of retirements from aging workers. Later this decade, fewer graduates will have the skills needed to build and run mines producing lithium, nickel, copper and other metals to feed ravenous makers of electric vehicles, solar panels and other renewable-energy technologies.
Enrollment in U.S. mining engineering programs dropped 46% between 2015 and 2020, according to a survey by the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration (SMME). The same problem afflicts major mining countries such as Canada, South Africa and Australia. 
""We are going to end up with untrained people to run mines at a time when you really need to mine for the EV transition,"" said Mike Armitage, who sits on the board of fluorspar miner Tertiary Minerals Plc.
The talent crunch is hitting just as automakers are gearing up to build millions of electric vehicles. Many plan to have fully electric fleets by 2030. Batteries and wiring for all those engines will require major boosts in metals production.
Many students are spooked, professors and industry executives say, by mining's historical reputation as a dangerous industry that pollutes the environment. That stereotype was reinforced just three years ago when 270 people died after the collapse of a tailings dam owned by Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) at an iron ore mine in Brazil.
AGING WORKFORCE
More than half of miners are over the age of 45 and 20% are over 60 and closing in on retirement, according to a study from Mercer. The U.S. government is forming a committee to address ""public perceptions about the nature of mining"" and its aging workforce.
Meanwhile, the China University of Mining and Technology - considered that country's best mining school - enrolled more mining engineering students in 2020 than the entire United States, largely to supply China's growing coal sector, according to the SMME survey. 
Now, Western universities, trade groups and companies are rushing to recruit new students as high school seniors finalize university applications and many first-year college students begin to choose their area of study.
""If you don't know mining, you get these odd perceptions of the industry that we're like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs with pick-axes,"" said Emilie Schouten of silver miner Coeur Mining (NYSE:CDE) Inc, which has boosted outreach to students. 
CEO SEES 'TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES' 
Concern about the looming talent shortage even prompted Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) Inc Chief Executive Richard Adkerson to meet personally with University of Arizona students this year to sway their career choices.
""Today's mining is not the mining that people thought of historically,"" said Adkerson, who also chairs a global mining industry trade group. ""There's just such tremendous opportunities for young, technical people to come in and make a contribution immediately."" 
Universities are launching or expanding courses teaching data analytics, autonomous driving and computer programming to prospective miners, not just geology and geography. They are also funding research into new ways to process minerals and battle climate change. 
In the United States, the Colorado School of Mines has built an underground mine for students to train on new technologies. At the University of Kentucky, where Little studies, graduate students have begun researching new ways to extract metals from old electronics. 
In the United Kingdom, the University of Warwick has launched 50 skills training courses on electrification.
'COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY' 
In South Africa, the University of the Witwatersrand - which has trained industry titans such as former Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) Plc CEO Ivan Glasenberg - this year started offering a climate issues course to mining students to reflect rising interest in the topic, despite coal's import to the national economy.
The Western Australia School of Mines (WASM) is phasing out its petroleum engineering program and morphing it to focus on renewable energy.
""Our mission is to create thought leaders ... (who feel their) moral responsibility is to produce the material that we need to produce sustainable livelihoods,"" said WASM's Michael Hitch. 

That mission fueled Tom Benson's decision to join Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Corp and help build what the company hopes will be the largest U.S. lithium mine, which aims to be carbon-neutral. 
""If you want smart people to come into this industry, you need to show them that you have a commitment to sustainability,"" said Benson, who oversees the company's intern program and runs its exploration division. ""Mining needs to play an essential role in fighting climate change.""

1491,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 01:11PM ET</span>",Daimler Truck shares climb on Frankfurt market debut,"By Victoria Waldersee and Ilona Wissenbach
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Daimler  (OTC:DDAIF) Truck reached a valuation of 24.6 billion euros ($27.83 billion) by the market close on its first day of trading on Friday, leaving Daimler shareholders better off as a result of the long-awaited listing.
The truck and bus maker, the world's largest by revenue, saw its shares climb only slightly from the opening price of 28 euros over the course of the day, with Daimler's share price, adjusted for the spin-off, rising 2.87% to 74.25 euros.
The split was announced in February and pitched by the two companies as an opportunity to unlock value in both Daimler Truck and the owner of Mercedes-Benz passenger cars and vans.
Daimler AG (DE:DAIGn), soon to be renamed Mercedes-Benz AG, has kept 35% of Daimler Truck shares, while 65% were spun off. Shareholders in Daimler received one share in Daimler Truck for every two Daimler shares they owned.
""We are certain we will create value,"" Daimler CEO Ola Kaellenius said, speaking to an emptier-than-usual hall in Frankfurt as pandemic restrictions limited the number of attendees.
""Trucks and cars have different requirements. We are thus unleashing the full potential of both companies,"" he said. 
Daimler Truck is targeting double-digit profit margins across the business in 2025, up from an expected 6-8% in 2021, with a particular focus on boosting its lagging European sales.
If it hits the double-digit target, it will prioritise investment in future technologies over boosting profits further, Daimler Truck CEO Martin Daum said in a roundtable with journalists after the listing.
""The fact that we still exist is due to two things: because the company has always made money, and there were hard times in between, and secondly, because we always invested in the future,"" Daum said.
Daimler Truck is now the world's largest commercial vehicle maker by revenue, but its profit margins lag competitors like Traton's Scania and Volvo Group's Volvo Trucks.
Its performance is strongest in North America, where it reported an adjusted return on sales so far this year of 10.8%, compared to 7.2% in Asia and just 4.5% in Europe.
Its focus in coming years will be on boosting sales of electric trucks to 60% of all sales by 2030, including hydrogen and battery-electric models.

Meanwhile, Daimler will focus on positioning itself as the leader in the luxury electric vehicle market, Kaellenius said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Microsoft is set to secure unconditional EU antitrust approval for its $16 billion bid for artificial intelligence and speech technology company  Nuance Communications  (NASDAQ:NUAN), three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The latest tech deal, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s second biggest after its $26.2 billion LinkedIn purchase in 2016, follows heightened regulatory scrutiny of ""killer acquisitions"" whereby tech giants buy and shut down nascent start-ups and potential rivals.
Microsoft announced the Nuance deal, which would boost its presence in cloud services for healthcare, in April and it has already received regulatory approval in the United States and Australia, without remedies given.
Known for its pioneering speech technology and helping launch Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Siri virtual assistant, Nuance serves 77% of U.S. hospitals.
The European Commission, which is scheduled to decide on Microsoft's proposed Nuance purchase by Dec. 21, declined to comment. Microsoft declined to comment.
Microsoft has also been in preliminary discussions with Britain's CMA antitrust agency ahead of a formal request for approval of the Nuance deal, the sources said. The company's request is expected to be filed in January, they added.
A CMA spokesperson said it does not speculate on which cases it might investigate. Its website does not list Microsoft's proposed Nuance takeover as one it is looking at. 
The European Commission last month asked customers and competitors to list concerns about the deal, such as whether Microsoft could favour Nuance over its competitors or unfairly bundle its offerings, Reuters reported exclusively on Tuesday.

The outreach was the most extensive by an antitrust authority reviewing the deal, a source said. [L1N2SO0AR]

1493,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 01:01PM ET</span>",Lancia to mimic Mercedes in pursuit of a future inside Stellantis,"By Giulio Piovaccari
MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's Lancia will pursue profitability over volume to secure a long-term home in the 14 brand Stellantis stable and try to emulate German carmaker Mercedes to do so, its boss Luca Napolitano told Reuters. 
Lancia has in recent years retreated from a past littered with world rally titles and iconic cars such as the Delta to a single model, the Ypsilon, in just one market, Italy.
Some analysts have regarded Lancia as one of the least strategic brands within Stellantis, the world's fourth largest carmaker, which was formed this year by the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA.
However, Napolitano has presented a 10-year plan to Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares to relaunch Lancia, based on three new models: the new Ypsilon in 2024, both hybrid and battery electric, and a compact crossover expected in 2026 followed by a compact hatchback in 2028, both fully electric.
""Clearly volumes are important, but our targets are about profitability,"" Napolitano said in an interview on Friday.
Lancia, which alongside Alfa Romeo and DS was grouped in the pool of Stellantis brands cooperating in the premium market, needed to continue on this high-end path, he added.
""We still need to work and need to look at a benchmark... which for us is Mercedes,"" Napolitano said. ""I don't mean we want to fight against Mercedes, that would be naive, but that is an example of what we look at"". 
While Alfa Romeo and DS are global brands, Lancia's target is to move to Europe, initially targeting Germany and France, where electrification is moving faster, then adding countries including Spain, Belgium, Austria and the Nordics, he said.
""We initially target to make 25-30% of our sales abroad, to reach 50-50,"" he said. ""Our aggressive electrification strategy and our focus on market segments which are very strong in Europe will help us"".
'JUST THREE CLICKS'
Napolitano said that Lancia aimed to be the brand within Stellantis with the highest share of recycled materials.
""We would like to build cars with a significant portion of recycled materials,"" he said. 
Lancia's 10-year plan does not include going back to motor races and expanding outside Europe, as it needs credibility in the premium segment and to focus on priorities, Napolitano said.
""However, in the coming year, if things go well, why not trying to bring (Lancia models with) right-hand drive also in Japan, South Africa or Australia?"" he said.
Lancia's expansion plan in Europe will be based on a light network of dealers, only in the largest urban areas, helping it to keep costs down and boost profitability.

Napolitano said the target was to have around 100 Lancia selling points in Europe in around 60 cities, which would be shared with other Stellantis brands, while pushing online to reduce the amount of time potential buyers spend at dealers.
""My target is to make it possible to buy a car with just three clicks,"" Napolitano said.

Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi had been investigated by prosecutors in the case. But his name did not appear in the document closing the inquiry and judicial sources said the case against him would now be dropped as no proof had been found.
Lawyers for the people under investigation were not immediately available for comment.
Both Eni and CEO Descalzi declined to comment. 
The case revolves around allegations that between 2014 and 2019 some top managers at Eni tried to discredit witnesses in cases involving corruption in Nigeria and Algeria. Defendants in the two corruption cases in Nigeria have since been acquitted.
In June Italy's justice ministry ordered an inquiry into the conduct of two prosecutors in the Nigeria graft case. 
In the document, seen by Reuters, the prosecutors accuse five former and present Eni managers and a lawyer of criminal conspiracy aimed, among other things, at obstructing justice and slandering witnesses. 
The wrapping up of a preliminary investigation in Italy is usually the final step before prosecutors request a trial. 
SUSPECT OIL CARGO 
The document also said prosecutors had accused three oil-trading firms of trying to defraud Eni in a case revolving round a crude oil shipment ""of uncertain origin"". 

Sources previously told Reuters the shipment of the crude, purportedly from Iraq, had created panic within Eni over fears it could be, at least partially, Iranian. 
Handling Iranian oil would have breached sanctions the United States reimposed or extended after quitting a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers.

""Thinking of quitting my jobs & becoming an influencer full-time wdyt,"" Musk said in the tweet, without elaborating.
It was not immediately clear if Musk, a prolific user of the social media platform, was being serious about quitting his roles.
Musk, who is also the founder and CEO of rocket company SpaceX, and leads brain-chip startup Neuralink and infrastructure firm The Boring Company, said during a conference call in January that he expects to be the CEO of Tesla for ""several years."" 
""It would be nice to have a bit more free time on my hands as opposed to just working day and night, from when I wake up to when I go to sleep 7 days a week. Pretty intense.""
Last month, he asked his followers on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) whether he should sell 10% of his stake in the electric-car maker, to which the majority agreed. He has sold shares worth nearly $12 billion since.
The billionaire is known for his Twitter banter and lively interactions with followers which have in the past raised regulatory and corporate governance questions, lawyers have said. 
Musk was fined $20 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for tweets in 2018 and was required to step down as chairman.

Howard Fischer, a partner at law firm Moses & Singer, said he doubted Musk's latest tweets violated any rules because they were too vague.

So, to hedge one’s portfolio against a potential correction, we think inverse ETFs ProShares Short S&P500 (SH), ProShares Short QQQ (PSQ), ProShares Short Russell2000 (RWM), and ProShares Short Dow30 (DOG) could be ideal bets now. Read on.The S&P 500 has declined some 4% since hitting its all-time high last month, just before researchers in South Africa identified a new COVID-19 strain. The spread of the omicron variant, high inflation, and the Fed's decision to increase the pace of its tapering are giving investors pause, with the notion of a major market downturn on the minds of many. In addition, Harry Dent Jr., an American financial newsletter writer, has predicted that the biggest market crash will hit next year, with the biggest depression, with the economy not rebounding until 2024.
The National Institute's Autumn 2021 Global Economic Outlook predicted that annual U.S. inflation would rise from 1.2% in the fourth quarter of last year to 5.1% this year and moderate to 2.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Furthermore, CEOs across the economy agree that market volatility will remain a primary challenge even next year.
Given the rising market uncertainties, we think one could add inverse ETFs ProShares Short S&P500 (SH), ProShares Short QQQ (PSQ), ProShares Short Russell2000 (RWM), and ProShares Short Dow30 (DOG) to one's portfolio. Inverse ETFs help hedge against market downturns by moving in the opposite direction.

However, concerns about the Fed's decision to increase interest rates, high inflation, and the discovery of the COVID-19 omicron variant could end the tech stock party next year. Therefore, we believe investors should be cautious about betting on popular tech stocks DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) and Asana (ASAN), which have both lost more than 45% in price over the past month. Let’s discuss.Although the tech stocks led the markets higher last week, inflation could end tech stocks' rally next year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite dipped after a three-day winning streak and ended the regular trading session lower yesterday. Even mega-cap tech shares caused U.S. stocks to tumble last week due to investor concerns over the COVID-19 omicron variant.
Furthermore, the Fed is expected to consider speeding up the pace of its tapering to $30 billion per month at its December meeting. This might give the Fed the flexibility to raise interest rates soon, which in turn could increase the interest expense borne by tech companies, reducing their future earnings.
Given this backdrop, we think investors should take care regarding betting on popular tech stocks DocuSign, Inc. (DOCU) and Asana, Inc. (ASAN), which have plunged more than 45% in price over the past month.

First, a recap of its earnings release. The company reported earnings per share of $7.81 on revenue of $7.41 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $7.74 on revenue of $7.35 billion.
On top of that, Broadcom said it sees revenue in the first quarter coming in around $7.6 billion, beating the $7.25 billion consensus.

Investing.com – Costco stock (NASDAQ:COST) traded 6% higher Friday after the company’s first-quarter results easily topped estimates and the retailer said it is doing all it can to keep its shelves stocked in the holiday season.  
According to Bloomberg, Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said he is pleased with the company’s ability to keep its shelves stocked despite shipping snarls. He did say some inventory may not be able to make it before Christmas.
Factory shutdowns, shipping delays, congestion at ports, the unavailability of truck drivers and higher staff and other costs have hurt practically every retailer.
In Costco’s case, while it has tried to overcome those challenges, it has also recently benefited from people giving a break to online shopping and returning to stores to pick up their stuff.
Total revenue in the first quarter ended November 21 rose around 17%, to over $50 billion. This included net sales and membership fees.
Comparable sales, excluding the impact of fuel and currency fluctuations, jumped 10% in the quarter.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - On the day that shareholders of Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) PLC voted to move the company's headquarters to London from The Hague, the company sent a letter to the Dutch prime minister to soften the blow.
Signed by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden, the letter said Shell's departure had been ""a difficult message for us to announce,"" given the company had more than a century of history.
But the letter to Prime Minister Mark Rutte outlined the many projects and activities Shell will continue in the Netherlands, including retaining 8,500 employees, and the division-level management of Shell's upstream (production), renewable energy and projects & technology divisions.
Shell has said its shift to Britain would mean just nine staff, including CEO Van Beurden, would leave the Netherlands.
""In this letter, we would like to affirm our commitment to the Netherlands,"" Van Beurden, who is Dutch, wrote. ""Shell has the ambition to be, both through its own investments and through cooperation with others, one of the largest drivers of the energy transition in the Netherlands.""
Shell's plans include helping to build the 750MW Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind project, scheduled for completion in 2023, and the company is in talks over a hydrogen production facility at its Pernis refinery in Rotterdam, Europe's largest.
More than 99% of Shell shareholders voted on Friday to approve the move to London. The company's board must meet once more to make a final decision, with the changeover likely taking place in early 2022.

But the outcome seems a foregone conclusion: On Nov. 30 Van Beurden listed his estate in Wassenaar, a posh suburb of The Hague, for sale with an asking price of 6.5 million euros ($7.35 million).

1504,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 12:18PM ET</span>",Santander ordered to pay Orcel $76 million after losing court battle,"By Jesús Aguado and Emma Pinedo
MADRID (Reuters) - A Madrid court has ordered Santander to pay Italian banker Andrea Orcel 67.8 million euros ($76.42 million) after it withdrew its offer to make him CEO, a pricey twist in an employment dispute that has captivated the world of high finance. The row between Orcel and Santander chairman Ana Botin ruptured a close professional bond – Orcel had previously been Botin's investment bank consigliere – and put Europe's star dealmaker abruptly out of a job.
Orcel and Botin ended up in court after Spain's largest bank dropped its plans to make the former UBS investment banker its CEO as a result of a disagreement over his pay. Orcel had already left UBS to prepare for the new role.
The court said Santander's job offer letter to Orcel was a binding contract. It also referenced a few ""particularly eloquent"" tweets by Botin, a TV interview and a video in which she said that Orcel's appointment would be ""effective from the beginning of 2019"".
Those elements helped establish that the document constituted a ""valid and perfect contract"" which was ""unilaterally and arbitrarily"" rescinded by Santander, Judge Javier Sanchez Beltran said in the ruling.
""The situation created by  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) caused Mr Orcel clear moral damage,"" the ruling, dated Dec. 9 but released on Friday, said.
Appeals could delay a final ruling for another one or two years if legal proceedings reach Spain's Supreme Court, several court sources said.
A spokesperson for Santander said the bank would appeal the ruling. It has 20 days to do so. 
""The Board of Santander is confident we will be successful on appeal,"" the spokesperson said.
Orcel's legal team and a spokesperson for the Italian banker declined to comment.
The court ruling caps a successful week for Orcel, who is now CEO of UniCredit. He won plaudits on Thursday when he unveiled a new strategy for the Italian bank, pledging to return 16 billion euros to investors.
But unions on Friday said that UniCredit was set to cut 950 full-time positions.
REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE
The court said Santander has to pay Orcel 17 million euros for a sign-in bonus, 35 million euros for a buyout clause, 5.8 million euros for two years' salary and 10 million euros for moral and reputational damage, plus interest.
Some industry insiders considered the ruling a blow for Botin and the bank as she had personally courted Orcel for the role over the summer of 2018.
""It will be a blow for Santander but any reputational damage to Botin or the bank itself is expected to fade over time as the amount won't really hit a bank with such a capacity to generate billions in profit,"" Enrique Quemada, CEO of Spanish investment bank ONEtoONE, told Reuters when asked to comment on the ruling.
Quemada and lawyers said that the compensation Orcel was entitled to was in line with pay packages for top jobs in the industry.
""In a civil court, such an amount is not unheard of. The amount seems outrageous but he seems to be the Lionel Messi of banking,"" said Eduardo Alonso, lawyer with Spanish firm A&M Asociados.
The case revolved around whether a four-page offer letter to Orcel in September 2018 was a binding contract or a non-binding initial offer, as Botin asserted in the first session of the Madrid court hearing in May.
In January 2019, Santander said the bank could not meet Orcel's pay demands, which included covering up to 35 million euros of a 55 million euro compensation package he was due to receive in future years from UBS.
Orcel originally sought as much as 112 million euros from Santander for breach of contract and damage to his career for the bank's sudden U-turn.
But in May he dropped the part of his legal claim that would require the Spanish bank to hire him. This was after he was appointed UniCredit CEO.
He also reduced his demand to between 66 to 76 million euros, according to sources close to the matter, a court document and Santander's lawyer.
At the hearing in May, Botin and Orcel, who himself had not been called to testify, sat just a few seats apart.
Botin testified that Orcel had also breached the terms of the offer letter, which stated he would make his best efforts to reduce the amount of deferred compensation Santander owed him.
She said he had refused to deduct 13.7 million euros he was to receive as a bonus from UBS for work done in 2018 from the sum owed him. 
But on Friday, the court said that it could not be considered as proven that Orcel did not make his best efforts to try to reduce the buyout.

""Mr Orcel's best efforts are considered beyond doubt,"" the court said in its 24-page ruling.

(Reuters) -European stocks fell on Friday on nervousness around the Omicron COVID-19 variant, while U.S. inflation reading coming in broadly in line with expectations did little to allay uncertainty around U.S. monetary policy. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 slipped 0.3%, down for third straight session on worries that measures to curb the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant could hit economic recovery. 
But a strong two-day gain at the beginning of the week saw the index post best weekly gain since March, up 2.8%.
Data on Friday showed U.S. annual consumer prices rose further to 6.8% - the biggest year-on-year rise since June 1982 and followed a 6.2% advance in October.
""It looks to be a subdued end to the week... as stocks pause for breath following the big gains in the first half of the week,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.
""U.S. CPI came in line with expectations, but prices continue to rise, meaning that while the pressure on the Fed to raise rates hasn't increased much as a result of today's data, it doesn't really lessen it either."" 
On the contrary, news that the European Central Bank is widely considering a temporary increase to its bond purchase plan at a policy meeting next week was seen as a dovish step.
Technology and retail were the top decliners in Europe on Friday.
""We think the path for equities is lower over the next 12 months,"" said Milla Savova, European equity strategist at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
""Real bond yields will come up from record lows as the Fed turns more hawkish and the market starts to price in a sharper-than-expected Fed hiking cycle."" 
Auto stocks were led higher by  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) which rose 2.9% after spun-off Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) Truck climbed in its market debut on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Gains for the sector came even as data showed China's auto sales dropped 9.1% in November, marking their seventh consecutive monthly fall, as a prolonged global shortage of semiconductors disrupted production.
Tobacco group Swedish Match jumped 7.2% after the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. Democrats dropped a proposed vaping tax that would have taxed e-cigarettes like regular ones.

Food delivery companies Deliveroo and Just Eat Takeaway slipped 2.4% and 3.2% respectively, adding to losses in the past week on worries that a European Commission ruling on gig economy drivers would hurt profits.

HELSINKI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Finland has chosen U.S. defence giant  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT)'s F-35 fighters to replace ageing F/A-18 combat jets and plans to order 64 planes with weapons systems in a $9.4 billion deal, the government said on Friday.
Lockheed Martin competed in a tender for the deal with Sweden's Saab, U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA), France's Dassault and Britain's BAE Systems (OTC:BAESF).
The procurement from Lockheed, including weapons as well as service and maintenance until 2030, is estimated to cost 8.378 billion euros ($9.44 billion), the government said.
The construction of hangars and other equipment will add a further 777 million euros, and 824 million euros will be reserved for the final optimised weapons package and to control future contract amendments, it added.
""When comparing military performance, the F-35 best met our needs,"" Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen told a news conference.
Military planemakers have been vying for the deal since late 2015, when the Finnish defence ministry began the search for a new jet to replace Finland's old Hornet fighter bought in 1992 from McDonnell Douglas, now part of Boeing.
Finland is the 14th nation to opt for the F-35. It will begin phasing in the F-35 from 2027 onwards, said Airforce Commander Pasi Jokinen.
The choice strengthens the small Nordic nation's defence cooperation with its allies, most significantly the United States and Norway, said researcher Charly Salonius-Pasternak at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.
""Finland and Norway already train together in the north so it will be a political decision to determine what intelligence is shared and when,"" he told Reuters, referring to the potential for the jets to share data in real time.
Unlike Norway, Finland is not a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) but it has forged stronger ties with the organisation in recent years and chosen military equipment compatible with NATO members. 
In 2014 Finland and Sweden, which is also not a NATO member, signed an agreement to train together and allow NATO assistance in crisis situations.
""The F-35 will provide Finnish industries unique digital capabilities that leverage 5th generation engineering and manufacturing,"" said Bridget Lauderdale, Lockheed Martin's vice president and general manager of the F-35 programme.
""The production work will continue for more than 20 years, and the F-35 sustainment work will continue into the 2070s,"" Lauderdale said in a statement.
Rival jetmakers expressed their disappointment with Finland's decision with Saab Chief Executive Micael Johansson saying he was somewhat surprised the F-35 had fallen within budget.
France's Dassault said said the choice of a U.S. aircraft was regrettable.
""Once again, we notice and regret an American preference prevailing in Europe,"" Dassault said in a statement.
Boeing said it still sees significant international interest in its F/A-18 Block III Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler.
Sweden, a neighbour to Finland and home to Gripen maker Saab, said it regretted the outcome while also respecting the decision.
""Our excellent defence cooperation will of course continue. Finland will continue to be our closest security and defence policy partner,"" Sweden's Ministry of Defence said in a statement.
Reuters reported earlier on Friday that Lockheed Martin was set to win the contract.

""Due to the timing of regular and deferred maintenance events, the supply of labor, and fluctuating prices in the supply chain, exiting Covid is proving to be more challenging than entering it,"" said Ornstein.
He added that while Mesa has managed better than most major and regional airlines, it was not immune to the challenges and they are now expecting the issues currently impacting costs to spill over into the next two quarters.
As expected, analysts moved to adjust their price targets on Mesa in reaction to the news, with Raymond James cutting it to $12.50 (though from $13) and Cowen slashing their target to $7 from $12.50. 
Deutsche Bank moved to downgrade the stock to Hold from Buy, also cutting its price target to $7 from $15. Analyst Michael Linenberg said the company is facing elevated cost pressures over the next two quarters from training/staffing due to a higher turnover and increased maintenance costs resulting from supply chain challenges."

Marcolin will also buy back the 10% stake LVMH acquired in the firm when Thelios was founded in 2017, the companies said in a joint statement.
The move reflects interest in European luxury companies in bulking up and tightnening their grip on production capacity, as business bounces back strongly from pandemic disruptions following a resumption in social activities. 

French rival  Kering  (PA:PRTP) also recently reinforced its eyewear business, announcing plans to purchase upscale Danish label Lindberg in July. The Gucci owner began building an in-house eyewear division in 2014, reaching almost 600 million euros ($678.42 million) in wholesale revenues in 2019.

MADRID (Reuters) -Spain's top soccer clubs have approved a 1.994 billion euro investment from private equity fund CVC Capital Partners in the first deal of its kind in Europe, though four clubs - including Barcelona and Real Madrid - opted out.
On Friday 37 clubs voted in favour of the ""LaLiga Boost"" deal that buys CVC an 8.2% stake in a new company that will get revenues from LaLiga broadcasting and sponsorship rights.
Real Madrid, Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Ibiza voted against the deal, one source close to the negotiations told Reuters. There was no immediate official statement from those clubs or details on their next moves.
At least 32 of the 42 teams from the Spanish first and second divisions needed to back the plan. On top of the four objections, one other club abstained from voting, the source said, without naming the club.
LaLiga had said the deal would be worth 2.7 billion euros when it was first unveiled in August. The lower 1.994 billion euro figure announced on Friday reflected the opt-outs and will be shared among the participating clubs and paid over a three-year period, the league said.
It marks the first investment agreement from a private equity firm in a major European League.
""This is a new milestone in the history of LaLiga and its clubs,"" LaLiga president Javier Tebas said. ""It allow us to continue our transformation towards a global digital entertainment company, improving the competition and enhancing the fan experience.""
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) will contribute with a portion of the funds that CVC will invest in the Spanish football league and recover over 50 years, sources from LaLiga and the fund have said.
The clubs are committed to allocate 70% of the funds to investments linked to new infrastructure and modernization projects. Up to 15% can be used to sign players, with the remaining 15% for reducing debt.
The deal looked like it was at risk of unravelling as Barcelona, Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao last week proposed an alternative proposal which would see JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and HSBC jointly lend 2 billion euros in exchange for a fixed annual payment of 115 million euros for 25 years, a document seen by Reuters showed.
A source close to Real Madrid told Reuters the club will begin legal action against La Liga as they threatened when they announced their objection in August. The objecting clubs will not take any share of the CVC investment, though they will continue to receive their allocated share of TV rights money, LaLIGa said.
Barcelona and Real Madrid, who have yet to comment on the deal, were among the driving forces behind the failed plan to launch a breakaway European Super League earlier this year and vowed to continue to set it up after a Madrid court ruled against UEFA.
It is the third time CVC has tried to invest in a top European league, after separate plans with Italy's Serie A and Germany's Bundesliga to sell some media rights to it were scrapped earlier this year.
CVC is also lining up preliminary bids for a stake in the French football league's media rights business, a source told Reuters this week.

CVC has invested in Formula 1, Moto GP and rugby and is reported by Sky News to be behind a new commercial venture that is preparing to merge the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and Women's Tennis Association (WTA).

Investing.com – Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) stock fell 5% Friday on a Bloomberg report that Yum! Brands-owned Taco Bell (NYSE:YUM) has canceled a planned test of a product from the company.
The report said Taco was dissatisfied with the samples. Beyond Meat terminated two employees from the team that made the product, which was designed to mimic grilled meat known as carne asada, it said.
Another test of a Beyond Meat product could still happen, according to the report.
In a statement to Investing.com, Taco Bell disputed the Bloomberg account. “The test between Taco Bell and Beyond Meat was not canceled.  Taco Bell and Beyond Meat are actively still working together to create a plant-based protein that’s completely innovative to the national QSR (quick serve restaurant) space,” the company said.
Beyond Meat has had a tough time bringing its products to market, with delays marring several of them. That has reflected in its stock price. It’s down almost 50% in a year that has seen indices make new highs.
The company told Bloomberg it has “commercialized and introduced more than a dozen retail and foodservice products in the U.S. and abroad” since March 2020.

Investing.com —  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) shares fell 12% on Friday after the company reported data from its phase 1 study of its seasonal flu vaccine candidate, mRNA-1010.
The data showed that the shot successfully boosted titers against all four strains in older and younger adults, even at the lowest dose, and no significant safety concerns were observed.
However, while the drug maker described the results as positive, the data showed that it may not be as strong as existing shots.
Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison weighed in on the data, stating it is ""undifferentiated.""
""We believe the market was looking for data which supported clearly better efficacy, such that today's results are likely to pressure MRNA,"" added Harrison.
Regardless, Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel was upbeat, saying: ""It is encouraging to see that participants in the study who received the 50 µg dose, including older adults, achieved robust increases in geometric mean antibody titers against H1N1 and H3N2, the strains responsible for the vast majority of morbidity and mortality in this age group. We believe our mRNA platform is well-positioned to address the significant unmet need in seasonal flu.""
With the company benefitting from its Covid-19 vaccine rollout and the mRNA technology behind it, Moderna is looking to create vaccine shots outside of just Covid-19. The company told investors in September that it is working on developing a single vaccine that combines both the Covid-19 booster and its potential flu shot."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened Friday markedly higher, shrugging off any concerns about a faster tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve to rein in raging inflation. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT). the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 153 points, or 0.4% at 35,907 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3%. 
Earlier, the Bureau of Labor Statistics had said the annual rate of inflation rose to its highest level in nearly 40 years in November, hitting 6.8%. While that was distorted to a degree by upheavals in prices a year ago due to the pandemic, the core rate -- which strips out more volatile food and energy prices - also hit a 30-year high of 4.9%. The headline rate rose by 0.8% on the month and the core rate by 0.5%, both chunky increases that suggest that companies are still able to pass on higher costs to their customers more or less at will. 
""Airfares and hotel room rates came roaring back,"" said Grant Thornton Chief Economist Diane Swonk via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""This reflects the surge in holiday travel."" She also pointed to the relative lack of Black Friday discounts this year which hit home in annual price comparisons with last year's holiday season. Apparel retailers in particular had warned in their third-quarter numbers that they were suffering shortages of product due to long factory closures in Asia in the summer because of Covid-19.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note to clients that while headline inflation may have peaked (wholesale gasoline prices are down some 15% from their October peaks) but warned that core inflation has further to rise and may yet hit 7% by February. He pointed to a succession of solid increases in rents that are pushing the shelter part of the price index higher.
Among individual movers, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) stood out with a 17% gain after a strong quarterly update after the bell on Thursday, while chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), up 9.4%, and wholesaler Costco (NASDAQ:COST),up 3.8%, also both profited from robust quarterly numbers.
Going in the other direction was Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) stock, which fell 8.5% after the company reported a second straight disappointment on the bottom line, failing to reduce its net loss as hoped. New customer numbers also disappointed as the pandemic-era pet boom began to wane.
Elsewhere,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) fell heavily again, after disclosing early stage trial data for its new mRNA-based flu vaccine that indicated it would have no real competitive edge over existing flu vaccines. Moderna stock fell 9.5% to its lowest in nearly a month.  Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, meanwhile, fell another 1.4% against the backdrop of further selling by CEO Elon Musk. Musk also added a seemingly tongue-in-cheek threat to stand down from the company to his Twitter feed on Thursday."

Production of trains in Germany, where Alstom has its biggest workforce, is to be shrunk and partly moved abroad, the spokesperson said on Friday, confirming comments by labour union IG Metall.

Alstom, which makes trains and signalling systems for urban and regional rail networks, said some plants in Germany were structurally underutilised and that it aimed to integrate production more closely into its European network.
It aims to carry out the redundancies in a socially responsible manner, via internal transfers, re-training, early retirement or severance packages, it said.

IG Metall, which opposes Alstom's plans to cut jobs, said the plan would particularly affect sites in eastern Germany, with 350 to 450 of the job cuts to hit Hennigsdorf outside Berlin and 300 to 400 Goerlitz.
The new jobs would be primarily in Mannheim and Braunschweig in western Germany as well as in Berlin. Alstom's site in Kassel will not be affected, it said.

Wall Street analysts expect the shares of these companies to gain more than 45% in price in the coming months. So, read on.DiDi Global Inc.’s (DIDI) sudden decision to delist from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) less than six months after its listing surprised the market. The company’s decision highlights the deteriorating United States-China relationship.
Based in Shanghai, China, electric vehicle (EV) maker NIO Inc. (NIO) is known as the ‘Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) of China.’ The company delivered 10,878 vehicles in November 2021, representing a 105.6% year-over-year rise. Also, its revenues for the third quarter, ended September 30, 2021, increased 116.6% year-over-year to RMB9.80 billion ($1.54 billion), while its gross profit came in at RMB1.99 billion ($313.24 million), up 240.3% year-over-year. However, the stock has declined 16.2% in price over the past month and 30.1% year-to-date to close yesterday’s trading session at $34.05. NIO investors were spooked by fears of more delistings in the future. Furthermore, analysts expect its EPS to remain negative this year and next year. In terms of forward EV/S and P/S, NIO’s respective 9.35x and 9.64x are higher than the 1.48x and 1.20x industry averages. So, the stock looks overvalued, and we think it could be wise to avoid it now.
However, the EV industry is expected to grow significantly, with governments taking initiatives to transition their countries to a sustainable energy-driven future. According to a report by Valuates Reports, the global electric car market is expected to reach $476.73 billion by 2027, growing at a 25.3% CAGR. So, instead of betting on NIO, we think it could be wise to add the following domestic EV stocks to one watch list: Fisker Inc. (FSR), Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (FFIE), and Hyzon Motors Inc. (HYZN). They are likely to be less vulnerable to Chinese authorities’ regulations. In addition, Wall Street analysts expect their shears to soar more than 45% in price in the near term.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy is considering offering compensation to firms penalised by the use of its anti-takeover powers, two government officials said, in a move intended to reduce the risk of legal disputes.
Prime Minister Mario Draghi has repeatedly used the so-called ""golden powers"" since he came to office in February to prevent Chinese investors buying controlling stakes in companies deemed strategically important.
Following one of these cases, LPE, a Milan-based producer of semi-conductor equipment, appealed to an administrative court after the government in April prevented it from being acquired by Chinese company Shenzhen Invenland Holdings Co. Ltd.
The idea of offering financial redress is aimed at limiting recourse to the courts and helping the government defend itself against allegations it is depriving shareholders of their rights, said the sources, who asked not to be named.
The proposal, which has yet to be finalised, was tabled by Industry Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti, one of the sources said.
The anti-takeover legislation is normally used to ward off undesired bids in industries such as telecoms, semiconductors, banking and energy.
Italy has used it five times since the golden powers were introduced in 2012. Four of these episodes beat away Chinese bids and three have been under Draghi's ten-month old government.
The first hearing in LPE's case is scheduled for July 2022, one source said, adding Shenzhen would participate as a co-plaintiff.
Another court case could arise from Draghi's most recent use of the golden powers in November, a third source said.
This episode saw Rome block an attempted joint venture between Zhejiang Jingsheng Mechanical and the Hong Kong arm of Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) to buy the U.S.-based group's screen printing equipment business in Italy.

The source said Applied Materials' Italian unit may launch action against the government, as it deems the deal important for increasing its market share in China.
LPE declined to comment, while Applied Materials said it would not comment on talks with regulatory authorities.

Investing.com – Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) stock slumped 9% in Friday’s premarket trading after the company reported wider-than-expected losses while  sales matched estimates for the third quarter.
Adding to the woes was the company’s cut in annual revenue guidance at the top end, which is now sees at $8.9 billion, down from September’s $9 billion forecast. The guidance now matches its lower-range forecast of $8.9 billion.
Several brokerages including JPMorgan, Barclays and Wells Fargo lowered their price targets for the stock. UBS sees the stock hitting $46, down from its previous target of $71.
The company blamed supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and higher inflation for its lackluster earnings that, at around $32 million, were just a tad lower than the same quarter last year. Share-based compensation to staff also contributed to the losses.
The company has previously said that part-time shifts to better optimize interval-level labor forecasting and provide more flexibility to staff is one of the ways it has adopted to overcome manpower shortage.

Meanwhile, U.S. equity funds saw net inflows of $248.81 billion after two years of outflows.
The higher inflows into U.S. bond funds, despite a rally in equities, highlights an investor preference for safety and stable returns during the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic.

U.S. taxable bond funds drew a record $465.89 billion in net buying while municipal bond funds secured purchases of $96.5 billion.

1532,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 08:47AM ET</span>","China's chip conglomerate Unigroup gets state-backed investors, Alibaba out of deal","By Josh Horwitz
(Reuters) -A consortium led by Beijing Jianguang Asset Management and Wise Road Capital will become a strategic investor in Chinese chip conglomerate Tsinghua Unigroup, the company said on Friday.
The deal, which is pending court approval, winds down a long-gestating restructuring process for the beleaguered Tsinghua Unigroup, which was once poised to be China's chip champion but later found itself saddled with debt.
It is also a blow for  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Co Ltd, which was competing with state-backed Jianguang Asset Management to purchase the company in order to bolster its fledgling chip division.
The size of the investment was not disclosed in Unigroup's statement. A Unigroup spokesperson referred queries to the company statement.
Tsinghua Unigroup was originally 51% owned by China's prestigious Tsinghua university and led by former real estate magnate Zhao Weiguo.
Under Zhao, Unigroup invested aggressively in various chip companies, in tandem with a government push to boost China's semiconductor industry.
Yet few of those bets turned out successful, which caused the company to cross-default on onshore and offshore bonds worth about $3.6 billion by the end of 2020. The following year it received a court order calling for its restructuring.
In July, Reuters reported that Alibaba and Jianguang Asset Management, also known as JAC Capital, were among a number of firms competing to purchase Unisplendour, one of the main revenue generating units under the Unigroup umbrella.
Unigroup also has stakes in Unisoc, a maker of smartphone application processor chips, and Yangtze Memory Technology Company, a maker of flash memory. 
DATA TROUBLE
JAC is a private equity firm indirectly owned by China's sovereign wealth fund under the state council.
According to public filings, the firm indirectly controls Wise Road Capital, a fund which brokered a number of cross-border deals for China's chip sector.
A company source briefed on the deal said Alibaba was the frontrunner to purchase Unigroup, and hoped to use it to bolster its own cloud computing and chip division.
However, last minute concerns about data security arose after Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing was hit with an unexpected regulatory probe in Beijing for allegedly violating data privacy laws, just days after it listed in New York.
Alibaba's status as a U.S.-listed company caused a working group managing Unigroup's restructuring to ultimately favor JAC.

""The working group was concerned that if Alibaba was picked, some fundamental information about chips would have to be disclosed to the U.S. government and this info would be linked to national security,"" the source said.
Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

1533,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>",U.S. Consumer Prices Climb at Fastest Annual Rate Since 1982,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer prices rose last month at the fastest annual pace in nearly 40 years, magnifying how rapid and persistent inflation is eroding paychecks and increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten policy.
The consumer price index increased 6.8% from November 2020, according to Labor Department data released Friday. The widely followed inflation gauge rose 0.8% from October, exceeding forecasts and extending a trend of sizable increases that began earlier this year.
The median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 6.8% annual gain and a 0.7% advance in the monthly measure.
The increase in the CPI reflected broad advances in most categories.
The data reinforce expectations the Fed will accelerate the wind down of its bond-buying program at the central bank’s final meeting of the year next week. Central banks -- and politicians -- around the world have come under increasing pressure to address rising inflation as workers spend more at the grocery store and the gas pump.
A faster tapering would open the door for the Fed to begin increasing interest rates, a move markets now expect by the middle of next year. Annual CPI increases are anticipated to hover near 7% into 2022.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, so-called core prices rose 0.5% from the prior month. The core CPI was up 4.9% from a year earlier, a fresh 30-year high.

However, its shares have lost more than 30% in price since hitting their 52-week high of $2.14 on Nov. 10. So, is it wise to buy the dip in the stock despite falling uranium prices? Read on.Based in Toronto, Canada, uranium exploration and development company Denison Mines Corp. (DNN) is known primarily for its flagship project, its 95% owned Wheeler River uranium project. The company also acquired a 50% ownership stake in JCU (Canada) Exploration Company on August 3, 2021. For the third quarter, ended September 30, 2021, DNN’s revenue increased 247.8% year-over-year to CAD9.54 million ($7.52 million), while its net income came in at CAD32.87 million ($25.91 million) compared to a CAD5.48 million ($4.32 million) loss in the year-ago period.
Investors’ optimism surrounding soaring uranium prices helped DNN’s shares hit their 52-week high of $2.14 on November 10. However, according to Trading Economics data, uranium futures fell to around $46 per pound, declining from their $48.10 two-week high reached on November 15. The stock has lost 29.7% in price over the past month to close yesterday’s trading session at $1.49. It is currently trading 30.4% below its 52-week high.
DNN’s toll milling operation at McClean Lake was suspended during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2020 and again during the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter of 2021 due to the suspension of mining at the Cigar Lake mine because of the COVID-19 pandemic. So, amid rising COVID-29 delta variant cases in Canada and omicron variant fears, DNN’s near-term prospects look bleak.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Spinning off  Daimler  (OTC:DDAIF) Truck has already proven a solid move to unlock value for Daimler AG (DE:DAIGn) shareholders, CEO Ola Kaellenius said on Friday, with the execution of its electrification strategy the next step. 
Speaking hours after the luxury carmaker's truck and bus division was listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Kaellenius said Daimler shares had already benefited from the decision and would continue to do so.
""With a very robust first price of the Truck side today I think that part of the equation has now been fulfilled,"" Kaellenius said.
""Now it's all about executing our strategies and unlocking even more value in these two shares in years to come.""
Daimler shares, up 33% since the spin-off was first announced in February this year, were 3.51% higher by 1252 GMT. Daimler Truck shares were at 28.7 euros compared to a debut price of 28 euros. 
Sky-high stock market valuations of electric-only players like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Rivian have placed pressure on traditional automakers to prove their worth to shareholders amid growing consumer and regulatory pressure to lower emissions.
Soon to be renamed Mercedes-Benz AG, Daimler's focus is now squarely on leading the premium electric vehicle market and developing its software capabilities, with Kaellenius describing it as a ""blend of a luxury car and a tech company.""
The carmaker is hiring 3,000 engineers globally to develop its own operating system for electric-only vehicles, expected to hit the market from 2024. 
Keeping software close to the business was a strategically important, Kaellenius said. 
On other aspects of the electric vehicle value chain such as batteries and charging networks, the carmaker operates largely through a number of joint ventures with other firms including BMW, Stellantis and others.

Geographic diversity was key in areas such as battery production, the CEO said when asked whether the company would in the long-term seek to concentrate battery production in Europe.
A flexible supply chain across the board would remain key into 2022 in particular to minimise the impact of the continuing semiconductor shortage, Kaellenius said, after the carmaker reported passenger car sales more than 20% below last year's levels in October and November.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Didi Global plans to hire Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) for its planned Hong Kong listing and U.S. delisting, said three sources with knowledge of the matter, as it moves to withdraw from the New York exchange after just five months. 
Didi, which made its debut in New York on June 30 after raising $4.4 billion via an initial public offering (IPO), said last week that it plans to delist from the U.S. bourse and pursue a Hong Kong listing.
The company is under pressure from Beijing to quit the New York Stock Exchange after running foul of Chinese authorities by pushing ahead with its IPO despite being asked to put it on hold while a review of its data practices was conducted. 
Two sources said Didi was looking to appoint Goldman to work on the Hong Kong listing before embarking on the New York delisting. A separate source said Didi was also in talks with other investment banks including some Chinese banks.
Given the short time since its New York debut, Didi will have to apply for a dual-primary listing in Hong Kong, instead of a secondary one which requires at least two financial years of good regulatory compliance on another qualifying exchange.
The company, sometimes dubbed the Uber (NYSE:UBER) of China, has also asked the Wall Street investment bank to come up with proposals on how a Hong Kong listing and New York delisting would work, said two of the sources. 
Didi did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Goldman declined to comment. The sources were not authorised to talk to the media and therefore declined to be identified. 
Goldman was one of the main underwriters of Didi's New York IPO, along with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan. 

Reuters reported last week, citing a source with knowledge of the matter, that Didi aims to complete the Hong Kong listing as soon as in the next three months, and delist from New York by June 2022. 
Didi's shares closed at $6.66 on Thursday, more than 50% below their launch price.

1539,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 08:01AM ET</span>","Deal or no deal, insurance rates soar to cover M&A boom","By Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - The cost of insurance to cover problems involving M&A has nearly doubled in just two years, underwriters and brokers said, after an explosion of global dealmaking during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Potential buyers take out insurance to protect against issues such as misrepresentation by a target of its performance or order book, while sellers buy cover to ensure a clean exit.
After years of falling rates due to tough competition, 2021 was the first in which M&A insurance rates have risen since the market began more than two decades ago, Andrew Johnson, director of M&A at broker Paragon, said. 
Some in the insurance industry said a lack of due diligence has led to a spike in claims, while the boom in mergers and acquisitions has translated into steeply higher premiums.
""From August/September last year, we saw incredible deal volumes, that has encouraged insurers to raise rates,"" said James Swan, a partner at insurance broker McGill and Partners.
Global M&A activity hit a record $4.33 trillion in the first nine months of 2021, leaping 97% from $2.2 trillion scored in the first nine months of a pandemic-hit 2020, as firms positioned themselves for life after COVID.
The M&A insurance market has risen to more than $5 billion from less than $3 billion a year ago, Swan said, adding that a contract he was working on in Europe was priced at around 1.9% of the cover available, up from around 1% a couple of years ago.
Caroline Rowlands, an executive director at insurance broker Howden, said rates for some deals in Britain had risen to 1.5% of the cover provided, from 1% previously.
And William Monat, global head of transactional liability at insurer Mosaic, said rates for some U.S. deals had risen to around 4% of cover from below 3% previously. 
CUTTING CORNERS?
Where M&A insurance had previously been bought predominantly by private equity firms, corporates were increasing the amount of cover they buy, industry sources say. 
And COVID led to claims coming through sooner, said Rowan Bamford, president of Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA) Transactions Solutions.
""With the pandemic and issues round doing proper diligence on businesses, perhaps there's been some corner-cutting on process,"" he said, adding that buyers were not able to visit businesses easily due to restrictions, while competition for deals may have encouraged haste.
The time to complete due diligence was sometimes compressed by more than half, Liberty said in a recent report.
Adrian Furlonge, partner at Hemsley Wynne Furlonge, said that on a couple of M&A deals, the broker had received notification of a possible claim very soon after closing, suggesting there may have been insufficient research in advance.
""Everybody has been doing too much in too small a timeframe"", Furlonge said.

Manufacturing and healthcare were among sectors which had seen a large number of claims, industry sources said, with workforce and supply chain problems meaning companies could not always produce what they had promised. 
Most M&A insurance disputes are settled behind closed doors and only become public if arbitration fails. But that has not yet arisen for claims since the pandemic began, sources said.

1540,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 07:45AM ET</span>",Factbox-Santander vs Andrea Orcel: how did things go sour?,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish bank Santander (MC:SAN) has been ordered by a Madrid court to pay Italian banker Andrea Orcel 67.8 million euros ($76.40 million) over a withdrawn offer to make him chief executive. 
The ruling came more than three years after Santander announced plans to make Orcel, one of Europe's best-known investment bankers and now chief executive of Italy's UniCredit, CEO. 
Here are the main points on how things turned sour:
WHEN DID IT BEGIN?
On Sept. 25, 2018, Santander announced the appointment of Italian banker Andrea Orcel as its new chief executive officer to replace Jose Antonio Alvarez and said the appointment was expected to be effective in early 2019 following regulatory approval. 
Santander said Orcel would bring a deep understanding of retail and commercial banking, as well as a strong track record in managing diverse teams, and would help build a global digital platform.
FIRST REACTIONS
Analysts at the time said they struggled to understand why Orcel, who had been the head of UBS Group's investment banking business since 2014 and a member of the bank's executive board since 2012, would become the CEO of a mostly retail bank.
His appointment immediately raised questions about a potential change in Santander's strategy. 
Chairman Ana Botin responded that Santander was not planning any major strategy change and would remain a commercial, rather than shift to being an investment bank. 
SANTANDER WITHDRAWS ORCEL'S OFFER
Orcel resigned from UBS and was put on six-month gardening leave after signing a job offer letter from Santander. 
But on Jan. 15 2019, Santander withdrew the offer to make Orcel CEO, making a rare, unexpected U-turn on such a high-level appointment. 
Santander said the cost of compensating Orcel for the deferred awards he had earned over the past seven years at UBS and other benefits would be significantly above the board's original expectations at the time of the appointment.
Santander did offer Orcel a senior advisory role in March of that year in an attempt to mend fences, which he rejected, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
ORCEL FILES CIVIL LAWSUIT IN MADRID COURT
In late June 2019, Orcel sought as much as 112 million euro from Santander as part of a civil lawsuit for breach of contract.
Orcel's claims were based on a four-page letter - signed by Santander's general secretary Jaime Perez Renovales in September - in which the bank formally offered him the job along with a stock and bonus package to compensate for deferred pay he risked losing by quitting UBS.
    The package consisted of ""up to"" 35 million euros' of a 55 million euro package that Orcel was due to receive in future years UBS. 
PASTURES NEW
After more than two years on the sidelines of European finance, Orcel return to executive life when he was appointed CEO of Italy's UniCredit in early 2021. He subsequently cut his claim for compensation from around 112 million euros due to 68 million as he was taking up a new job. 
SHOWDOWN
Orcel and Botin faced each other in May this year as the case finally made it to court. Botin testified that the offer was never a contract and that the board had not then approved Orcel's compensation offer.

The public hearing concluded in October, when UBS chairman Axel Weber testified he made it clear the Swiss bank would not pay Orcel any deferred compensation if he quit to join a Spanish rival.

Investing.com – CF Industries stock (NYSE:CF) traded 3% higher in Friday's premarket after it raised its full-year EBITDA guidance amid soaring sales of fertilizers.
The stock had closed 2.7% lower Thursday.
The fertilizer manufacturer now sees its EBITDA at $2.75 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, 20% higher than the previous forecast of $2.3 billion.
The company said that reflected higher-than-expected realized pricing for products and strong demand for nitrogen-based fertilizers, an outcome of pandemic-fueled consumption of both organic and processed foods. 
CF Industries also credited favorable weather that has enabled the strongest fall ammonia application season in North America in the last decade. 
The company reported its third-quarter results last month and said the global nitrogen demand-supply balance should remain tight at least into 2023. It said the conditions were favorable for prices to remain strong. It pegged its ammonia production for the year at 9 million tons.
It projected that farmers in North America will continue to plant nitrogen-consuming crops (corn, wheat, cotton and canola) at high levels given the current relatively high prices for those crops. Industrial activity in the region continues to increase in line with economic activity, supporting further demand for nitrogen products, it said in November.
CF’s third-quarter sales rose 61% to $1.36 billion.

ROTTERDAM/LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) PLC shareholders voted overwhelmingly on Friday in favour of a plan to end the company's dual share structure and move its headquarters to London from The Hague.
With roughly 58% of outstanding shares cast, a preliminary tally showed 99% of shareholders supported a special resolution enabling the corporate structure change.
Official results were expected later in the day, but no significant change was expected as the vast majority of institutional shareholders had voted early.
The proposal, which would see the company renamed Shell PLC, losing the ""Royal Dutch"" title it has had for more than a century, requires approval by 75% of shareholder votes cast.
Shell board members were to meet later to make a final decision, with the move planned sometime in early 2022.
The company's boards presented the plan in November, saying the simplification would strengthen Shell's competitiveness and make paying dividends and share buybacks easier.
Critics say Shell's decision was motivated in part by a Dutch court ruling in May that ordered it to cut carbon emissions by 45% by 2030. Shell, which is appealing the ruling, says its environmental policy will not be affected by the move.
""We have considerable operations here in the Netherlands ... and that will not be changed one bit by the possible change in location,"" Chairman Andrew Mackenzie said ahead of the vote.
A group of protesters outside Friday's meeting in the Dutch port city of Rotterdam chanted ""Shell must fall!"". One banner read: ""You can't run and you can't hide from Climate Justice."" 
Taxation was a factor in the move. Because the company's headquarters and tax home are now in the Netherlands, dividends it pays on its ""A"" shares are subject to a 15% Dutch withholding tax. 
Equal payments for ""B"" shares are distributed through a Dividend Access Mechanism that sees them streamed via a trust registered on the Channel Island Jersey to avoid the Dutch tax.
The new single-share structure and British tax home will resolve those issues, as Britain does not levy a dividend withholding tax.
The company plans to return $7 billion in proceeds to shareholders from the sale of gas assets in the U.S. to ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). 

The Dutch government said it was ""disappointed"" by Shell's decision to leave. A member of the Green party in the Dutch parliament raised the idea of levying an ""exit tax"" on the company, but failed to gain support.
After the vote, Mackenzie said the company would ""continue to be very proud that the Netherlands is part of our heritage"" and said the firm would retain a major presence in the country.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen nudging higher at the open Friday, with investors waiting for the latest U.S. inflation reading with bated breath.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 125 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 20 points, or 0.5%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 70 points, or 0.4%.
The major averages handed back some of their hefty gains this week on Thursday, snapping a three-day win streak, with blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping less than one point, the broad-based S&P 500 down 0.7% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite falling 1.7%.
The discovery of the Omicron strain of the Covid-19 has added volatility into the markets since it was first identified by scientists in South Africa last month. However, the main focus Friday will be the release of the latest U.S. inflation data, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), as a precursor to next week’s Federal Reserve policy-setting meeting.
U.S. consumer prices are expected to have jumped by 6.8% year-on-year in November, topping October’s 6.2% rise which was the biggest inflation surge in more than 30 years.
A higher than expected number could convince the Fed it needs to act more aggressively. It is already expected to announce that it will speed up the tapering of its bond-buying program next week.
Also due later in the session is the preliminary reading of the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index, which is seen weakening to 67.1 from November’s 67.4. 
In the corporate sector,  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) is likely to be in the spotlight after the athleisurewear retailer boosted its annual sales growth outlook but also warned of a potential hit to demand from the new variants of the coronavirus.
Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) will also be in focus after the computer software company posted strong second-quarter results as well as increasing its ongoing share buyback program by an additional $10 billion.
Oil prices pushed higher, and are on course for their biggest weekly gain since late August as fears that the Omicron variant will lead to a significant hit to global crude demand dissipate.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1% higher at $71.66 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.9% to $75.09. Both benchmarks are set to rise more than 7% this week, their first weekly gain in seven weeks.
Data detailing the Baker Hughes' rig count and CFTC positioning later in the session round off the week.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,772.45/oz, while EUR/USD fell 0.2% to 1.1270.

Sales of Fusion and NetSuite – Oracle’s two enterprise resource planning products – rose 35% and 29%, respectively – significant for the company as it attempts to transition its clients to its Cloud offering to better compete with the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The company said that target is making a headway as more companies are willing to shift to public Cloud from on-premise management.
Total Cloud revenue was up 22% at $2.7 Billion.
Payments to settle a 10-year-old dispute surrounding former CEO Mark Hurd's employment hurt the firm’s earnings and the company reported a net loss of $1.24 billion against a profit of $2.44 billion in the same period last year.
On an adjusted basis, the company reported a profit per share of $1.21 and beat estimates.
For the ongoing quarter, the company expects EPS to come in at $1.16 billion on revenue of $10.8 billion at center of the guidance.

1546,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 06:18AM ET</span>","As Omicron Advances, South Africa Sees Little Severe Disease","(Bloomberg) -- South African hospitalizations from the omicron coronavirus variant are rising at a slower rate than surging case numbers, while severe disease is limited and there’s only a small uptick in deaths.
Data presented by the government on Friday reinforces theories that while omicron spreads more rapidly than earlier strains, it exhibits less pathogenicity, or the ability to make people very ill.
Previous waves showed an increase in hospitalizations before a dramatic rise in case numbers, said Michelle Groome, the head of health surveillance for the country’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases. Now, “we first saw the increase in cases and then started seeing these hospitalizations, so early indications are that we may be starting to see a disconnect,” she said.
The findings will come as some relief for South Africa, the epicenter of the omicron outbreak, and the world as the mutation spreads to more than 50 countries. Case numbers in Africa’s most developed economy are nearing a record and the reproduction number, a gauge of how fast a virus spreads, is higher than it has been at any time during the pandemic.
But that’s not translating to overloaded hospital wards. While the number of people hospitalized with Covid-19 is nearing 5,000, that’s about a quarter of its peak in the mid-year third wave. 
Most of the early infections with the variant, the discovery of which was announced by South Africa on Nov. 25, have been in Gauteng, the province where Johannesburg and the capital, Pretoria, are located. Data from that province has shed light on the potential severity of disease.
“There are early indications that we haven’t seen dramatic increases” in the number of people who need oxygen, ventilators or need to be moved to intensive care units,” Groome said. “We have also looked at the case fatality rate, the number of people who are dying in hospital, and once again there is no indication that has been increasing.”
While initial studies show that vaccines are less effective against omicron, most hospital admissions are in age groups with lower vaccine coverage, Groome said.
As many as 68% of coronavirus hospital intakes in the Tshwane municipal area -- that includes Pretoria -- were under 40, according to NICD data presented on Dec. 3. That compares with individuals over 50 accounting for 66% of hospitalizations during the early weeks of the third wave.
South Africa’s mass vaccination drive only began for those over 60 years old in May, before younger categories were added. More older South Africans are vaccinated than younger ones.
The initial rush of omicron admissions included many children under the age of five, a marked difference from earlier bouts of infection. Children below the age of 12 are not eligible for vaccination in South Africa.
For now, Groome says, there is little reason for concern.
“Severity among children is being monitored,” she said. “But, at this stage, anecdotally, most pediatricians” are saying children in hospital with Covid were already admitted for other problems and the duration of their stay is short.
There is no indication of respiratory problems for young children with Covid-19, Joe Phaahla, South Africa’s health minister, said at the same briefing.

The drop was the result of steps taken Dec. 6-9 to enforce a ""security interest"" in the shares, the filing said.

BENGALURU (Reuters) -India's Star Health and Allied Insurance Co, backed by billionaire stock investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, see-sawed in a weak debut on Friday, after failing to attract investor interest in a blockbuster year for domestic listings.
Shares of the country's largest private health insurer were down 6% in pre-open trade before reversing course to gain 4.4%. At 0635 GMT, shares were trading flat at 901.40 rupees.
At the day's high of 940 rupees, the Chennai-based company was valued at 66.86 billion rupees ($883.69 million). 
Star Health, which offers coverage options for retail health, group health, and overseas travel insurance, witnessed a subdued response to its listing subscription last week and had cut the size of its initial public offering (IPO) to 64 billion rupees from 72.49 billion rupees.
Last month, digital payments start-up Paytm made one of the worst major Indian stock market debuts, raising questions around impending IPOs on the until-now hot Indian market.
Appetite for very large IPOs in India has taken a beating since Paytm's debut rout, though demand for much smaller IPOs from companies with established businesses remained strong.
Relatively smaller firms including KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants operator Sapphire Foods India and data analytics company Latent View have made strong debuts.
""Considering the undersubscription of the issue, the flat listing of Star Health was expected. The financial performance was impacted in FY21, but long-term growth prospects of the industry remain quite promising,"" said Ajit Mishra, vice-president, research, Religare Broking.
The insurer, which saw a significant increase in claims during the resurgence in COVID-19 cases earlier this year, expects to see an impact on its claims ratio for fiscal 2022.
""On the listing day, Star Health and Allied Insurance stock was initially down mainly due to fears of the new Omicron variant as further impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could increase the claims,"" said Amarjeet Maurya, assistant vice-president, mid-caps, Angel One.
""We are positive on the stock and every dip in share prices provides buying opportunities to long-term investors.""

Jhunjhunwala, who owns a near 15% stake in the insurer, did not put up any shares for sale in the IPO.

Investing.com –  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) stock will be under watch when trading starts Friday after the leisurewear-maker boosted its annual sales growth outlook but also warned of a hit to demand from the new variants of the coronavirus.
The company said further resurgences could hurt consumer demand and further disrupt supply chain even as most of its retail locations are currently open.
While supply chain bottlenecks continued to be a challenge in the third quarter – suppliers’ factories were shut in Vietnam due to pandemic restrictions -- the company overcame them by shifting some production elsewhere. According to Reuters, the company used pricier air freight more and prioritized production for key holiday styles to tackle supply-chain bottlenecks.
For the ongoing financial year, Lululemon expects net revenue to be $6.27 billion at center of the guidance, up from its previous forecast of around $6.23 billion at midpoint of the range.
Chief Executive Officer Calvin McDonald said he was “pleased with our early holiday season performance”.
The company brightened its outlook after third-quarter net revenue rose 30% to $1.5 billion as people refuse to ditch the pandemic-induced habit of wearing casual clothing for both office work and domestic chores. 
Net revenue increased 28% in North America and increased 40% internationally. Total comparable sales rose 27%.
Adjusted profit per share came in at $1.62 and beat estimates.
For the current quarter, the company expects net revenue to be $2.14 billion at center of the guidance range."

The figures released on Friday show that the start of a gradual recovery seen in October, when demand was down 56%, had petered out.
Heathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye called on the British government to reduce restrictions as soon as it was safe to do so, including allowing UK nationals arriving from red list countries to isolate at home.

""It would send a strong signal that restrictions on travel will be removed as soon as safely possible to give passengers the confidence to book for 2022, opening up thousands of new jobs for local people at Heathrow,"" he said.

1554,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 04:10AM ET</span>",Analysis-Rohingya lawsuit against Facebook a 'wake-up call' for social media,"By Rina Chandran and Avi Asher-Schapiro
BANGKOK/LOS ANGELES ( Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation) - A landmark lawsuit by Rohingya refugees against Meta Platforms Inc, formerly known as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), is a ""wake-up call"" for social media firms and a test case for courts to limit their immunity, human rights and legal experts said.
The $150 billion class-action complaint, filed in California on Monday by law firms Edelson PC and Fields PLLC, argues that Facebook's failure to police content and its platform's design contributed to violence against the Rohingya community.
British lawyers also submitted a letter of notice to Facebook's London office.
While analysts are split over the merits of the case and its chances of success, Rohingya activists said their status of being deemed illegal immigrants in Myanmar left them with few options.
""The Rohingya lost everything. But in Myanmar, there is no law for the Rohingya,"" said Nay San Lwin, co-founder of advocacy group Free Rohingya Coalition, who has faced abuse on Facebook.
""Facebook profited from our suffering. The survivors have no option other than a lawsuit against Facebook. It will be an injustice if Rohingya survivors are not compensated for their losses,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Meta did not respond to a request for comment. 
In an earlier statement in response to the lawsuit, a Meta spokesperson said the company was ""appalled by the crimes committed against the Rohingya people in Myanmar.""
""We've built a dedicated team of Burmese speakers, banned the Tatmadaw (Myanmar military), disrupted networks manipulating public debate and taken action on harmful misinformation to help keep people safe. We've also invested in Burmese-language technology to reduce the prevalence of violating content.""
A day after the lawsuit was filed, Meta said it would ban several accounts linked to the Myanmar military, and said on Wednesday it had built a new artificial intelligence system that can adapt more easily to take action on new or evolving types of harmful content faster.
It was a sign that the tech giant was rattled, said Debbie Stothard, founder of the Alternative ASEAN Network on Burma (ALTSEAN), an advocacy group.
""The timing of these announcements shows the lawsuit is a wake-up call. The lawsuit itself is quite a bold move, but the Rohingya clearly felt there were sufficient grounds,"" she said.
""Strategic litigation like this - you never know where it can go. In recent times we have seen climate-change litigation becoming more commonplace and getting some wins,"" she added.
NO PRECEDENT
More than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims fled Myanmar's Rakhine state in August 2017 after a military crackdown that refugees said included mass killings and rape. Rights groups documented killings of civilians and burning of villages.
Myanmar authorities say they were battling an insurgency and deny carrying out systematic atrocities.
United Nations human rights investigators said in 2018 that the use of Facebook had played a key role in spreading hate speech that fuelled the violence against the Rohingya.
A Reuters investigation that year, cited in the U.S. complaint, found more than 1,000 examples of posts, comments and images attacking the Rohingya and other Muslims on Facebook. 
But in the United States, platforms such as Facebook are protected from liability over content posted by users by a law known as Section 230.
The Rohingya complaint says it seeks to apply Myanmar law to the claims if Section 230 is raised as a defence.
""Based on the precedents, this case should lose,"" said Eric Goldman, a professor of law at Santa Clara University School of Law. ""But you've got so much antipathy towards Facebook nowadays - anything is possible.""
While the technology industry and others have long held that Section 230 is a crucial protection, the statute has become increasingly controversial as the power of internet companies has grown.
Earlier this year, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg laid out steps to reform the law, saying that companies should have immunity from liability only if they follow best practices for removing damaging material from their platforms.
The lawsuit is a good test case for courts to limit how much immunity platforms are afforded, said David Mindell, a partner at Edelson PC, one of the law firms that brought the suit. 
""This case is about what happens when a powerful company has this unchecked power over the world,"" he said.
WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINTS
Goldman and Mindell said that recent whistleblower complaints from inside Facebook, which allege the company did not act even when it knew its platform was being used for human rights abuses, could buttress the lawsuit, as could the company's admission that it was ""too slow"" to contain the abuse.
The lawsuit highlights that ""a company can apologise all they like, but at the end of the day, people were harmed,"" said David Kaye, a human rights lawyer who chairs the board of the Global Network Initiative, a group that includes Facebook and other tech firms.
""And those stateless people can't go to the government of Myanmar for remedy. And if they can't go to the company - what's the remedy?""
The International Criminal Court has opened a case into the accusations of crimes. In September, a U.S. federal judge ordered Facebook to release records of accounts connected to anti-Rohingya violence in Myanmar that the social media giant had shut down.
The progress of the lawsuit would be keenly watched by not just the Rohingya, but also other groups and individuals who have been harmed by online hate speech, said Stothard.

""Refugees, migrants, LGBT people, other minorities - they have all suffered serious harm,"" she said.
""The question to ask is not, will the lawsuit succeed, but why was it necessary? It's about making social media companies accountable,"" she said.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged lower Friday, handing back some of the week’s strong gains as investors assess the impact of the Omicron Covid variant and disappointing U.K. GDP numbers ahead of the release of key U.S. inflation data.
At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.5% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.2%. 
U.K. growth data, released earlier Friday, showed the country’s economy barely grew in October, even before the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant. 
Gross domestic product edged up by just 0.1%, below the expected 0.4% rise, slowing sharply from monthly growth of 0.6% in September. This meant the economy remained 0.5% smaller than in February 2020, just before the first Covid-19 lockdown, and further gains are likely to be hard won given the new restrictions in place to combat the virus. The numbers did little to change the market's belief that the spread of Omicron in the last two weeks will push back the Bank of England's rate hike until the new year.
The main European indices, in conjunction with most global stock markets, have posted gains this week helped by studies suggesting the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus results in less severe reactions in patients than previous versions.
In corporate news,  Daimler  (OTC:DDAIF) Truck stock traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on Friday for the first time, at 28 euros per share, after the spinoff of the commercial vehicle maker. Daimler (DE:DAIGn), which will be renamed Mercedes-Benz, has kept 35% of Daimler Truck shares. Daimler's own stock traded down 17% as the unit was stripped out of the parent company's balance sheet.
Investors are likely to keep their powder dry before the release of important U.S. inflation data at 8:30 AM ET, where a strong reading will strengthen the case for a policy tightening decision at the Federal Reserve’s meeting next week.
Economists are calling for consumer prices to rise 0.7% on the month in November, an annual gain of 6.8%, which would be the highest year-on-year figure since 1982.
Oil prices edged lower Friday, but are still on course for their biggest weekly gain since late August on easing fears the Omicron variant will lead to a significant hit to global crude demand.
By 3:40 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded flat at $70.90 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $74.28. Both benchmarks are on course to rise more than 6% this week, their first weekly gain in seven weeks.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,772.59/oz, while EUR/USD edged lower to 1.1288.

Inflation-watchers were greeted on Friday by news that Japan's wholesale inflation had hit a record 9.0% in November, rising for the ninth straight month. The news sets the stage for the U.S. CPI release that economists expect at 6.8%, a level that would be the highest since 1982. Some even expect a headline number with a ""7-handle"".
So jittery are Americans about inflation that President Joe Biden -- facing mid-term elections next year -- released a statement saying the data would not ""reflect today's reality"" and price rises would soon subside.
In any case, the Federal Reserve looks almost sure to speed up stimulus unwinding when it meets next week -- all the data indicates a robust economy and tightening labour markets, with Thursday's weekly jobless claims sharply below predictions.
Even the Bank of Japan will discuss at next week's meeting paring pandemic-time emergency funding, Reuters reported on Friday. 
Unsurprisingly, economists polled by Reuters predict higher bond volatility ahead, though they also see 10-year U.S. yields ending 2022 around 2% - barely 50 basis points higher than now 
U.S. Treasury yields are on track for their biggest weekly rise since March, following three weeks of decline. Equity markets are reasonably buoyant - while world stocks are set for the biggest weekly gain since March; European stocks are down though Wall Street futures are pointing north.

San Francisco (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is being sued by a second female employee for sexual harassment in less than a month, with the two lawsuits alleging a ""hostile work environment"" against women at the car maker's U.S. factory.
Erica Cloud, a Tesla assembly line worker, accused defendants including her former manager of ""continuous and pervasive"" sexual harassment in a lawsuit filed in Alameda County Superior Court in California on Wednesday. 
She alleges the manager hugged and massaged her while making crude and suggestive remarks. She said she is now experiencing retaliation from other managers after complaining to Tesla's human resources team about the misconduct.
Tesla and other defendants subjected her to ""a hostile work environment stemming from animus towards her gender, sexual harassment,"" the lawsuit says.
The lawsuit alleges that Tesla and other defendants failed to prevent and take corrective actions over sexual harassment and retaliation.
Tesla did not immediately responded to Reuters' emailed questions about the lawsuit. Tesla does not have a public relations department. 
On Nov. 18, another female Tesla worker, Jessica Barraza, filed a lawsuit against Tesla, alleging rampant sexual harassment at its main factory in Fremont, California.

""The pervasive culture of sexual harassment, which includes a daily barrage of sexist language and behavior, including frequent groping on the factory floor, is known to supervisors and managers and often perpetrated by them,"" the lawsuit alleges.
In October, a Black contract worker won a $137 million jury award over workplace racism against Tesla. Tesla shareholders subsequently approved a proposal to ask it to publish a report fully accessing the company's diversity and inclusion effort.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open lower Friday, handing back some of the week’s strong gains as investors assess the impact of the Omicron Covid variant and disappointing U.K. GDP numbers ahead of the release of key U.S. inflation data.
At 2:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.5% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.5%.
The main European indices, in conjunction with most global stock markets, have posted gains this week helped by studies suggesting the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus results in less severe reactions in patients than previous versions.
Additionally, drugmakers have voiced confidence that their current vaccines would be able to cope with the mutations if populations take advantage of booster jabs.
However, there still exists a degree of caution on Friday as many European countries battle a potential fourth wave of the virus with new mobility restrictions ahead of the holiday season, a vital period for the retail sector in particular.
Investors are also likely taking a breather before the release of important U.S. inflation data, where a strong reading will strengthen the case for a policy tightening decision at the Federal Reserve’s meeting next week.
Economists are calling for consumer prices to rise 0.7% on the month in November, an annual gain of 6.8%, which would be the highest year-on-year figure since 1982.
The Fed is expected to confirm that it will speed up the pace of its bond purchase taper next week and also possibly indicate a more aggressive path for interest rate hikes in 2022.
Back in Europe, U.K. third quarter GDP rose marginally in October, climbing just 0.1% compared with the expected 0.4% gain, and is still 0.5% below its pre-pandemic peak. 
German consumer prices fell 0.2% on the month in November, as widely expected, a rise of 5.2% on the year.
Oil prices edged lower Friday, but are still on course for their biggest weekly gain since late August on easing fears the Omicron variant will lead to a significant hit to global crude demand.
By 2:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $70.70 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $74.12. Both benchmarks are on course to rise more than 6% this week, even with a brief bout of profit-taking, their first weekly gain in seven weeks.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,774.25/oz, while EUR/USD edged lower to 1.1290."

(Reuters) -Fortescue Metals Group Ltd said on Friday Elizabeth Gaines will step down as chief executive as the miner extends its transition from a pure play iron ore producer to a green energy and resources firm.
Gaines, who oversaw a tripling in the share price of the world's fourth-biggest iron ore miner in the past four years, will remain on Fortescue's board as a non-executive director and assist in the search for the new CEO.
The move comes as Fortescue's chairman and Australia's richest man, Andrew Forrest, pushes to turn the company into the world's biggest green energy group, with a focus on hydrogen at its green power arm, Fortescue Future Industries (FFI).
Forrest hailed Gaines, a former travel industry and private equity executive who joined the company in 2013 and also served as its chief financial officer, as one of Australia's ""truly inspiring leaders"".
Gaines said she wanted to make way for a new boss to lead Fortescue's evolution into a renewable energy and resources company.
""I don't see this as departure of any shape or form, and I think this is just the opportune time. Fortescue is genuinely transitioning,"" Gaines told reporters in Sydney.
The company did not set a timeline for the change over. 
Fortescue has begun a worldwide search to identify its next chief executive and other leaders with ""global experience across heavy industry, manufacturing, and renewable energy,"" it said in a statement.
Analysts said the move was not unexpected, although the timing was a bit sooner than some had anticipated.
""Management churn at Fortescue has been an ongoing concern in the market, including risk to CEO tenure in the wake of Elizabeth Gaines selling the majority of her Fortescue shares in September,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Saul Kavonic said.
Its shares slipped as much as 1.8% and closed down 0.8%, underperforming its bigger iron ore rivals and the broader market, as investors mulled how the transition would fit into the company's strategy.
""Fortescue needs to tread warily to make sure its iron ore business operates to its optimal potential as the cash flow generated will be initially the sole funding for FFI,"" said Shaw & Partners analyst Peter O'Connor.
Fortescue lost its chief operating officer Greg Lilleyman, a highly respected executive in the iron ore industry, and two other senior leaders following a review this year of cost blowouts at its Iron Bridge magnetite project.

Kavonic had flagged the risk of Gaines potentially quitting in a September note after she sold around 65% of her shares, excluding performance rights.
Analysts also pointed to some disenchantment at Fortescue after long-term incentives were cut.

The deal for the stake in Dexus Australia Logistics Trust (DALT) will be the largest investment in Asia under its Core+ Real Estate strategy, Blackstone said. 
Dexus will own the rest of the joint venture.
About 90% of DALT's portfolio is exposed to Sydney and Melbourne and is weighted to traditional logistics facilities, a key pillar of growth for the e-commerce sector, Dexus said in a separate statement. 
The deal will also help Blackstone gain a foothold in Australia's online shopping market as e-commerce penetration rate remains relatively low despite high sales, the private equity firm said.
Blackstone said the DALT deal also gives it access to densely populated areas and major transportation hubs, which aligns with the company's strategy of ""overweighting high conviction sectors and locations"".

Earlier this year, Blackstone purchased a portfolio of self-storage assets in Melbourne and an office tower in Sydney's central business district.

In June, the Swedish companies announced plans for a joint venture to develop batteries for electric cars, including setting up a gigafactory for production and an R&D centre.
Volvo Cars said the two had now signed a binding agreement for the venture. The R&D centre, located in Gothenburg, will start operations next year. 
""Our partnership with Northvolt secures the supply of high-quality, sustainably-produced batteries for the next generation of pure electric Volvos,"" Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement.
Volvo Cars, majority owned by China's Geely Holding, aims to sell 50% pure electric cars by the middle of this decade and fully electric cars only by 2030.
The Gothenburg-based company added it expected to confirm a location in Europe for the new gigafactory, with potential annual capacity of up to 50 gigawatt hours (GWh), in early 2022.
Volvo's initial public offering (IPO) on Oct. 29 was the biggest in Europe so far this year.
Northvolt, whose biggest shareholder is Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), said in October it planned to invest $750 million expanding its laboratory facility in Sweden.
The lithium-ion battery maker raised $2.75 billion in equity this year to expand capacity at its factory in northern Sweden, which is due to start production this month.

Aiming to take on Asian players such as CATL and LG Chem, it is aiming for a 20% market share in Europe by 2030. It has to date secured over $27 billion worth of contracts from customers including BMW, Scania, Volkswagen, Volvo Cars and Polestar.

The National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors (NAFMII) held a meeting with Chinese developers on Friday at which it said individual risk cases won't affect the normal financing functions of the market over the medium to long term, according to newspaper. 
This is the latest sign that China is marginally relaxing financing conditions for developers to prevent the financial trouble of heavily-indebted China Evergrande Group from triggering a collapse of the property sector, as well as a sharp slowdown of the economy.

However, NAFMII will prioritise support to those developers that operate in line with China's real estate policies, the newspaper said, suggesting Beijing won't reverse its deleveraging campaign.
Developers including China Merchants Shekou Industrial Zone Holdings Co plan to issue debt instruments via the interbank market in the near term to fund mergers and acquisitions, the newspaper said.

Some Commerce Department officials are trying to block the Defense Department's proposal, the Journal added, citing people familiar with the matter. 
Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) was added to a U.S. blacklist last year that denies it access to advanced manufacturing equipment from U.S. suppliers due to its alleged ties to China's military, claims that the company rejects. 
SMIC, China's largest contract chipmaker, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.

In the coming months, U.S. officials are also considering adding more Chinese technology companies to the Commerce Department's entity list and to the Treasury list banning U.S. investment, the Journal added.

The Swiss pharmaceuticals company raised the prospect of divesting Sandoz in October after years of revamping the business, as price pressures mount in the off-patent drug sector.
Investment group EQT (NYSE:EQT) and the Struengmann family, who are investors in BioNTech, are considering a joint offer for Sandoz, German media reported in November.
""I have read that as well,"" Narasimhan told German weekly magazine WirtschaftsWoche in an interview.
""There have been various requests for more information. But no concrete offers,"" he added.
Novartis would decide by the end of 2022 how to proceed with Sandoz, which achieved sales of $9.7 billion last year, about 20% of the group's total, Narasimhan added.
""The question we need to clarify by then is: Will Sandoz be more successful in the future within or outside the Novartis organization?"" 
""What is clear is that we want to focus Novartis primarily on innovative medicines. We generate 80% of our sales and 80 to 90% of our profits with new medicines, for example for cancer, cardiovascular problems or genetic diseases.""

Investing.com –  Canbridge Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (HK:1228) made a dismal debut in Hong Kong that raised around HK$604 million ($77.46 million).
Shares were at HK$9.07 by 11:57 PM (4:57 AM GMT). The biopharmaceutical company issued 56,251,000 shares globally at a final offer price of HK$12.18 per share.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Asia Limited and Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Hong Kong Limited were the offering’s joint sponsors, while RA Capital, Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Bay Master Fund Ltd, Janus Investors, General Atlantic, WuXi Biologics, Ruihua Capital and Belinda A.

SHANGHAI/SYDNEY (Reuters) - China's domestic air traffic, once the world's envy after a fast rebound during the pandemic, is faltering due to a zero-COVID policy that has led to tighter travel rules in Beijing and weaker consumer confidence after repeated small outbreaks.
The outlook for the fourth quarter, normally a popular time for southerners to head north for winter breaks and northerners to head south for warmer weather, is dimming due to COVID-19 related disruptions at a time when international traffic is negligible.
""It's very exhausting that the virus somehow always manages to make a comeback,"" said Elaine Shen, a Shanghai resident who had to put off her domestic travel plans for the first time since the start of the pandemic due to cases in Shanghai. 
Domestic capacity at the country's three biggest airlines reached around 115% of pre-COVID levels in April but by October had fallen to around 77% due to outbreaks with lower peaks after each rebound, HSBC data shows. That contrasts with a steadier U.S. domestic recovery. (Graphic: China domestic & international air passenger turnover, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/lbpgnljkgvq/ChinaAirPassengerVolumesDec2021.png) 
In mid-November, the situation worsened when the city of Beijing announced that travellers from any Chinese city that had reported even a single COVID case within the past 14 days would be restricted from entering the capital, which is being protected ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics. 
Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang province, on Tuesday slashed its number of flights to Beijing to just one per day due to two local cases.
Air China (OTC:AIRYY), China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) and China Southern Airlines posted a combined loss of nearly 8 billion yuan ($1.25 billion) in the third quarter.
There is potential downside risk to combined fourth-quarter estimates that have a current consensus loss of 7.2 billion, HBSC analysts said.
Domestic air passenger traffic stood at around 40% of pre-COVID levels in November, while the number of flights dropped to around 60% of 2019 levels, according to aviation data provider Variflight. 
Chinese airlines last week cut 9.4% of scheduled domestic flights for December, according to airline data firm Cirium, amid fears about the Omicron variant.
The fall in traffic comes as Chinese airlines ready for the return of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX around year-end after it last week received safety approvals from China's aviation regulator.
The extra capacity is likely to prove a burden, according to Chen Jianguo, an expert at Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association of China. 

    ""Because of COVID, most airlines in China are not short of capacity,"" he said. ""Rather, they're running a serious surplus of aircraft at the moment... So (for the MAX), airlines have no option but to suffer in silence.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Chinese artificial intelligence startup SenseTime Group is discussing the fate of its planned $767 million Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) with the city's stock exchange on Friday, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The move comes after the Financial Times reported on Thursday that the United States will put the company on an investment blacklist on Friday that would mean U.S.-based investors could not buy shares in the company.
The sources declined to be named as the information was not yet made public. SenseTime had not been aware the blacklist was under consideration, the sources told Reuters on Thursday.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange declined to comment and SenseTime did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
SenseTime had planned to sell 1.5 billion shares within a price range of HK$3.85 to HK$3.99 each in the IPO. It was due to set the final price and allocate shares to institutional investors on Friday, according to the firm's filings.
The people with knowledge of the matter said SenseTime and its advisors held urgent talks late on Thursday and early on Friday on how the ban would impact its the IPO, which was in its final stages when the blacklist report was published.
U.S.-based investors had lodged bids to buy stock during the bookbuilding process, one person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. 
But a second source said some investors started to pull their bids to buy shares once the likely ban was reported.

More than half of the deal, $450 million, had been sold to cornerstone investors ahead of the transaction's expected launch on Monday.
SenseTime is due to start trading on Dec. 17, the filings showed.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A spate of COVID-19 cases at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Financial Group Inc was not caused by a specific incident, the Wall Street investment bank said on Thursday, and its decision to reinstate home working was erring on the side of caution.
Jefferies on Wednesday sent staff home and cancelled client parties and virtually all but essential travel after nearly 40 new COVID-19 cases were reported at the firm, prompting speculation about the cause of the spike and whether other banks will follow suit.
The Jefferies spokesman said the number of cases was small - the Manhattan-headquartered bank has 4,500 employees worlwide, with offices in Asia and Europe as well as the United States - but it was getting out in front of the issue. He said the bank does not do routine staff COVID-19 testing.
""Throughout the pandemic, we have worked to put the health and safety of our employees first,"" Jefferies Chief Executive Richard Handler said in a statement to Reuters on Thursday.
""Given the time of year and the increase in COVID cases happening everywhere, it just made sense to encourage people to work from home, be with their families, and avoid any unnecessary travel or large social events.""
The bank has felt the pandemic’s impact acutely, as its Chief Financial Officer Peg Broadbent died due to coronavirus complications in March 2020.
Two sources familiar with the matter also said on Thursday that the recent outbreak was not believed to be the result of a ""superspreader"" event.
Some Jefferies staff were surprised by Wednesday's news and had been unaware of any fresh wave of cases, they told Reuters.
Handler said in a memo to staff on Wednesday that more than 95% of all employees were vaccinated, and 100% of those who enter its offices were vaccinated. Jefferies had called its staff back to offices in October. 
The company did not specify the location of the 40 infected employees, nor whether the return to working from home had been imposed at all offices. 
Several Wall Street firms are increasing efforts to ensure staff get coronavirus booster shots, as countries and industries grapple with how to respond to the spread of the Omicron variant.
Daily COVID-19 cases in New York City have surged in recent days and hospitalizations in the city are at their highest level since April, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). While the Delta variant is still dominant in the United States, Omicron has been detected in many U.S. states including New York.
BOOSTERS
Most banks are strongly recommending staff get booster shots, sources said.
Jefferies will require everyone who wants to enter any of its offices to have their booster administered by Jan. 31, unless they are not yet eligible to do so, Handler wrote in a staff memo on Wednesday.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) has made COVID-19 boosters available to staff at its new headquarters in Columbus Circle since early November, according to a source familiar with the matter.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co said on Wednesday it was providing all employees with four hours of paid leave to get the booster shot.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) also provide employees with paid time off to receive vaccines and booster shots.
U.S. private equity group KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc, headquartered in midtown Manhattan, also said on Thursday it was encouraging staff to obtain boosters. The firm sent notices to staff before Thanksgiving and after the Omicron variant was discovered, a spokeswoman said.
The firm is also testing staff coming into the office for COVID-19 even if they are fully vaccinated and requiring masks in all common areas, the spokeswoman said. 
Banks and other financial firms are reluctant to reverse efforts since the summer to move staff who had been working from home back into the office. However, they are conscious that workers are increasingly concerned about the Omicron variant. 
Banks and other financial firms are mostly allowing smaller teams to hold holiday parties to help maintain morale, but avoiding large-scale, firm-wide gatherings. Several firms are requiring COVID tests before parties, the sources said. 
Some events have gone ahead.

The UJA-Federation of New York's Wall Street Dinner, attended by Wall Street leaders including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Chief Executive David Solomon, was held on Monday at the Marriott Marquis in midtown Manhattan, attended by 700 in-person guests.
Although proof of vaccination was required upon entry, in line with City of New York regulations, there was no requirement to mask and most guests chose not to as they mingled over hors d'oeuvres and cocktails.

1574,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 09:55PM ET</span>",General Motors returns to rare earth magnets with two U.S. deals,"By Ernest Scheyder and Ben Klayman
(Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) plans to source rare earth magnets for its future electric vehicles from new U.S.-based manufacturing facilities under two separate deals announced on Thursday, a return to an industry the automaker had all but abandoned in the 1990s.
The agreements with MP Materials Inc and privately-held Vacuumschmelze are the latest push by GM to domestically source EV materials for its Ultium platform, a goal it hopes to achieve by 2025. GM did not disclose financial terms.
Shares of MP, which went public last year via a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger, were up 6.5% on Thursday. GM's shares fell 1%.
The Biden administration is putting pressure on automakers via tax incentives and other measures to invest and create EV supply chain jobs in the United States and reduce reliance on China. 
GM, which hopes to sell more than 1 million EVs annually by 2025, signed a supply deal with a California lithium project in July and in October said it would work with  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co to study,vehicles%20and%20renewable%20energy%20equipment rare earth supply chains.
""The more we can recover natural resources for batteries and EVs from North America, process them here and manufacture them ... the more value we can create,"" Shilpan Amin, GM vice president of global purchasing and supply chain, said on a call with investors. ""Our strategy is to control our own destiny.""
Rare earths are a grouping of 17 metals that, after processing, are used to make magnets found in EV motors that turn electricity into motion. China is the world's largest producer and consumer of rare earths and rare earth magnets. 
As part of the deal, MP Materials will build a so-called neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnet facility in Texas that will supply enough magnets for GM to build 500,000 EV motors. GM said it does not plan to take a stake in the Texas facility, which should open by 2023.
MP will source the rare earths to build those magnets from its California mine, where it is also building processing equipment. MP currently relies on China to process the rare earths it extracts from its mine, and thus all of its revenue. 
A Chinese company also owns nearly 8% of MP's shares, an ownership structure that has raised eyebrows in Washington. Las Vegas-based MP has long said it is an independent company and feels no pressure to favor Chinese interests. 
The Pentagon awards $13 million in rare earths funding to U.S. projects has also funded several MP-related projects and said the United States needs more rare earth mines. 
GM and Germany-based Vacuumschmelze said they will jointly build a U.S. rare earth magnet plant. Shilpan said terms of the deal are still being finalized, but the plan is to use locally sourced raw materials when production starts in 2024. 
It was not immediately clear where Vacuumschmelze will procure rare earths since MP operates the only existing U.S. rare earths mine.
PAST
In an ironic twist, GM once was a global leader in the rare earth magnet industry through its Magnequench division. But in 1995, GM sold the division - and its patents - to a consortium that included two Chinese partners. 
The deal helped GM grow in the Chinese automotive market, but also gave China access to the rare earth magnet technology that was first developed by U.S. military scientists. The U.S. plant that had manufactured the NdFeB magnets eventually closed, with production moving to China.
GM's deals with MP and Vacuumschmelze essentially seek to undo that step by reviving the U.S. rare earth industry. It was not immediately clear if GM, MP or Vacuumschmelze will license the NdFeB patents - some of which are now held by a division of Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) - for U.S. production. 

GM referred questions about patents to its two new suppliers. MP said it is confident it can either license the patents or engineer new ways to make the magnets that do not infringe the patents. Vacuumschmelze representatives could not immediately be reached for comment.
While GM is building an electric vehicle supply chain for North America, it is also building one for China, which is the company's largest in terms of vehicle sales.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - For global banks and fund managers drawing up their 2022 China investment strategies, one factor occupies their minds but eludes valuation models: President Xi Jinping's next five years in office.
Having done away with term limits in 2018, China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong is steering the country back toward its socialist roots, upending financial markets. 
Crackdowns on internet giants, property developers and education have MSCI's China index down 20% in 2021 against a 15% rise in world stocks, while China's once-popular high-yield debt market has crumbled.
There is a growing consensus that the selling is overdone, but with Xi all but assured an unprecedented third term next year and with policy in flux, investors have said positioning for the era to come is a more delicate task than simply bargain hunting.
""What you buy today and what you buy in the future will be quite different from what you bought last year, five years ago or 10 years ago,"" said Chi Lo, senior strategist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management in Hong Kong.
""The new regime under the Xi Jinping government is going to be more properly supervised, more regulated,"" he said.
""Companies' operation models will have to change...what the Chinese government wants to develop will be the key to decide your portfolio's composition.""
Lo suggested avoiding ""sunset"" sectors such as coal and steel to focus on apparent priorities such as high-tech manufacturing or emissions reduction projects.
Other global banks have offered similar ideas.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) compiled a 50-stock ""common prosperity portfolio"" containing renewable energy firms, some consumer-exposed companies and tech and state-owned firms with a focus on research, among others.
J.P. Morgan has highlighted the potential of ""new heroes"" in electric vehicles, such as BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF) Ltd, and advanced manufacturing while ""old heroes"" in the property sector fade.
Jack Siu, chief investment officer for Greater China at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), is on watch for a possible upgrade in company earnings next year, as ""we will likely see some supportive fiscal policy and moderately or slightly less tight monetary policy"" ahead of the Party Congress, which could usher in another term for Xi.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) expects an above consensus economic recovery to 5.5% growth in 2022 as policy is eased.
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), which says China has the highest potential for upside in Asia next year, is overweight on staples, 5G and high-end manufacturers and said China's blue-chip CSI300 aligns better with policy priorities than MSCI's index which has heavy weightings to some out-of-favour internet firms.
""While we believe that risk/reward has improved for internet names, we maintain a strategy of gaining exposure to common prosperity themes, on a structural policy tailwind,"" Societe Generale strategists said in their Asia outlook note.
COMMON GOOD
""Common prosperity"" isn't a new concept in China, having first been mentioned by Mao in the 1950s. It has gained currency as a Xi-era catchphrase for a new drive to narrow a yawning wealth gap and foster more inclusive growth.
Xi has also renewed efforts to de-leverage the property sector, sought to curtail tech firms' grip on data and commerce, and promised carbon neutrality by 2060. 
What's whacked markets and put investors on guard is less the program's broad direction - which bulls say now seems set for the next decade or so - than its unpredictable application, especially as Xi consolidates power.
To be sure, policy risk is ever-present in China. But a year of seismic shifts - sometimes heralded via gnomic regulatory comments in state media or a confusing melange of leaks - makes it front of mind.
""That's a large worry for us, because you don't really know what the Chinese Communist Party's thinking,"" said Mark Arnold, chief investment officer at Hyperion Asset Management in Brisbane.
""You've really got an all-powerful government, a one-party state really developing into a one-person state, so you don't have the feedback loops or protections of democracy.""
Still, flows suggest it is not yet scaring foreigners away from stocks, according to data from BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK), which shows consistent equity flows this year against selling in bonds that have been hurt by a crackdown on developers' borrowing.
Foreign inflows into China's stock market totalled 241 billion yuan ($40 billion) for the year to the end of September.
Inflows into China's interbank bond market totalled 598 billion yuan in the first 10 months of 2021, up 18.4% from the end of 2020. An ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA index of Chinese investment grade bonds has been steady this year against a 30% plunge in the Chinese high-yield index.
For some, the risk of missing out on China looms larger than the danger of getting hurt.
""If you're a global pension fund and all your eggs are in the U.S. basket, and you've got nothing in China, it's quite a skewed portfolio,"" said Jim McCafferty, joint head of equity research in Asia at Nomura in Hong Kong.

""As soon as we see U.S. equities start to underperform and Chinese equities, which of course are cheap on all valuation benchmarks, start to outperform - that's the point in time where I think investors will start agitating.""

1576,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 09:54PM ET</span>",Shares in Focus After Debt Defaults Declared: Evergrande Update,"(Bloomberg) -- Stocks tied to China Evergrande Group and Kaisa Group Holdings may move after the embattled developers were officially labeled defaulters for the first time.
The two firms were downgraded to restricted default by Fitch Ratings, which cited missed dollar bond interest payments in Evergrande’s case and failure to repay a $400 million dollar bond in Kaisa’s.
Chinese high-yield dollar bonds rallied for a third straight day Thursday after the news. The notes are poised for the longest streak of gains since Nov. 22, according to a Bloomberg index.
Key Developments:
 
Moutai Surge Shows Bull Market Returning (08:30 a.m. HK)
The world’s second-largest stock market is showing signs of exuberance for the first time since Chinese policy makers popped a bubble earlier this year.
The {{28930|FTSE ChChina A50 Index of China’s biggest stocks has climbed more than 6% in a six-day advance, its steepest since February. Its relative-strength index is at a 10-month high, a sign of increasing momentum.
The gains are coinciding with two large defaults in the credit market in Evergrande and Kaisa -- and it’s no coincidence. The Communist Party has shifted to easing mode to limit the fallout from a property slowdown, deploying measures to help boost liquidity in the financial system. 
Colour Life Services Applies to Resume Trading on Friday (6 a.m. HK)
Trading of shares in Colour Life Services, a real estate management company, and controlling shareholder Fantasia Group Holdings Ltd. was halted last month pending inside information announcements, according to separate filings. 
Colour Life Services also said that its property developer shareholder received a notice from TFI Securities and Futures, alleging Fantasia has not discharged its payment obligations of about $96.98m, according to a regulatory filing.
Evergrande Declared in Default as Huge Restructuring Looms (5:29 p.m. HK)
China Evergrande Group has officially been labeled a defaulter for the first time, the latest milestone in a months-long financial drama that’s likely to culminate in a massive restructuring of the world’s most indebted developer.
Fitch Ratings cut Evergrande to “restricted default” over its failure to make two coupon payments by the end of a grace period on Monday, a move that may trigger cross defaults on the developer’s $19.2 billion of dollar debt. 
The downgrade came just minutes after Fitch applied the same default label to Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd., which failed to repay a $400 million dollar bond that matured Tuesday. Together, the two companies account for about 15% of outstanding dollar bonds sold by Chinese developers.

BUFFALO, N.Y. (Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) employees on Thursday voted to join a union at one store in Buffalo, New York, delivering the coffee chain its first unionized company-owned location in the United States. Workers at a second location in the city voted to reject the drive to organize.
Employees at one Starbucks location in Buffalo voted to join Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union. 
The vote count for a third store in the upstate New York city ended without a definitive result because a number of ballots were still under review, a process that could stretch into early next year, according to Ian Hayes, an attorney for the union.
""We will keep listening,"" Rossann Williams, president of Starbucks North America, said in a letter to employees after the vote. ""These are preliminary results with no immediate changes to our partner relationship as the NLRB process continues.""
The closely watched results come as Corporate America eyes new union organizing campaigns amid a U.S. labor shortage that has already led to higher wages at most large retailer and restaurant chains. Experts said the Starbucks results may encourage union activity at other companies.
""Although it's a small number of workers, the result has huge symbolic importance,"" said John Logan, a labor professor at San Francisco State University. 
E-commerce company Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is facing a new election at one of its Alabama warehouses after results of the previous election - which the union lost - were overturned last month.
The Buffalo election involved just over 100 workers altogether, a tiny fraction of Starbucks' roughly 220,000 employees in its U.S. cafes.
Even so, the union victory could embolden other baristas to launch organizing drives at some of the company's more than 8,000 other company-owned U.S. cafes. Already, three other Buffalo-area stores and one store in Mesa, Arizona, have petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to join the union.
""I am absolutely optimistic,"" said James Skretta, a barista at one of the other New York stores to call for an election. ""We feel as though this is validation for what it is that we've been doing.""
The outcome encourages Skretta to ""withstand what we know will continue to be an aggressive anti-union campaign,"" they said.
Shares of the Seattle-based company closed about 1% lower at $115.35 on Thursday.
'AGGRESSIVE' TACTICS
Some local baristas had decried what they said were aggressive company tactics, including flooding Buffalo locations with executives, holding meetings with employees and even bringing in ex-CEO Howard Schultz to talk to workers and extol the virtues of existing wage hikes and benefits.
Starbucks denies that any of its actions amounted to union busting.
The company had several unionized cafes and a roastery in the United States the 1980s, but all eventually decertified. It beat back more recent organizing campaigns in Philadelphia and New York City. One location in Canada unionized in 2020.
In Buffalo, about 15 Starbucks employees who support the union drive gathered in a room to watch results. Many jumped, screamed and hugged when they realized they had enough votes to win the first store to be counted, on Elmwood Avenue.

The vote was 19-8 in favor of joining the union.
Baristas and shift supervisors from the second location on Camp Road voted 12-8 to reject the union. Hayes, the union's lawyer, said during a news conference that the union will challenge those results.

The shares fell as much as 4.5% to HK$370.40 on Friday. They were sold at HK$388 apiece in an IPO that raised about HK$7.15 billion ($917 million). The H-shares had been marketed at between HK$350 and HK$410 and were ultimately priced at a discount of 34% to Asymchem’s Shenzhen-listed stock.
Asymchem is the largest IPO in Hong Kong since Dongguan Rural Commercial Bank Co.’s $1.2 billion deal in September. Hong Kong’s exchange has hosted few large offerings in recent months as Beijing’s clampdowns on various industries soured sentiment in both the primary and secondary markets.
Twelve of 16 IPOs in the city since August raising over $100 million each ended their first session below their listing price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of Thursday. 
Asymchem, a Tianjin-based contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) for the drug industry, plans to use proceeds to add capacity and capabilities as well as increase market share.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and Citic Securities Co. were joint sponsors for the share sale.
Two other smaller debuts in Hong Kong on Friday had mixed performance. Gushengtang Holdings Ltd., a traditional Chinese medicine healthcare service provider, jumped as much as 18% following a $104 million offering. CANbridge Pharmaceuticals Inc., a biopharmaceutical company, dropped as much as 29% following an $88 million IPO.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Friday morning, as the ripple effects from China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) default continue to be felt. The omicron COVID-19 variant was also back in the spotlight, with investors gauging its risk to the economic recovery.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.25% by 9:04 PM ET (2:04 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.41%. China Evergrande and  Kaisa Group  Holdings Ltd. (HK:1638) have officially defaulted on their dollar debt. Fitch Ratings cut China Evergrande to “restricted default” after the developer failed to make two coupon payments by the end of a grace period on Monday. Kaisa, which failed to repay a $400 million dollar bond that matured Tuesday, also got the same label from Fitch.
Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China raised its foreign currency reserve requirement ratio for the second time in 2021 after the yuan climbed to the highest since 2018, prompting the offshore yuan to decline the most since July 2021.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.30%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.49% and South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.47%.
In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 was down 0.45%.
Omicron concerns are rising again after a study found it is 4.2 times more transmissible than the delta variant in its early stages.
“Ultimately the issue from a health perspective is that even if omicron does prove to be less severe, which the initial indications so far have pointed to, a rise in transmissibility could offset that,”  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategists including Jim Reid said in a note.
That could mean that more people are in the hospital, “even if a lower proportion of them are severely affected,” the note added.
Meanwhile, U.S. data, including the consumer price index, will be released later in the day.
“Various Fed participants, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have signaled a hawkish shift in their policy stance, catalyzed by increasing discomfort with elevated inflation against a backdrop of robust growth and ongoing strengthening in labor markets conditions,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economists and strategists including Ellen Zentner said in a note.
“We revise our Fed call and now expect the Fed to begin raising rates in Sept. 2022, two quarters earlier than our prior forecast,” the note added.

(Reuters) - A California jury found that Bayer (OTC:BAYRY)'s Roundup weedkiller was not the cause of a woman's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Bayer said on Thursday, delivering the chemical giant its second trial victory over claims the popular herbicide causes cancer.
The jury in San Bernardino County found that Donnetta Stephens' cancer was not caused by her exposure between 1985 and 2017 to Roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate. 
She sued the company for negligence and failing to warn her of the dangers of Roundup.
""Despite everyone's best efforts, it was impossible to try a coherent case via Zoom with our schedule,"" said Fletch Trammell, Stephens' attorney. ""We plan to appeal and look forward to trying the case again in more favorable circumstances.""
Trammell noted similar cases typically took weeks to try and the Stephens case took more than four months due to technical problems and long breaks.
Bayer said the verdict was consistent with the evidence.
The Stephens case is the fifth over Roundup to go to a trial verdict.
Plaintiffs were awarded tens of millions of dollars in the first three but Bayer got its first favorable trial outcome on Oct. 5, which lifted the company's stock price.
The company said in May it would be more selective in settling cases and had said Stephens settlement demands were unreasonable.
Roundup-related lawsuits have dogged the company since it acquired the top-selling brand as part of its $63 billion purchase of agricultural seeds and pesticides maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2018.

The company has spent billions of dollars to settle around 96,000 Roundup cases of about 125,000. 
Bayer is still pursuing appeals in two of the three verdicts it lost, including one the company hopes will be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court, where a ruling for Bayer could effectively end the Roundup cases.

Congested ports, a shortage of truck drivers and a scarcity of raw materials have made it harder for retailers to put products on their shelves in time for the all-important shopping season. 
Retailers are rushing to meet pent-up demand over the holidays this year, trying everything from using air freight to ordering products well ahead of time, as an early start to the shopping season has sent some consumers making purchases in as early as September.
""Some inventory, in fact, won't make it before Christmas,"" Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said, adding that Costco has mitigated that as best as possible, signaling some optimism on holiday supply.
With growing vaccination rates and easing COVID-19 curbs, more consumers stepped back into brick-and-mortar stores to buy supplies, boosting sales of everything from home furnishings to jewelry at Costco, which relies heavily on customers' treasure-hunt shopping experience at its cavernous warehouse clubs.
Total revenue in the first quarter ended Nov. 21 rose 16.6% to $50.36 billion topping estimates of $49.60 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 

Comparable sales, excluding the impact of fuel and currency fluctuations, jumped 9.8% in the quarter, also above expectations of an 8.74% surge.
Net income attributable to Issaquah, Washington-based Costco rose to $1.32 billion, or $2.98 per share, from $1.17 billion, or $2.62 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $2.64 per share.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration is holding talks among federal agencies about the security of Americans' data and whether the U.S. government has adequate tools.
In June, President Joe Biden withdrew a series of Trump-era executive orders that sought to ban new downloads of Chinese-owned WeChat and TikTok and ordered a Commerce Department review of security concerns posed by those apps.
The order set a Dec. 6 deadline for Commerce, in consultation with other government agencies, to submit a report on ""additional executive and legislative actions to address the risk associated with connected software applications"" that are acquired or accessible by companies controlled or based in countries that are deemed foreign adversaries.
A White House official confirmed to Reuters that the departments of Commerce and Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ""have submitted an initial set of analyses and recommendations"" in connection with the order, without offering details.
The official added that the ""administration is now engaged in interagency deliberations to ensure that relevant departments and agencies have the tools, authorities and resources needed to protect Americans’ sensitive data."" The administration did not release any of the findings.
On Nov. 26, the Commerce Department proposed amending regulations on information and communications technology supply chains to provide additional criteria to implement Biden's executive order and determine if connected software applications present unacceptable risks.
The Commerce Department said in October it met a separate deadline to make recommendations to protect U.S. data.
The administration of former President Donald Trump sought to block new users from downloading the Chinese apps and ban other technical transactions that Chinese-owned short video-sharing app TikTok and WeChat both said would effectively block the apps’ U.S. use.

U.S. courts blocked those orders, which never took effect.
The Trump administration contended WeChat and TikTok posed national security concerns because sensitive personal data of U.S. users could be collected by China’s government. China and the apps have denied any improper use of U.S. data.

People stuck at home during the lockdowns last year ditched dressier clothes for hoodies and leggings, benefiting Lululemon, Aerie, Athleta, and prompting others, including Kim Kardashian's shapewear brand Skims, to enter the fray.
Athleisure apparel makers are still booking sales benefits, but Lululemon said the pandemic worsening due to COVID-19 variants could further impact supply chain issues and lead to temporary closures of some or all of its stores.
The new Omicron coronavirus variant first detected in southern Africa and Hong Kong has triggered uncertainty over the reopening of the global economy.
Lululemon has already had to shift some production out of Vietnam due to pandemic-led factory closures over the summer, use pricier air freight more and prioritize production for key holiday styles to tackle supply-chain bottlenecks.
""Demand for our brand is outpacing supply, and our business could have been even stronger without the supply chain challenges,"" Chief Executive Officer Calvin McDonald told analysts, adding that inventory challenges affected the launch of some new clothing collections.
Lululemon's shares fell 2% to $408 in extended trading, as the company also slashed sales outlook for its Mirror home-fitness platform.
The company's factories in Vietnam have reopened, but lingering effects of the shutdowns have caused delays in delivery of some holiday and fall products, McDonald said.

However, Lululemon raised its fiscal 2021 revenue forecast to between $6.25 billion and $6.29 billion, largely in line with estimates.
The company's revenue rose to $1.45 billion in the third quarter, compared with estimates of $1.44 billion. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.62 per share, beating estimates of $1.41.

SEATTLE (Reuters) -Veteran Boeing (NYSE:BA) airplane programs executive Mark Jenks, who helped steer the 737 MAX program through a safety crisis, plans to retire, while supply chain executive Elizabeth Lund is to take over the role, the U.S. planemaker said on Thursday.
Jenks, a 38-year Boeing employee who has also held executive positions on space and defense programs, is the senior vice president overseeing production programs across Boeing's commercial jetliner portfolio. 
While his retirement plans had been in the works since last year, a spokesperson said, Jenks' departure comes as the U.S. planemaker works to muscle through production and certification challenges on its 787 and 777X programs, while moving toward resuming deliveries of the 737 MAX in China. 
Jenks will remain with Boeing's commercial airplanes unit through the beginning of 2022, commercial airplanes chief executive Stan Deal told employees in a memo seen by Reuters.
Jenks was named head of the 737 program in 2019 after the 737 MAX was grounded in March of that year following two fatal crashes in five months. 
He was then tapped in 2020 to oversee the U.S. planemaker's commercial production.

Lund has served in senior leadership positions at Boeing on the 777/777X, 747, and 767 widebody programs, and had led product development for the Commercial Airplanes division.
Lund will continue as an executive overseeing the manufacturer's supply chain until a successor is named for that position, Deal said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) has hired two executives who previously worked with billionaire investors Bruce Kovner and David Tepper for top investment positions in the firm's $81 billion hedge fund unit, the company said on Thursday.
David Ben-Ur, who managed Kovner's family money, will join as chief investment officer of the unit's hedge fund solutions business. Atish Nigam, who worked at Tepper's hedge fund Appaloosa Management, will become chief investment officer of the hedge fund unit's special situations investing business.
Both men will join New York-headquartered Blackstone in early 2022 and will work for Joe Dowling who heads Blackstone's hedge fund business known as BAAM.
""Our mission is to deliver exceptional performance and these are highly skilled investors who will help us achieve that,"" Dowling told Reuters.
Dowling, a former endowment chief at Brown University, came to Blackstone this year and has recruited staff as a number of senior Blackstone executives left the firm.
The new hires ""demonstrate the tremendous momentum we have in BAAM,"" Jon Gray, Blackstone president and chief operating officer, said. ""David and Atish are exceptional investors with great track records of managing money and delivering strong, risk-adjusted returns through market cycles.""
Ben-Ur was chief investment officer at CAM Capital where he managed assets for Kovner who founded hedge fund Caxton Associates in 1983. Before that he was co-chief investment officer at Corbin Capital and started his career at Fidelity Investments.
CAM Capital and Blackstone also agreed on preliminary terms to manage CAM Capital's assets.
Nigam was a senior analyst at Tepper's Appaloosa, a hedge fund that is now managing mainly Tepper's personal fortune.

Blackstone's BAAM unit is on track to post its best-ever year, with revenues and earnings topping last year's records and assets at a record high. Blackstone's fund-of-funds portfolio, BAAM Principal Solutions, gained 12.2% over the last 12 months, outpacing the hedge fund industry which gained 8.9%.
But the unit has also seen turnover. Ben-Ur will replace Gideon Berger, who left the firm earlier this year, while Nigam will replace Min Htoo who is leaving at the end of the year.

(Reuters) - Wall Street closed lower on Thursday as investors banked some profits after three straight days of gains and turned their focus toward upcoming inflation data and how it might influence the Federal Reserve's meeting next week.
The Nasdaq was down more sharply than the S&P 500 while the Dow was virtually flat, ending down less than 1 point. 
Investors were in a waiting game ahead of U.S. consumer prices index (CPI) inflation data due Friday morning. A higher-than-expected reading would strengthen the case for a policy tightening decision at the U.S. central bank's meeting.
In the first three days of the week, the Nasdaq rallied 4.7%, the S&P advanced 3.6% and the Dow gained 3.4% as fears abated about the latest coronavirus variant Omicron.
""We had a rip roaring rally. There's still nervous people out there,"" said Dennis Dick, head of markets structure, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. 
""We'd a Omicron relief rally but the underlying problem still remains, that the Fed's taking the punchbowl away.""
Joe Quinlan, chief market strategist for the CIO office of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), said investors may be taking profits and pausing buying after the three days of gains. 
""Also there may be a little risk-off trade ahead of the CPI number on Friday,"" he said. ""If it comes in hotter than expected it really shines the light and the focus on the Fed meeting. The pressure would build on the Fed for a faster tapering."" 
Fed Chair Powell signaled last week that the meeting would include a discussion about a faster tapering of bond-buying. 
""It would reaffirm in many people's minds that the Fed is behind the curve,"" said Quinlan. 
If the inflation number implies a need to hike rates faster, this ""would put pressure on technology and give a bid to cyclicals"" he said.
""You'd want to buy the companies that could pass on these higher costs to consumers. That undermines the growth story. You want to own more cyclicals and value than growth,"" said Quinlan.
A Reuters poll of economists predicted the Fed would raise rates by 25 basis points to 0.25-0.50% in the third quarter of next year. However, most saw the risk that a hike comes even sooner.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.06 points to 35,754.69, the S&P 500 lost 33.76 points, or 0.72%, to 4,667.45 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 269.62 points, or 1.71%, to 15,517.37.
Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors declined, with consumer discretionary down 1.7%, losing the most and real estate, down 1.4%, and information technology falling 1%, showing the next biggest losses.

Shares of the company rose 6.6% to $622 in extended trading. 
Analysts have pointed to strong near-term demand for Broadcom's radio frequency and wireless chips as telecom firms spend more to roll out 5G technology, and continued strength in its broadband division. The company counts smartphone giants Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) among major customers.
Broadcom is also poised to benefit from higher demand for its data-center and server chips, aided by a rise in hybrid working models and a rapid shift to cloud by businesses during the pandemic.
Enterprise demand rebounded sharply over 30% in the reported quarter, while revenue from semiconductor solutions is expected to grow 17% in the current quarter, Chief Executive Hock Tan said on a conference call with analysts.
The San Jose, California-based company forecast first-quarter revenue of about $7.60 billion, well above analysts' average estimate of $7.25 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose 15% to $7.41 billion, narrowly beating estimates of $7.36 billion, while earnings per share of $7.81 was also better than expected. 

Broadcom has also diversified beyond its core chip business and forayed into the lucrative software arena, at a time when the world grapples with supply chain disruptions and an industry-wide chip shortage. Its infrastructure software revenue grew 8% to $1.77 billion in the fourth quarter. 
The new share repurchase program is effective until the end of next year, the company said in a separate statement.

1591,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 06:01PM ET</span>",U.S. safety agency discussing Tesla camera replacements,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Thursday it is discussing with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) its decision to replace cameras in some U.S. vehicles.
CNBC reported on Monday Tesla was replacing front fender cameras in several hundred Model S, X and 3 vehicles due to faulty circuit boards inside but had not issued a recall. 
NHTSA said it is ""monitoring all data sources"" including consumer complaints, and also urged ""the public to let NHTSA know if they think their vehicle may have a safety defect that isn’t part of a current recall.""
U.S. law ""prohibits manufacturers from selling vehicles with design defects posing unreasonable risks to safety,"" the agency said, adding it has ""robust enforcement tools to protect the public, to investigate potential safety issues, and act when we find evidence of noncompliance or an unreasonable risk to safety.""
Consumer groups said the regulator needs to look into whether Tesla should have recalled the defective parts.
“Reports of a service campaign repair to malfunctioning front-end cameras that are critical to Tesla’s driver assistance suite is important enough to the safety of the vehicle to merit exploration by NHTSA,"" said Jason K. Levine, executive director at Center for Auto Safety.
""The reality is that the auto industry has a long history of choosing to conduct service campaigns instead of recalls, but it is too early to say whether that’s the case here.” 
A malfunction of front fender cameras, safety systems used for blind spot monitoring, would likely create a safety risk, said David Friedman, a former acting administration at NHTSA and now Vice President at Consumer Reports.

""If people are losing reliable access to blind spot images, or the effectiveness of autopilot or automatic emergency braking is being hampered, the malfunction would seem to pose an unreasonable risk,"" he said.
Tesla was not immediately available for comment.

Now, the situation has certainly taken a turn for the worse. The seven-day moving average of new cases was around 71,000 in early November. Currently, it’s at 119,000. One factor is that viruses spread more and faster in the winter months. Further, measures of travel volume are at about 90% of 2019 levels, and people are taking less precaution in terms of masking and social distancing. It’s also clear that the vaccine is protecting against the worst effects of the virus but not necessarily in terms of spread.

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 05:28PM ET</span>","Analysis-Malaysia's palm oil producers adjust to labour shortages, higher recruitment costs","By Mei Mei Chu
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's palm oil producers are racing to adjust to an acute shortage of workers due to the coronavirus and sharply higher costs of recruitment as they make changes in response to accusations of forced labour. 
The country, second only to Indonesia in palm oil production, has become more competitive in recent months due to higher export levies imposed by its southern neighbour. But mounting employment costs mean Malaysia risks losing that edge and potentially ceding market share to Indonesia. 
The increased costs, alongside record-high fertilizer prices affecting both countries, pushed the key commodity to an all-time high in October. That has already forced up the price of the foodstuff worldwide, and is raising the costs of cosmetics and detergents and other products that palm oil is used in. 
For a relared graphic, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/zjpqkynjgpx/MalaysiaPoilvsFAO.png
The most pressing problem for palm oil producers such as FGV Holdings and Sime Darby Plantation is a lack of workers to harvest palm trees, a skilled and dangerous task. 
""The current issues are an extreme manifestation of the fact that as incomes grow and workers, with greater options of urban employment, become less able or willing to do manual labour, attracting them to the plantations will become more difficult,"" said Julian McGill, head of South East Asia at LMC International. ""Soon there will be no 'cheap' labour."" 
COVID EXODUS
Up until April last year as many as 337,000 migrant workers, mostly from Indonesia, worked on Malaysian plantations, making up about 80% of the workforce. Thousands of them flew home throughout the pandemic while Malaysia closed borders and stopped issuing new work permits to control the spread of the new coronavirus. Hundreds of undocumented workers were also deported. 
As a result, Malaysia's palm oil yields dropped to nearly 40-year lows this year as plantations operated with about 75,000 fewer workers than needed. The steep drop in production pushed palm oil prices to record highs and sparked concerns about food inflation. 
For a related graphic on Malaysia vs Indonesia palm oil yields and production, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/gkvlglbgopb/MalvsIndoPalmYieldsProdDec2021.png
To alleviate the situation, Malaysia in September approved the recruitment of 32,000 foreign workers for palm oil plantations, prioritising those from Indonesia. Although even if that many were hired, it would still leave plantations well below full capacity for the next peak harvest season of September to November 2022. 
Plantation owners are finding it harder and more expensive to hire workers as they try to repair Malaysia's standing in global markets caused by accusations of using forced labour. 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) banned imports of palm oil in 2020 from Sime Darby and FGV on suspicion of using forced labour, including debt bondage, violence and unlawful retention of identity documents. The bans are still in effect. Both companies have hired independent auditors to evaluate their operations and said they would engage with the CBP to address its concerns. 
Similar accusations of forced labour have also been made by the CBP and rights groups against other industries in Malaysia, including rubber and electronics. In July, the U.S Department of State downgraded Malaysia to its labour watch list that includes China and North Korea.
""The risks of a failed or corrupt recruitment process to Malaysia's government and industry reputation at this time, already reeling from U.S. forced labour sanctions and a blackened image globally, are real,"" labour rights activist Andy Hall told Reuters. 
Hall, who has been at the forefront of campaigns to end labour abuse in Malaysia and elsewhere in Asia, was hired by Sime Darby in October 2020 as an ethical recruitment consultant. 
IMAGE REPAIR
To try to address the issues and repair its image overseas, plantations have invested millions of ringgit to improve recruitment processes, upgrade housing for workers, provide lockers for workers to keep their passports in and hire auditors and consultants to assess their labour practices. 
FGV and Sime Darby told Reuters they are strengthening due diligence processes to ensure they appoint only labour agencies that comply with their human rights policies. They said they have improved communication efforts to ensure workers fully understand the realities of plantation work.
""This is to further ensure that contracts are signed freely, without any coercion, intimidation, deception or threats as well as to ensure that no unethical practices were involved in the recruitment process,"" Sime Darby told Reuters. 
Educating and preventing labourers making large payments to recruiters or other middlemen, which up to now has been common, is one of the key issues that needs to be addressed, according to Hall. 
Some companies are considering repaying such recruitment fees to workers, a manager of a palm oil refinery told Reuters. Such a move helped Malaysian glove company Top Glove Corp get an import ban lifted by the United States.
FGV said it has allocated an additional 43 million ringgit ($10 million) this year to refurbish workers' housing and upgrade equipment to ensure continuous access to electricity and water in remote locations. Sime Darby told Reuters it estimates that it will spend 65 million ringgit annually for the next seven years on routine efforts to review and improve working conditions at its plantations.
Employers must pay all coronavirus-related fees like testing and quarantine, with no help from the Malaysian government. That could double recruitment costs for each worker to about 10,000 ringgit, according to estimates by the Malaysian Palm Oil Association. 
""We have to go through the process of agents identifying workers, preparing the passports, Indonesian government clearance, and Malaysian government's standard operating procedures,"" MPOA Chief Executive Nageeb Wahab told Reuters.
There is no guarantee that Malaysian plantations will be able to recruit the thousands of workers it needs. Indian labour agent Vimlesh Gautam told Reuters he is aiming to hire 3,000 workers from India to start by December, but has so far only identified around 200 candidates as coronavirus protocols in India and Malaysia complicate the recruitment process. 
""We have to put the process on hold because we are awaiting medical guidance from Malaysia,"" said Gautam. ""Once it is confirmed we can get more workers."" 
CLIMBING COSTS
With most Malaysian plantations having been severely understaffed for two seasons, urgent clearing, weeding and application of pesticides and fertilizers are needed to help palm production recover.
Thousands of tonnes of valuable fruit have been left to rot on the ground after plantations' failed efforts to get local workers to do the taxing work of harvesting the heavy, perishable and prickly fruit bunches at the prevailing wage rates.
The need to spend money on such remedial work, just as fertilizer prices hit record highs, on top of the extra outlays on recruitment, will push up costs for Malaysian producers, making them less competitive against Indonesian rivals. 
Cheaper labour has historically kept Malaysia's average cost of palm oil production lower than Indonesia's, whose cost has been in the $400 to $450 per tonne range. Malaysia's cost has already increased to about $478 to $526 per tonne this year, according to MPOA. Indonesia's figure has also risen, to $500 to $600 per tonne this year, mostly because of rising fertilizer prices, according to the Indonesian Palm Oil Association (GAPKI). But Malaysian producers such as FGV expect costs to continue to rise, threatening their advantage.
These mounting costs are spurring Malaysia's palm producers to accelerate investments into genome research to create higher-yielding seeds, as well as automation and mechanization, even looking at drones to harvest the fruit. 

Plantation owners hope such investments will make them less reliant on human labour, but new technology will take years to implement.
""In the short term, there is nothing companies can do but to convince the government to give them more workers and improve on the process,"" said Ivy Ng, regional head of plantations research at CGS-CIMB Research.

1604,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 04:11PM ET</span>",Airbus goes legal as Qatar Airways jet row escalates,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus dramatically raised the stakes in a dispute with Qatar Airways over skin flaws on A350 jetliners on Thursday, accusing the Gulf carrier of misrepresenting the problem as a safety issue and calling for independent legal advice.
Airbus has been locked in a row with one of the industry's biggest buyers for months over damage to paint and an underlying layer of lightning protection, which Qatar Airways says has led to the grounding of 20 jets by its domestic aviation regulator.
In a rare statement airing a breakdown in relations between the planemaker and the launch customer of Europe's premier long-haul jet, Airbus said the A350s had been declared safe to fly by European regulators despite some ""surface degradation.""
""The attempt by this customer to misrepresent this specific topic as an airworthiness issue represents a threat to the international protocols on safety matters,"" it said.
Airbus officials confirmed the statement referred to Qatar Airways. 
A spokesman for the airline said it would not comment on the Airbus statement before reviewing it.
Industry sources said there was no indication Qatar Airways was ready to back down in the dispute, which has already prompted it to exclude Airbus from a multi-billion-dollar deal to replace its 35 freighters, which is set to go to Boeing (NYSE:BA).
At stake is the credibility of two of the industry's most powerful players and a potential compensation battle over hundreds of millions of dollars in estimated grounding costs.
The row widened last week when documents seen by Reuters revealed at least five other airlines had complained about paint or other skin flaws since late 2016. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) joined the list of affected carriers this week, but so far only Qatar has seen jets being grounded .
Exclusive photographs published Reuters by Reuters have shown exposed and corroded lightning protection beneath cracked paint. 
""We have worked actively with Qatar Airways in order to minimise the impact of this in-service surface degradation on their aircraft,"" Philippe Mhun, Airbus Executive Vice President Programmes & Services, told reporters.
BRAND DAMAGE
Mhun said Airbus had offered solutions to Qatar Airways from patches, to repairs of the anti-lightning material or repainting of entire aircraft, but Qatar Airways had declined the offer.
Industry sources say Qatar Airways is reluctant to implement short-term fixes without a full breakdown of the root cause.
Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said in London last week, ""we don't know if it is an airworthiness issue. We also don't know that it is not an airworthiness issue.""
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has said ""no potential airworthiness issue has been identified to date"" and ruled out a link with a separate manufacturing flaw which prompted it to issue a draft safety directive for 13 A350s.
Airbus says it understands the cause, though sources say a formal diagnosis may require further tests on surface ageing.
The legal step taken by Airbus comes under a contract clause allowing for arbitration, Mhun said. 
Usually arbitration is carried out away from the public gaze, but Airbus said it was acting to ""defend its position and reputation"" while calling for a ""constructive dialogue"".
Qatar Airways says its own brand and wide-body operations are at stake due to the grounding of 20 of its A350 jets, less than a year before the Gulf state hosts the FIFA World Cup.

Some airlines have been pressuring Airbus to head off any damage to their brands as a result of the bitter public row between Airbus and a high-profile customer which has clashed with planemakers in the past, through rarely to such a degree.
""I have never seen anything like this. It is not only a problem between Airbus and Qatar Airways but it is also designed to prevent further damage to the A350's reputation with all operators,"" said aviation adviser Bertrand Grabowski.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 slipped Thursday following a three-day rally as investors weighed up positive labor market data ahead of Friday's inflation report that could intensify expectations for a faster pace of Federal Reserve monetary policy tightening.
The S&P 500 fell 0.71%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, the Nasdaq fell 1.7%.  
""The broader market is taking a breather after the run up over the last four days going into tomorrow's consumer price index report,"" David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors told Investing.com in an interview on Thursday.
Economists forecast that the CPI Index for November rose 6.8%, up from 6.2%, led by a sharp increase in rising rents. That would the fastest pace of inflation since 1990.
""We're looking at a lot of different REITs and a lot of different apartment companies, and seeing rental growth for those types of companies of about 10%,"" Wagner added. ""Rising rental rates will lead to a CPI reading that's going to be higher than expected and more importantly, it's going to be longer than expected.""
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled last month that the Fed would consider stepping up the pace of bond purchasing tapering to curb inflation pressures.
On the jobs front, data continued to show an improving labor market as jobless claims fell to 184,000, the lowest in more than 52 years.  
Energy was the biggest drag on the broader market as oil prices fell 2% on concerns that fresh restrictions in Europe could weigh on the travel, and energy demand, albeit not as much as initially feared.
""Oil demand is unlikely to escape completely unscathed, though the effects [from the restrictions] will probably not be nearly as serious as initially feared,"" Commerzbank said in a note.
 Diamondback Energy Inc  (NASDAQ:FANG), Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB), and  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) led the move to the downside in energy.
Technology, meanwhile, was pressured by weakness in semiconductor stocks, paced by a 5% decline in Wolfspeed (NYSE:WOLF) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) gave up some gains, though Wall Street continues to talk up further growth ahead for the tech giant amid expectations for strong iPhone demand and new production launches.
""We believe the risk/reward is very favorable at current levels for this ""safety blanket"" tech stalwart,"" Wedbush said. Demand for Apple's iPhone 13 is outpacing supply by ""about 10 million units globally,"" it added.
Health care, meanwhile, added to gains from a day earlier as CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) soared to a record high after the drugstore chain said sales were set to strengthen, underpinned by its expansion of health-care services.
In other news, GameStop (NYSE:GME) fell more than 10% after the video game retailer reported third-quarter losses than were wider than expected and failed to provide update on strategy to bolster growth."

Investing.com – Stocks took a breather on Thursday as investors awaited the latest reading of inflation due out early Friday.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) continued to rise, coming closer to a $3 trillion market valuation as it touched yet another 52-week high.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) shares also gained after data showed its Covid-19 vaccine withBioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) offered protection against the Omicron variant, especially after three doses. The Food and Drug Administration added 16 and 17yos to the list of those eligible for booster doses.
Omicron has sent a jolt of volatility into the markets since it was first identified by scientists in South Africa last month. The Federal Reserve is set to meet next week and could decide to speed up its timeline for removing stimulus from the economy as inflation creeps higher.
Speaking of which, the consumer price index comes out early on Friday, and a higher than expected number could convince the Fed it needs to act more aggressively.
Reuters did a poll of economists, who predicted the Fed would raise rates by 25 basis points to 0.25% to 0.50% in next year’s third quarter, though most also said the risk was that a hike comes even sooner.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Consumer prices
U.S. consumer prices are expected to have jumped by 6.8% year-on-year in November, topping October’s 6.2% rise which was the biggest inflation surge in more than 30 years, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. The data are released at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
2. Core consumer prices
Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, so-called core CPI is seen up 4.9% year-on-year. It had risen by 4.6% in October. But it is seen as slowing from October, expected to rise 0.5% for the month compared with 0.6% for the previous month.
3. Consumer sentiment
The preliminary reading of the U.S. consumer sentiment for December, as reflected in the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index, is seen weakening to 67.1 from November’s 67.4. This number comes out at 10:00 AM ET.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. passenger railroad Amtrak told a U.S. House of Representatives panel on Thursday it expects to be forced to temporarily cut some service in January because of a COVID-19 vaccine mandate.
Amtrak President Stephen Gardner told a House Transportation subcommittee that roughly 95% of its 17,000 employees have been fully vaccinated ahead of a Jan. 4 deadline.
""We anticipate proactively needing to temporarily reduce some train frequencies across our network in January to avoid staffing-related cancellations, with our plan to fully restore all frequencies by March or as soon as we have qualified employees available,"" he said.
Gardner said in written testimony he expects the reductions to be in long-distance services ""because of the relatively small crew bases at intermediate points along multi-day long-distance routes where conductors and engineers report to work.""
He noted that many engineers, conductors and on-board service employees retired or left Amtrak and it temporarily halted hiring due to funding uncertainty. 
Without additional employee vaccinations Gardner said Amtrak is ""currently determining what service reductions will be necessary and intend to communicate them publicly by next week.""
An inspector general report released on Thursday said Amtrak plans a big boost in hiring but faces challenges.
The report found Amtrak's Human Resources Department ""does not have sufficient leadership or staff to effectively recruit, screen, hire, and onboard new employees, which will likely hinder the company’s plans to add 2,500 to 3,500 new employees"" by late 2022.
Amtrak said in comments that it agreed with the report's recommendations and pledged specific actions by October 2022, including ""reviewing executive compensation and incentives."" 
Congress has approved $66 billion for rail as part of a massive infrastructure bill, with Amtrak receiving $22 billion and $36 billion for competitive grants.

Gardner said the funding ""will require educating, hiring, training, and developing career paths for thousands of additional workers.""
Amtrak saw demand fall off substantially during COVID-19 and is now seeing about 70% of pre-pandemic volumes. ""We don't know how long it'll take before business travel has returned,"" Gardner said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY)'s U.S. unit will pay $3.5 million to resolve a lawsuit by the state of Illinois against the German automaker for updates of emissions software arising from the 2015 diesel cheating scandal.
Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s bid to avoid lawsuits filed by officials in other states seeking damages. VW had earlier warned of potential astronomical damages in the state and local suits.
""Volkswagen intentionally tampered with vehicles it claimed to be environmentally friendly but were actually releasing harmful emissions,"" Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement. 
The Illinois settlement is worth about $300 for each of about 12,000 vehicles. 
""This agreement will fully resolve Illinois’s legacy claims and put this matter behind the company as we focus on building a future of sustainable mobility,"" Volkswagen said.
In September, VW agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle environmental claims with the states of New Hampshire and Montana.
Two other states - Ohio and Texas - and two counties - Hillsborough County, Florida, and Salt Lake County, Utah - have pending suits involving about 35,000 vehicles.
Volkswagen previously settled U.S. actions prompted by the emissions scandal for more than $20 billion, but that did not shield it from local and state government liability, an appeals court found.
In 2015, Volkswagen disclosed that it had used sophisticated software to evade nitrogen oxide emissions requirements in nearly 11 million vehicles worldwide. It also misled the Environmental Protection Agency, which had started asking questions in 2014.
In addition to equipping vehicles with ""defeat devices"" before they were sold, VW also installed software updates after sale, which was the conduct at issue in the Illinois suit.

At the time, VW did not reveal the true purpose of the updates, which were aimed at refining the software used to control the emissions.
In 2017, VW pleaded guilty to fraud, obstruction of justice and falsifying statements as part of a $4.3 billion settlement reached with the U.S. Justice Department over the automaker's diesel emissions scandal.

(CTVA) and Mosaic Co. (NYSE:MOS) are two prominent players in the global agricultural inputs industry. CTVA is an agricultural chemical company that operates through two segments ─ Seed and Crop Protection. The company develops and supplies advanced germplasm and trait technologies that improve resistance to weather, disease, insects, and herbicides used to control weeds, enhance food and nutritional characteristics, and help produce optimum yield. On the other hand, MOS produces and markets concentrated phosphate and potash crop nutrients. The company operates through three segments ─ Phosphates, Potash, and Mosaic Fertilizantes. It also provides nitrogen-based crop nutrients, animal feed ingredients, and other ancillary services.
The United States is witnessing decade-high food prices owing to high inflation, rising energy and commodity prices, and global supply chain constraints. Nevertheless, increasing consumer spending this festive season has been surging the demand for fertilizers and crop nutrients to produce better crop quality and yield, driving its prices. To overcome these issues, some countries have stopped exporting their crop nutrients to support their domestic availability.
However, falling natural gas prices (a key ingredient in making nitrogen-based fertilizers) and technological integration in seed sciences to produce genetically modified seeds should help companies produce better crop yields, promote sustainable agriculture, and witness good sales in the upcoming months. So, both CTVA and MOS should benefit.

These stocks are rated A (Strong Buy) in our proprietary rating system.The production of several industries has been hit hard by the global semiconductor chip shortage over the past 18 months. And although the global chip shortage is not expected to subside until the end of 2022, the situation could begin improving in the near term, thanks to the initiatives to ramp up production. The Biden administration has urged Congress to pass a $52 billion spending bill before Christmas to address the crisis.
Rising demand from several industries, such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs), is driving the industry’s growth. The global semiconductor chips market is expected to reach $553.6 billion by 2026, registering a 7.8% CAGR.

However, our view is that Aurora Cannabis (NASDAQ:ACB) doesn’t look fundamentally fit enough to capitalize on the industry’s trend. So, instead, we think it could be worth betting on fundamentally sound pot companies Curaleaf (CURLF), Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), and HEXO (NASDAQ:HEXO). We think they could potentially deliver promising returns in the coming months. Let’s discuss.The growing requirement of cannabidiol oil for therapeutic needs from an aging population, and a growing consumer preference for innovative recreational cannabis products, have been driving the cannabis industry’s growth. The global spending on legal cannabis is expected to reach $43 billion by 2024. Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced steps to improve insurance policies for hemp businesses to make them more flexible. Also, the record high support from U.S. adults and GOP lawmakers has generated positive sentiment concerning the cannabis market.
However, medicinal cannabis company Aurora Cannabis Inc.’s (ACB), which is based in Calgary, Canada, has not benefited from the favorable industry trends. In its last reported quarter, the company’s total net revenue decreased 11.1% year-over-year to CAD60.11 million ($47.54 million). The stock has declined 34.6% in price over the past six months and 38% over the past year. Furthermore, the stock’s average price target of $6.31 represents a potential 4% decline from its $6.57 last closing price. Therefore, we think ACB may not be the right choice to cash in on the industry tailwinds.

(Reuters) -U.S. regulators on Thursday expanded eligibility for COVID-19 vaccine booster shots to 16- and 17-year-olds, as public health officials have urged Americans to get a third shot due to concerns about the new Omicron variant of the virus.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it amended its emergency use authorization of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX)'s vaccine to allow youths aged 16-17 to receive a third shot at least six months after their second vaccine dose. 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also signed off on the shots. 
""Although we don’t have all the answers on the Omicron variant, initial data suggests that COVID-19 boosters help broaden and strengthen the protection against Omicron and other variants,"" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement. She strongly encouraged all eligible 16- and 17-year olds to get the shots.
Around 4.7 million U.S. youths in that age group are fully vaccinated and more than 2.5 million of them are six months past their second dose.
Only the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been authorized for use in the age group.
Some scientists have raised concerns about the additional shot because of the elevated risk of rare cases of heart inflammation in young men that have been linked to messenger RNA vaccines such as the Pfizer/BioNTech shot. 
All U.S. adults are currently eligible for booster shots of the three authorized COVID-19 vaccines. 
The FDA's authorization comes a day after Pfizer and BioNTech released data suggesting that booster shots could be key to protection against infection from the newly identified Omicron variant.

The CDC has identified fewer than 100 cases of Omicron in the United States, but they are expected to increase in the coming weeks and months. 
Meanwhile, the dominant Delta variant, which is very transmissible and can be passed on by people who are fully vaccinated, has driven up infections. Regions where activities have moved indoors for winter, such as the Northeast, have seen some of the biggest increases in new cases, which now average close to 120,000 daily.

At that valuation, the Sao Paulo-based fintech, backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, is only behind commodities players Petrobras and Vale. 
On Wednesday, Nubank priced its initial public offering at the top end of a range it had lowered earlier due to concerns over a global rout in technology stocks, to raise nearly $2.6 billion. The offer was eight times oversubscribed, one source with knowledge of the matter said. 
The flotation comes as a record year for U.S. listings, which saw heavyweights like Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) and Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) go public, draws to a close.
Nubank has said it had turned a profit in the first half of 2021 in its Brazilian operations. Founder and Chief Executive Officer David Velez said the company will stay focused on three markets - Brazil, Mexico and Colombia.
""A lot of the capital that we're raising in this IPO is for Colombia and Mexico. And so we will continue to just invest behind that growth opportunity,"" Velez said in an interview with Reuters.
Nubank's investors include Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global Management and SoftBank Latin America Funds.
""Nubank is one of those companies whose shares we might want to hold for the very long term,"" said Douglas Leone, global managing partner at Sequoia, in an interview with Reuters. Sequoia started investing in Nubank in the seed round in 2013.
""Right now the focus is to make sure we (Nubank) do the very best job for customers in Latin America,"" added Leone, who is also a member of the fintech's board of directors. 
Having become one of Brazil's biggest credit card issuers, Nubank has pioneered products that have spawned off a fierce race among competitors.

The company's stock opened at $11.25 per share, compared with the initial public offering price of $9 per share.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and NuInvest are the lead underwriters for the offering.

1620,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 02:36PM ET</span>",Outage shows how Amazon's complex cloud makes backup plans difficult,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Major companies using Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s data services got a painful lesson this week about how the complexity and market dominance of the company's cloud unit make it difficult to back up their data with other providers, analysts and experts told Reuters.
Amazon said that an ""an impairment of several network devices"" in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) Virginia data center region caused the prolonged outage on Tuesday. The outage temporarily interrupted streaming platforms Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney+, trading app  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) and even Amazon's own e-commerce site, which makes heavy use of AWS.
An Amazon spokesperson told Reuters on Wednesday that the issues had been resolved.
The huge trail of damage from a network problem at a single region that AWS calls ""US-EAST-1"" underscored how difficult it is for companies to spread their cloud computing around. 
With 24.1% of the overall market, according to research firm IDC, Amazon is the world's biggest cloud computing firm. Rivals like  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet's  Google Inc  (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) are trying to lure AWS customers to use parts of their clouds, often as a backup.
But crafting a complex online service that can be easily shifted from one provider to another in case of emergency is far from simple, said Naveen Chhabra, a senior analyst with research firm Forrester. Rather than being a singular ""cloud,"" AWS is actually composed of hundreds of different services, from basic building blocks like computing power and storage to advanced services like high-speed databases and artificial intelligence training.
Any given website, Chhabra said, might use several dozen of those individual services, each of which must work for the site to function. It is difficult to make a backup on another cloud provider because some services are proprietary to AWS and some work very differently at another provider. 
""It's like saying, 'Can I put an SUV body on a sedan chassis?' Maybe, if everything is all the same and lines up. But there is no guarantee,"" Chhabra said.
Another issue that makes it hard for businesses to diversify is that AWS makes it relatively cheap to send data into its cloud, but then charges higher prices for ""egress fees"" to get data out of its cloud to take to a rival.
""That amplifies issues like this (outage) when they happen,"" said Matthew Prince, chief executive of internet security firm Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) Inc ""A more resilient cloud is one where egress fees are eliminated and customers can be multi-cloud. I think that would actually increase the faith customers have in the cloud.""
DEPENDENCIES IN ONE REGION 
AWS itself has critical ""dependencies"" within its own services where they are linked together in ways that can cause one to fail when another fails, said Angelique Medina, head of product market at Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO)'s ThousandEyes. That is because AWS's complex services are often built on top of its own more basic services. One problem that crops up with a basic function like networking can cascade through services that depend on it.
Early on in the incident on Tuesday, AWS said the outage was ""affecting some of our monitoring and incident response tooling, which is delaying our ability to provide updates.""
Medina said AWS also seems to be have critical services clustered in its US-EAST-1 region, where another outage last year also had a widely felt impact. 
""That's where a lot of their critical dependencies have been located historically,"" Medina said. ""Over time, they've diversified a bit.""
Chhabra, the Forrester analyst, said Amazon has done a lot of ""heavy lifting"" to make its own services resilient. But what Amazon does not do for its customers is build applications in a way that can withstand an outage by tapping multiple locations or providers.
Doing so can often involve extra work that might not always be worth it when cloud outages remain relatively rare. 

""It's this tradeoff you always have between something that is decentralized, something that's secure and something that's useable,"" said Charly Fei, product lead for Inter Blockchain Communication lead at The Interchain Foundation, which is focused on technologies for decentralizing computing. ""It's not something where you'll ever get a perfect solution that gets all three.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's finance firms have began issuing an array of updated work from home guidance to staff after the government toughened up rules. 
But following stricter government COVID-19 guidance to work from home will be a ""challenge"" for accountants as they head for their busiest time of the year, auditor PwC said on Thursday.
Britain announced tougher restrictions on Wednesday, ordering people to work from home to slow the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant.
Employees in Britain's huge financial services sector had begun returning to the office in large numbers in recent months, with financial districts in the City of London and Canary Wharf busy in the run up to Christmas.
""As always we will follow government guidelines, but there's no denying this will be a challenge for some sectors,"" said Kevin Ellis, PwC's chairman and senior partner.
""The majority of our people had returned to the office two to three days a week. It's the busy season for audit and there's also lots of deal activity that benefits from some in person meetings,"" Ellis said.
PwC offices will remain open for people who have a ""business or personal need to use them"", he said.
PwC, along with EY, Deloitte and KPMG are dubbed the ""Big Four"" and dominate auditing of blue-chip companies globally, with the year end period their busiest as accountants make checks for annual company reports ahead of publication.
EY and Deloitte said they have asked staff to comply with the government guidance, though their offices are still open for employees who need them.
""We ask anyone who comes into our offices to wear a face mask and to have taken a lateral flow test within 48 hours of coming in,"" a Deloitte spokesperson said.
The City of London Corporation said the fresh restrictions will be a disappointment to business in the historic ""square mile"" financial district it governs.
""We will urge City businesses, workers and residents to follow the new rules,"" said Catherine McGuinness, the City's policy chair.
""But we also ask the government to set out a clear roadmap to normality early in the new year and base all decisions on data. We need to find ways to live with the virus which allows the economy to prosper,"" she said. 
Banks also started to issue revised guidance to staff including  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which told its nearly 8,000 staff in Britain it was discouraging work social gatherings in what would usually be a busy time for Christmas parties, a source at the bank said.

Staff numbers at Deutsche Bank London offices will be significantly reduced from Monday, though employees with certain roles such as traders or those with personal reasons can still go in.
The shift also comes a day after U.S. investment bank Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Financial Group told staff to work from home again and cancelled all client parties after a spate of COVID-19 cases.

Union Pacific said 73% of its 31,000 employees were fully vaccinated as of Dec. 8, adding that it was still encouraging workers to report their vaccination status and get inoculated.
The company and its unions have filed lawsuits against each other after the Nebraska-based railroad made COVID-19 vaccines compulsory under a rule issued by U.S. President Joe Biden for federal contractors.
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc-owned BNSF said it was pausing its implementation of the federal mandate for its about 35,000 employees, adding that its stance remained that the decision to be vaccinated is a personal one.
The rule required contractors to have employees vaccinated by Dec. 8 but that date was later extended to Jan. 18. The order applied to newly awarded contracts, although the government has been asking suppliers to agree to amend existing contracts to insert the vaccine requirement.
On Tuesday, a U.S. District Court judge in Georgia blocked that rule, saying the federal government exceeded its authority.

1625,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 01:51PM ET</span>",American Airlines plans to reduce international flights next summer,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh and David Shepardson
(Reuters) -American Airlines Group Inc plans to scrap, reduce or delay the introduction of flights to several international routes next summer because of a lack of widebody aircraft, according to a company memo seen by Reuters.
American, which is the world's largest carrier, said Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's delay in delivering 787 jets, including 13 aircraft that were expected to arrive by this winter, has crimped its ability to ramp up capacity. 
""Without these widebodies, we simply won't be able to fly as much internationally as we had planned next summer, or as we did in summer 2019,"" Chief Revenue Officer Vasu Raja said in a staff memo.
The move also comes at a time when the airline industry is grappling with new uncertainty caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant. A flurry of new testing rules and border closings following the discovery of the variant late last month has set back the nascent recovery in international traffic.
Raja said American will not fly to Edinburgh, Shannon in Ireland and Hong Kong next summer. Frequency of flights to Shanghai, Beijing and Sydney will also be ""significantly"" reduced.
American's incoming Chief Executive Robert Isom told Reuters this week that the new travel restrictions had dampened demand in some international markets.
The company currently does not have direct flights to Edinburgh, Shannon and Hong Kong. It had expected to resume services to both Edinburgh and Shannon at the end of March and had been selling tickets for those flights.
A company spokesperson said the airline will cancel those flights and is contacting affected customers with offers for alternate travel arrangements.
The direct flights on the Los Angeles-Hong Kong route remain suspended since February 2020. The spokesperson said since the company has not been selling those flights, no ticketholders would be affected by the decision.
The spokesperson attributed the reduction in services to Asia to soft demand.
DREAMLINER DELIVERIES
Deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner, which has faced manufacturing delays, are expected to resume by April 1 at the earliest, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported American's decision to cut flights.
""We deeply regret the impact to our customers as we work through the process to resume deliveries of new 787s,"" Boeing said in an emailed statement. 
The 787 Dreamliner is important for Boeing's rebound from the pandemic as well as from a safety scandal caused by two fatal crashes. 

United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc, another Boeing customer, said it is ""working closely"" with Boeing to understand how the delivery delays might affect its schedule. 
Shares of American were down about 1% on Thursday, while those of Boeing dropped 2%.

Meat processors have been unable to find enough workers for the past two years due to the tight labor market and health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Tyson expects to boost production and reduce labor costs by expanding automation, with cumulative savings of more than $450 million projected by fiscal year 2024, King said on a webcast for investors.
The company will increasingly use machines, instead of people, to debone chicken, one of its most labor-intensive jobs and a position with high turnover, said David Bray, group president of Tyson's poultry division. A capital investment of $500 million in the area through fiscal year 2024 will generate labor savings equal to more than 2,000 jobs, he said.
Profitability in Tyson's chicken unit has declined partly due to the labor shortage and because processing plants are operating below full capacity, Bray said.
""We are not servicing our customers to the degree that they expect us to,"" Bray said.
Tyson slaughtered about 37 million chickens a week on average in fiscal year 2021, accounting for 80% capacity utilization, and will increase processing to 40 million birds weekly in fiscal year 2022, or 85% capacity, Bray said. 
The company aims to slaughter 47 million birds a week over time, reaching about 98% capacity utilization, to meet strong demand, he said.
""Demand is outpacing supply,"" he said. 

Tyson shifted production during the pandemic to adapt to soaring demand at grocery stores and reduced sales at restaurants.
About 59,000 U.S. meatpacking workers were infected with COVID-19 through January at plants run by Tyson and competitors, according to a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee report.

Many assets have responded well to high inflation readings over the past year, with the S&P-500 (SPY) being one of them, up over 20% year-to-date. However, the supposed inflation hedges, precious metals, have been unable to hold their ground and continue to sink year-to-date. This has certainly made the precious metals a frustrating trade, and the only good news to come of this frustration is that it’s left bullish sentiment readings near multi-year lows. As the chart below shows, sentiment has not been this bad for the precious metals sector since March 2020 (except for September 2021), and extreme pessimism often breeds major rallies. Looking back to March 2020, silver was up more than 100% in less than six months.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission announced draft rules on Thursday to give many drivers for online firms such as Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Deliveroo employee benefits, a move labour unions say is overdue but some companies argue will lead to job losses.
The proposal, a global first that needs to be thrashed out with EU countries and lawmakers before it can become law, marks the latest attempt by the European Union to regulate tech companies and ensure a level playing field between online and traditional firms.
""No one is trying to kill, stop or hinder the development of the platform economy,"" Jobs and Social Rights Commissioner Nicholas Schmit said at a news conference introducing the proposals.
However, the rules were needed to ensure that new business models uphold labour laws, he said. 
The EU executive said the draft rules could apply to around 4.1 million of the 28 million workers at online platform companies across the 27-country bloc.
Internet firms that set pay and standards of conduct for their couriers would have to classify them as employees entitled to a minimum wage, paid holidays and pension rights, according to the draft rules.
Online food ordering and delivery companies, which are generally loss-making in an industry seen as ripe for consolidation, have fought court cases around Europe and the United States to have riders and drivers classified as self-employed contractors, rather than employees - with mixed results.
MIXED REACTIONS
Reactions to the EU plan varied, with CEO Jitse Groen of Europe's largest food delivery company Just Eat Takeaway.com, which also owns Grubhub in the United States, saying he welcomed them.
However, ""Delivery Platforms Europe"", a lobby group that includes Uber, Deliveroo, Glovo and Delivery Hero, said in a statement that what part-time drivers wanted most was flexibility on their working hours and the rules as proposed would lead to job losses. 
Petra Bolster of Dutch labour union FNV, which won lawsuits against Deliveroo and Uber over employment, noted the proposal included a list of five tests to help determine when couriers were self-employed.
""That's naive because platforms will use that as a toolkit to get around the criteria and get away with everything,"" she said. ""It is their entire profit model to avoid costs of employment.""
Under the EU proposal, companies will be considered employers if they supervise the performance of workers through electronic means, restrict their ability to choose their working hours or tasks and prevent them from working for third parties.
Crucially, the proposal shifts the burden of proof onto companies when a dispute arises as to whether a worker is a self-employed contractor or an employee.
SELF-EMPLOYED 'FICTION'
Leonid Popa, a Russian immigrant who was an Uber driver in the Netherlands for four years, said the idea he had been self-employed had been a ""fiction"" but he was left without work and forced to seek government assistance when the COVID-19 pandemic struck.
""The whole story was nonsense. There was no flexibility, you don't earn much, you have to work more than 40 hours to earn a basic living and there's just really no feeling of security,"" he said, adding that he hoped better regulation would help his former colleagues.
Giles Thorne, an analyst for Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), said the EU proposal would not destroy online ordering and delivery models, which were here to stay, but would give a little more power to couriers.

For consumers, the long-term result of European protections for workers would likely be a small increase in either prices or delivery fees.
But ""I would bet my bottom dollar that people keep ordering bento boxes online"", Thorne said.

Shares of CVS, however, were up 3.8% at $96.7 after it raised its 2021 profit forecast to $8.00 per share from prior estimate of $7.90 to $8.00, with the company seeing higher-than-expected COVID-19 vaccine and testing sale volumes in the fourth quarter.
Pharmacy chains like CVS have benefited from distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and tests during the pandemic. CVS has so far administered 50 million vaccines and 29 million tests, which is expected to generate over $3 billion revenue in 2021.
CVS said it now assumes COVID-19 related revenue will decline 60%-70% next year, but added there were moving parts to the outlook given the uncertainty regarding new variants, booster doses and availability of oral antiviral medications and their impact on testing demand.
""You can make a bull case on vaccine and testing for next year based on what is happening and especially if we go into the mode of an annual booster kind of thing,"" Chief Financial Officer Shawn Guertin said at the company's Investor Day.
The company said it will revise this estimate once it has more data and clarity on policy. 
The drugstore chain, which has seen its profit weighed down this year by higher medical costs in health insurer Aetna (NYSE:AET) due to the pandemic, expects COVID-19 to have a smaller impact on its insurance business next year.

CVS is still presuming COVID-19 will have a net negative impact next year, specifically in the Health Care Benefits segment, but will be significantly lesser than 2021, according to Guertin.
The company expects 2022 full-year adjusted profit between $8.10 and $8.30 per share, the midpoint of which was below analysts' estimates of $8.24.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The chief executives of major U.S. retailers including  Target  (NYSE:TGT),  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), Kroger (NYSE:KR), CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), Autozone and Best Buy on Thursday urged Congress to take action to address the online sale of stolen, counterfeit and dangerous consumer products.
The group called on Congress to crack down on anonymous online sales, citing the growing impact of organized retail crime.
""Retail establishments of all kinds have seen a significant uptick in organized crime in communities across the 
nation,"" the letter said.
""Criminals are capitalizing on the anonymity of the Internet and the failure of certain marketplaces to verify their sellers. This trend has made retail businesses a target for increasing theft.""
On Friday, the White House said it has been in contact with federal law enforcement officials over a string of flash mob ""smash and grab"" robberies of U.S. retail stores.
A wave of ""smash-and-grab"" crimes is plaguing upscale stores in major U.S. cities, with mobs of thieves making off with expensive goods in brazen raids. The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles have seen a several high-profile robberies.
The letter, which was also signed by the CEOs of Neiman Marcus, Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI), Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD), Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), calls on Congress to pass legislation to make it ""easier for consumers to identify exactly who they are buying from, and make it harder for criminal elements to hide behind fake screennames and false business information.""

The bill introduced in 2020 would require verification of third-party sellers on online retail marketplaces. It would also order online platforms allowing for third-party sellers of consumer products ""to authenticate the identity of high-volume third-party sellers"" to ""prevent organized retail crime"".
Online marketplaces would need to verify high-volume third-party sellers by obtaining seller’s government ID, tax ID, bank account information, and contact information.

Investing.com — MP Materials Corp (NYSE:MP) shares have strengthened 10% Thursday on the news it will build its initial rare earth metal, alloy and magnet manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, Texas. In addition, and arguably, more importantly, the company announced it has entered a long-term agreement with General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) to supply rare earth materials, alloy and finished magnets.
They will be used for the electric motors in more than a dozen models using GM’s Ultium Platform, with an incremental production increase that starts in 2023.
The facility will be 200,000 sq. ft and will also serve as the business and engineering headquarters for the company's expanding magnetics division, MP Magnetics. 
The deal is one that will be cheered by the Biden administration, with the U.S. needing to increase its rare earth production to meet its EV goals.
The initial facility will be able to produce roughly 1,000 tonnes of finished Neodymium magnets per year, with the potential to power approximately 500,000 EV motors yearly. Furthermore, they will also support other markets, such as clean energy, electronic and defense technologies.
“MP Materials has built an exceptional magnetics team and important commercial relationships that will accelerate our mission to restore the full rare earth supply chain to the United States,” said MP Materials Chairman & CEO James Litinsky. "

MILAN (Reuters) -Investors welcomed a pledge by new UniCredit Chief Executive Andrea Orcel to return at least 16 billion euros ($18 billion) to them under his new strategy to 2024, sending the Italian bank's shares to a 22-month high on Thursday.
UniCredit plans to generate sufficient new capital to pay out as cash and share buybacks almost two thirds of its market value, which has shrunk after the pandemic thwarted previous CEO Jean Pierre Mustier's bet on shareholder compensation.
""Whatever we do with this group we need to maintain our distribution at levels that .. are rewarding shareholders for all they have done,"" Orcel told a market presentation.
Mustier in 2017 raised 13 billion euros from shareholders to fund UniCredit's restructuring in one of Europe's biggest cash calls.
Shares in UniCredit, which lost its number one ranking last year to Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) after it snapped up smaller peer UBI, have been trading at a big discount to the sector.
They shot up 11% on Thursday to 12.8 euros on the much larger-than-expected capital distribution goal.
""Ambitious and encouraging,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said.
M&A POSSIBLE
With its excess capital reserves intact, UniCredit will still be in a position to evaluate potential mergers and acquisitions, Orcel said, having walked away in October from a rescue deal for state-owned rival Monte dei Paschi.
Only a large M&A transaction could cast doubt on the capital return goal, but the deals the bank has reviewed as it evaluates options would not fall into that category.
""We cannot ... squeeze this group as a lemon and not do the things we need to do because we're hostage to the 16 billion ... but I feel quite solid on it,"" he said.
Ditching its current 50% payout ratio, UniCredit plans to return 3.7 billion euros in 2022, with a 30% cash dividend component that will later rise to 35%.
That is higher than UniCredit's profit goals of 3.3 billion euros for both 2021 and 2022 based on a new definition which strips out one-off items and some special bond coupons.
""2022 is still a year of consolidation,"" Orcel said.
Net profit is projected to top 4.5 billion euros in 2024, growing on average by 10% as UniCredit cuts costs by 500 million euros over the period, net of digital investments and wage increases, and adds 1.1 billion euros to revenues.
With interest rates not expected to recover over the plan's timeline, UniCredit will bet on fees earned on the sale of wealth management and insurance products to drive revenue up 2% a year.
Confirming what sources had told Reuters last week https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/unicredit-cnp-eye-extension-call-option-insurance-jv-sources-2021-12-01, Orcel said UniCredit would reduce to just two or three its many insurance partners and revise agreements to retain a bigger share of placement fees, while also investing to drive sales.

Cutting risk weighted assets by around 15 billion euros in the next three years, UniCredit will bet instead on capital light businesses, including advisory and capital markets, to lift its return on equity to 10% in 2024 from around 7% this year.

This is evidenced in-part by the increased retail sales. Quality warehouse club stocks Costco (COST), BJ’s Wholesale (BJ), and  PriceSmart  (NASDAQ:PSMT) are expected to benefit ahead of the holiday season, and from the traditional last-minute shopping rush. So, we think it could be wise to add these stocks to one’s portfolio now. Read on.Last year’s holiday season was disappointing because people were confined to their homes amid the COVID-19 pandemic and travel was restricted. This year, however, consumer spending has picked up significantly in the months leading up to the holiday season and is expected to remain strong. According to the CNBC All-America Economic Survey, individuals on average are planning to spend $1,004 on gifts, which is 13% higher than they spent during the pandemic last year.
Investors remain worried about persistent supply chain issues and rising inflation. However, despite high inflation, retail sales rose faster than expected in October. Membership warehouse clubs are also likely to continue witnessing high foot traffic and increased sales as the holiday season approaches. Also, according to a Technavio report, the warehousing and storage market is expected to increase by $347.19 billion during 2021-2025, growing at a 6% CAGR.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally sound warehouse club stocks Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc. (BJ), and PriceSmart, Inc. (PSMT).

Read more to find out.Headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, ABB Ltd (ABB) manufactures and sells electrification, industrial automation, and robotics and motion products to customers in utilities, industry, and transport, and infrastructure worldwide. In comparison, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) in St. Paul, Minn., develops, manufactures, and markets various products worldwide. It operates through four business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer.
The resurgence of COVID-19 cases and rising concerns over its highly transmissible omicron variant have cast a pall over the global economic recovery. In addition, high inflation is keeping the market volatile. However, the continuing vaccination drive and supportive fiscal and monetary policies have boosted the industrial machinery sector’s growth. Moreover, the $1 trillion infrastructure bill, which was passed on November 15, and increasing innovation in the industry, are expected to help the sector grow significantly in the coming months. So, both ABB and MMM should benefit.
ABB’s stock has gained 34.8% in price over the past year, while MMM has returned 3.8%. Also, ABB’s 29.7% gains year-to-date are significantly higher than MMM’s 1% returns. Furthermore, ABB is the clear winner with 5% gains versus MMM’s negative returns in terms of the past months’ performance.

1643,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 12:22PM ET</span>",Superbonus! Italy's green growth gambit lines homes and pockets,"By Gavin Jones and Giuseppe Fonte
ROME (Reuters) -When Briton Candida Arvanitakis decided to make her 18th century Italian holiday home more energy efficient, she was pleasantly surprised to find it would cost her next to nothing as Italy is stumping up about 150,000 euros of the bill.
Under a scheme introduced in July last year the Italian government pays an eye-watering 110% of the cost of turning buildings green, from insulation to solar panels to replacing old-fashioned boilers and window fittings.
""It's a real incentive for people to reduce emissions. I only wish it existed in Britain too,"" said Arvanitakis.
The European Union estimates that three-quarters of the buildings in the bloc are energy inefficient. It says renovating them could cut carbon dioxide emissions by 5%, but less than 1% of the region's building stock is upgraded each year.
Not surprisingly, there has been a massive take-up in Italy's ""superbonus"" scheme which is seen as a litmus test for the sort of policies EU members may need to meet the bloc's goal of slashing greenhouse gas emissions this decade to 55% below 1990 levels.
On the plus side, Italy's council of engineers estimates it has boosted gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.7% this year and created 153,000 jobs - exactly the sort of growth story some economists say the green transition can deliver for decades.
On the down side, a surge in demand has inflated the cost of building services and Italy's tax collection agency said last month it had uncovered fraud worth more than $1 billion related to the superbonus and other home improvement incentives.
Critics also object to the high cost to the state, the fact that some of the main beneficiaries are well off and don't really need government handouts - and that the subsidies cover new gas heating and therefore continued fossil fuel use.
'CAN'T MEET DEMAND'
A number of other European countries, including France, the Netherlands, Hungary and Denmark also offer subsidies for green home improvements, though none are as generous as Italy.
The scheme, championed by Stefano Patuanelli, a minister from the ecologically-minded 5-Star Movement, is due to run through 2025 but will be reduced in size and availability from the end of next year. 
The impact on Rome's strained public finances is considerable. The Treasury estimates there will be a total outlay of 33 billion euros ($37 billion) by 2036 - once all the subsidies and credits have worked their way through the tax system - which is equivalent to almost 2% of annual GDP.
The average cost of the subsidised works carried out so far on the individual apartment blocks most Italians live in is 557,000 euros, according to Italian economic analysis and consultancy firm Nomisma.
""Work has more than doubled since the superbonus was introduced,"" says Luca Passerini, who owns a building firm in Rome. ""I have hired more labourers but we can't meet the demand. We are not taking on any new jobs until May.""
Climate analysts said it was too soon to measure the impact of the subsidies on household energy use but they welcomed the thrust of the measure in a country where homes account for 11.5% of emissions, according to the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA).
""It is clearly positive both for reducing emissions and improving the air quality of our cities,"" said Michele Governatori at the climate and energy think-tank ECCO.
However, he said the subsidy was probably too generous and initial confusion over its scope and duration led to a rush to cash in. That ""drugged"" the market, allowing builders to hike prices for work of sometimes dubious quality.
Governatori also criticised the fact that the bonus is applicable for gas heating, saying ""subsidies like this should exclude any use of fossil fuels"".
BUILDERS OR BUTCHERS?
One way for people to claim the subsidy is by deducting it from their tax returns over a five-year period. 
A more popular method is to use the tax credit to pay the building firm. It subtracts the sum from its taxes or sells the credit to a bank, which is reimbursed by the state.
The measure has been blighted by corruption. 
Italy's tax collection agency said last month it had uncovered fraud worth 950 million euros connected with the superbonus and other home improvement incentives.
""We found invoices for work that didn't exist, invoices issued by unqualified firms, even butchers that issued invoices for building work,"" said the agency's chief Ernesto Ruffini.
Italy ranks 52nd in Transparency International's global corruption perceptions index and is 21st out of the EU's 27 member states, above Greece and five Eastern European countries.
Italy's public finance watchdog, the Parliamentary Budget Office (UPB), said the goal of getting maximum emissions cuts at minimum cost was not being achieved by the scheme.
""The declared aim of energy efficiency risks creating excessive benefits for building firms,"" said UPB board member Alberto Zanardi. 
For all its alleged flaws, the superbonus scheme still stands out among Italy's efforts to meet its climate targets, which many experts say are far from sufficient.
They say Italy, which is heavily reliant on imported oil and gas, is doing too little to develop alternative energy sources and has not followed the lead of countries such as Germany and Spain in a major push towards electric vehicles.
""We are way behind in the switch to renewable energy and we are not on track to meet our emissions pledges,"" said ECCO's Governatori.

HAMBURG/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) CEO Herbert Diess will stay on with rejigged responsibilities, the carmaker said on Thursday, ending weeks of uncertainty about his future amid conflict with unions, as the company ratcheted up spending plans on electric cars.
Ralf Brandstaetter, who took over from Diess as head of the core Volkswagen brand last year, will join the board and lead a new division entitled Volkswagen Passenger Cars from Jan. 1, the company said in a statement.
He will also take over Volkswagen's China business from Diess from Aug. 1. However, Diess will take on responsibility for the company's software unit Cariad, which bears a key function in the company's transformation efforts.
""I cannot complain about a lack of responsibilities - I continue to feel fully responsible for the company,"" Diess said.
Diess's future had been in doubt following clashes with Volkswagen's powerful labour unions, although sources told Reuters as early as November he was likely to stay on.
Preference shares in the company traded 1% lower, giving up some gains after being boosted by speculation about a possible listing of luxury division Porsche AG earlier this week.
Diess' management and communication style, warning of tens of thousands of possible job losses in coming years and frequently highlighting the threat of competition from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), angered the carmaker's works council, prompting weeks of negotiations over his future at the firm.
At a news conference on Thursday, works council head Daniela Cavallo, who had lashed out at Diess for fuelling concerns among the carmaker's workforce, said she was happy with the outcome of negotiations.
""I have no interest for us to have these conflicts in public,"" Cavallo said. ""The conclusions of this planning round are clear: we have a solid and robust plan we can all be proud of.""
SPENDING HIKE
The company's supervisory board presented its annual update to the company's five-year rolling investment plan on Thursday, outlining investments of 159 billion euros ($180 billion) - up from 150 billion euros last year - including electrifying more of Volkswagen's sites across Europe.
Volkswagen Supervisory Board Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch said the group was able to fully fund the programme, adding the group had some intelligent financing concepts up its sleeve, without being more specific.
Spending for electric vehicles will be raised to 52 billion euros, up around half compared with last year's blueprint, which Diess said was also a reflection of the changes Volkswagen is going through to overtake Tesla.
""We are becoming a battery manufacturer, a charging infrastructure manager, software is playing a more dominant role ... we are developing new business activities with an unbelievable dimension for us,"" he said.
Diess said Volkswagen expected to generate 20 billion euros of revenue by 2030 from its battery division alone, which is being readied for a partial sale or listing.
The reorganisation of the leadership team would see the Volkswagen Group delegating management of individual car brands to focus on these overarching business areas, Diess said.

The world's second-largest carmaker also confirmed it expects its operating margin to be at the upper end of its 6-7.5% target range for 2021.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's chairman said on Thursday the regulator is considering toughening rules around how underwriters, boards of directors and sponsors of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPAC) structure fees, issue projections and disclose conflicts.
SEC chief Gary Gensler, in a keynote address to investor advocates, said the new rules would be intended to strengthen obligations of ""gatekeepers"" who facilitate fundraising at earlier stages of a blank-check company before it seeks an initial public offering (IPO).
SPACs - Wall Street's biggest gold rush of recent years - are listed shell companies that raise funds to acquire a private company and take it public, allowing targets to sidestep the more onerous regulatory checks of an IPO. The SEC is seeking to better scrutinize the SPAC deals market and boost SPAC investor protections.
""The investing public may not be getting like protections between traditional IPOs and SPACs,"" Gensler said at a meeting of the Washington-based Healthy Markets Association, underscoring a concern around how SPACs may be priming the market as they target a public offering. 

""Many gatekeepers carry out functionally the same role as they would in a traditional IPO but may not be performing the due diligence that we've come to expect,"" Gensler added. 
The SEC in September expanded its crackdown on the SPAC sector, telling top auditors https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-us-sec-cracks-down-second-time-spac-equity-accounting-treatment-2021-09-28 of these companies to account more strictly for public shares in these shells.

Furthermore, the stock looks overvalued at its current price level. So, we think hydrogen stocks Cummins (CMI),  Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG), and Ballard Power Systems (NASDAQ:BLDP) could now be better additions to one’s watch list. Wall Street analysts expect them to gain significantly in the coming months. So, let’s discuss these names.Integrated fuel cell company FuelCell Energy, Inc. (FCEL), which is based in Danbury, Conn., manufactures fuel cell technology platforms for power generation. The company’s revenue for its fiscal third quarter, ended July 31, 2021, increased 43.3% year-over-year to $26.80 million. Its gross profit came in at $1.10 million, compared to a $3.12 million loss in the year-ago period. Also, its shares have gained 33% in price over the past three months to close yesterday’s trading session at $7.61.
However, FCEL is currently trading 74.1% below its 52-week high of $29.44, which it hit on February 10, 2021. The stock soared in price after the $1 trillion-plus bi-partisan infrastructure bill was passed, which is expected to boost the demand for fuel cell power plants. However, Wall Street analysts expect the stock to hit $7.33 in the near term, indicating a potential 3.7% decline. The stock looks overvalued at the current price level. In terms of forward EV/S and P/S, FCEL’s respective 31.84x and 36.26x are higher than the 2.01x and 1.65x industry averages. In addition, its 11.53x forward P/B is 284.8% higher than the 3x industry average. So, the we think stock is best avoided now.
Even though hydrogen-fuel infrastructure is in its early stages of development, the industry is expected to witness significant growth in the long run, with governments moving to decarbonize fuel and promote clean energy usage. According to a BlueWeave Consulting report, the global green hydrogen market is expected to reach $6.84 billion by 2027, growing at a 57.7% CAGR.

1653,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 11:16AM ET</span>","Evergrande, Kaisa cut by Fitch to default after missed payment deadlines","By Clare Jim and Karin Strohecker
HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - Ratings agency Fitch downgraded property developers China Evergrande Group and Kaisa Group on Thursday, saying they had defaulted on offshore bonds, while a source said Kaisa had started work on restructuring its $12 billion offshore debt.
The downgrades to so-called ""restricted default"" status come even though Evergrande and Kaisa have not officially announced defaults that could result in drawn-out debt restructuring processes.
The fate of Evergrande, which has more than $300 billion in liabilities, and other indebted Chinese property companies has gripped financial markets in recent months amid fears of knock-on effects around the world, although Beijing has repeatedly sought to reassure investors. 
In its note on Evergrande, Fitch said the developer did not respond to its request for confirmation on coupon payments worth $82.5 million that were due last month, with the 30-day grace period ending this week, and so assumed ""they were not paid.""
Evergrande did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment on Fitch's decision while Kaisa declined to comment. 
""The defaults of Evergrande and Kaisa move us to the second step of this China Property downturn, with systemic risk being gradually replaced by idiosyncratic risk,"" said Robin Usson, credit analyst at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI). 
""It will be interesting to see the role played by SOEs (state-owned enterprises) in the restructuring process, the level of 'control' exerted by the government over this 'marketed-oriented approach',"" Usson added.
People's Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Yi Gang said on Thursday rights of Evergrande shareholders and creditors would be ""fully respected"" based on their legal seniorities, and the risk caused by a few Chinese real estate companies in the short term would not undermine Hong Kong's capital market. 
Dollar-bonds issued by Evergrande gained but remain in deeply distressed territory, trading between 18-29 cents. Kaisa dollar-bonds, most of which are trading around 34-35 cents on the dollar, nudged higher.
Fitch defines a restricted default as indicating an issuer has experienced a default or a distressed debt exchange, but has not begun winding-up processes such as bankruptcy filings and remains in operation.
The non-payment has triggered an ""event of default"" on Evergrande's bonds and its other U.S. dollar notes will become due immediately and payable if the bond trustee or holders of at least 25% in aggregate amount declare so, Fitch said. 
The same ""cross default"" is true for Kaisa, which, according to Refinitiv data, has note maturities totalling $2.8 billion next year, and $2.2-3.2 billion of maturities each year between 2023 and 2025.
Fitch said there was limited information available on Kaisa's restructuring plan after it missed $400 million in offshore bonds repayment on Tuesday.
Evergrande said last week it planned to forge ahead with a restructuring of its debt.
""Banks and bondholders (both local and foreign) will welcome debt re-profile exercises from companies with liquidity problems, as long as they are conducted in a fair, transparent and candid manner,"" Gustavo Medeiros at Ashmore Group wrote in a recent note to clients. The UK-listed asset management firm had exposure to both Evergrande and Kaisa bonds, according to recent filings. 
KAISA TALKS
Kaisa is expected to soon sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with Lazard (NYSE:LAZ), the adviser of a group of bondholders, the source and another person told Reuters. The bondholders hold over 25% of Kaisa's $12 billion offshore bonds. 
The NDA will lay the groundwork for further discussions on forbearance and financing solutions, the people said, who declined to be named as the talks are confidential. 
But an agreement is unlikely in the next few weeks as the talks are still at an early stage, the first source said.
Kaisa said it was open to talks on forbearance, but declined to comment on details. Lazard declined to comment.
The group of Kaisa offshore bondholders, which says it owns 50% of the notes that were due on Dec. 7, sent the company draft terms of forbearance late on Monday. 
The group previously offered $2 billion in fresh debt to help Kaisa repay its onshore and offshore debts, sources have said. Other financing ideas are also on the table.
Kaisa is also in talks with another bondholder group, the first person said. 

Kaisa's default came after it failed last week to secure the minimum 95% approval needed from offshore bondholders to exchange the bonds that were due Dec. 7 for new notes due June 6, 2023, at the same interest rate.
Trading in Kaisa's shares, which have lost 75% this year, was suspended on Wednesday. Evergrande's stock has plunged 88% this year.

1654,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 11:02AM ET</span>",Trucks catch up in the self-driving vehicle race,"By Nick Carey and Paul Lienert
OXFORD, England (Reuters) - We'd all be whizzing round in robotaxis by now if Elon Musk had been right.
Instead, fully self-driving cars are struggling to get away from the starting grid and some investors are betting that driverless trucks will reach the chequered flag first.
Only a year ago, startups developing robotaxis were pulling in eight times more funding than firms working on autonomous trucks, buses and logistics vehicles, but the gap has narrowed dramatically in 2021.
With fewer regulatory and technological hurdles, trucks operating on major highways, fixed delivery routes or in environments far from cyclists and pedestrians such as mines and ports are now being seen as a faster way to generate returns.
In the year through Dec. 6, total investment activity for self-driving logistics vehicles leapt fivefold to $6.5 billion from $1.3 billion in the same period in 2020, according to startup data platform PitchBook.
Investment activity for robotaxi firms https://reut.rs/3DEIdVU, meanwhile, fell 22% to $8.4 billion from $10.8 billion over the same period, the PitchBook data compiled for Reuters shows.
The numbers may even understate the trend as some robotaxi firms such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo are pumping more cash into their own autonomous trucking operations as well.
In the latest trucking deal, Robotic Research said on Thursday it has raised $228 million by tapping outside investors for the first time to expand its autonomous trucks, buses and logistics vehicles business. 
The new money comes from investors including SoftBank's Vision Fund 2, Enlightenment Capital and Luminar Technologies, which makes lidar sensors used in self-driving cars.
Robotic Research Chief Executive Alberto Lacaze told Reuters the company was deploying autonomous vehicles at scale where the business case works for customers ""right now"".
""They don't have to wait until 2025, unlike robotaxis where you need to have the cost of all the sensors come down by an order of magnitude,"" he said.
OVERPROMISES
As recently as 2019, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Musk had promised a million robotaxis ""next year for sure"", but self-driving cars that can navigate safely anywhere are still a long way off.
Peter Rawlinson, head of electric vehicle (EV) startup Lucid Motors, said last month it would be a decade https://reut.rs/3ocMXh4 before fleets of robotaxis hit the roads - even with the most advanced sensors.
PitchBook's lead mobility analyst Asad Hussain said startups such as Gatik, which makes autonomous short-haul vans, and Nuro with its mini delivery robots, could eclipse Waymo and rival Cruise over the next few years in commercialising at scale. 
Still, while long-haul trucks are easier to automate than robotaxis because major highways are simpler environments than bustling city roads, self-driving truck company executives are cautious about how fast they can ramp up.
""We're very cognizant of the overpromises that the industry has made,"" said Cheng Lu, chief executive of self-driving truck technology company TuSimple, which went public in April with a market value of $8.5 billion. 
""The industry understands the complexity of the problem now and that solving it will take a longer time,"" he said.
For now, TuSimple has a fleet of about 50 trucks with safety drivers aboard crisscrossing America's warmer southern states, but it plans to have a national network covering major U.S. highways by 2024.
That will involve major investments in mapping highways, learning how to handle tougher weather and road conditions further north and in new self-driving trucks being developed by Navistar (NYSE:NAV), which is part of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s Traton. 
'A LONG JOURNEY'
But rolling out a truly national network could take years as self-driving trucks still face a major challenge: human drivers.
An autonomous vehicle will always hit the brakes if it encounters a ""testosterone-laden human male"", said Ralf Klaedtke, chief technology officer at  TE Connectivity  (NYSE:TEL), which makes sensors and electronic systems to handle masses of self-driving data for the auto industry.
""The autonomous vehicle will always be the slowest in mixed traffic,"" he said. 
Paul Newman, founder of British autonomous vehicle software startup Oxbotica, says robotaxis remained his ""North Star"", his clear long-term goal. 
But for now he is focusing on simpler applications, some of which use a purpose-built, fully-electric self-driving vehicle from Australian startup Applied EV.
""This is a long journey,"" he says while showing off test vehicles at the company's headquarters in Oxford in England. ""It's one of the hardest engineering problems to solve."" 
Oxbotica is working on vehicles for mines in partnership with Wenco, part of Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) Construction Machinery, and on many different options with energy company BP (NYSE:BP), such as vehicles for remote wind and solar farms. 
Morag Watson, BP's senior vice president for digital science and engineering, said Oxbotica's technology could monitor large sites, or haul equipment out to humans undertaking repairs. She said they would be testing many different options in 2022.
""We've barely scratched the surface of what we can do with industrial autonomy,"" Watson said.
Oxbotica is also working with British online food delivery and technology company Ocado (LON:OCDO) which automates supply chain systems for the likes of U.S. retail chain Kroger (NYSE:KR). BP and Ocado have both invested in Oxbotica.
Alex Harvey, Ocado's head of advanced technology, said Oxbotica's technology could be used ""in the warehouse, in the yard, on the road, or kerb to kitchen"".
NO LEFT TURNS!
U.S. autonomous EV maker Outrider has targeted distribution yards - picking up trailers after truckers drop them off and lining up new ones to be hauled away - including at a Chicago yard for paper company Georgia-Pacific. 
Outrider has developed a robot arm for the truck to connect and disconnect trailers. It has raised $118 million so far and Chief Executive Andrew Smith says it will scale up to thousands of vehicles over the next five years.
The startup wants to start doing short hops between yards but operating on public roads adds complexity, Smith said.
""We saw through the early hype of the technology and recognised distribution yards were the perfect near-term solution with their repetitive, low-speed operations in confined environments,"" he said.
Going out on public roads requires moving carefully, partly because of regulations, but also because of legal pitfalls in a litigious market such as the United States.
Ian White, chief executive of digital insurer Koffie Labs, said a ""black swan billion dollar"" crash could wipe out any company that moves too fast and gets it wrong.
""You'd be putting your balance sheet on the line,"" he said. 
That's why Gatik has opted for a careful approach for its ""middle-mile"" delivery routes between distribution centres and retailers, Chief Executive Gautam Narang said.
Gatik's trucks run on short, predictable routes avoiding left turns across oncoming traffic, schools, hospitals, fire stations, blind turns - or anything complicated.
""We're not working on every tricky situation the autonomous vehicle industry is trying to solve,"" he said. ""We're taking baby steps using routes that are uneventful from a complexity standpoint."" 

Gatik works with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Loblaw Companies Ltd using autonomous trucks with safety drivers, though it operates some driverless routes in Arkansas and sees the global shortage of drivers as an opportunity.
""We decided to focus on a simpler use case where the need was very acute,"" Narang said. ""We're not building the technology for technology's sake.""

Investing.com – American Airlines stock (NASDAQ:AAL) traded 1.3% lower Thursday following a report in The Wall Street Journal that the carrier plans to trim the number of international flights next summer because Boeing hasn’t delivered new 787 Dreamliners owing to production problems.
The routes likely to be affected by the decision include Edinburgh, Shannon, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing and Sydney. The carrier isn’t bringing back seasonal flights to Prague or Dubrovnik, Croatia, and it is delaying the launch of certain routes, such as from Seattle to Bengaluru. The flight to India’s Silicon Valley was to begin next month.
Deliveries are expected to resume by April 1, 2022, at the earliest, which is later than previously anticipated, the WSJ report said.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) halted Dreamliner deliveries in October last year and has since been coordinating with the regulators for inspections so it can deliver the planes to its clients.
The manufacturer in October said its 787-production rate was approximately two planes per month. It said it expected to continue at that rate until deliveries resumed and then return to five per month over time, still a slow rate."

Read on.Springfield, Mass.-based firearm products manufacturer Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc. (SWBI) witnessed robust demand for its products earlier this year, due in varying degrees to COVID-19 pandemic-induced high demand, a change in the U.S. presidency, and civil unrest.

Furthermore, its shares plunged 29.9% on December 3, putting it on track for its biggest one-day selloff since March 2020. This is due primarily to its weaker-than-expected second-quarter earnings and a decline in demand levels from the pandemic-related highs.

And its cost-reduction programs are expected to help the company improve its margins. “I am excited and encouraged by the pace of demand in many of our end markets and our record backlogs, both of which position us well for fiscal 2022,” asserted George Oliver, chairman, and CEO.
For the fourth quarter, ended September 30, JCI’s non-GAAP sales increased 7% year-over-year to $6.40 billion, while its non-GAAP net income increased 12% from its year-ago value to $628 million. The company’s EPS increased 16% year-over-year to $0.88.
As overall economic activity picks up, the demand for building products is rising, which should benefit JCI. However, the newly identified COVID-19 omicron variant is threatening the global economic recovery with rising cases of infection. If the new variant leads to another COVID-19 surge, it could hamper the economic recovery and hurt JCI’s earnings growth. The company’s net income has declined at an 8.9% CAGR over the past three years.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is rolling out a new credit card and beefing up its existing rewards program in a bid to encourage up to 1 million wealth clients to use its banking services as well, executives said Thursday.
Chief Executive Brian Moynihan has called the preferred rewards program a key pillar of the bank's growth strategy. The new benefits aim to encourage clients of the bank's Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust wealth management businesses to open credit cards and checking accounts. 
""We have 1 million wealth clients who don't bank with us,"" John Sellers, head of preferred rewards, said in an interview. ""When they do, history tells us, they bring hundreds and thousands of dollars of incremental assets. The (new rewards offers are) a great carrot to hold out there."" 
The program offers awards like cash back and discounts on home loans to customers who kept more than $20,000, $50,000 or $100,000 with the bank, with the benefits increasing based on assets. 
Thursday's announcement adds perks for people who keep more than $1 million or more than $10 million at the bank, and it adds a new credit card - the premium rewards credit card elite. 
The strategy is to convince these customers the credit card rewards are so good that they will want to move more of their money and accounts to Bank of America, said Jason Gaughan, head of consumer card products. 

""These customers don't usually revolve a balance,"" so the bank does not earn much interest from them, Gaughan said. ""The value isn't really the card relationship. It's the entire relationship.""
Card holders who also qualify for the top rewards tiers can earn up to 3.5 points per $1 spent on travel and dining, as opposed to the 2 points per $1 for all other card holders.

1662,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 10:21AM ET</span>",Investor group faults new Exxon board members on climate transition plan,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) -A coalition of  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) investors wants the oil company to replace its chief executive officer and move more aggressively to slash greenhouse gas emissions, saying its newly appointed board members and management team have not done enough to transition to clean energy or overhaul spending.
Six months after hedge fund Engine No. 1 successfully placed three new directors on Exxon's board, the Coalition for a Responsible Exxon (CURE) said management and the board have been too slow to reshape the company.
Exxon's earnings have recovered from losses in 2020, posting third-quarter earnings of $6.8 billion on the back of rising oil prices, but the company has taken a slower approach to energy transition investment than most other oil majors.
""CURE awards the new board an overall grade of D- for failing to make any tangible progress on the targets set by us, other shareholders and independent observers at the time of the annual meeting,"" CURE, which has 145 members and oversees $2.5 trillion in assets, said in a report released on Thursday.
The group said Exxon's corporate plans to 2027, released earlier this month, do not meet a climate transition plan consistent with holding the rise in the world's temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The group said the plan fails to set segment-specific reduction targets for Exxon's midstream and downstream businesses.
Exxon set annual capital spending through 2027 at $20 billion to $25 billion, allocating money to low-carbon projects and extending its previously projected investment rate for two years.
The company said its plans increase spending to $15 billion on greenhouse gas emission-reduction projects over the next six years while maintaining disciplined capital investments in its industry-leading portfolio.
""The plans support the corporate strategy of continued structural cost savings, investment in low-cost-of-supply and lower-emission products, and further portfolio high-grading, positioning the company to double earnings and cash flow by 2027 versus 2019,"" Exxon spokesman Casey Norton said.
He added that the company is on track to meet its 2025 greenhouse gas emission-reduction plans by the end of 2021, four years ahead of schedule, and said the company developed more aggressive plans for further Scope 1 and Scope 2 reductions through 2030, consistent with Paris Agreement pathways. 
GROUP TARGETS CEO
The coalition again pushed Exxon to split its chairman and chief executive posts. 
Exxon, one of America's most well-known brands, has five new directors, including three voted in by shareholders earlier this year. CURE previously said the company's willingness to appoint the new directors signaled it ""may intend to change.""

CURE is now calling for CEO Darren Woods to be replaced and for the company to appoint an independent board chairman. The group also said the company's CEO and other top executives should receive incentive packages tied to achieving the 1.5 degree-aligned greenhouse gas targets.
The coalition also took issue with Woods' pay, noting that he was paid millions even as the company's value declined by billions of dollars in recent years.

1663,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 10:07AM ET</span>",Starbucks union drive spurred by barista burnout from mobile orders,"By Hilary Russ and Julia Love
NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) baristas waging a union campaign in Buffalo, New York, say they are organizing in part to have more of a say in the workload created by the company's mobile app, which has left them struggling to keep up with surges in orders for $6 Frappuccinos and other custom coffee drinks. 
On Thursday, the National Labor Relations Board will tally ballots from employees at three stores in the area. Baristas and shift supervisors there are seeking to join Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union. They need a simple majority of votes cast for each store to win at that location.
The pandemic has created a surge in mobile orders at Starbucks and other restaurant chains. The baristas in Buffalo and elsewhere complain that they cannot limit the number of mobile orders per hour, leading to unexpected surges they struggle to fulfill. 
Individual stores can turn off mobile orders completely for their locations temporarily, but that requires a manager's approval, the company confirmed, and customers can then order from other nearby locations.
Baristas said that adds to those other stores' burdens, but the company said such shifts do not necessarily lead to overflows in other stores.
The union election involves about 100 workers altogether, a tiny fraction of the roughly 220,000 employees in the U.S. cafes of Seattle-based Starbucks. But a win in Buffalo could catch fire as baristas who have also complained about thin staffing and little control over workplace conditions enjoy more power in a tight labor market. 
Since the Buffalo campaign was announced in August, three other nearby locations and one store as far away as Arizona have sought to follow its lead.
""We respect the process that is underway and, independent of any outcome in these elections, we will continue to stay true to our Mission and Values,"" Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson told employees in a letter on Tuesday.
Employees who spoke with Reuters said they want higher wages, seniority pay and better staffing levels. But burnout from mobile orders and frustration with other tech systems has been an important driver in the campaign, interviews with five workers suggest.
""Technology was made for customers and not for employees,"" said Casey Moore, a barista at one of the Starbucks locations whose votes are being counted on Thursday. ""Without a union we haven't been able to voice how the technology could also work for us.""
A Starbucks spokesman said the company is constantly updating its app based on employee and customer feedback. 
TICKING TIME BOMB
Moore and other employees interviewed by Reuters said they are not opposed to tech in principle but want more of a say in how it is developed and deployed in stores. 
When Starbucks launched seasonal holiday drinks and gave out free tumblers in November, the mobile ordering system was so inundated with orders at one Buffalo area store that staff fell behind by as much as 40 minutes and threw away at least 30 drinks abandoned by customers, said James Skretta, a barista there. 
The chain has about 20 stores in and around Buffalo. It launched its app in 2009 but added new ways to pay and earn points in 2020 as rewards memberships soared during the pandemic. 
The mobile order app ""completely changed what it means to be a barista,"" said Danka Dragic, a shift supervisor at one Buffalo area store.
Starbucks baristas are not the only workers who have balked at stores' high-tech makeovers. Five workers at a  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) location in Austin, Texas, quit after becoming overwhelmed with mobile orders, according to media reports.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc in June rolled out an app that it said enables employees to complete various tasks from their phones, but labor advocates warned the technology could open the door to more stringent productivity quotas.
A Walmart spokesperson said the app eases aspects of work including scheduling, clocking in and communication for employees.
""Workers across industries are challenging the creep of punitive technology in the workplace,"" Bianca Agustin, corporate accountability director at labor nonprofit United for Respect, said in a statement. 
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has fought to ensure sensors and other technology installed in  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) trucks are not used to punish drivers, and hospitality union UNITE HERE has pushed for tech aimed at boosting worker protection, including safety buttons for hotel cleaners.

Starbucks baristas also chafe at a performance management program that rates their customer service – especially because they are under pressure by other technology that tracks how fast they process drive-thru orders. 
""It's as though you are making drinks under the pressure of trying to defuse a ticking time bomb,"" Skretta said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Thursday, on course to end a three-day winning streak, after another set of lower-than-expected claims for jobless benefits again highlighted how hot the U.S. labor market is right now. 
The Labor Department said initial jobless claims fell to a new 59-year low of 184,000 last week, well below the 215,000 expected. Taken together with Wednesday's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey - which showed over 11 million unfilled jobs across the country - the figures point to a degree of tightness in the labor market that seems highly probable to stoke further inflation next year. That in turn may push the Federal Reserve to accelerate the tightening of monetary policy further. 
The labor data come a day before the government releases consumer inflation data for November, which are expected to show inflation running at nearly 7% year-on-year.
By 9:49 AM ET (1449 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 126 points, or 0.4%, at 35,629 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2%.
Among early movers, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock fell 1.2% and Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock fell 2.6% after the airline it would trim its capacity for the summer season next year due to the delayed delivery of Dreamliner jets.  That announcement comes only two days after the airline announced a change of management, with long-serving CEO Doug Parker set to step down in March. 
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock, meanwhile, drifted 0.2% lower after being hit with a $1.3 billion antitrust fine in Italy, the latest and one of the largest antitrust fines handed out to a U.S. company in Europe. GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock fell 4.8% after posting a wider full-year net loss and little fresh detail about its digital transformation after the close on Wednesday.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock fell 1.2% as investors fine-tuned their outlook for the next year, which remains clouded by the progress of the Omicron variant of Covid-19. Omicron, which is capable of at least partly avoiding the immune defenses triggered by existing vaccines, is fast becoming the dominant strain of Covid-19, and appears to be contributing to rapid increases in infections in both South Africa and Europe. 
In brighter news, home furnishings specialist RH's (NYSE:RH) stock rose 11.5% after posting results that saw it nudge full-year guidance for revenue and margins higher, despite sustained cost pressures from shipping and transportation. CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) stock, meanwhile, rose 2.8% after announcing a new $10 billion buyback and a promise of higher dividends at its annual investor day.
Electric vehicle stocks were broadly lower, as legacy carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) issued a reminder of its financial firepower as it tries to defend its current market share. The German carmaker is set to invest some $59 billion on e-mobility by 2026, an increase of 50% from its previous estimates. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was down 2.3% while Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) was down 8.1%. "

PlugShare is a platform used by electric vehicle drivers for locating and selecting public chargers. EVgo’s wholly-owned arm Recargo has developed the app that allows users to share their experiences and feedback around specific locations with other drivers, better plan both short and long range EV trips, rate their charging experiences.
EVgo acquired Recargo in July for $25 million in an all-cash transaction.
While awareness of EVs among consumers has increased over the year, many are still refraining from buying them over concerns related to the life of a single charge, the location of charging points and their accessibility.  
EVgo said as of July, there were seven unique PlugShare app installs for every 10 EVs in operation in the U.S. Since its inception, over 3.6 million unique Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Play accounts worldwide have downloaded the app to their devices, contributing to more than 3.8 million reviews of public charging locations."
1667,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 09:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Activist investor Macellum prepares Kohl's board challenge -sources,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Macellum Advisors GP LLC is planning to nominate directors to Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS)'s board because it believes the U.S. retailer has not done enough to improve its business, two people familiar with the matter said.
It would be the second time that Macellum has pushed for changes at Kohl's. It sought to replace nine board directors earlier this year in a campaign conducted with hedge funds Ancora Holdings Inc and Legion Partners Asset Management LLC.
The investors agreed to drop that challenge when Kohl's expanded its 11-member board by three directors.
Macellum, which is run by hedge fund veteran Jonathan Duskin, is preparing a slate of nominees with retail and operating experience to again challenge the Kohl's board early next year, the sources said. 
The firm is concerned about Kohl's languishing stock price and the fact that public markets are not valuing the bricks and mortar retailer properly despite its ample free cash flow and efforts made by management.
Kohl's stock is trading roughly where it was a decade ago. If the board had new directors with more operational experience, the company might be able to pursue steps like betting more on ecommerce or selling its real estate to improve the stock price, the people said.
The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Duskin declined to comment and a Macellum spokesman said a standstill agreement with Kohl's, which expires Jan. 11, prevents the fund from making any statement.
It was not clear whether Ancora and Legion might again be part of a group. Ancora did not respond to a request for comment and Legion could not be reached for comment.
A spokesman for Kohl's was not immediately available for comment.
Kohl's already faces pressure from another activist shareholder, Engine Capital. The firm, run by Arnaud Ajdler, urged Kohl's this week to sell itself or consider separating its e-commerce business.
""My number one priority, the number one priority of the board, is to drive shareholder value,"" CEO Michelle Gass told CNBC on Wednesday.
Kohl's shares have risen 26% this year, trailing gains made by rival retailers like Macy's (NYSE:M), whose stock price has jumped 143%.

As part of the settlement with the hedge funds earlier this year, Kohl's added former Lululemon CEO Christine Day, Thomas Kingsbury, a former CEO of Burlington Stores (NYSE:BURL), and Margaret Jenkins, a restaurant industry veteran, to its board.
Headquartered in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, Kohl's has 1,162 stores in the United States and a market value of $7.7 billion.

However, EBAY reported declining active buyers and value of goods sold in its most recent quarter due to shifting consumer preferences. So, is the stock a buy now? Keep reading to learn our view.Renowned multinational e-commerce company eBay Inc. (EBAY) in San Jose, Calif., operates marketplace platforms that connect buyers and sellers worldwide. The company gained substantially over the pandemic period because the closing of brick and mortar stores encouraged online shopping. However, that momentum is fading as people resume in-person shopping. EBAY posted a disappointing holiday sales outlook, with sales expected to be $2.57 billion - $2.62 billion in the period ending in December, versus analysts' $2.65 billion estimate. EBAY’s shares slipped on the news, which indicates declining active buyers on its online marketplace. Furthermore, the lean holiday outlook is partly due to inventory shortages and the global supply chain crunch.
Over the past month, EBAY’s stock has declined 9% in price to close its last trading session at $67.16. The stock is currently trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. However, it has gained 34.6% over the past year and 33.7% year-to-date.

Third-quarter net revenue rose 19% to top $1 billion as the company rode a booming housing market to sell more of its upmarket hand-crafted rugs and bed linen.  
In its third revision of the year, the company said its annual revenue is likely to grow by 32%-33% compared to the previous forecast of a 31%-33% rise. The company had booked $2.84 billion in net revenue for the year ended January 30, 2021.
The company also expects to withstand any pressure on profit margins from continued shipping and port delays. Adjusted operating margin is seen a tad higher at 25.4% at the center of the guidance range, compared to 25.2% at midpoint of the previous forecast and an improvement of 360 basis points from last year. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percent. 
Adjusted net income rose 25% to $209 million, helped by control of selling, general and administrative expenses and by lower interest costs.

Given this sentiment, Wall Street analysts expect two beaten-down stocks, Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) and Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON), to rally significantly in 2022. So, we think it could be worth adding these stocks to one’s watchlist. Read on for a more detailed discussion.Investor fears about the spread of the COVID-19 omicron variant have contributed to stock market volatility. Adding to the concerns, last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated that the Fed might consider speeding up the tapering of its monthly bond purchases.
In October, inflation hit a record high of 6.2%, its highest level since December 1990. So, to keep inflation from spiraling out of control, the Fed plans to tighten its monetary policy. Nevertheless,  Goldman Sachs Group , Inc. (NYSE:GS) expects the S&P 500 to hit 5,100 by the end of 2022.
The shares of Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) and  Peloton Interactive Inc . (PTON) have suffered significant price declines recently. However, given their strong fundamentals and solid growth attributes, Wall Street analysts expect these stocks to gain substantially in the next 12 months.

However, considering the growing competition in this space and NEE’s mixed profit margins, is it worth adding the stock to one’s portfolio? Read on. Let’s find out. NextEra Energy Inc . (NYSE:NEE) in Juno Beach, Fla., is a leading clean energy company that generates clean, emissions-free electricity from seven commercial nuclear power plants in Florida, New Hampshire, and Wisconsin. The company also owns a competitive clean energy business, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC, which, combined with its affiliated entities, is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from wind and solar and a world leader in battery storage.
The company’s shares have gained 23.4% in price over the past year due to strong investor interest in the renewable energy sector, thanks in-part to President Biden's plans to address climate change.
However, several new companies have entered the space with no product pipelines or the financial strength to capitalize on the nascent sector. Consequently, many analysts feel the clean energy industry has entered a bubble. This, coupled with the stock market's rising volatility, could threaten NEE’s price performance in the near term.

The highly automated system allows the driver to focus on other activities while a car equipped with the technology is in heavy traffic or on congested highways, Mercedes-Benz said in a statement on Thursday.
Germany's KBA authority approved the system based on technical requirements laid out in United Nations regulations.
""The KBA is setting national, European and international standards in road safety on the road to autonomous driving,"" said the authority's president, Richard Damm, in a statement.
Beyond the U.N. regulation on technical requirements, countries also have to pass legislation clarifying where and how such systems can be used, as well as issues of liability. 
""With this milestone, we are once again proving our pioneering work in automated driving and also initiating a radical paradigm shift,"" said Markus Schaefer, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) chief technology officer. 
As soon as legislation in China and the United States is in place, Mercedes-Benz will offer the system in those markets, Schaefer added.
Germany's approval means Mercedes-Benz can offer the S-Class with Drive Pilot to customers in Germany in the first half of 2022.

Such Level 3 automated systems have been allowed in Germany since 2017. According to Mercedes-Benz, there are over 13,100 kilometres (8,140 miles) of motorway suitable for the Drive Pilot system in Germany. 
The KBA approved the system for driving speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour (37 miles per hour). It has not decided whether to clear it for speeds of up to 130 kph, or a lane-change assistant that would automate overtaking another car.

Cyber security has been an increasingly critical issue for companies and financial institutions, including small and medium-sized enterprises, as attacks have increased in terms of numbers and impact. 
They have increased further as many companies have shifted towards hybrid work models during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The governor of the Bank of Italy in October warned that financial institutions were more exposed to such risks, with cyber attacks on European banks increasing by 54% this year, and called for greater care in monitoring and managing them. 
Generali's new services will be offered globally, starting in Europe at the beginning of 2022. 

They include cyber risk assessment, simulations of phishing attacks and learning programmes to strengthen clients' ability to prevent attacks but also to restore normal operations and minimise the consequences after an attack.
""Technology, consumer needs and cyber risks evolve rapidly, and the insurance industry must accelerate to embrace new digital opportunities and respond to increasing cybersecurity needs,"" Generali Group Chief Transformation Officer Bruno Scaroni said in a statement.

1682,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 07:27AM ET</span>",Once-Hot IPOs Stumble as Market Volatility Picks Up,"(Bloomberg) -- A banner year for tech-related initial public offerings is poised to go out on a sour note as returns dwindle in a surge of stock market volatility that’s prompted a flight to quality among investors. 
More than 130 technology IPOs raised more than $60 billion in the U.S. this year, record hauls for both metrics, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. They comprised about one-third of the entire IPO market, excluding special purpose acquisition companies and direct listings. Recent trading returns, however, have been lackluster. 
While behemoths like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). on a record-setting spree, many newly listed tech entrants are still lagging. Software IPOs in particular have been pummeled amid broader concerns that higher interest rates will put pressure on the group’s lofty valuations. 
This year’s software IPOs surged by an average of 23% during their first month of trading, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. All of that rally has been erased after new listings took the brunt of the past week’s wild market swings.
Take Vian Technology Inc., for example. The maker of advertising software surged 75% in its first month of trading, but has now fallen 60% below the offering price.  
Three of the past four software debuts have fallen 30% or more from their offering prices. Grab Holdings Ltd. is also trading down since it went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company at the beginning of the month. 
If not reversed, the weakness may threaten appetite for IPOs during the final weeks of December and at the start of 2022, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Alison Williams wrote in a note.
“Recent equity market volatility bears watching after equity-price strength and generally muted volatility has supported issuance levels so far this year,” she said.
Didi Global Inc.'s (NYSE:DIDI) IPO ranks among the year’s biggest flops. The value of the ride-hailing giant’s shares have been sliced in half since its June offering amid regulatory pressure in China that prompted an announcement from Didi last week that it plans to delist from the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD), the brokerage that became synonymous with the rise in retail trading last year, has fallen more than 40% amid slowing growth. Health-care platform  Oscar Health  Inc (NYSE:OSCR) has lost three-quarters of its value since its March offering. 
Of course, there have been plenty of big winners. Roblox Corp (NYSE:RBLX), the owner of a popular video-game platform, has soared 177% since it began trading in March as users continue to surge. Fintech company  Affirm Holdings  Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM), which offers buy-now, pay-later programs for shoppers, has rallied 161% since its January debut.
Having little to show for revenue hasn’t stopped young electric-vehicle makers from rallying.  Rivian Automotive  Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN), whose IPO last month was the biggest of the year, has gained 57%. Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID), which began trading in July after merging with a blank-check company, is up more than 80% since then.
Tech Chart of the Day
With Apple approaching the $3 trillion market value landmark, investors have a reason to be nervous. When the stock broke through both the $1 trillion and $2 trillion thresholds for the first time, it was followed by a fall. After reaching the first trillion, the shares corrected 40%, while a 20% drop came soon after the second trillion was breached.

1683,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 07:26AM ET</span>",Italy fines Amazon record $1.3 billion for abuse of market dominance,"By Elvira Pollina and Maria Pia Quaglia
MILAN (Reuters) -Italy's antitrust watchdog said on Thursday it had fined Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) 1.13 billion euros ($1.28 billion) for alleged abuse of market dominance, in one of the biggest penalties imposed on a U.S. tech giant in Europe.
Amazon said it ""strongly disagreed"" with the Italian regulator's decision and would appeal.
Global regulatory scrutiny of tech giants has been increasing after a string of scandals over privacy and misinformation, as well as complaints from some businesses that they abuse their market power.
As well as Amazon, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) have drawn heightened scrutiny in Europe.
Italy's watchdog said in a statement that Amazon had leveraged its dominant position in the Italian market for intermediation services on marketplaces to favour the adoption of its own logistics service - Fulfilment by Amazon (FBA) - by sellers active on Amazon.it. 
The authority said Amazon tied to the use of FBA access to a set of exclusive benefits, including the Prime label, that help increase visibility and boost sales on Amazon.it. 
""Amazon prevents third-party sellers from associating the Prime label with offers not managed with FBA,"" it said.
The Prime label makes it easier to sell to the more than 7 million most loyal and high-spending consumers members of Amazon’s loyalty program.
The antitrust authority also said it would impose corrective steps that will be subject to review by a monitoring trustee. 
Amazon said FBA ""is a completely optional service"" and that the majority of third-party sellers on Amazon do not use it. 
""When sellers choose FBA, they do so because it is efficient, convenient and competitive in terms of price"", the U.S. group said in a statement.
""The proposed fine and remedies are unjustified and disproportionate"", it added.
The EU Commission said it had cooperated closely with the Italian competition authority on the case, within the framework of the European Competition Network, to ensure consistency with its two own ongoing investigations into Amazon's business practices. 
The first was opened in July 2019 to assess whether Amazon's use of sensitive data from independent retailers who sell on its marketplace was in breach of EU competition rules. 
The second, in late 2020, focussed on the possible preferential treatment of Amazon's own retail offers and those of marketplace sellers that use Amazon's logistics and delivery services. 

""This investigation complements today’s decision of the Italian competition authority which addresses Amazon’s conduct in the Italian logistics markets,"" the Commission said on Thursday.

(Reuters) - The United States rushed millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses for children ages 5 to 11 across the nation, but demand for inoculations for younger kids has been low, more than a dozen state public health officials and physicians said. 
Of the 28 million eligible U.S. children in that age group, around 5 million have received at least one dose, according to federal data, likely satisfying initial pent up demand from parents who were waiting to vaccinate their kids.
At the current pace, fewer than half of U.S. children ages 5 to 11 are expected to be fully vaccinated in the coming months, state officials told Reuters. Some states, including Mississippi, said thousands of vaccine doses are sitting idle. 
“We are concerned that the demand is not going to be as quick and as great as it was for the adult population,” said Karyl Rattay, director of Delaware’s division of public health.
A smaller dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for those aged 5 to 11 received U.S. authorization last month, with the first shots going into young arms on Nov. 3.
Vaccine hesitancy among adult caregivers has affected the vaccination rate for this age group more than other groups, physicians told Reuters. 
""I think parents are nervous. There's probably a cohort of parents who felt comfortable vaccinating themselves... but are hesitant to vaccinate their children,"" said Dr. Matthew Harris, a pediatrician leading COVID-19 vaccinations for the Northwell Health hospital system in New York.
The push to vaccinate children has taken on fresh urgency amid concerns that the new Omicron variant of the virus, first identified in southern Africa and Hong Kong in late November, will spread quickly in the United States, causing a surge in infections already back on the rise from the easily transmitted Delta variant. 
Given the pervasiveness of Delta and prospects of new variants spreading in the United States, ""having as much immunity in the population as possible is critical,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.
While serious illness and death from COVID-19 among children is relatively rare, cases among unvaccinated people under age 17 have increased in recent months. Infected children can also pass COVID-19 to other people at higher risk of serious illness, including those who have already been vaccinated.
Some parents have been concerned about reports of heart inflammation, a rare vaccine side effect seen in young men at higher rates than the rest of the population.
On Tuesday, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said the agency has been scouring its database of adverse events and has not found any reports of the condition among 5- to 11-year-old recipients of the vaccine. 
The children's vaccine rollout may also be hampered by staffing shortages at healthcare providers, and greater reliance on pediatricians as opposed to larger and more efficient mass vaccination centers, said Sean O'Leary, a professor of pediatrics at University of Colorado. 
Fewer than 20% of U.S. children ages 5 to 11 have gotten at least one shot so far, compared to around 80% of U.S. adults, according to federal data. Of particular concern is that the number of U.S. children getting COVID-19 shots may already be plateauing. 

In the past week, more children have been receiving a second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine than a first, according to government data. That suggests a slowdown in demand aside from those who were anxious to get their kids vaccinated at the first opportunity. 
""I think what we were hoping for was that parents would have these meaningful conversations with pediatricians and that would provide them confidence to vaccinate their kids,"" Northwell's Harris said. ""I'm not sure that that's really come to fruition.""

The company is holding its 2021 Investor Day today and issued a statement ahead of it. CVS’s optimistic outlook comes amid a record period for the chain and its rivals including Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA), all of whom have benefited from the Covid-19 fallout and concerns around health arising out of the pandemic.
The company also initiated guidance for the next year, projecting revenue of around $309 billion. 
It guided for adjusted earnings per share of $8.20 at midpoint of the range for the next financial year.
As part of its long-term growth trajectory, CVS is targeting a return to low double-digit adjusted EPS growth in 2024.

1688,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 07:07AM ET</span>","Alibaba's e-commerce empire under threat from Douyin, Pinduoduo","By Sophie Yu and Josh Horwitz
BEIJING (Reuters) -For more than a decade,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group has been China's undisputed e-commerce king but of late its crown has shown signs of slipping, unsettled by an influx of aggressive competitors into the sector.
This week, Alibaba announced it was reorganising its e-commerce businesses https://www.reuters.com/technology/alibaba-names-toby-xu-cfo-2021-12-06 into two units, one for China and one for overseas.
In China, its two main marketplaces - Tmall for established brands and Taobao which welcomes all kinds of merchants - process over $1 trillion in orders annually.
But Alibaba is seeing sharply slower growth in customer management revenue (CMR), the money derived from charging merchants for services which usually accounts for one-third to one-half of its overall revenue. It rose just 3% in the July-September quarter, down from 20% growth a year earlier.
Alibaba last month also cut its annual revenue forecast https://www.reuters.com/business/chinas-alibaba-misses-quarterly-revenue-expectations-2021-11-18 while sales or gross merchandise value (GMV) for Singles Day, its banner shopping event, this year climbed only 8.5% https://www.reuters.com/business/chinese-state-newspaper-blasts-worship-turnover-after-alibabas-singles-day-2021-11-12 - the smallest rise to date.
Those disappointing numbers are due in part to regulatory changes and pandemic-induced slower economic growth that has made shoppers reluctant to splurge.
But they also highlight the onslaught of competition and the fact that some rivals have stolen a march over Alibaba in the fastest-growing areas of China's e-commerce.
Merchants and analysts cite ByteDance's Douyin - the Chinese sister app to TikTok and a relative newcomer - as the force to beat in live-streaming e-commerce, while Nasdaq-listed  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc has taken the lead in rural and budget e-commerce. 
""Other platforms are growing faster than Alibaba, which means they are eating Alibaba's lunch,"" said Lu Zhenwang, CEO of Shanghai-based Wanqing Consultancy.
Alibaba said in a statement to Reuters it has always faced intense competition. It added it offers merchants a powerful live-streaming tool in Taobao Live and that its Taobao Deals platform for discount shopping and Taocaicai platform for community group buying were gaining share in lower-tier markets.
AN UP-AND-COMING DOUYIN 
Douyin is targeting a jump in GMV to over 1 trillion yuan ($155 billion) this year, according to a company source with direct knowledge of the matter. The source was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.
That's more than 6 times the 150 billion yuan it was on track to earn last year - a figure given by sources in November 2020.
Douyin declined to comment on its e-commerce business.
The app, which boasts 600 million-plus daily active users, began allowing merchants to open stores on its platform in 2018. This year the company has made it easier for brands to open flagship stores.
Yatsen, the parent of Chinese cosmetics giant Perfect Diary, plans to invest more in its Douyin presence. By comparison, its sales on Tmall, which accounts for about 40% of its revenue, are contracting.
""Douyin, right now, is becoming a very important factor for brand growth,"" CEO Huang Jinfeng told an analysts' call last month.
Merchants are attracted to the amount of time users spend on Douyin - 1,871 minutes on average in October compared to 350 minutes on Taobao, according to consulting firm Questmobile. 
Moreover, while Alibaba's viewer traffic tends to converge on China's biggest live-streaming celebrities - Li Jiaqi, known as the Lipstick Brother, and Viya, a former singer - they are just two people. In contrast, Douyin can draw on a large pool of live streamers.
Zen Yan, a 42-year-old auditor living in Beijing, is an avid Douyin shopper.
""It's easy to spend one hour or more surfing on Douyin every day after work and there are a lot of influencers selling all kinds of things,"" she said.
CHEAP AND POWERFUL
At the other end of the e-commerce spectrum is Pinduoduo. It's popular among China's rural residents thanks to rock-bottom pricing and a group buying model that encourages users to share their purchases on messaging platforms to get cheaper prices.
Its GMV surged 66% to 1.67 trillion yuan in 2020. While more modest 20% GMV growth is expected in the fourth quarter, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), that would still be much stronger than Alibaba's recent showings.
Pinduoduo declined to comment.
Rural e-commerce is more of a people business than regular e-commerce and Alibaba is years behind Pinduoduo in forming relationships with key local merchants and manufacturers, analysts say.
""For consumers who are already used to Pinduoduo to buy bargains, it's hard for them to switch to a new platform. The same goes for factories or local grocery vendors who are used to Pinduoduo,"" said Daphne Tuijn at Shanghai-based analytics company Chaoly.
Alibaba also can't engage in viral marketing as effectively as Pinduoduo, hampered by its lack of direct access to a messaging platform like Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY)' WeChat, she added.
RIVALS AND REGULATIONS
Alibaba is revamping its e-commerce business - the newly unveiled reorganisation follows the launch of Taobao Deals last year and a rebranding of two community marketplaces into Taocaicai in September.
Even so, its challenges are plentiful and analysts doubt Alibaba can turn back the clock to when it was showing the fastest growth in Chinese e-commerce.
Douyin and Pinduoduo are only two of at least 10 established competitors. JD (NASDAQ:JD).com remains its closest rival while Meituan and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), giants in search and food delivery respectively, are expanding their e-commerce offerings. At the same time, smaller startups are targeting niche segments like shoes and makeup.
And while its impact has been hard to quantify, Alibaba has also been hurt by a regulatory crackdown that forced it to abandon a policy of requiring interested merchants to exclusively set up shop on its platforms. 

""I don't believe Alibaba can reverse the situation...it can only adopt a defensive strategy,"" said Wanqing Consultancy's Lu.

1690,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 07:04AM ET</span>",Dow Futures Fall 110 Pts; Jobless Claims Data Due,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally lower Thursday, as investors take stock after three days of solid gains on lessening concerns over the Omicron virus and ahead of important unemployment data.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 110 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 15 points, or 0.3%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 65 points, or 0.4%.
The major averages all closed higher Wednesday, the third day of gains, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 0.1%, the S&P 500 up 0.3%, creating the biggest three-day rise of the year for this broad-based index, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rising 0.6%.
Global equities have been helped this week by indications that the Omicron strain was not as medically damaging as previous variants. Wednesday’s statement from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) that their vaccine appears to be effective against the new variant after three doses added to the positive sentiment. That message suggests that the booster shot programs being rolled out across North America and Europe will keep infection rates low until the pharma industry has had time to tailor its vaccines to the new variant.
Still, the Covid pandemic is far from over, with the U.K. Health Security Agency warning that the U.K. could register one million cases by the end of this month given the steep trajectory of the Omicron variant.
Investors also appear to be playing a waiting game ahead of Friday’s November inflation report, with a high number expected to cement a move by the Federal Reserve to speed up its tapering plans next week.
Consumer prices are expected to rise 0.7% month-over-month, equating to an annual rise of 6.8%, the highest level for over 30 years.
Ahead of that, the latest weekly U.S. jobless claims data, the most up-to-date gauge of the strength of the country’s labor market, are due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT).
In the corporate sector, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will be in the spotlight after Italy's antitrust watchdog fined the online retail giant 1.13 billion euros ($1.28 billion) for alleged abuse of market dominance, in one of the biggest penalties imposed on a U.S. tech giant in Europe.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) will also be in focus after the troubled video game retailer released another quarterly loss and disclosed a subpoena from the U.S. securities regulator for documents on a probe into its share trading activity. 
Additionally, the likes of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) release earnings after the close.
Oil prices handed back some of the recent strong gains on increasing optimism that the new variant will not cause a significant hit to crude consumption.
Wednesday’s U.S. crude oil supply data from the Energy Information Administration showed a draw of 240,000 barrels for last week, less than the previous week’s 910,000-barrel draw and also below the draw of 3 million barrels indicated by the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% lower at $71.91 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.7% to $75.33. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,779.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1310.

The CEO had cited the market, performance and productivity as reasons behind the decision to lay off employees in the United States and India.
Better.com said in May it would go public through a merger with blank-check firm Aurora Acquisition Corp, in a deal that valued it at $7.7 billion.
Earlier this month, the terms were amended to provide Better.com with half of the $1.5 billion committed by SoftBank immediately, instead of waiting till deal close.
Founded in 2016 and headquartered in New York, Better.com offers mortgage and insurance products to homeowners through its online platform.

1692,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 06:31AM ET</span>",Companies divided on draft EU rules for gig economy workers,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The European Commission published draft rules on Thursday to give workers at online platform companies such as Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Deliveroo better social rights, but which companies say could lead to job losses and more litigation in court. 
Following are initial reactions to the proposals:
UBER SPOKESPERSON: 
""Uber is committed to improving the working conditions for the hundreds of thousands of drivers and couriers who rely on our app for flexible work. 
""But we are concerned the Commission's proposal would have the opposite effect - putting thousands of jobs at risk, crippling small businesses in the wake of the pandemic and damaging vital services that consumers across Europe rely on.
""As countries including France have demonstrated, there is a better way and any EU-wide rules should allow drivers and couriers to retain the flexibility we know they value most, while allowing platforms to introduce more protections and benefits.""
DOMINICK MOXON-TRITSCH, BOLT'S VP OF REGULATION & PUBLIC POLICY:
""We are disappointed that the European Commission is proposing to sacrifice the flexibility and efficiency of platform work through the reclassification of employment. It seems to be a one-sided approach that doesn't take all available options into consideration. 
""The proposal made by the Commission means that hundreds of thousands of ride-hailing drivers and delivery couriers would lose the opportunity of platform work, as platforms would be forced to shift to an exclusive full-time employment model. 
""This would negatively impact working conditions for platform workers, reduce their earning opportunities, and severely impact tens of millions of European citizens who benefit from platform services today."" 
RAPID DELIVERY COMPANY GORILLAS:
""We have employed our team members through permanent contracts to provide access to health insurance, social security, paid sick-leave, vacation times, and fair wages above minimum wage. 
""In this spirit, we have grown from 0 to over 12,000 employees in less than two years. And as we are highly invested in creating an environment where all of our team can grow, we are also convinced that our current economy requires a certain amount of flexibility to allow for innovations to develop.""
PETRA BOLSTER OF DUTCH LABOUR UNION FNV: 
""This proposal tackles abuse and exploitation of a large group of workers. We see this proposal as a great step forwards. 
""Platform workers deserve security about their income and work, protection from sickness and say over their working hours. Provisions such as pay to be on call, sick pay, time off, vacation pay and pensions must apply to them too.""
DELIVERY HERO 
""Delivery Hero fully supports the European Commission’s aim to improve the labor conditions of platform workers.
""However, we strongly believe that the suggested criteria to trigger the proposed rebuttable presumption of employment and reversed burden of proof are too broad and would not contribute to that goal. This would also have disproportionate restrictions for self-employed platform workers and put limitations on the flexibility we know they value most.""
JITSE GROEN, CEO AT JUST EAT (OTC:JSTTY) TAKEAWAY:
""As Europe's largest food delivery platform, Just Eat Takeaway.com welcomes and fully supports the EU Commission's proposals to improve conditions for workers and help them access social protections. 
""We hope that the Commission's proposal will create clarity and a level playing field that ensures that companies across Europe are held to the same standards, so that all platform workers are treated with the dignity they deserve."" 
DENNIS RADTKE MEP, EPP GROUP SPOKESMAN ON SOCIAL AFFAIRS

""The EU has high standards when it comes to fair working conditions. Platforms like Uber or Deliveroo cannot be the exception. 
""New ways of doing business should not lead to precarious working conditions. That is why I am happy to see that the European Commission has listened to our urgent calls for better rights for workers of these platforms.""

PARIS (Reuters) -Vivendi will buy activist fund Amber's stake in Paris Match owner Lagardere ""in the coming days,"" it said on Thursday, accelerating a deal that would extend its influence over French media ahead of next year's presidential election.
Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) announced in September its plan to acquire Amber's almost 18% stake in Lagardere for 24.10 euros per share and then file a full takeover offer at the same price.
Back then, it said it expected to complete the stake purchase by Dec. 15, pending the required regulatory clearance, but on Thursday it said it would speed up the transaction.
""Recent analyses carried out by Vivendi have led the company to consider that this acquisition could take place now,"" it said in a statement. 
It added that to comply with merger regulations, it would not exercise the voting rights deriving from the Amber stake acquisition or the tender offer on minority shareholders until the necessary regulatory approvals had been obtained. 
""As a result, the Vivendi Management Board has decided to authorize the immediate acquisition of the Lagardere shares owned by Amber Capital,"" the group said. 
The deal will lift Vivendi's Lagardere stake to 45.1%, with the tender offer for the remaining shares to be filed by February 2022.
The acquisition means Vivendi, which already owns pay TV group Canal+ and right-leaning news channel CNEWS, will gain control over Lagardere's flagship magazine Paris Match, weekly newspaper Journal du Dimanche and radio station Europe 1.
The media ambitions of Vivendi's billionaire top shareholder Vincent Bollore have ruffled feathers in President Emmanuel Macron's inner circle, sources have said, with some fearing his empire building could result in airwaves dominated by right-wing views ahead of the April 2022 presidential election.

One of the candidates, far-right commentator Eric Zemmour, used to have a paid position on CNEWS and he frequently appeared on air. He is no longer on the channel. 
Vivendi has declined to comment on media reports that Bollore was backing Zemmour in the presidential race, with a source saying neither the company nor its largest shareholder had ever expressed their support for Zemmour.

Investing.com -- Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) shares fell by 3.7% on Thursday as the aero engine maker warned that the pace of recovery from the ongoing challenges of the Covid pandemic remains uneven.
The company said its restructuring programme is running ahead of plan, allowing it to generate free cash flow in the third quarter and putting it on track to beat its forecast of net cash outflows of 2 billion pounds ($2.6 billion) for the full year. It expects to have cut more than 8,500 jobs by the end of the year, and to hit its 1.3 billion-pound savings target by the end of 2022.  
The improvement to 2021 is, however, due partly to shifting 300 million pounds of liabilities into next year, in line with deferred deliveries of aircraft using Rolls-Royce engines.
The company said its engine flying hours are currently around half of 2019 levels but that large engine flying hours were recovering as key travel corridors, especially transatlantic routes, reopened.
In civil aerospace, installed engine sales and shop visit activity were both lower than the previous year, while current trading in defense was in line with expectations.
Chief executive of Rolls Royce (LON:RR), Warren East, said the company is delivering on the elements in its control.
""We have achieved good results with our fundamental restructuring program, as we sustainably reduce costs and deliver a leaner and more efficient company,"" East said.

Investing.com – Amazon stock (NASDAQ:AMZN) was down 0.5% in premarket trade on Thursday after Italy’s competition regulator slapped it with a 1.13-billion-euro ($1.28 billion) penalty for alleged abuse of its market dominance.
The stock closed flat Wednesday.
The fine is one of the biggest imposed on a U.S. tech giant in Europe and comes out of one of the many cases the region’s regulators are pursuing against American companies over concerns ranging from privacy to abuse of market dominance.
Amazon said it ""strongly disagreed"" with the Italian regulator's decision and would appeal.
“Amazon holds a dominant position in the Italian market for intermediation services on marketplaces, which Amazon leveraged to favor the adoption of its own logistics service - Fulfilment by Amazon (FBA) - by sellers active on Amazon.it to the detriment of the logistics services offered by competing operators, as well as to strengthen its own dominant position,” Italy’s antitrust regulator said in a statement posted on its website.
The authority said Amazon tied the use of FBA access to a set of exclusive benefits, including the Prime label, that help increase visibility and boost sales on its Italian website.
The Prime label makes it easier to sell to over 7 million typically high-spending members of Amazon’s loyalty program.

1697,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 05:36AM ET</span>",Rolls-Royce limits cash burn even as long-haul recovery stutters,"By Paul Sandle and Muvija M
LONDON (Reuters) -Rolls-Royce expects cost cuts to keep cash outflows below its guidance of 2 billion pounds ($2.6 billion) this year, although the aero-engine maker's hopes of a recovery in long-haul flying face a new challenge from the Omicron coronavirus variant. 
The British company said on Thursday its large engine flying hours - a driver of revenue in its civil aviation business - had ticked up to 50% of 2019 levels, helped by a reopening of transatlantic routes.
Year-to-date, large engine hours have increased to 46% of 2019 levels, up from 43% in the first half, but set to miss the forecast it made in March for a recovery to 55% this year.
However, long-haul travel suffered another blow in recent weeks, with the emergence of the Omicron variant resulting in new travel restrictions.
""The pace of travel recovery remains uneven as countries are managing the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, and events of the last 10 days or so bring that to mind,"" Chief Executive Warren East told investors and analysts.
Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) shares, which are around the same level they were 12 months ago, were trading 3% lower in early deals.
The company has been hit hard by the pandemic due to its exposure to the airline industry, forcing it to raise money and take out huge loans. 
East said Rolls-Royce was delivering on the things it was able to control. 
It will have cut 8,500 jobs by the end of this year, with the pace of restructuring running ahead of its plan. A $2 billion sale of its Spanish unit, ITP Aero, also saw Rolls-Royce meet its 2 billion pound asset sale target in September. 

The improved trading performance helped the more than century-old company return to positive free cash flow in the third quarter, in addition to reducing the outflow expected in the second half.

1698,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 05:26AM ET</span>",U.S. to put Chinese firm SenseTime on blacklist ahead of $767 million listing: FT,"(Reuters) - The United States will put Chinese artificial intelligence company SenseTime on an investment blacklist on Friday, the Financial Times reported, citing people familiar with the decision, as the company is finalising its Hong Kong IPO.
The startup had not been aware it could be added to a U.S. blacklist, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter, adding the news also caught bankers working on the $767 million deal by surprise.
A call was under way late on Thursday in Hong Kong hours between the company and its advisers to discuss the implications of the ban on its initial public offering (IPO), the sources said, declining to be identified as the information was not yet public.
SenseTime told Reuters it had no immediate comment on the blacklisting report, and did not respond to questions about the future of the IPO.
The company was planning to sell 1.5 billion shares within a price range of HK$3.85 to HK$3.99 each in the IPO. It is due to set the final price and allocate shares to institutional investors on Friday, according to the firm's filings.
The Financial Times said that the U.S. Treasury will place SenseTime on a list of ""Chinese military-industrial complex companies"". 
In June, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order that barred Americans from investing in companies on the list.
If added to the blacklist, U.S. investors would not be able to buy into the IPO. 
A number of U.S. investors had placed bids to buy stock in the IPO and the implication of the ban on their order was unclear, one direct source added. 
The FT said the action against SenseTime will be part of a part of a package of sanctions against a number of countries to mark Human Rights Day. 
The United States alleges SenseTime is among Chinese companies that played a role in human rights abuses against Muslim minority groups in China, an allegation which Beijing denies. 

On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation to ban imports from China’s Xinjiang region over concerns about forced labor.
SenseTime was placed on a U.S. Commerce Department blacklist in 2019 and the company said at the time that it strongly opposed the U.S. trade restrictions and would work with relevant authorities to resolve the situation.

1699,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 05:11AM ET</span>",U.S. senators announce bipartisan social media data transparency bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three U.S. senators, two Democrats and a Republican, announced on Thursday a bill to require social media companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), now known as Meta Platforms Inc, to give certain researchers access to its data.
Senators Chris Coons and Amy Klobuchar, both Democrats, announced the bill along with Rob Portman, a Republican. It would require the companies to release internal data and assist independent researchers whose projects have been vetted by the National Science Foundation, an independent federal agency.
""Researchers would then be able to examine the data and release findings on the platforms' impact to the public,"" the lawmakers' offices said in a joint statement. Throughout the process, users' privacy would be protected.
Companies that fail to turn over wanted data could face enforcement from the Federal Trade Commission and could lose their immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That provision says that the platforms cannot be held responsible for posting put up by users or other third parties.
There is currently no House of Representatives companion to the proposed bill.

Photo-sharing app Instagram, a subsidiary of Meta, has come under particular scrutiny over the potential impact of its services on the mental health and online safety of young users. Instagram responded to the concerns by suspending plans for a children's version of the app. It also tightened some rules just this week.
""Increasing transparency around Big Tech practices will give policymakers the high-quality, well-vetted information we need to do our job most effectively,"" Portman said in a statement.
